Abstract 
The resilience of a country can be seen from the ability to stabilize its economic growth supported by the 
resources within it. This paper wants to explain how this country achieved economic success through natural 
and human resources, namely the management of clean water and the provision of secondary school level 
teachers in districts and cities throughout Indonesia. The methodology used in this analysis is Robust Ordinary 
Least Square Regression for cross-sectional data for 501 districts and cities in Indonesia. The results show that 
the robust model with all the independent variables is significant at the 5% level. The results of this study prove 
that with this proposed a new model which is a strong model that can be applied in Indonesia in the future. The 
results of this study also recommend to the government in making key policies to achieve growth in every 
region in Indonesia.

Introduction 
With the development of automation technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), big data and artificial 
intelligent (AI) become a big challenge while providing many opportunities with the emergence of several new 
choices for business people (Aileen, et al, 2019, Purba & Panday, 2015, Tan, et al, 2019). Thus, business players 
who have business from small, medium and large must run their businesses to adjust to the development of the 
technology in question. This is because consumers can quickly determine their choices available online in 
cyberspace media (Kim, et al, 2019, Purba, et al, 2020). 
The readiness of a country in facing the industrial revolution 4.0 can be seen from one of the indicators (Purba, 
et al 2019; Tan, et al 2018), namely the Global Competitiveness Index issued by the World Economic Forum 
(WEF). In 2018 Indonesia’s ranking is in 45th in the world, better than 47th in 2017. Meanwhile, for the 
ASEAN region, Indonesia sits at 4th place below Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Therefore the challenge for 
the Indonesian people is to be able to immediately advance to a higher level.

Abstract 
 
Lack of electricity and high dropout rates create conditions of poverty everywhere in Indonesia. Poverty becomes a 
very complex problem that has broad impacts. Poverty destroys purchasing power, decreases human quality, and 
decreases economic welfare. Lately, efforts to fulfill electricity and basic education have become crucial because 
electricity can be used in a variety of activities and education will open views to improve the situation individually 
and socially. Therefore, the econometrics model in this study is the effect of electricity and basic education on 
poverty in the Indonesian Territory. This study uses secondary data cross section as many as 501 districts and cities 
in Indonesia. The analytical method in this study is Robust Least Squared Model. The results of the analysis of this 
study conclude that an increase in electricity and the level of participation in primary school education can 
significantly reduce poverty. Every 1% increase in household access to electricity will reduce the poverty gap index 
by 0.058, then each increase in participation primary school education will reduce the poverty gap index by 0.067. 
This study suggests that the policy of fulfilling electricity and basic education is crucial to combating poverty in 
regions in Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
Increased poverty gap shows more and more individuals who are met their needs under conditions below 
the poverty line. The problem of poverty has become interesting lately. Since the great depression of the 1930s, the 
focus has been on economic growth rather than poverty and economic stability. Since the world economic crisis 
occurred in 2008, the problem of poverty has become very interesting because the conditions of poverty and income 
inequality have triggered the beginning of a serious economic crisis in this modern era (Smeeding, 2005). Poverty 
and income inequality have damaged aggregate purchasing power of the society (Budiono & Purba, 2020). The 
quantity of goods and services that can be purchased becomes less, so that the production of goods and services 
becomes less as well (Rajagukguk, et al 2020). As is the market system that supply must be the same as aggregate 
demand (Budiono, 2012). 
Economically, the inability of individuals to generate income makes these individuals poor. The causes of 
this high poverty gap include mastery of knowledge, ownership and control of productive assets, and market forces 
and political & legal forces. Educational systems and knowledge mastery is very important both individually and in

government requires school-age children to attend compulsory education. 
5. Conclusion 
It turns out that the combination of fulfilling education and electricity can reduce poverty gap powerfully. 
Between electricity and education support each other and in the same direction to reduce poverty gap. The National 
Development Strategy of these two basic needs is the key to success for the Indonesian state. Policies that support 
the fulfillment of electricity and cheap education for the community are absolute. Indonesia Government is going to 
push electricity energy. Government had to build some electricity power station in all Indonesia region. Also 
government do program for placing teacher in all region. This is important because this policy strategy has a dual 
effect not only for reducing poverty inequality but also for social welfare across districts and cities. Thus, it has been 
proven that the need for education and meeting electricity does not only improve the economic conditions of the 
community but also reduce the poverty gap.

Abstract  
 
South Africa uses direct combustion of coal for its bulk power generation. The air emissions of noxious 
gases which includes carbon emissions is a continuous challenge. South African power stations have 
historically employed best practices for managing air emissions.  South Africa has also pioneered the coal 
to gas to liquid technology in the production of synfuels; Sasol. South Africa is in need for a just 
transition away from direct coal combustion.  This paper explores the theory and global practices of coal 
gasification, reviews the recent research efforts on advances in the processes and questions if the 
approach could be a partial contribution towards a just transition in South Africa’s bulk power generation.  
The South African economy is a coal driven economy and every engineering contribution that includes 
the management and use of this natural resource has merit. In conclusion, the paper explores the idea of 
introducing the required heat for gasification from a small modular nuclear reactor; to go one step ahead 
in terms of introducing the emerging hydrogen economy whilst UNFCCC puts to rest the old coal 
economy by 2050.

1. Introduction 
South African natural coal resources are widely available at surface level; it can be collected, bagged and 
sold for individual and local use by residents, commercial and industrial activities.  The net result will be 
open and exposed fires with direct exhaust of all emissions into the atmosphere. To counterbalance this 
past and potential practice, South Africa must provide affordable electricity for all. In addition, the South 
African economy is historically built on coal. Millions of jobs are dependent on coal. South Africa like 
most countries utilizes coal as its major energy resource, with over 70% of the country’s energy needs 
been provided for by this fossil fuel (Ratshomo and Nembahe, 2018). Lack of alternatives, the expected 
growth in the country’s population, and the continuing need for energy security will see this percentage 
potentially increase in the next two decades. 
 
The country requires an engineered and just transition path towards meeting its global obligations on 
carbon emissions and climate change (The Paris Agreement, 2015).  Switching from direct coal 
combustion to coal gasification could be one step in the just transition path towards zero carbon emissions 
by 2050.

Small Modular Nuclear Reactors  
SMR powered by nuclear can supply heat at temperatures in the range of 1000°C for application in 
chemical processes such as the synthesis of liquid or gaseous energy carriers. Nuclear coal gasification 
could open a new door of opportunity for the South African coal sector. This approach could be extended 
to include the production of hydrogen for the emerging hydrogen economy of electric vehicles and 
stationary fuel cell powered micorgrids.  In a study promoted by Stellenbosch University (Botha et al, 
May 2013), in an integrated nuclear assisted carbon to liquid process, the system was evaluated in terms 
of syngas production efficiency versus carbon utilization. Early results show if the hydrogen production 
plant is sized to deliver the required oxygen for the gasification plant, syngas efficiency of 63% is 
achieved while 71,5% of the carbon is utilized. The optimum outlet temperature of the high temperature 
reactor was 850 °C. The system potential could be extended and improved such that carbon utilization 
reaches 90%.   
 
5. Conclusion 
The application of coal gasification technology is mature and commercial. The literature review study 
draws the following conclusions: 
i. 
The use of synthetic gas in power generation increases the efficiency of the system, is eco-
friendly, and is a better substitute for coal combustion in thermal power stations. 
ii. 
The thermal efficiency of an integrated gasification combined cycle plant is relatively higher than 
that of a coal combusting power plant  
iii. 
Coal gasification technology is compatible with machinery and equipment currently used in coal 
combusting facilities in South Africa. 
iv. 
Technical advancement and carbon capture technology enable coal gasification plants to produce 
much less carbon emissions. 
 
Towards the future, The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has aspiration that 
post 2050, coal will cease as a primary energy resource for mankind.  South Africa has three decades to 
migrate away from carbon energy resources such as coal, oil and gas.  To make the transition from carbon 
to non-carbon resources over three decades, an option is to consider syngas from coal.  Syngas has the 
attributes of localization for energy independence and the capacity and capability for energy security. 
Adding in a small modular nuclear reactor as heat source, mitigates using coal combustion for heating and 
will start a new economy in industrialization, promoting both nuclear and hydrogen engineering and 
technology.  When all is done and coal is removed as primary energy resource, South Africa will have 
accumulated strength in both nuclear and hydrogen energy resources.  The South African Energy 
Transition Pathway could read : Coal combustion to coal gasification; Towards a nuclear and hydrogen 
energy economy which is complimented by solar and wind renewables with pumped hydroelectricity 
energy storage, having present day demand of 35 GW with a potential 70 to 80 GW demand in 2050.   
 
The key research questions remain: 
a. Can coal gasification using the heat from a small modular nuclear reactor be an economically 
viable strategy in moving from 100 % coal combustion to zero coal combustion by 2050, to leave 
behind a new economy in nuclear and hydrogen engineering, technology as sustainable non-
carbon energy resources ?  
b. Can nuclear and hydrogen energy resources compliment and associate with renewable energy 
resources, including using municipal solid and sanitation waste as primary hydrogen feedstock 
post coal?  
c. Can the UNFCCC Global Climate Change Fund, finance a new coal gasification investment in 
Mpumalanga (similar to Sasol) that will have a 2 decade life span (2030 to 2050) in powering the 
existing South African Thermal Power Stations, a potential 40 GW stranded national asset?

Abstract  
 
Energy is central to national economic growth and prosperity.  In 2003, South Africa published its White Paper on 
Independent Power Procurement as a first step in market liberalization.  To date, South Africa has procured via 
Ministerial Determinations, mostly from on shore wind and solar photovoltaic, renewable energy to compliment the 
national power utility baseload of thermal coal, imported hydro and nuclear.  The new investments in renewable 
energy was substantial, R200b as compared to Eskom’s New Build of Medupi, Kusile and Ingula of R400b; all 
being sovereign guaranteed. The paper analyses the utility scale renewable energy investments since inception. The 
conclusion is that the future of renewable energy resources will be limited to only wind and solar photovoltaic 
technologies. These will most likely be developed in just three provinces of South Africa as a complimentary energy 
resource to the national grid.  They will have no role in national energy security.  Given the demise of coal as the 
vanguard of national energy security, the accountability transfers to nuclear. A new era of the 4th industrial 
revolution of advanced manufacturing and industrialization will emerge. The private sector led auction and bid 
financing as developed in the IPP program is a strength worthy of transfer to the new nuclear national investment 
programme.

1. Introduction 
The late 1990’s saw the introduction of the first efforts to restructure electricity markets in Europe and the 
US.  The primary driver of restructuring was to achieve efficient production of electricity and efficient 
investment in generation through competition. Following Order 888 from the Federal Regulatory Energy 
Commission (FERC) in 1996, the US commenced its restructuring process of moving away from the 
historical vertically integrated utility model of generation, transmission and distribution.  A market 
environment was born. In summary, generation companies can compete with each other through open 
transmission and distribution companies to serve customers. In Europe, the European Union adopted the 
same approach to develop an integrated electricity market as an efficient instrument to achieve the energy 
policy targets of security, affordability and sustainability of supply.  In 1996, the European Parliament 
and the European Council approved the first electricity directive to liberalize the energy sector by 
establishing competitive electricity markets.  This supported one of the EU’s main objectives to share a 
single market that guarantees the free movement of goods, capital, services and labor amongst members. 
Globally, the trend accelerates. Wholesale electricity markets are established. Independent system

The ratio is indicative of load factor; extrapolated to indicate that a higher load factor will 
enhance the security of supply and lower the unit cost of delivered electrical energy.  Presently, 
Koeberg delivers on an almost 100% annual energy availability factor and the lowest unit cost of 
electrical energy to the national grid. On the other extreme, the open cycle gas turbines delivers, 
in limited time, the highest unit cost of electrical energy to the national grid.

4. Conclusion  
 
4.1 Renewable Energy Resource of Wind and Solar Photovoltaic   
Utility scale investments of wind and solar PV will most likely be limited to the existing favorable sites as 
in the Eastern, Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa.  These three provinces have 
potential to exceed the next decade plans of 17,742 GW and 8,288 GW as at 2030; however, national grid 
absorption capacity and the absence of large scale static energy storage solutions could emerge as the 
bottleneck to investments.   
 
For the three major economically active provinces of  Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and Mpumalanga 
Provinces, a confident forecast is zero investments in large scale wind or solar photovoltaic technologies.  
These three economically active provinces just do not have the natural resources to power up the large 
scale wind or solar multi billion rand investments.  The remaining three provinces of Limpopo, North 
West and Free State could attract just smaller size solar photovoltaic investments and no investments in 
wind.    
 
The past trend (2012 to 2020) and the forecast trend (2020 to 2030) is that the multi billion rand 
renewable investments will be localized to just the three provinces and will not be distributed nationally 
across the South African National Grid.  However, a fixed reference is that natural renewable energy must 
become an integral part of daily living.  To maximize on this reference, it is recommended that individual 
customer scale investments be promoted and developed. For example, one should explore micro or mini 
scale vertical axis wind turbines on high rise buildings; either window or roof mounted.  Similarly, every 
roof top should have a set of photovoltaic panels.  These solutions can be promoted by customer and the 
renewable energy industry as beyond the meter type commercial solutions; at individual scale, low cost 
and distributed customer and community investments.    
 
Thus, in the absence of domestic gas and utility scale static energy storage, a first conclusion is that 
renewable energy resources will not deliver on national energy security.  Renewable energy resources at 
utility scale is only energy complimentary to other energy resources and will saturate around 30% of the 
total national mix. Potential greater success could be realized at individual customer levels as in

grid complimentary energy resource at the lowest cost. The planned Inga 3 complex of 2500 – 4700 MW 
could deliver value similar to that as achieved by the Cahora Bassa Project in Mozambique; bulk 
electrical energy at high load factor and low unit cost in compliment to national base load power stations.     
 
4.2 Thermal Coal Energy Resource 
Thermal coal is on the way out due to global warming and climate change.  By 2050, the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, has set zero as the target for thermal coal electricity 
generation.  South Africa’s commitments are to peak in early the 2020’s, plateau for a while and then to 
aggressively decline towards a zero outcome by 2050.  The South African economy is heavily dependent 
on coal; the present day debate is on a just transition that will accommodate jobs and the socio economic 
impact of change.  The debate is valid and a possible answer could be in the emerging era of industrial 
revolution 4.0 and its portfolio of advanced manufacturing and industrialization by  automation, robotics, 
machine learning and artificial intelligence. This leads straight into the subject of nuclear science, 
engineering and technology.  
 
4.3  
Nuclear as in Large Pressurized Water Reactors and as Small Modular Reactors 
Without coal and given the absence of South African large scale hydro, South Africa’s energy security 
vests in nuclear as the only base load, non-carbon, clean and sustainable energy resource.  The applicable 
technologies will be  both  large pressurized water reactors and small modular reactors.  The entire South 
African national grid is designed and built to operate as an alternating current, synchronous power system 
at fundamental frequency of 50 Hz.  In the absence of base load synchronous generation, the South 
African national grid will cease to function; irrespective of the size of the wind and solar photovoltaic 
connected power plants.   
 
4.3.1  Brownfield PWR Extension at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station, Cape Town 
Technically, the existing Koeberg Nuclear Power Station can accommodate a brownfield development of 
Units 3 and 4; to yield a total capacity of 2500 MW.  The project, complete with financing, can be done 
similarly to that of the REIPPPP example; private sector debt and equity with a long term power purchase 
agreement.  Nuclear can plan for a 60 year time period for the delivery of the lowest unit cost of 
electricity to the national grid.  In addition, the design can be engineered to deliver on local and regional 
water security; bulk fresh water from desalination given the large volumes of sea water that is 
continuously used to cool the nuclear reactors.  
 
4.3.2 
Small Modular Reactors for the Renewal of the Ageing Thermal Coal Power Stations, 
Mpumalanga Province.    
South Africa struggles with an ageing thermal coal fleet; poor energy availability, lapse of national grid 
energy security with economic consequences of national grid load shedding and increasing excursions 
from environmental air emissions limits.  Time is fast approaching for South Africa to repurpose the 
ageing thermal fleet; to scrap the mechanical assets of boilers and turbines and to reuse the electrical 
assets of synchronous generators and national grid substations as powered by small modular reactors.  
The domestic advanced manufacturing and industrialization of small modular reactors will be the catalyst 
for the industrial revolution 4.0 driven national economic renaissance for both country and continent.

Abstract 
A3 problem solving is an improvement process that applies lean thinking to present report in a structured manner. 
This process improvement methodology identifies and eliminates waste to satisfy organization’s potential goals such 
as improving productivity, satisfy customers, reduce the operation costs, and support the decision-making. The 
problem solving is a key ability in manufacturing environment. An ineffective decision making can affect productivity, 
the lead time and manufacturing costs. This paper used case study to present A3 thinking approach by developing a 
very simple and structured report for improvement process. The results of case study show the developed A3 report, 
which goes from the identification of the problem, determination of current situation of the process, identification 
cause of the problem, determine how to tackle the problem, evaluation of improvement and determination of the 
effectiveness of the process. The result has also showed that the cycle time of line reduced from 180 minutes to 172 
minutes and 25 seconds. The reduction was due to identification and elimination of non-added values. Application of 
A3 problem solving process has demonstrated the applicability and paybacks of the methodology in manufacturing 
industry.

1 Introduction 
 
Recently, the pressure to find ways to manage operations more efficiently and effectively is increasing rapidly in 
manufacturing industry. Organizations are realizing that they must improve their entire workforce in order to help 
their organizations achieve their goals or objectives. Keeping customer satisfied is among most vital functions of any 
company (Jones and Sasser, 1995). A company should ensure the continuous delivery of its service standards to 
customers to preserve customer satisfaction. Customers have higher expectations, and manufacturers must meet these 
expectations by increasing product’s quality, reducing delivery time, and minimizing costs (George, 2002). With 
business support tools in place, companies can ensure to meet consistently meeting customer expectations. Many 
companies have lost opportunities due to shortfall of the products or services due to the incapacity of production lines, 
courtesy of the resource’s management. Constant late delivery to the customer results in unsatisfied customer and the 
loss of market share.   
 
In production and manufacturing, businesses use cycle time as a benchmark of their productivity. Less cycle time 
means less lead time to present a product in the market quicker. Organization will produce more units in reduced time 
and use resources of organization at best level; it also increases customer satisfaction and organization’s productivity. 
As such, in the long run, most companies wish to decrease their cycle times to improve productivity and thereby 
reduce costs. For this reason, it is very important to implement process to identify and help to eliminate waste, which 
is the major cause of any system inefficiency. 
 
This paper aims to apply A3 problem solving tool developed by Toyota to find out the biggest problem that contribute 
to the downtime in production line and eliminate it. The information arrangement is vital to guide through the 
investigation of the current problem. The investigation will lead to identify value and non-value-added activities and 
eliminating non-value added based on verified information. To achieve the above aim, the specific objectives are: 
Identify the problem and eliminate it, improve operational speed and improve effectiveness. Shook (2008) defines A3

The lean tool A3 problem solving report has been implemented successfully through the results of the process. From 
this case study, the A3 problem solving has shown that it is a tool that promotes lean thinking. Through the process, 
it allowed the identification of specific activities (slow pace and quality issues) that negatively influenced the 
productivity of the assembly line and to eliminate the waste and satisfy customers. It also promotes communication 
among different functional department in organization such as production department and quality department to work 
for common goal. 
 
The study has shown that in A3 structured report, the assembly line was effective during the month October (after 
campaign). The output for the line was increased from 7 parts to 9.6 parts, that means the productivity improvement 
was achieved. The downtime dropped from 32.7% in August to 8.4% in October.

Abstract  
The adaptability of asset management plan to changes in production models is needed to improve competitiveness. 
This research outline a design of a criticality assessment tool with particular emphasis to a Fertiliser Manufacturing 
Company. The criticality assessment tool was developed as a framework based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process 
(AHP) which was used in the design of a computer application. The assessment tool was applied at the Company 
producing criticality scores and ranking for assets which had been presented in two hierarchical levels namely system 
and sub-system 12 System level assets and 142 sub system level assets). The results produced by the assessment tool 
where consistent with the perceived top 10 critical assets as determined by 24 subject matter experts (SME) within 
the organization. The results allowed the Company to priorities its critical assets and come up with strategies for each 
asset which was previously difficult to achieve.  The tool enable the prioritization of assets in line with the business 
objective as stipulated in the asset management system standard (ISO 55001).

Introduction 
The current global trend where energy deficiency and dynamic trade policies affect business, provides a platform were 
business strategies change rapidly thus affecting production models which in turn affect asset management (in this 
paper asset management refers to physical assets). It becomes important for asset management decision makers to be 
in-sync with the business strategy. Thus “changing business dynamics has made it imperative on a decision maker to 
have a quantified decision” (Singh & Kulkarni, 2013). Asset criticality basically changes when business models 
change since certain systems will be discontinued while other systems are installed or enhanced. This is the case with 
most Company in Zimbabwe where a fertilizer manufacturing company can be cited as an example that has changed 
the operational model resulting in three production systems being discontinued, Figure 1 shows the installed plant 
configuration while Figure 2 shows the revised model. The systems seized to be critical thus affecting, service level 
agreements, spares management and personnel utilisation. Obviously it becomes important to know the assets that 
need to be prioritized to complement the new business model.

Conclusion 
The question “How can asset criticality assessment be done effectively for a fertilizer manufacturing plant?” has been 
answered by saying, one can use AHP a Multi Attribute Method, while leveraging on a methodology that first 
determines the contextual interpretation of identified single matter experts (SME) in a setup (organization) and 
applying the interpretation in determining the appropriate decision making criteria for determining quantified asset 
criticality. The quantified asset criticality can be used as an integral part of the assent management system detailed in 
ISO 55001.

Abstract 
 
As the South African population grows, so too is the demand for clean water. There are numerous methods that 
have been developed over the years for cleaning water. Water purification technologies at Veolia Water 
Technologies, in Johannesburg, South Africa, is focused on increasing the quality of purifying water systems.  
However, challenges of building bigger clarifying systems to accommodate for demand is key. In this paper, a 
structural control system on an existing clarifier is developed and tested in Ansys. This led to the identification of 
the number of stiffeners needed to support a 4m high rectangular tank, however, the number of stiffeners required 
for a tank of much larger size is still unknown. Various parameters such as fatigue failure, design variables, as 
well as the different stiffener positions and sections used to determine the local bucking points of the rectangular 
structure is tested in the FEA environment using Ansys. This allowed for the examination of the Actiflo’s 
behaviour using several stiffener configurations while simultaneously reducing the thickness of the structure in 
order to reduce costs. The effects of loads on deflections and stresses on the Actiflo are found to be pronounced 
around stiffener locations and local buckling points. Building on this a new model of a much larger Actiflo 
Clarifier is being proposed in this paper.

308","The concept was developed using the original basin without stiffeners. Pressure was applied on all the inside walls 
and then simulated to reveal critical points within the structure. After the critical points where identified, 
corresponding stiffeners were applied in those areas to reinforce the structure. For the development of this 
configuration, the aim was to provide a rigid structure using the least number of stiffeners without compromising 
the structural integrity. 
 
3. Simulation Results 
Figure 6 illustrates the concept simulations done on ANSYS. With the need to improve on the current design of 
the Actiflo in terms of its stiffener configuration, where it was overdesigned, a proposal given to draw up 3 
different stiffener configurations and gauge them against one another under the same constraints and conditions. 
Concept 1 deflected 150mm from its initial state, concept 2 deflected by ±100mm while concept 3 only deflected 
by 18mm. The deflection areas reduced in size as well. The introduction of the vertical columns had a vital role 
to play. The structure is now more rigid with less material used and less costly.

4. Conclusion 
The aim of this project was to effectively investigate methods of optimizing the Actiflos stiffeners. This could not 
be done without thorough research of how parameters such as the Actiflo wall thickness, stiffener configurations 
used, optimal stiffener locations as well as identifying local buckling points. The Actiflo was designed in 
accordance to the volume required per chamber which covers the most important aspect of an Actiflo operation 
however no structural analysis was done to investigate the number of stiffeners required to resist the internal 
hydrostatic forces, the type of stiffeners to be used and ideal locations to place stiffeners. This structure was 
therefore classified as statically indeterminate beam with a VDL (varying distributed load). 
The simulation power tool is found compatible for this investigation as it can effectively solve complex problems 
and any risks by identifying failures prematurely before they occur, this may also cut any manufacturing costs. A 
second benefit to this application is it increases robustness and reliability of a structure. A baseline model was 
created without use of stiffeners, to determine the threshold of the plate’s deflection. Upon review of the two main 
factors namely, costing and simulation of the configuration. Configuration 1 is the cheapest but proves the least 
effective. Configuration 2 is also cheap option as well but does not maintain the structural shape. Deformation is 
still apparent. Finally, Configuration 3 proves the best option as the saving is drastic as well as the rigidity in 
comparison to the other two configurations (Maqina, 2021). The results, theories and techniques used, can be

Abstract 
 
An Actiflo Clarifier is a water purification system designed by Veolia Water Solutions in Johannesburg, South 
Africa, to handle 10 ML of water a day. The tank is relatively large and made using thin plates reinforcement with 
stiffeners. For the current design, it is found that the plate thickness can be reduced considerable by adding 
horizontal or vertical stiffeners or a combination of both. The addition of stiffeners will increase the rigidity of 
the tank wall by increasing the moment of inertia of the combined section. For the design of tank walls with 
intermediate horizontal stiffeners, there is no simple formula available. This research is focused on investigating 
the optimal stiffeners locations, in attempt to reduce costs without compromising on the structural integrity. 
Specifically the investigation focused on investigating the optimal stiffener locations using the 200 x 75mm 
Parallel Flange. The robustness was tested by developing a conceptual design on AutoCAD inventor and 
conducting simulations of varying distributed load on a beam (i.e the Actiflo wall) with multiple supports 
(Stiffeners)

6. Conclusion 
The aim of this project was to effectively investigate methods of obtaining optimal stiffener locations of the Actiflo 
Clarifier. This could not be done without thorough research of how parameters such as the Actiflo wall thickness, 
stiffener configurations used, optimal stiffener locations as well as identifying local buckling points (Maqina, 
2021). The Actiflo was designed in accordance to the volume required per chamber which covers the most 
important aspect of an Actiflo operation however no structural analysis was done to investigate the number of 
stiffeners required to resist the internal hydrostatic forces, the type of stiffeners to be used and ideal locations to 
place stiffeners. This structure was therefore classified as statically indeterminate beam with a VDL (varying 
distributed load). 
Therefore an effective approach to solve such a problem was to make substantiated assumptions and limit the 
number of variables analyzed. The calculated results had 1% error due to human error, the simulations are more 
accurate, and however for more accurate results it is essential to provide the software with more inputs (Maqina, 
2021). The simulation power tool is found compatible for this investigation as it can effectively solve complex 
problems and any risks by identifying failures prematurely before they occur, this may also cut any manufacturing 
costs. A second benefit to this application is it increases robustness and reliability of a structure.

Abstract 
Plastic waste in Nigeria has undeniably been a leading source of pollution since the inception and use of plastic 
for packaging food and beverages. The rapid increase in its production and usage has become of significant 
concern and has contributed to the problem of waste disposal. Its effects cannot be overemphasized considering 
its environmental hazards such as clogging of water ways, release of chemicals into the soil, endangerment to 
animals living in and around water bodies. It has become imperative that proper actions be taken to manage plastic 
waste disposal. The approaches considered in this paper are mostly circled around innovative recycling technique. 
Descriptive statistics was employed in analyzing the data and hypotheses were tested using Chi-square test. The 
analysis of the result shows that there exists poor management practice on plastic disposal and reveals that the 
perceptions of male and female respondents to sustainable plastic waste disposal management differs. The 
findings of this study concluded that this paper looks into certain methods that are already being implemented to 
manage plastic waste in Nigeria as well as the approaches that may be more effective in ensuring proper disposal 
so as to maintain environmental sustainability.

ABSTRACT 
This paper assesses the acoustics technology as a possible solution to online cleaning of coal fired boilers. An 
acoustics device is designed in AutoCAD Invertor professional 2016, where simulations are performed and 
compared with calculations done to determining if the acoustic device can be used for boiler cleaning or as a backup 
system to soot blowers, popularly used in South Africa. The similarity law was used to determine the frequency of 
the beam that will be suitable for an acoustic horn with a frequency of 75Hz when varying forces ranging from 40N 
to 820N are used. The diaphragm of the acoustic horn deflected 0.5 mm when a pressure of 552kPa was applied. It 
was further found that for as long as the diaphragm does not deflect and bleed the air the stress needed will be 816 
MPa which will not reach the expected maximum. This will make the acoustic horn experience a pressure of 50MPa 
which is able to dislodge soot on the tube walls and surfaces of the boiler. This paper also looks at material and their 
properties which are used for the beam and acoustic horn.

1. Introduction  
The first boiler that was developed was a kettle-type boiler in the 1700s and 1800s which simply boiled water into 
steam (Insolation, 2018). Fire tube boilers was one of the first boilers designed which consisted of the water 
surrounding the tubes in the shell of the boiler while fire runs through the tubes (Rite boilers, 2018). The fire-tube 
boiler has doors that swing open to clean the boiler tubes. This was an important feature for boilers fired with coal 
and wood (Babu, 2016). This proved to be very dangerous once boilers started becoming popular. This led to 
different methods of cleaning boilers, such as acoustic horn cleaning and water jet cleaning, soot blowing etc., to be 
developed. Fire-tubes are straight tubes that are rigid enough not to allow any expansion (Shandu et al, 2019). An 
acoustic horn or waveguide is a tapered sound guide designed to provide an acoustic impedance match between a 
sound source and free air, see Figure 1. This has the effect of maximizing the efficiency with which sound waves 
from the source are transferred to the air. Conversely, a horn can be used at the receiving end to optimize the transfer 
of sound from the air to a receiver.  A boiler is a closed vessel in which fluid (generally water) is heated, as in Figure 
2. The fluid does not necessarily boil. The heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or 
heating applications, including water heating, central heating, boiler-based power generation, cooking, and 
sanitation (Shandu, 2021). At present the firm uses soot blowers or cleaning of the interior of the boiler tubes, which 
as its own disadvantages (Holmes et al, 1999; Warriner and Noblett, 2002). Acoustic cleaning is a maintenance 
method used in material-handling and storage systems that handle bulk granular or particulate materials, such as 
grain elevators, to remove the build-up of material on surfaces. Acoustic cleaning apparatus, usually built into the

The simulation results represented by the deflection and the stress show how a vibrational force applied to a beam 
generates a waveform that affects the beam, removing slag. Figure 8 shows that when the beam is vibrating it may 
reach the same deflection in the upward direction.   Figure 8 shows the relationship between the force and 
displacement when compared the graph in Figure 9.   Figure 7 can also represent a stress-strain graph because strain 
is calculated from displacement. The graphs in these figures show a fracture point for simulated values and not for 
the calculated values because the values calculated do not take into consideration all three principal stresses and thus 
not giving an accurate value whereas in simulation the program takes inconsideration  the strain caused by the force 
(Shandu, 2021).   
 
In comparison of the two approaches it is found that the simulation approach is very fast, easy and gives a broader 
view of how the forces interact with the body. This interaction can be seen visually and can be easily interpreted. 
This approach can be very effective when solving most complex situations. This approach is fast and still has a high 
accuracy. The manual calculations take a long time to complete and does not look at the problem in complete detail 
as the simulation rather it looks at the direct effect the force will cause. This approach is not as accurate as it 
involves human error and rounding off values.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The material that was selected was appropriate for the project as cast-iron beams today are used in boilers. The cast 
iron beam, even though it is a brittle material, can still withstand high temperatures and a considerably high amount 
of vibration before fracturing. Brittle material was chosen because under high temperature ductile material will tend 
to expand drastically before fracturing and that is not good for the flow of water and fire moving through the tubes. 
The location of the stress in the simulation was correct as the stress was maximum where the force was applied. The 
maximum stress of 182.088MPa and a maximum deflection of 26.2866mm for the simulated values and with direct 
calculating of stress we get a max stress of 224.06MPa and deflection of 48.088mm. This deflection is enough to 
remove the slag and soot off the beams. The best force was found to be 225N which gave a max stress of 
61.1562MPa and deflection 9.24mm. Based on the results obtained from the simulation and calculation, the applied 
force increases deflection as the stress approaches fracture (Shandu et al, 2019). However, the graphs and 
calculations showed that the maximum safe stress is 225N but can withstand values above this frequency. This

operation as it will produce enough vibration to remove slag. 
 
This paper discusses the merits of using an acoustic cleaning solution to maintenance industrial boilers. It is focused 
on the power industry and as such its contribution is in the area of maintenance of boiler used in the power industry. 
These boilers produce steam that are used to generate electricity via steam turbines.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents cost analysis for maintenance in the steam plant department of Sasol in Secunda, South Africa, 
based on weekly boiler outage and general boiler breakdowns. All maintenance and contributing factors during a 
General Overhaul (GO) for a period of 48 months maintenance plan are carefully analyzed in this paper. The current 
cleaning technology which uses soot blowers was found to be the main contributor to the high costs due to its failure 
when the boiler is running, causing leaks and erosion on boiler tubes. As a result, there is a significantly high cost on 
superheater tubes with a variance of R29 704 191.18 from a budget of R50 919 502.53 in 14 days of a 90 days GO. 
The cost of soot blower repairs also exceeds the budgeted amount of R1 000000 by R428 884,73 in variance in 14 
days of the GO. The results of metallographic examination of the tube used is presented in this paper. Based on this 
analysis a new maintenance method using an acoustics approach is proposed in this paper. This approach can either 
work hand in hand with the soot blowing technology currently being used for the existing design of boilers to 
minimize the exposure of the tubes to pressure hot air or be used independently for a whole new design of boilers.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Determining RBI, Probability, Consequence and Risk Ratings for Boiler Tube 
A rating scale of 1 (high) to 5 (low) is used for the probability ratings.  Where appropriate likelihood of failure 
ratings is related to the remaining life of the item. These include internal wall thinning mechanisms, external wall 
thinning, fatigue and creep.  For all other damage mechanisms, the likelihood of failure rating is derived according 
to the susceptibility of the item to in-service deterioration based on the process conditions and the equipment 
metallurgy. The consequence ratings are categorized into safety, environment and business consequences. The 
consequence ratings are linear relationships between the highest consequence value, above which the highest 
consequence rating of 1 is assigned, and the lowest consequence value, below which the lowest consequence rating 
of 5 is assigned, see Table 1. Once the probability and consequence ratings have been assigned, the risk rating for 
the pipelines of the boiler which are grouped in corrosion loops can be determined [1].

345","that is the most important factor in crack growth. Corrosion will always be present in a boiler simply due to normal 
thermal oxidation. Every cyclically loaded steel boiler component exposed to a corrosive environment will develop 
corrosion fatigue cracks if stresses are routinely high and frequent and if enough time elapses.  
 
The drawing for the ring feed header specified that a 15Mo3 elbow be installed, however, it was confirmed by 
spectrographic analysis that the chemical composition of the elbow section was not comparable to the chemical 
composition requirements of DIN 17175 15Mo3. The elbow was not alloyed – it was a carbon steel material in lieu 
of carbon-molybdenum steel material. It is most likely that the elbow was fabricated from DIN 17175 St35.8 
material. Although the microstructure of the incorrect material did not thermally degrade whilst it was in service, the 
correct material (15Mo3) would have had better corrosion fatigue resistance because of its alloying elements and 
higher strength at the operating temperature. The room temperature tensile approximation of the elbow was found to 
be within the requirements of DIN 17175 grade 15Mo3 and St 35.8. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The vibrations and sound waves from the use of an acoustic device may cause other different types of risks to the 
whole structure itself. Using AutoCAD Invertor 2016, parts of the acoustic horn were modelled and simulated 
against predicted forces and pressures. A frequency range of 60-70 Hz was used which fell currently into real life 
limitations and powerful enough for cleaning large vessels such as boilers and is more practical with a less amount 
of vibrations to be used for acoustic purpose. It is advised that improvements be done on the current design or 
combination of the soot blowing and acoustic may be used. As improvement of the current cleaning process (soot 
blowing) for the aim of more availability and minimizing breakdowns on the boiler plant and ultimately reducing 
maintenance cost [3, 7].

Abstract 
Materials handling is one of the most essential aspects within manufacturing processes and/or industries. 
Transportation equipment used in manufacturing industries varies from pallet jack to forklift trucks and/or cranes. 
Materials handling equipment are mechanical equipment used for the movement, storage, control and protection 
of materials, goods and products throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption and disposal. 
The influence of global economy has led to changes in the conventional approaches for manufacturing companies. 
In this case, manufacturing companies in South Africa and globally have taken into consideration several essential 
characteristics such as real-time reaction to changes, quick and quality response in sustaining and satisfying 
customer requests and/or needs, in both hardware equipment and software modules by which the production 
processes are optimized for next generation manufacturing systems. In two previous papers we outlined the design 
of a heavy-duty handling system and its hydraulic lifting mechanism based on Industry 4.0 principles. Electro-
hydraulic circuit modelling as well material selection for electro-hydraulic operation of the new designed system 
arepresented herein.

1. Introduction 
Electro-hydraulic circuit consists of different components such as electric motor which converts electric energy 
into mechanical energy, the pump which converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy and the actuator 
convert back hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Control elements like valves are used which controls the 
fluid in the circuit such as direction control valves, flow control valves, solenoid valves & pressure relief valves, 
etc, see Figure 1 and Table 1.

357","A) Solenoid Valve Functionality 
In the normal position of the solenoid valve, the pressure port P is connected to the working port B, and the 
working port A is connected to the tank port T. The valve is actuated when the rated voltage is applied to the coil 
Y. In the actuated position of the valve, the port P is connected to the port A, and the port B is connected to the 
port T, Figure 17. When supply to the coil is cut off, the valve returns to its normal position. This valve can be 
used as the final control element for controlling a double-acting cylinder.  
Figure 17 - 4/2-way Single-solenoid Valve, Spring Return [7]. 
5. Output Feedback Controller Design of Hydraulic Actuator Systems 
The new system design consists of a hydraulic unit, a 486/66- based PLC equipped with a Metrabyte M5312 
quadrature incremental encoder card and a DAS-16 analog/digital (AID) conversion card and, an external force 
source facility (as shown in figure 90 & 91). The pump provides constant operational supply pressure up to 300 
MPa. The hydraulic valve is a low-cost closed-center four-way proportional valve. The positioning of the valve 
spool is based on the pulse width modulation principle. Load is used as an environment. Three pressure 
transmitters read the pump, supply line, and return line pressures with ±l% accuracy. An incremental encoder with 
sensing resolution of 0.06 mm reads the displacement of the cylinder piston. The control signal generated by the 
control algorithm is converted to an analog signal by the AID card and is transmitted to the hydraulic valve 
amplifier, as shown in Figure 18.   
 
Figure 18 - Output feedback controller design of hydraulic actuator systems [8]. 
5. Conclusion 
The new system has been designed and will consist of 4-double acting hydraulic cylinders responsible for lifting, 
2-double acting hydraulic cylinders that will expand the system making it adjustable, a hydraulic steering cylinder 
for steering and 4 - hydraulic motors that will drive the system from point A to point B. Electric hydraulic 
components selection for new design system has been conducted. Through this paper and its analysis, it is proven 
that the use of internal combustion engines in heavy duty handling systems that are operated within indoor

365","manufacturing factories and/or internal logistics can be eliminated and replaced with an eco-friendly electric 
hydraulic systems technology [3-5]. 
The use of 16-ton forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing industries poses health dangers to employees since 
the exhaust fumes of an internal combustion engine are toxic and has the economic effects of Carbon Monoxide 
(CO) poisoning. Carbon monoxide (CO) is odourless, tasteless, colourless, non-irritating and cannot be detected 
by any of the human senses. Because it cannot be detected, employees can be exposed to very high levels without 
realizing there is a problem. Therefore, the compilation of this document is aimed at designing a new handling 
system that will be hydraulically operated and powered by an electrical source (e.g. battery, motor etc.). In coming 
up with the system, it is believed that it will lower the rate of Carbon Monoxide (CO) exposure and thus the cost 
of workers compensation claims in South Africa.  
Therefore, this new system design promotes Occupational Health and Safety of people working in industrial areas 
where Bulk Material Handling systems are in place.

Abstract 
The emergency care service stands out for its high complexity and importance. Intended to 
assist outpatients with different levels of severity, they often facing unpredictable and variable demand. 
In this sense, the risk classification instruments emerged as a way of managing the queues, scaling the 
service order according to risk criteria. Among the classifications, we highlight the Manchester Triage 
System (MTS), created in 1997 in England, and implemented in Brazil in 2008. It classifies risks in 
five levels, each of them having a color and a maximum waiting time allowed until first medical 
care. The MTS makes it possible to quickly identify and separate patients at risk of death and who need 
immediate care. With a literature review, it was identified that part of the emergency rooms that use the 
MTS are not able to comply with the requirements, exceeding the time of attendance, which can 
cause damage to the patients' health. This project aims to analyze the attendance process in an 
emergency care unit and check the appropriate number of doctors and nurses who must be present in 
order to respect the MTS. For this purpose, a simulation model for discrete events will be developed in 
the Flexsim software.

Abstract  
 
 
 
The project consists of analyzing and improving the process of a small business, which produces potato 
sticks, with the central objective of increase productivity, eliminating waste and reducing the bottleneck. 
To carry out the studies, a flowchart of the processes present throughout the company was created, in 
order to make a chronological analysis, a tool that aims to analyze the execution times of the activities 
that involve the production process, followed by a VSM (Value Stream Mapping). The Value Stream 
Mapping is an ideal way to determine the waste involved in the process, and to point out the processes 
with improvements, such as identifying the main problems to be addressed. After studies of the processes, 
it was identified as the main bottleneck of the production line, since the process time was longer in the 
company's lead time. With the aid of the FlexSim software, simulations were carried out on the processes 
and identified as possible to improve the layout, reduce the travel time for operators and products. The 
layout change allows to optimize the process, use the best operators and implement belts between 
manufacturing lines, positively impacting the process times of the furnaces, consequently reducing the 
execution time, increasing the productivity and waste reducing.

Abstract 
3D Printing has grown tremendously over the past few years and continues to do so as the industry grows with 
new technologies. 3D Printing makes design easier and allows engineers to create prototypes and mock-ups of 
these designs faster than ever before. Edits can be made in hours rather than days and best of all, it can be done 
on the desktop, rather than on the factory floor. The question of replaceability of conventional manufacturing 
technologies with 3D prints, and the accuracy of finite element analysis on a 3D printed-like model is the focus 
of this study. This study conducted an FEA of some simple structures and compared results of the simulations to 
that of lab tests on 3D printed parts. Sample specimens in the shape of a block, 25 mm x 25 mm x 25 mm in 
diameter is designed using Autodesk Inventor 2018 and tested in a simulation environment of Autodesk Inventor 
to gain insight into the responses of these objects under compressive loads on different axes. The same designed 
3D objects are then printed using a 3D printer out of several different materials and infills using the FDM (Fused 
Disposition Modelling) method. These objects are exposed to the same external forces applied in the FEA with 
strain gauges used to measure the response and thus providing a comparison with the FEA. The results of these 
tests are analysed and presented herein.

Introduction 
The 3D printing technology is an additive manufacturing process, which proceeds by making three-dimensional 
solid objects from a digital file. This process involves printing layers of material until the object has been formed 
with the use of a 3D printer. 3D printing has enabled the production of complex geometries with minimal waste 
in material, when compared to the traditional manufacturing methods, which mostly proceed using subtractive 
method. This technology offers the flexibility of “embedded” manufacturing- manufacturing components in place 
where it is needed, thus reducing transportation cost, and reducing throughput in prototyping. This is due to 
mobility of the printer compared to the massive weights associated with subtractive machine tools. Finite element 
analysis (FEA), a technique has provided insight into complex engineering problems over the years with 
continuous values of elements calculated across the model from one element to another. It is highly useful in 
estimation of mechanical properties of models with dissimilar material properties to obtain local effects and 
accurate solution of the whole model via an element-wise approach. 
 
There has been a tremendous revolution in the 3D printing technology over the past 30 years since the first form 
of additive manufacturing was developed. In 1981 Dr. Hideo Kodama came up with a functional prototyping 
system using photopolymers to build up a solid printed model which consisted of cross-sectional layers within the 
model. It is the build-up of these layers that creates the 3D shape of the object. A few years later in 1984 Charles 
Hull came up with a process of using a UV laser beam and a vat of resin photopolymer to create 3D models called 
Stereolithography (SLA), a process known as vat photopolymerization which he then patented. This was done by 
exposing the photopolymer to the UV laser beam which would cause the resin to solidify into a solid piece of 
plastic (Al’Aref, 2018: Wen et al, 2018). The object is printed from bottom to top leaving behind a solid piece of 
material.3D printing has numerous amounts of processes which change in their layering methods and materials

372","KN. Therefore, it is assumed that the loads in Table 1 are Mpa and subsequently the loads in Table 2 are 
KN/mm^2. this would give a ratio of 1KN=1000Mpa.  
 
The results obtained in Table 1 do not differ regardless on which axis the loads have been applied but keep in 
mind that the materials used are that of an isotropic nature and not the natural form of the filament used with the 
FDM 3D Printing method. Even though the same loads were applied to that of the 30% and 50% simulations the 
tabulated results were almost identical and only verified slightly. The results observed in Table 2 clearly show 
that 3D printed objects with the use of the FDM method are in fact anisotropic material. The practical PETG 
results in Table 2 have established that there is an inconsistency in the 3D printed test specimens, the 
displacements. 
 
6. 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
The study can conclude that the FEM simulations on Autodesk inventor are in fact isometric and in order to 
overcome this, orthotropic values will need to be uploaded in the new materials list. For a more accurate 
comparison the simulated results could rather be simulated with loads using the ratio of 1KN=1000Mpa. This 
could possibly represent similar values between Table 1 and Table 2 but observing these results seems unlikely. 
 Using the FDM printing method this study shows the inconsistency of each 3D print load failure. To better the 
outcome of this study more test specimens can be used and tested for a larger list of values to compare. This study 
has proved that Autodesk Inventor 2018 standard isometric material values do not yield accurate simulated results 
when in comparison to that of the practical results (Abbot, 2021: Abbot et al, 2019).

Conclusion and Recommendation 
The mechanical properties of the materials are still seen to be that of isometric and therefore cannot accurately 
represent the properties of those of the 3D printed filaments used. It could be argued that if the loads experienced 
are perpendicular to that of the FDM printed layering, the results obtained using the isometric material properties 
can be compared. Even though this could be, the results obtained in Tables 2 and 3 are nowhere that of the results 
yielded in Table 4. 
 
The results yielded in Table 4 for the practical compression tests are also between that of 25% infill and 50% infill 
whereas the results of the simulations obtained in Tables 2 and 3 are 100% solid. this could be why the results 
obtained in Tables 2 and 3 are much smaller than those seen in Table 4. This is also a good comparison to visually 
see how 3D printing can save on material usage and how 3D printing behaves with different percentage infills in 
comparison to that of is solid comparisons.

Abstract 
Undergromd mining activity continues to contribute a huge part of the South African gross domestic product and as much as it 
is profitable, there are high risks involved in these kinds of mining operations. The safety of working personnel and equipment 
is of high importance to ensure it remains profitable. This report investiages how the safety of working personnel and equipment 
can be further improved by designing a yielding bolt under seismic activity. The principle of operation of the yield bolt is based 
on the science of radial expansion of hollow tubes in tension to provide intergrity to underground excavations. The reults shows 
how the principle can be used to mitigate the risks caused by seismic activity on mining operations. 
Keywords: Underground mining,dynamic, mining operations, personnel safety, yielding bolt,fricton and risk mitigation. 
1. Introduction 
Most underground excavations require ground support to maintain excavation stability and to ensure a safe environment for the 
working personnel and equipment. A suitable ground support design which is capable to withstand various loads caused by 
underground seismic activity  (Plouffe, et al., 2007) is of paramount importance. In reality, dynamic seismic activity are very 
difficult to anticipate and study their behaviour in order to determine the occurance and behaviour of the nesxt activiy.  (Plouffe, 
et al., 2007). When properly accounted for, well-designed dynamic/yielding ground support systems can dramatically improve 
the excavation stability. The importance of the appropriate ground support selection and design is crucial to ensure personnel 
safety in seismically active areas.For static gradual down fall of ground,there various sufficent instruments to measure and 
support the ground.For dynamic seismic activity,due to its unpredictability and varying magnitudes there is need for designing 
sufficient yielding ground support elements in highly stressed, burst-prone or high deformation environments (Plouffe, et al., 
2007). 
2. Experimental Approach to Ensuring Excavation Stability Problem 
To determine the demand placed on the ground support by dynamic loading activity, it is assumed that a certain volume of rock 
will be subject to vibrations for which the intensity can be characterized by an acceleration or a velocity (Plouffe, et al., 2007). 
To effectively maintain a safe working environment, the ground support must be able to withstand the additional loads and 
displacements in order to dissipate the energy (demand) released by the dynamic event. All mining excavations will have 
different geomorphic and sedimentary rock layouts,this is means that every excacation needs to be assessed individually to 
determine the required ground support elements. Overall,the magnitude, nature,frequency and distance between the excavation 
and epicentre of seismic activity make it very difficult to ensure an appropriate design (Plouffe, et al., 2007). The worst case 
scenario will be simulated using a hydraulic press which will pull (tensile) the yielding bolt at a speed of 3 m/s similar to seismic 
activity and rock bursts in dynamic events. The yielding bolt is designed to absorb this energy for a length of 600 mm. In order

381","The five tests conducted are plotted into one graph showing the displacement of the mandrel within the tube and the force 
produced when radially expanding the tube. Overall the graphs follow the trend similar to that of a stress-strain graph for tensile 
strength testing. However, the graphs have a longer permanent plastic deformation(strain hardening) region because the tube is 
hollow. After the initial yield point of the tube, the force starts to drop since the dynamic friction is less than static friction. 
When the cone reaches the end of the test,the force starts to rapidly increase and provides the ultimate tensile strength of the 
bolt.  
4. Discussion 
 
From the practical results obtained, the design parameters selected do yield accurate results from practical testing. It is evident 
that all tubes yield above 20 tons. The average yield of tests 1 and 2 is above 19 tons, this is accurate due to the tests being 
static and correlates to a static friction factor of 0.15 between the cone and tube. In test graphs 3,4 and 5 the yield tonnage drops 
lower than in tests 1 and 2. This is due the tests being dynamic at speeds of 3 m/s and thus the applicabe friction factor is kinetic 
friction of 0.09. It is important to note that the tubes are lubricated within the inner diameter to reduce the effects of the 2 
friction factors as the test progresses and ensure that recorded yield force is entirely due to the expansion of tubes. Towards the 
end of the test, the cone is allowed to continue being pulled against the tube even though there is no more length of tube to 
yield. This is done in order to determine a safety factor and see if the welding, tube or rod will fail, thus the measurable quantities 
after testing are considered unrealiable as the destructive testing distorts all dimensions. This failure test has shown that the 
tube may split as seen by test 1. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The report is succesfull in showing the behaviour of a tube under going radial expansion by a mandrel. This working principle 
is incapusled in a bolt design to be used in underground mining excavations.It uses graphs,diagrams and descriptive analysis 
to explain this behaviour. The concept is to be used for ensuring the integrity of underground mining excavations as mineral 
extractions reach deeper under lengths. Due to the unpredictable nature of underground rock seismic activity, it is important 
to account for the worst case scenario.It was found that the performance of a yield bolt will differ depending on the nature of 
the seismic activity.The load bearing of the bolt is more consistent in the event of static seismic activity and tends to drop 
during dynamic activity.  
For this report, the tube is placed in tension during radial expansion. Similar studies have been conducted and placed the tube 
in compression,thus making it prone to buckling. Furthmore, the yielding force was not an important parameter because the 
concept of radial expansion of tubes was used to line drilled holes for oil extraction underground, the lining prevents soil and 
other foreign substances from contaminating the extracted oil with the benefit of keeping the soil intact on the sides as they 
drill deeper.

Abstract (12 font) 
A base case process design for the pyrolysis of pinedust and Acacia tortilis residues was rated 
unsustainable due to the use of a fossil-based, high-cost energy source; the absence of energy 
integration and low yields of the targeted dry oil. Incremental improvements were made using a 
logical matrix based on demonstrated best practices from literature, including the use of a fast 
pyrolysis regime to increase bio-oil quality and yield. More sustainable sources of energy such as 
the use of char by-products in a self-energizing system or the use of concentrated solar were 
proposed. Integrating such improvements will improve the techno-economic outlook of the 
project by lowering the production cost of the pyrolysis oil while reducing the ecological impact 
of the process. We assumed the technical feasibility of utilizing the bio-oil as a substitute for fuel 
oils in slow engines, which has been theoretically proven and partially demonstrated. The logical 
matrix led to sustainable conceptual models for a pyrolysis system that can supply bio-oil for use 
in a heavy fuel oil power generator. Bio-oil would be a cost-effective solution for substituting 
fuel oil, which is facing stiffer regulatory restrictions due to its high sulphur and black carbon 
emissions.

1.1 General introduction 
Current global policies and trends emphasize sustainability- the ability to balance technical, socio-economic, 
ecological and cultural polarities surrounding a project in the long term. Sustainability highlights the ability to meet 
present-day needs without compromising the needs of the future generation, which justifies project continuity 
(Yawson et al., 2009). There has been a global shift in researches and implementations of bioenergy projects to 
reflect this concept. Sustainability studies can take any form: feasibility assessments, optimizations to ascertain 
viability, case-focused impact studies or life cycle assessments, among other options. Charis et al., (2018) buttress

388","4. Conclusion 
Literature gave satisfactory models that were useful in improving the techno-economic outlook of the pyrolysis 
systems. Both the self-energized and concentrated solar pyrolysis systems were found to be largely sustainable due 
to their ability to efficiently use waste-to-energy and renewable energy forms in the process. This greatly reduces 
reliance on fossil-fuel-based electricity and the associated socio-economic and environmental impacts. There are no 
policy restrictions in both countries for the use of the waste forestry residues, therefore the only binding issues on 
sustainability were the supply chain issues. A geographical information systems (GIS) spatial study is recommended 
to ensure a good supply chain strategy. Generally speaking, the socio-economic and ecological sustainability for 
such bio-energy projects that utilize waste is positive, which is the case for the pyrolysis system due to the clean 
energy supply, improved aesthetics and environment, along with employment creation in the biomass supply and 
value chains. However, there would be a need for a more detailed environmental impact assessment, which can be 
done using various methods including LCA or early process development evaluations. The next step would be to 
demonstrate the conceptual model in a pilot or industrial system involving all the system components.

Abstract 
 
Shopping online is a phenomenon that is growing rapidly nowadays. The growth of the industry indicates that 
there is still great potential in the e-commerce market. The internet provides new opportunities for marketers 
to improve marketers' practices when developing marketing strategies. The younger generation (18 to 30 
years old) is not only more familiar with e-commerce, but also processes information on the website five 
times faster than the older generation (58 to 75 years old). Students are the biggest potential market in 
Indonesian for online shopping. This research provides a significant contribution to obtaining information 
about student behavior in online shopping. This study aims to understand market segmentation for online 
shopping in Indonesia. Knowing factors that influence online shopping behavior is fundamental and 
important for providers of products or services in online shopping. The hypothesis of this research is 
processed using multiple linear regression analysis. The result of the analysis is a recommendation to 
improve business strategy. Based on the research results, factors that significantly influence online shopping 
behavior are perceived risk, online advertising, trust and security, and enjoyment. The recommendations are 
completeness of the information and good handling in shipping goods, innovative advertising concepts, 
ensuring the confidentiality and security of consumer data in conducting transactions, as well as providing 
products quickly, safely, and easily.

It can be concluded at the significance level of 0.05, the social influence and website quality variables are 
received (H0 received), meaning that the regression coefficient is not significant. At the 0.05 significance level, risk 
perception, online advertising, trust and security, and pleasure variables are rejected (H0 rejected), it means a 
significant regression coefficient. 
 
5. Recommendation 
The results of this study indicate that factors affecting online shopping behavior in students are the perception of 
risk, online advertising, trust and security, and pleasure. Recommendations can be given in this study for providers 
of online shopping (online marketplace) to improve the business strategy to attract a wider market are: 
1. Concerns of respondents to the defective product received can be done to provide complete information about 
the product and good handling in delivering the goods. Difficulties resolve problems such as returns that can be 
avoided with ease in a groove and a clear procedure regarding the return of goods. Assessment of quality in 
addition to visits from some of the reviews available on online shop, it is better if each product is reviewed 
using video. To avoid any suspicion about the authenticity of the online store about the displayed image. 
2. The effect of online advertising affects the interest to do online shopping or switch to other products. It can be 
concluded that online shops must have a concept that is always innovative advertising to attract customers. 
3. Comforts and consumer trust in the privacy of the online stores affect consumer desires in the decision to buy 
the product. Therefore, that online site has to maintain the privacy of any consumer data to support the good 
reputation of the online store. 
4. The timesaving, convenience, availability of information, and facilities to compare products affect the interests 
of consumers towards online shopping activities. This gives the advantage to the online shop to provide 
products that fit consumer needs. 
 
 
6. 
Conclusion 
The results of the t-test for independent variables that affect the dependent variable with P-Value <0.05 re the 
value of the risk perception (0.025), online advertising (0.013), trust and security (0.004), and pleasure (0.008). It can 
be concluded that the factors that significantly influence behavior are risk perception, online advertising, trust and 
security, and pleasure. 
Based on the results of multiple linear regression analysis, the recommendations are the completeness of the 
information and good handling in the shipping of goods. The online store should have a concept of innovative 
advertising to attract customers. Consumer confidential data must be secured in the transaction online shopping. 
Providing products according to customer needs will help consumers quickly find the product. Convenience, time 
savings, completeness of the information that able to compare one product with another is the top priority of 
respondents in choosing online shopping. 
Further research on online shopping behavior in students, among others, to realize the results of experimental 
studies the existing recommendation on online marketplace provider. So it can be known whether these factors can 
increase sales.

Abstract 
 
Enterprise resource planning systems are comprehensive and complex software developed to consolidate business functions 
and processes. Public entities are encouraged to implement such systems to improve internal process flow and service 
delivery, despite obvious challenges of the new technology implementation. Elsewhere, many organisations have adopted 
ERP systems notwithstanding the difficulties and inherent risks. Using data from questionnaires and interviews, this study 
evaluated the factors that affect the implementation of Microsoft Dynamic 365 ERP systems in public entity in South Africa. 
The results indicate that the major challenges facing public entities, when it comes to the implementation of big projects, like 
ERP systems, is the rigid nature of supplier selection processes.

1. Introduction 
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are applied to improve efficiency and quality by introducing process integration, simplifying, 
and standardising various business proceedings. Consequently, the adoption of enterprise resource planning systems has become an 
important feature of organisations in both the public and private sectors. Bachman (2010) suggests that it is more private sector 
organisations that implement ERP systems compared to public organisations, stating that that while private sector organisations have been 
implementing ERP systems since the early 1990’s, ERP adoption in public organisations has straggled.  This seems to be the case for 
public organisations in South Africa. There is little literature on South African organisations adopting or implementing ERP systems. Das 
Neves et al. (2004) laments the lack of literature, relevant to the South African context, about the selection of appropriate ERP systems for 
organisations. Other works (Townsend (2002); Scholtz and Kapeso (2014); Mukwasi and Seymour, (2014); Urban and Mashinini, (2008)) 
cover various topics on ERP implementation and adoption in South Africa but they are all based on private organisations and Small, 
Micro and Medium Enterprises (SMMEs). This study examined the implementation of an ERP system in a public organisation. 
 
Successfully incorporating ERP systems into organisational structures result in a range of socio and technical challenges. These 
challenges differ from one setting to the next. Different organisations observe varying levels of success as well as different challenges 
after implementing ERP systems. Petter, DeLone, and McLean (2013) highlighted the adoption of information technology artefacts, by 
user communities, as an area of concern. The stated benefits of information technology investments depend on the level, nature, and 
appropriateness of system usage, as much as it is influenced by system quality. This study will abstract from similar studies that have been 
conducted, on the factors that affect implementation successes and failures of ERP systems and relate that to the experience of 
implementing an ERP system in a South African public entity. This study is set in a public entity in South Africa. Assessing the success 
factors and potential barriers from the ERP implementation process may provide an answer to why public entities, within the country, 
have been reluctant to adopt ERP systems. Moreover, the organisation opted for a cloud-based ERP system, Microsoft Dynamics 365. 
Peng and Gala, (2015) submit that ERP resources, such as Dynamics 365, can offer an assortment of options to users but also bring, with 
them, new obstacles. This study will also evaluate the benefits and challenges of Dynamics 365.

410","The projected go-live date for the ERP implementation kept changing as the implementation team faced numerous challenges. The 
makeup of the implementation team did not consist of enough executive members as a result, some decisions took longer to be made or 
finalised. Notwithstanding the differences in culture and lack of competitive pressure, state entities are still required to follow established 
project management frameworks and oversight procedures. These procedures and/or guidelines remain the same for both public and 
private institutions. In trying to assess how best did the NMI follow project management process, a comparison is discussed below. 
 
5.1 Implementation 
Project planning in public entities tends to be ad-hoc whereas successful implementation requires detailed planning in line with resource 
availability, operational requirements, and risks. The duties, responsibilities, and timelines were delegated clearly among parties, in this 
case. Section Heads and their teams were required to evaluate and map out business processes, identify business process re-engineering 
opportunities before seeking software customisation from the vendor. Delays in implementation emanated from the lack of decision-
makers in the steering committee and lapses in monitoring and coordination of the planned activities. To avoid delays in implementation, 
it is very critical to monitor and coordinate planned activities and stick to the original timelines. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The findings from this study generally corroborate what is available in literature. This study confirmed that one of the main challenges 
facing public entities, when it comes to the implementation of big projects, like ERP systems, is the rigid nature of supplier selection 
processes, amongst other things. The NMI did not have complete control on ERP implementation collaboration team and partners and that 
influenced the effectiveness of the implementation strategy. Using the project management checklist, as a guideline, also identified parts 
of the implementation strategy that was not thoroughly considered. For future research, studies on successful ERP adoption and 
implementation in South Africa’s public sector should be conducted. More studies should also be conducted on Cloud ERP and what it 
can offer South Africa’s public organisations that other ERP systems were not able to offer.

Abstract. Robots are used to assist human beings in various applications. There is a need to 
improve the performance of robot structures by cutting cost and to provide light-weighted 
material systems. An area of flexible link manipulator has gained more interest from researchers 
in robotics. When compared with rigid-link manipulators, flexible manipulators are easy to 
manoeuvre, high-speed performance and higher payload-to-weight ratio. It has been noted that 
in previous and recent years’ experiments were proposed in analysing tip deflection. In this 
paper a model of 2DOF Flexible Link Manipulator (FLM) in a cantilever configuration, it has 
been designed from a lightweight material. The aim is to assess the stability of the FLM model 
with a set of varying payloads attached at the tip as to what will be the maximum load it can 
withstand. The Inventor design tool was used to simulate the loading procedures, which assisted 
with Finite element analysis. Results are compared against the allowable maximum deflection 
limit of cantilever configuration. Results on how the model deflects are produced with the safety 
factor at each loaded condition and numerical results of maximum deflection produced by the 
set of varying loads were compared with the FEA results. And based on the results assessed, 
conclusions are made with a set of safety factor and how the light weighted design is 
advantageous in the industry to improve safety and performance.

1. Introduction 
Engineers and researchers have focussed on modelling a flexible manipulator, and so far with controlling the 
vibrations occurring when the model has moved and stopped, mostly conducted with theoretical models. Amongst 
other uses, this new area of flexible link manipulator has gained interest from researchers in robotics. When 
Compared with rigid-link robotic structures, flexible manipulators are easy to manoeuvre, high-speed performance 
and higher payload-to-weight ratio (Agee, et al., 2014). And the two-link flexible manipulator poses the rigid and 
flexible type of motions because of their mechanical flexibility, they are lightweight, (Sahu, et al., 2017) explains 
that they are easy to transport as they are compared to rigid robot arms which in the way they are structured tend 
to be inefficient and they have to carry less weight.  Balancing the flexibility and the weight of the links in these 
flexible manipulators is necessary (Rezaei & Shafei, 2019).  
 
Flexible link manipulators (FLM) are constructed like human arms some with more joints. They are continuously 
replacing rigid manipulators (Yu, et al., 2015) in the industry due to fewer energy demands when operating FLM. 
The controlling of a flexible manipulator, it is performed by actuating the joints to move at a certain speed

Is shown on the graph above figure 5 that when the loading is increased the more the model deflects, the deflection 
of the model increases linearly with the load. It shows that the more the model is subjected to loading it will bend 
until it fails. The loading criteria used in this study shows the weight ratio theory mostly discussed in flexible 
manipulators studies, as it is shown that as light as it is designed it can carry high loads. It is seen that the results 
follow the stress-strain graph, that the higher the stress the higher the strain. 
 
It is seen that having a light model reduces the weight of the system, with aluminium selected as a material type 
for the design. The model proved to carry the load at the tip as light as it is without failing at low payloads. This 
type of design model can reduce the cost of operation in the manufacturing industry, and reduction of power usage, 
because of having a lighter system the lower the cost in operation. 
 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper a study was carried out to validate the stability of a designed two link Flexible manipulator, the aim 
was to assess to what load it can hold to the allowable deflection. A limiting deflection value of 1,91mm was 
derived and a set of varying payloads were subjected at the tip of the model. With the help of Inventor software, 
finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to simulate the set of varying payloads. It was found that at the load 
that can be withstood by the model is 32,5 N the deflection is 1,8898 mm which is approximately equals to 
allowable deflections, the von mises stress of 1229,92 MPa was produced, first principal stress found was 1342,71 
MPa, third principal stress of 321,48 MPa and a maximum safety factor of 15 ul. It was seen from the results that 
the increase of varying loads the more the model deflects. It can be concluded that the aim of assessing the model 
stability was achieved, the model cannot be subjected to loads more than 32,5 N and the model is advantageous as 
it carries more load to its weight ratio. It can help reduce operation cost in the manufacturing industry as it was 
seen from the simulated results. Future studies can be carried out with a physical system actuated.

Abstract 
 
Conflict arises over shared resources when resource owners have individual strategy rather than collaboration. 
Teesta river basin shared by India and Bangladesh is known for its lack of an agreement between these two countries 
over sharing its waters. Such situation is creating distress and misunderstandings between these two countries. In 
this paper we have used a system analysis technique including linear programming and game theory by considering 
a rational plan which includes water storage, power production, irrigation and salinity control. Moreover using game 
theory we have investigated a range of strategies which will result in significant benefits for each country. 
 
Keywords 
Game theory, Linear programming, Teesta basin. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Undoubtedly, water is one of the most vital elements of nature for the existence of any living creature including 
human, plant and other species. However, developing countries are struggling with scarceness of pure water supply. 
It is estimated that by 2050, 6 billion people of the world will face hurdles for fresh water (Boretti and Rosa 2019). 
Consequently, stakeholders are conflicting with each other for water resources and creating disputes worldwide 
(Dinar and Hogarth 2015). For instance, disputes between Shaanxi and Hubei for Hanjiang River Basin (Wei and 
Gnauck 2007a), Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for Syrdarya Basin over water allocation (Melnikovová 2017), Namibia 
and Botswana for protecting the Okavango Delta (Wolf et al. 2005) and so on. The clashes among the stakeholders 
create hostile movements for their contradictory goals and tactics (Petersen-Perlman et al. 2017). On the other hand, 
interests and benefits of stakeholders cannot be denied (Mei 2015). For the purpose of mitigating these issues, the 
prevailing regulations do not work effectively (Dinar and Hogarth 2015). For utilizing the concepts of the interests 
and benefits of the stakeholders, studies should be come to light to resolve these conflicts and game theory plays a 
significant role in this regards. 
 
At the very first time, game theory was used to apply in water resource projects for equally cost allocation in water 
management (Dinar and Howitt 1997; Heany and Dickinson 1982; Young et al. 1982). Therefore, Nash Bargaining 
Solution, Shapley value, Least Core etc. has been established from this model for distributing cost (Lejano and 
Davos 1995). After that, many researchers have concentrated in resolving water conflicts by using game theory (Wei 
and Gnauck 2007b). 
 
In this paper, we will show a linear programming model how an international river Basin conflict may be viewed in 
the light of simple game theory. The region comprises northern part of west Bengal, Sikkim, Northern part of 
Bangladesh. The agriculture of the region is dominated by the monsoon. From June to October the rainfall is heavy, 
much of the plain is subject to flooding, and rice is almost the sole crop harvested. During the dry season from 
November to May only precarious winter crops of cereals, pulses, and oil seed can be grown without irrigation. 
Hence, rice dominates the agricultural economy and the diet. But people of this region is not getting enough water in 
the dry season especially people of Bangladesh. The river flows are highly seasonal and as a result are inadequate 
for full irrigation during the dry seasons unless over season storage is provided. Clearly, the dominant fact upon 
which the future development of the river basin depends upon the political relationship between India and 
Bangladesh. On these rivers India lies everywhere upstream of Bangladesh, and hence any Indian developments 
could have adverse effects upon Bangladeshi projects downstream unless the river basin is developed as a

428","Observing the payoff table we can see that Bangladesh must go for strategy 2 as in strategy 1 there is no chance for 
Bangladesh to make profit. India plays any of their strategies; Bangladesh is making profit by applying strategy 2. 
India will apply strategy 2 or 3 as strategy1 bears loss for India. So we can divide in six cases. 
 
4.3 Investigation of Strategies 
 
Case 1 (Bangladesh and India both do nothing): This is not an interesting case as both countries face with huge 
losses.  
 
Case 2 (Bangladesh does nothing and India share 30%): By this India could get profit but Bangladesh still faces with 
big loss. So it might not an acceptable case for Bangladesh. 
 
Case 3 (Bangladesh does nothing and India share 50%): By this India could get profit more than case 2 profit but 
Bangladesh still faces with big loss. So it also might not an acceptable case for Bangladesh. And it seems that India 
is getting more profit by sharing more water up to 50%. 
 
Case 4 (Bangladesh goes with their Dalia project and India do nothing): Though Bangladesh is making profit in this 
case but India will not be interested to go for this case as they are bearing loss in this case. 
 
Case 5 (Bangladesh goes with their Dalia project and India shares 30%): In this case though both countries are 
making profit so it can be a solution of this problem. But Bangladesh is getting larger profit than India which may a 
reason for India not to choose this case as by sharing more 20% of water India can make more profit than this. 
 
Case 6 (Bangladesh goes with their Dalia project and India shares 50%): Through this case both countries could 
make profit. India is getting a large portion of profit than Bangladesh. Though Bangladesh is making less profit here 
than case 5, case 6 is the most stable case and indicating Nash equilibrium of this game as there is a question in case 
5 that ‘do India will accept less profit than Bangladesh or not’. So case 5 is not a pure dominating case. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Water resource management could become a complex job, as the stake-holders may hold sometimes conflicting 
and contradictory views and interest. The water resource distribution between Bangladesh and India is one such 
case. This issue is one of the burning thorns in these two countries relations for last few decades. The game theory 
could be an efficient tool for solving this issue. In this case study, linear programming and game theory have been 
used as the modeling approach to mitigate the hurdles and to look for the better solution to this burning issue. From 
the game model and Nash equilibrium we can see the 6th case where Bangladesh goes with their Dalia Project and 
India shares 50% of Teesta rivers water is most beneficial for both sides. In this scenario, both Bangladesh and India 
profits and they make up a profit of total 2.59 Million units. So it is the most stable solution. However, while 
developing the model due to lack of study there environmental economic effects have been neglected. This can be 
the future scope of study. In conclusion, game theory is quite a powerful tool in resolving water resource conflicts, 
as this approach not provides a clear comparison between the different water users, but is also beneficial to water 
decision makers.

Abstract 
 
Bibliometric research presented the statistical analysis of publications. The bibliometric method was applied to 
classify the data regarding different variables such as journals, authors, and countries. The research shows a general 
overview of studies that have been reported in Nanomanufacturing. The main important point is that these indicators 
provide the reader with a general picture that identifies the most influential research on Nanomanufacturing. The 
paper was divided into sub-sections that focused on the relevant journals, research papers, authors, institutions, and 
countries. The results were in accordance with human thinking, moreover, a few unexpected results have appeared. 
The main objective of this article is to be informative, and the indicators sum up the most essential research on this 
topic. However, some influential issues will be skipped if they are not included in the web of science database, 
which is the only source that is used to handle the bibliometric analysis.

1. Introduction 
 
Nano-manufacturing is the production of Nano-scale materials, components, structures, systems, and 
devices. The production of parts could be either ""bottom-up"" from nanoscale materials or ""top-down"" which has too 
many steps for high precision. The production of Nano can be done by different techniques such as etching, laser 
ablation, and others. The necessity of Nanomanufacturing is becoming one of the important techniques to produce 
very small particles that could be used in various applications (Meijerl et al., n.d.). The need for Nanomanufacturing 
is not only by the requirement of the devices and structures with new properties but by decreasing the component of 
size, material applied, and consumption of products. Nano-scale manufacture indicates the production of structures, 
components, and materials with dimensions between 1-100 nm which include the surface and sub-surface style, 
nanowires, 3D Nanostructures, nanotubes, and nanoparticles. Lasers have been provided a very important 
opportunity in the inquiries of Nanomanufacturing (Kovalenko 2006).

Abstract  
 
Nowadays, many workers were faced with the increasing incidence of Work-related Musculoskeletal 
Disorders (MSD); the industries had taken multiple initiatives to reduce the risk by design the mechanical 
machine or supportive tool based on ergonomic criteria. In this context, the current study has been carried 
out in groceries shop at where most of workers were continuously exposed to MSD risk factors (e.g. 
repetitive manual tasks and awkward postures) and suffering from some kind of musculoskeletal complaint. 
The main objective of the current study was to evaluate ergonomic risk referred manual handling. In 
addition, the goal for this study is designing a specific tool to ease the workers and reduce risk. The methods 
used to evaluate the risk are RULA and REBA assessment. The scores of REBA for all the workers are 10, 
9 and 8 respectively while the RULA score is 7 for all workers. Besides, the intensity of work related injury 
was assessed using NIOSH Lifting Index. The workers score higher values for lifting index. The results 
showed that the ergonomic interventions are essential to reduce the mismatch between workers and 
workstations physical conditions, contributing to the postural correction and, consequently, to the MSD 
prevention.

1. Introduction 
Ergonomic is one of the significant aspect should be focus by all the employer and employee. Many industries 
overlook the seriousness of the ergonomic risk, which may cause a long term disability. In order to know the 
ergonomic risk, the definition of ergonomic must be comprehended. The definition of ergonomic is scientific 
understanding of interface among humans and other elements such as the way of work and technology of a system, 
the career that utilizes theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to improve human well-being and overall 
system performance (International Ergonomic Association, 2019). Ergonomic is also known as human factor. 
 
Ergonomic are needed to accomplish the law of Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and maximize the 
productivity of industry. Ergonomic had been focused by OSHA to reduce the occupational injury and risk among 
workers related to the ergonomics. It gives many benefits to the workers, production line and the company itself. Many 
organizations had conducted training for employer and employee to make them realized the present of occupational 
injury and ergonomic risk. 
 
Ergonomic risk had been taken seriously in the other countries. The statistic of the workers that had been affected by 
ergonomic risk is increasing rapidly every year among the workers. The specific organization was formed to make a

446","The design has a unique characteristic to reduce the risk. The main feature is the trolley can be adjusted suitable to the 
worker’s desire. It also can be adjusted according to the existing rack at the groceries shop. The function of the trolley 
is to reduce the load for the worker in manual handling. This is the alternative to reduce the back pain and muscle pain 
faced by the worker. 
 
The dimension of the trolley is based on the size of the workplace. The width of the trolley is 40 cm which is one of 
the shops has 60 cm in length between racks to rack. The length of the trolley is 100 cm which is suitable to fill with 
things in the groceries shops. The maximum height of the trolley is 80 cm, same height with the worker waist. They 
do not have to bend their body to arrange the product from trolley to the top level rack. 
 
The trolley designed to meet the needs of the workers and it helps to reduce awkward posture during reloading stock 
or good to the rack. They can fill the weight more than 50 kg and the task to restock the product will be take less time 
than before. The trolley also can reduce repetitive work of the worker regarding weight limit and capability of the 
worker. 
 
5. Conclusion 
It was found that majority of groceries shop and small company did not know about ergonomic and risk related work. 
Specific organization should focus more on company in rural area and take immediate action for high risk. The worker 
of the groceries shop had been experienced in injury related to their work; muscle pain and back pain. Their working 
posture may be lead back pain and muscle pain.  
 
The role of the study was characterized by a length route for the worker to lift the load, frequent bending forward, 
lifting loads at awkward postures and exceed the standard load limit resulting in high degree of manual handling-
related injuries. The future study can focused on the arrangement of the workplace or workplace layout. Workplace 
condition can be the source of risk to the worker. The enough space for the worker is necessary to ensure the worker 
feel comfortable and avoid hazardous at workplace.

Abstract 
Logistics 4.0 is an emerging phenomenon which is subsumed by Industry 4.0 concept. The importance of 
digitalization of logistics activities is increasing because of the competitive environment both in manufacturing 
and service areas. It is obvious that the implementation of Logistics 4.0 concepts in enterprises will be possible 
by technical-skilled employees. Whilst there is a significant amount of academic studies for Logistics 4.0, 
studies for Logistics 4.0 education is very limited. Universities’ and vocational high schools’ logistics 
departments’ lectures and courses must include Logistics 4.0 concepts and applications to provide technical-
skilled work force to the industry. This study aims to investigate Logistics 4.0 key concepts and to propose a 
structural Logistics 4.0 curriculum for the vocational high schools. To achieve this aim, 106 papers have been 
investigated and it has been seen that Internet of Things (Iot), big data and robotic technologies are the most 
mentioned ones in the frame of logistics. These concepts have been recommended as the topics which should be 
implemented into the logistics 4.0 curriculum of vocational high schools.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Industry 4.0 is an emerging concept which is studied by both academicians and practitioners since the date it 
was coined. Highly competitive economic environment forces organizations to adapt themselves to the 
principles of Industry 4.0. While the researches are going on about the general principles and applications of 
Industry 4.0, specialized fields like logistics are also the subjects of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Logistics 4.0 
can be briefly described as implementing Industry 4.0 concepts into logistics functions. 
 
Technically skilled employee is one of the key factors of this implementation. Workers, technicians and 
engineers who are capable of Industry 4.0 technologies and concepts will ease the adaptation and sustainability 
of Industry 4.0 concepts in an organization. While the organizations are taking actions to train their workforce 
for the new technological concepts, educational institutions should improve and adapt their curricula for the

Abstract 
 
The biggest challenge in earthquake emergency logistics lies in determining the demand for emergency logistics 
support. To forecast the need for emergency logistics support plays a vital role in optimal disaster logistics 
management. An accurate demand forecasting can prevent an out-of-stock, can save time, and ensure a proper 
allocation of emergency logistical relief to overcome the long-suffering of victims. This paper aims to design a 
model for estimating emergency logistical assistance requests after an earthquake. The methodology of Case-based 
Reasoning (CBR) is applied to build the model. At the same time, the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) 
able to supports retrieving data to the model to produce the forecasting results quickly. The research results show 
that the error forecast for relief logistics includes blankets, tents, food are respectively 16.78%, 15.99%, and 
10.48%. All errors forecast in the range of 10% -20%; thus, the results indicate that the forecast output model is 
valid to use for predicting emergency logistical assistance requests immediately after an earthquake occurs.

1. Introduction 
Earthquake is the most lethal natural disaster that brings destructive impact for living creatures (Cao et al. 2018; Jin 
2014). For the last decade, several earthquakes that occurred in Indonesia resulted in a large number of deaths, 
damaged infrastructure, and great economic losses. The highest earthquake occurrence that afflicts Indonesia 
happened in 2018 with 35 destructive earthquake incidents, the greatest number compared to previous years. 
According to Indonesia disaster management agency, a series of earthquakes in 2018 caused 4,814 deaths (increase 
597% from 2017), 21,083 injured victims (increase 1923% from 2017), 322,864 property damaged (increase 522% 
from 2017), and the economic loss to swiftly increase 233% from 2017. While the earthquake incidents might be 
unavoidable, the effective response operation should be carried out to reduce the devastating impact on the lives of 
those who affected (Loree and Aros-Vera 2018).  
 
One of activity that is considered as the key success for effective response operation is emergency logistic (EL) 
(D’Haene, Verlinde, and Macharis 2012), (Y. Liu et al. 2018). The main purpose of EL is to distribute the logistic 
reliefs to those who affected as quickly as possible to reduce their suffering and loss of life after the earthquake 
(Clay Whybark 2007). The greatest challenge in earthquake emergency logistics lies in determining emergency 
logistic relief demand. (Song, Chen, and Lei 2018). The chaos situation after earthquake makes it difficult to obtain 
demand-related information e.g affected areas, the damage level of the affected area, number of displaced 
population, etc. (Sheu 2007), whereas the forecasting number of total emergency logistic relief demand is a premise 
and basis to distribute emergency logistic relief optimally. (X. Wang et al. 2016), (W. Liu, Hu, and Li 2012). 
Emergency logistic relief must always be ready whenever the victims need it. The lack of amount of emergency 
logistic relief will potentially increase the number of death (Loree and Aros-Vera 2018). In order to reduce victim 
suffering and prevent additional deaths, disaster management agency strongly requires the method to forecast 
emergency logistic relief demand after earthquake so they can determine how many emergency logistic relief must

3. Results And Discussion 
 
Based on Table VIII, MAPE value for food, blanket, and tent are  10.48%, 16.78%, and 15.99% respectively. All of 
MAPE value is less than 20%, meaning that the forecasting result is valid (W. Liu, Hu, and Li 2012). Besides, based 
on Lewis classified model (Lewis 1982), the forecasting result is also considered having a good accuracy since all of 
MAPE value lies in the range of 10%-20%.  
 
The accurate forecasting result in this research is driven by few reasons: first, this paper uses precise attributes to 
determine case similarity. Four attributes which are magnitude, depth of hypocentre, epicenter distance, and MMI, 
are the factors which really affect the extensive damage of earthquake. The greater the damage, the number of 
emergency logistic demand will increase (Tang 2012). Other attributes are total population affected and duration of 
response phase. The more affected population, the more demand for emergency logistic relief (Tang 2012). The 
longer duration of response phase will result in increasing number of victims since during response phase, the risk of 
earthquake damage might be still threatening and the victims should not be allowed to leave the evacuee shelter. 
Therefore, the number of emergency logistic relief demand will increase if duration of response phase is longer. 
Second, this paper uses the appropriate attribute weighting method, which is IDVW, that is proven can increase the 
precision and accuracy in case retrieval. Third, the formula we proposed to forecast emergency logistic relief 
demand is based on number of post-earthquake victims estimation and logistic relief minimum standard needs, 
which reflects the real circumstances.  
 
IoT implementation proposed in this research supports the CBR model to obtain the value of magnitude, depth, 
epicenter distance, and MMI short after earthquake occur, so demand forecasting process can be conducted as quick 
as possible to increase the agility of EL.  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This paper establishes an empirical model to forecast emergency logistic relief demand in the aftermath of  
earthquake disaster based on the most similar historical case. The similarity is assessed by six attributes which are 
determined based on literature review and expert validation. Using IoT implementation, the model will estimate the 
number of post-earthquake victims quickly which is used as variable to forecast the number of food, blanket, and 
tent demand based on the formula we proposed in this research. The forecasting result is considered as valid and 
accurate since the MAPE value lies in the range of 10%-20%.

Abstract 
Comparative experimental performance evaluation of longitudinal and transverse four-pass soda can solar air heater 
has been studied. The aluminum soda can was used as the absorber plate of the solar air heater. Two design 
configurations, transverse and longitudinal arrangements, of the solar air heater’s absorber plate were studied. The 
tests were carried out at different tilt angles of 0o, 7o, 14o, 21o and 28o between May and June 2019 and readings were 
taken on daily basis from 8:00 hrs. to 17:00 hrs. The outlet velocity, inlet and outlet temperature of each arrangement 
were measured. Parametric plots were made with the measured parameters and the efficiencies were computed and 
compared. Even at a low insolation value, the transverse arrangement recorded a 10% more useful energy gain and 
15% higher cumulative efficiency than the longitudinal arrangement. Temperatures of about 105.4oC and 103.1oC at 
a mass flowrate of 0.019 kg/s, suitable for industrial and agricultural applications, were recorded for the transverse 
and the longitudinal arrangement, respectively.

1. Introduction
The world faces a greater challenge on energy management, economic waste and environmental pollution caused by 
disposal of used materials. It can never be overemphasized that recycling and reusing waste materials will save the 
environment and provide raw materials for production. Beverage (soda) cans (which are mainly made of aluminum) 
are not biodegradable and millions of them are discarded daily in the world. A typical soda can is an alloy containing 
92.5% to 97% aluminum, 5.5% magnesium, 1.6% manganese, 0.15% chromium and some trace amounts of iron, 
silicon and copper (Alcoa Inc., 2012). These end up clogging up the waterways and littering the environment with 
disastrous consequences. As part of a waste to wealth program, aluminum cans (which were usually recycled into 
products of lower value) are recycled. It has been found that due to its high thermal conductivity, aluminum soda cans 
can serve as absorber of solar air heaters which is of higher importance in the value chain (Mgbemene et al. 2017, 
Alvarez et al. 2004 and Sperry 2011). The use of soda cans as a component of solar air heating system is not yet very 
popular. However, the usage provides a cheap way of making solar air heating system. The aluminum soda cans, when 
used as the absorber plate of a solar air heater, are economically cheaper than aluminum flat plate and with the sun as 
the heat source, the whole system becomes even more economical. The use of recyclable materials in making absorber 
plates of solar air collector therefore implies the production of cheaper solar air heaters and cleaner environment. 
Solar air heating refers to the use of solar energy directly for heating purposes. The energy from the sun (solar 
insolation) is captured by an absorption medium and used to heat air for buildings or process heat applications. It is 
also applied for air conditioning or heating in buildings or for other different processes (Omojaro and Aldabbagh, 
2010). Solar air heaters are the most cost-effective solar technologies and are widely used due to their simplicity. It is 
employed in space heating, drying of timber and agricultural products and for re-generating dehumidifying agents. 
Also, solar air heaters are utilized as preheaters in industries and as auxiliary heaters in buildings to save energy during 
winter-times (Mahmood and Aldabbagh, 2013).

484","Comparing the results of the transverse and longitudinal arrangements of the four-pass solar aluminum soda can air 
heater, it could be seen that a reasonable maximum rise in temperature difference reaching 72.4oC and 68.5oC were 
established in the flow despite the low insolation. Even at the low insolation value, the transverse arrangement 
recorded a 10% more useful energy gain than the longitudinal arrangement with values at 1501 W and 1365 W, 
respectively. Table 1 presents the summary of the performance of the two air heater arrangements on 15th May 2019 
with average daily insolation of 717.2 W/m2. Comparing the efficiency of both arrangements, it can be seen that the 
transverse arrangement performs better than the longitudinal arrangement in both instantaneous efficiency and 
cumulative efficiency. This must have been as a result of absorber configuration and less pressure drop in transverse 
arrangement. 
Conclusions 
The performance of the longitudinal and transverse arrangement of a four-pass soda can air heater has been studied. 
The results of both arrangements showed that the four-pass soda can air heater can give an outlet temperature of 
105.4oC and 103.1oC respectively in rainy reason. Such a temperature is high enough for industrial use. The lower 
temperatures are good for home heating and agricultural drying purposes. The configurations of the system 
(transverse 
and longitudinal absorber arrangement) that will give the best performance have also been determined. The results 
were consistent in all the modes. They show that even in the rainy season, when sky is mostly cloudy, both SCAH 
configurations would still be able to establish a good temperature difference in the fluid. This shows that the 
aluminum 
soda cans can serve as good absorber materials for air collectors. However, the mass flow rate is a factor to be 
considered in the design and decision to use the SCAH.

Abstract  
Cement manufacturing process is not stable and efficient due to the bulk nature of the crawler chain system. The 
bulk nature of the crawler chain during operation uses high energy that is also a major concern during operation. For 
decades now, researchers have used several approaches to optimize the design of crawler chain system to improve 
stability, efficiency and energy during cement manufacturing. The weight of the crawler chain design is still heavy 
with several operational problems reported during cement manufacturing. It is therefore imperative to optimize the 
current design of crawler chain system such that the system operates with speed at optimal weight, which will not 
lead to mechanical failures. As such, optimal weight, low operational cost and low operational energy will be 
achieving during operation. In the current study, the tool of finite element analysis was used to optimize the weight 
of the crawler chain design during operation. The effects of material used and their impact on weight were modelled 
theoretically and validated by finite element analysis. The following were revealed after theoretical model and finite 
element analysis (1) it showed there was an optimal weight that gave optimal performance during cement 
manufacturing process. (2) It also revealed that to improve on performance and speed, the weight of the crawler 
design must be minimised. Study showed a close correlation between theoretical model results and results of finite 
element analysis.

Introduction 
The continuous miner is one of the major product lines that globally sells to the underground coalmine or 
quarry blasting in cement industry. The equipment consists of 4 main sections namely mainframe, cutter 
frame, conveyor and gathering head/spade. The machine provides a full cutting and loading solution on 
one machine. The cutter frame cuts the coal in a process called sumping. The tips on the cutter case 
breaks the call into small chunks. These chunks fall onto the gathering head/ spade that have a set of 
continuous loading arms. The CLAs push the chunks into the conveyor that runs on the center of the 
machine all the way to the back. At the back, a shuttle car will stand to be loaded just as a front-end 
loader will fill a dump truck. On the mainframe, a gearbox drives the traction chain. This chain moves the 
chain forward and back as well as turning the machine. This gearbox is called the traction reducer.

is a good quality for increased wear life on a chain since there is a lot of rubbing of two metals as the 
sprocket engages with the chain.  
According to the quotation obtained, it was obvious that carbon fiber is costly than the two other material 
and followed by Hardox 400 and the cheapest is Weldox 700. However, based on the quality material, 
Hardox 400 will be preferably chosen. 
6. 
Conclusion 
The chain was designed and it met the anticipated upshot design and the preliminary needs of the project. 
The chain is 50% lighter than the initial chain mass of 30kg per link. However, the chain is also strong 
enough to withstand the high torque induced by the gearbox. The cost to manufacture the chain is 
reasonable enough for a once off production. The present chain design is easy to manufacture and 
assemble i.e. no complex machining needed to produce the chain. Furthermore, it reduces the issue of too 
many manpower to dismantle the equipment or moving it from one point to the other since the weight has 
been reduced drastically according to proposed plan and objectives. 
The great achievement in this research is that the working hours wastage during the maintenance activites 
was reduced and numbers of skilled personnel was also reduced as well. 
7. 
Recommendations 
Further refining of the chain could be done in order to reduce the cost of machining. The chain must be 
trialed on a small scale prototype to see if there will be any unforeseen complications that may arise 
during the manufacturing process of the typical chain. A resilience test can be done to the chain model to 
predict the possible areas of failure in future.

Abstract 
 
A perennial crisis of growing waste accumulations and natural resource depletion are major challenges for most 
parts of the world today, of which many have explored recycling as a solution. However, recycling is impeded by 
the need to sort waste by material types before processing. Additionally, the composition of municipal solid waste is 
so random such that the processes cost more than the value of recyclables. This research aimed at increasing the 
quantum of waste recycled, by using waste sorting machines at large institutions such as universities and hospitals. 
Unlike municipal solid waste, the composition of the waste from such institutions was less random and could be 
analysed through waste characterisation and sorting. Waste characterisation was conducted for a university and the 
data directly integrated into the design and subsequent calibration of a customized and automated waste sorting 
machine. The modular and calibratable machine capable of sorting 200kg of waste per hour was designed, with an 
estimated cost of USD 5,966.72. The automated design was sound and sustainable, based on the simulation and 
stress analysis carried out, capable of achieving 12m travel distance per item and at least 85% accuracy in sorting, 
with Von Misses stresses not exceeding 0.168 MPa.

1. Introduction 
The world generates at least 3.5 million tonnes of plastic and other solid waste a day, 10 times the amount a century 
ago (Stephen , 2018). With the development of the world and global population growth, waste accumulations have 
become more prominent and the effects more pronounced. It is anticipated that by 2050, solid waste related 
emissions will increase to 2.6 billion tonnes of Carbon Dioxide from 1.6 billion tonnes in 2016 (Kaza, et al., 2018). 
Additionally, the consumption of natural resources is increasing due to the growing global population and increased 
demand from industries (Subramanian, 2018). As a result, the health of the environment has been deteriorating as

6. Discussion and Recommendations 
After the testing and simulation of the machine, the research should have progressed to the prototyping phase. 
However, suspension of normal activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic restricted access to the resources needed 
to produce a prototype. As a result, the design of the waste sorting machine could not be physically tested. Hence the 
simulations had to be stepped up, completely replacing the physical prototype with a digital version of the machine 
to demonstrate how the machine worked. The results of the simulations were promising and showed that the 
machine worked as intended. 
 
After the simulation of the machine, it was observed that the machine itself could be equipped with data loggers to 
produce real-time and highly accurate waste characterisations. Additionally, the calibration of the machine could be 
continuously adjusted using a simple learning algorithm that uses data collected after each cycle to automatically 
adjust the calibration for the next sorting cycle. However, large bottles and card boxes cannot be fed into the 
machine, therefore, to increase the range of materials that can be sorted, it was recommended that a shredder could 
added in a pre-sorting phase to break large objects into manageable sizes for sorting. 
7. Conclusion 
This project has revealed the role that waste characterisation at large institutions (such as universities, hospitals and 
business parks) can play in encouraging recycling through use of waste sorting machines designed to make use of 
this data. The waste sorting machine that was designed can be calibrated to sort new types of waste and respond to 
trends in the waste stream. Additionally, once in use, the machine can automatically provide accurate waste 
characterisation meaning institutions can observe the effectiveness of any waste management plans they have in 
place and identify any trends in their waste streams. The total cost of the machine was calculated to be USD 
5,966.72, based on the current market and labour prices both locally and internationally. Though no prototype of the 
machine was produced, detailed simulations were carried to demonstrate the functioning of the machine. 
 
Recycling can play a major role in dealing with environmental problems and reducing natural resource shortages. 
Using waste sorting machines at large institutions (such as universities) can greatly increase the amount of waste 
being recycled. The physical state of the waste being produced at these institutions allows for relatively simple 
waste sorting techniques to be used which cannot be used with municipal solid waste, allowing for simpler waste 
sorting machine design. The waste sorting machine is anticipated to reduce/eliminate the transportation of 
recyclables to dumps, and instead recyclables can be sorted from the mixed waste by the machine and then 
transported or sold to recycling centres. As a result, large institutions can play an active role in reducing the amount 
of waste going to landfills and increasing the amount of waste being recycled. Incorporation of the Internet of 
Things and Big Data can go a long way in encouraging the adoption of this waste sorting machine on a large scale 
by making real-time analysis easily available.

Abstract 
 
The automotive industry is growing faster than any other industry and neck on neck with this growth is the demand 
for lightweight components. This is a pull factor, which is primarily influenced by the drive towards reducing fuel 
consumption and emissions to the atmosphere. The stakes are very high in the quest to satisfy the insatiable 
customer hunger for reduced fuel consumption. Stringent emission regulations have also been put in place in order 
to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming. This has placed tremendous pressure for an increased production 
of light vehicle components. Hence the lighter the better, and this paper focuses on the lightweighting technologies 
that are being implemented in the automotive industry, and how weight reduction is vital in reducing vehicle fuel 
consumption and global warming. Two weight reduction methods, material substitution and topology optimization 
are reviewed and analyzed based on cost, strength and stiffness. The paper also discusses the contribution that 
vehicle mass has on the driving cycle when compared to other parameters that affect fuel consumption.

1. Introduction  
The automotive industry is the quickest growing industry today (Bangde et al. 2020). The demand for lightweight 
components in this industry keeps on burgeoning (Grand View Research 2018), and it is happening in the midst of 
an intensely competitive industry where the stakes are always high in the quest to satisfy the ever-changing needs of 
the customer. This is influencing sustainability, which can also be referred to as eco-friendly design. This is 
happening at a time when the world is going green and countries seek to minimize the negative effects of global 
warming. The increasing awareness about reducing emissions and the stringent emission regulations has placed 
tremendous pressure on automotive companies to turn to lighter parts in order to reduce the weight of cars (Chebolu, 
2020; Kobayashi et al. 2009; Fontaras et al. 2017). The lighter the better, and practical application has proven that 
reducing a motor vehicle’s weight by 10% not only reduces raw material consumption, which is material efficiency, 
but also cuts car fuel consumption by between 6% to 8% (Joost 2012; Bangde et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020). Thus, 
lightweighting supports sustainability. This is due to the fact that the lighter vehicle will have to overcome lesser 
tractive forces during motion. The weight of the car is the most significant tractive force. 75% of the fuel 
consumption is dependent on the weight (Saidpour 2004). The more the weight reduction, the lesser the tractive 
forces encountered by the vehicle when it is in motion and the lesser the fuel consumption. This is beneficial to both 
the company and the customer. Research has also proven that every 100 kg removed from a motor vehicle reduces 
CO2 emissions by 9 grams per kilometer (Hirsch 2011). Lightweight parts also have high energy efficiency (Dudek 
and Zagórski 2017). It is against this background that this paper presents the lightweighting strategies that have been

Abstract 
 
The electricity generation through renewable resources is a crying need to increase the rural electrification rate to an 
appreciable value in Nigeria. Electricity can be supplied through either the national grid being extended or through 
off-grid systems. The grid extension cost depends on the location of the area, its terrain, the number of households, 
and distance of the area from a grid point. However, based on these factors and inadequate supply of electricity to 
even the areas connected to the national grid, renewable energy sources may provide an alternative means of electricity 
generation in rural areas in Nigeria. This research paper highlighted the design, evaluation, and the techno-economic 
feasibility of providing electricity to rural Dilchidama in Nigeria through renewable energy sources. Total 77 
households, 1 primary school, 1 primary health centre and 4 shops having total estimated load of 306 kWh/d were 
considered. The design and techno-economic feasibility of the renewable resource was compared with extending the 
national grid to the area using HOMER and RETScreen tools.  The results showed that grid extension is much more 
cost competitive than the solar photovoltaic system for the study area for a maximum distance of 9.9 km. The 
sensitivity analysis performed by varying several input parameters indicated that solar photovoltaic renewable 
resource is a potential alternative beyond 9.9 km distance from the grid.

Introduction 
 
The requirement for electricity in any community is paramount considering the high benefits that are derived from it 
which relate to the enhancement of man’s quality of life. Electricity to some extent is a major issue in the 
characteristics of the gap between rural and urban communities in the developing world. It was estimated that about 
1.2 billion of the world population have no provision of electricity grid.  Most of them reside in rural areas in Sub-
Sahara Africa (about 0.590 billion), South Asia (about 0.610 billion), and East Asia (about 0.195 billion) (Breyer and 
Gerlach 2013). Lack of access to reliable light source or electricity, means productive workday stops when it is dark. 
Most of the rural dwellers use kerosene lamps, which emit poor light, and very dangerous because they give off an 
irritating smoke that blackens the walls and fills up closed rooms. If mistakenly tipped over it can start a fire that could 
burn down houses, particularly in mud-thatched houses, which are commonly found in the rural settlements. 
 
Furthermore, present scheme of provision of electrification to rural area via extension through grid lines of 
transmission did not succeed in the provision of electricity to the numerous population of rural areas in Nigeria and 
the hope that many rural areas will be connected to an electric source in the near future is still not known because even

Conclusions 
 
This study presented the design and economic evaluation of electrifying 77 residential houses, 4 shops, a primary 
school and a primary health centre in rural Dilchidama. The design, optimization and sensitivity results indicated that 
Solar PV technology is a viable means of electrifying Dilchidama due to the electricity production rate and good 
economic prospect in energy investment with a COE at US$ 0.579/kWh. However, when the design considered 
extending grid to the study area and compared it with a Solar PV system technology and Solar PV & diesel generator 
based system, the results indicated that grid extension if adequately supplied is more competitive for the village and 
villages with the same geographical data and terrain and are at a distance of less than 9.99 km and 6.90 km respectively. 
Although, the prices of solar PV components are gradually decreasing, Nigerian government can expand the renewable 
technology market and utilization by providing; loans, subsidies & grants, Feed-in-Tariff, etc. and also making a 
percentage of renewable energy sources into the energy-mix of the country thereby making renewable sources 
becoming more competitive in the near future.

Abstract  
 
Continuous improvement is the cornerstone of business survival as the chase to satisfy the ever-changing market 
demand intensifies in the midst of the reality of global competition. The improvements may be in the product, the 
process or both and can be minor or major changes. This paper presents a proposed roadmap and guideline for the 
product and process re-design when migrating from joining processes to monolithic parts in the production of sheet-
metal components. The research focuses on replacing TIG welding as a joining process with deep drawing to 
produce monolithic components. A hypothetical cylindrical cup of height 56 mm and diameter 100 mm is used as a 
case study and superimposed in the two manufacturing methods and the end product evaluated using simulations. 
The starting sheet material is aluminium 6061 of 2 mm thickness. The results show a minimum weight reduction of 
5% for the deep drawn component. The weight reduction also results in corresponding cost reduction. A five-step 
roadmap with specific work packages is proposed for smooth migration. The proposed steps are product redesign, 
process design, tool design, tool manufacture and product manufacture.

1. Introduction 
A clear strategic roadmap is required before any major product or process changes are adopted for continuous 
improvement. This enables companies to plan the sequence of steps and all the activities that will lead to complete 
changeover to the new product and process. In this way the potential risks are dealt with at the planning stage and 
the possible gains of the changeover will be realised. In this research a strategic roadmap for replacing a Tungsten 
Inert Gas (TIG) Welding process with the deep drawing process in order to produce monolithic (one-piece) 
components. Monolithic parts completely eliminate or reduce the need for joining processes as well as the associated 
resources and costs leading to resource efficient production methods (Allwood, Ashby, Gutowski, & Worrell, 2013). 
The use of monolithic parts has become an option for many manufacturers as they try to reduce the number of parts. 
In the automobile industry processing time has reduced by over 50 % in some cases (Boothroyd, Dewhurst, & 
Knight, 2011). Replacing TIG welding with deep drawing results in reduction in raw materials input into the 
manufacturing process and in turn reduces the weight of the product as well, weight reduction brings enormous 
advantages to the automotive industry like savings on fuel (Mazahery, Habibnejad-korayem, & Takrouri, 2019). 
Other notable benefits of producing deep drawing include the increased strength of the components due to strain 
hardening during drawing (J. Liu, Tan, Jarfors, Aue-u-lan, & Castagne, 2010). Parts made from deep drawing thus 
have a higher strength to weight ratio. However, in order to realise the benefits of switching over to deep drawing 
from TIG welding a clear roadmap is required and the potential benefits need to be quantified to give an objective 
insight of the envisaged new process.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, there is a lot of potential for the replacement of TIG welding with monolithic components produced 
by sheet metal forming through deep drawing. As the production volumes increase at times the TIG welding 
becomes slower especially when done manually. The research achieved a reduction in weight of at least 5 % for the 
deep drawn component used in the simulation. The weight reduction is desirable in saving resources hence also 
reduces the cost of producing the product. The deep drawing process also has 80% shorter cycle times compared to 
TIG welding and there is potential to benefit from economies of scale. A five-step roadmap is proposed for the 
migration from TIG to deep drawing. The steps involved are product redesign, process design, tool design, tool 
manufacture and product manufacture. It is recommended that the steps be carried out concurrently in order to 
minimise the migration time. Incorporating life cycle thinking through out the stages will ensure sustainability.

Abstract  
 
United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and 
modern energy for all. Sub Saharan Africa has an abundance of natural renewable energies as in solar and large 
scale hydroelectric resources. These resources remain untapped due to the general absence of a synchronous and 
interconnected electrical power system.  For the present day, off grid individual load solutions permeate the region 
and the continental lag remains in the industrial and postindustrial economies. Without dispatchable and economic 
electricity, sub-Saharan Africa will be stranded and her millions of inhabitants will be destined to poverty.  A clean 
energy resource to power up national and regional economies and to harness the continents massive renewable 
energy potential is nuclear energy. The paper discusses the issues which have limited the current nuclear 
technologies from being deployed and why the prospect of modern Small Modular Reactors to meet this need would 
seem appropriate. The paper recommends a charter for the large scale introduction of nuclear technology to Sub 
Saharan Africa; incorporating policy, regulatory practices, design standards and people development.

1. Introduction 
United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable 
and modern energy for all.  Agenda 2030 further defines the key expectations as follows: 
“7.a By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and 
technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel 
technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology; and  
7.b By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable 
energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island 
developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective 
programmes of support.”  
 
Sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of South Africa, comprises a collection of least developed 
countries and landlocked developing countries.  Given an abundance of renewable energy as in sunshine 
and concentrated large scale hydro potential as in the proposed Inga Complex on the Congo River, Sub 
Saharan Africa lacks the classic synchronous power supply system to harness the vast potential renewable

555",,"This approach would only be credible where the inherent design of the plant lead to confidence that the 
maximum nuclear damage it could cause was sensibly insurable. This would lead to a premium of plant 
safety features such as the HTGRs with TRISO fuel demonstrate. 
 
4.5 
Decommissioning Provision 
Another key issue for deployment of SMRs in Africa would be the acceptability of the decommissioning 
funds.  While there are many different approaches to this in the current world nuclear industries it would 
be most straight forward for the establishment of individual decommissioning funds for each nuclear 
installation, funded over its operating life. This could be modelled on the US practice where the fund is a 
legally separate item which is therefore not, as in some situations, a provision on the balance sheet of the 
operating company.  It might even be appropriate for the decommissioning fund to be fully funded at 
plant start up, with investment returns on the fund that are greater than inflation being returned to the 
operating company as income. 
 
4.6 
Waste and Spent  Fuel Management 
The current international approach for the management of nuclear waste and spent fuel is that it is a 
purely national responsibility and it is not allowed to “export” (or “import”) nuclear waste for final 
disposal.  This approach was largely put in place to avoid third world countries becoming “dumping 
grounds” for first world waste.  It is reasonable approach for countries with a substantial nuclear program 
but may be an economic challenge for countries with a very small program.  For low and intermediate 
waste it may be reasonable to establish a near surface disposal site on a country by country basis, as the 
overhead costs are not severe and the facility may only be required at plant decommissioning. The issue 
of a final repository for Spent Fuel is, however, much more challenging.  There is a very large fixed cost 
for establishing the repository facilities which are considerable and which would distort the economics 
substantially.  Given that the SMR design should aim to store all the spent fuel from its operating life on 
the site this issue would only be needed at end of plant life but must be included in the costing model 
from the beginning.  A high-level repository establishment can be in the region of $2bn (the establishment 
cost of the US Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in the 1990s).  In the context of the overall WIPP 
lifetime costs of some $20bn including operations this is reasonable, but to support a nuclear reactor plant 
that may have a capital cost of $1.5bn (say 300MW at $5000/kWe) it is clearly unacceptable. It therefore 
would become important to accept a regional Spent Fuel Disposal facility.  It may be logical to consider 
the future South African spent fuel disposal site which is already included in Koeberg’s spent fuel 
provisions. The policy on the final disposal of Spent Fuel as well as the low and intermediate waste needs 
to be included at the beginning of the projects and it would seem logical to approach this on a regional 
basis. 
 
The work ahead is vast, detailed and complex. Nuclear energy will require a substantial investment in 
human resources.  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) would need to be 
cultivated in the early years of primary and secondary schooling; to be followed through with 
undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications across a multitude of faculties and national research 
laboratories. The wealth of nuclear energy vests with its people; society will be the beneficiary.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the everyday lives of people and businesses around the world, and a field 
greatly affected has been the United States pharmaceutical supply chain. This global pandemic has made preexisting 
issues within the supply chain’s structure more glaring than before with people’s lives being at risk. Demand for drugs 
is at least equivalent and likely higher in this current health setting. If companies are not providing the appropriate 
medications to their customers, then it can be the difference between life and death for some. To investigate the 
challenges behind the supply chain, the analysis was focused on problems before COVID-19, such as the lack of 
transparency, burdensome regulations, and logistical issues due to improper distribution. An investigation on how 
COVID-19 has impacted each specific part of the pharmaceutical supply chain leads to a discussion on what 
recommendations could be implemented to fix the presented issues. The U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain is a 
complex, global system that has become increasingly more challenging to navigate because of COVID-19. Shortages 
need to be mitigated, and the inevitability of a future vaccine for the virus needs to follow a proper logistics and 
distribution model to ensure its success.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Background 
 
The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is one of the nation’s most valued industries and is one with global affluence. As of 
2019, the U.S. has increased its annual spending on pharmaceuticals to more than $370 billion. That is a growth of 
nearly $10 billion, an approximately 2.5% increase from 2018’s benchmark (HealthLeaders, 2019). Diving deeper 
into the spending, the U.S. represents 30 to 40 percent of the global market in per capita prescription drug spending 
(Ellis, 2019). The U.S. plays a sizable role in this supply chain, contributing a large amount of spending. 
 
Not only is the US a big spender in the pharmaceutical industry, but its heavy regulations on the sector complicate 
matters. There is a lack of transparency among all parties involved in the supply chain that, in times of crisis, can 
cause significant disruption and emphasize the flaws within it. Lack of standard operating procedures and shortcuts 
from drug manufacturers overseas have caused the U.S. problems with drug shortages and the quality of the product 
to suffer. A situation like the COVID-19 pandemic has caused mass drug shortages for people in the U.S. Th COVID-
19 pandemic has even forced the U.S. to bend the rules with some of their suppliers on the quality of their drugs. Drug 
manufacturers previously listed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as not meeting standards and 
regulations have been now certified to meet the demand by the public due to the pandemic. The lack of drug 
manufacturers meeting these standards and regulations to produce quality drugs has been the product of a messy 
supply chain that has not been cleaned up properly. The COVID-19 pandemic is now exhibiting the flaws of the 
pharmaceutical supply chain. It will hopefully lead to a realization of the problems that must be fixed in an industry 
that affects the well-being of human lives.

565","new fear has spawned in its place. Countries across the globe are now turning their attention to their dependence on a 
few other countries to produce their pharmaceuticals, namely China and India. These two dominate as the main 
suppliers of APIs and found themselves caught in the heat as closures of their manufacturing facilities panicked their 
customer countries. Though the situation was handled quickly enough to continue production and avoid mass 
shortages before they could happen, the U.S. will likely implement initiatives in an attempt to balance the production 
of crucial pharmaceuticals across the globe and reduce the risk of a shortage in the future events. 
 
4.2 Distributor and Pharmacy Contingency Planning 
 
Even though the production of pharmaceuticals weathered the storm, there are still issues within the distribution and 
retail sectors of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Transportation companies have felt considerable hits to their 
workforce as the virus disallows many to show up for work and discourages others from continuing to work despite 
their current good health. Without these transportation operators, drugs cannot be distributed to the pharmacies. 
Additionally, pharmacies are sprinting to create and implement safe methods of getting medications to their customers. 
Moving forward, contingency plans for disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic must address these problems. A 
“Plan B” for transportation companies that ensures the safety and health of their drivers as they transport drugs is 
critical, as is the implementation by pharmacies of safe product pick-up methods like contactless delivery. Each of 
these plans will be necessary as a vaccine for the virus is released and ready for distribution throughout the U.S. 
 
4.3 Advice for Customers 
 
In realizing the reality of the current pandemic, customer buying habits evolved into panic-buying, leaving those who 
did not partake without any supply for themselves. Though customers cannot control the choices of anyone other than 
themselves, some actions can be taken before a disaster occurs to increase their safety throughout it. A customer may 
consider keeping a reasonable, additional amount of their critical drugs on-hand. If already amid a disaster and the 
customer was not able to take that precaution, they may work with their doctor or pharmacist to determine an 
alternative. Specifically, in the case of COVID-19, the customer should opt for obtaining their medication through 
methods that decrease their contact with others, such as ordering online or over the phone and requesting a contactless 
delivery to their home. 
 
5. Conclusion and Moving Forward 
 
The COVID-19 global pandemic has highlighted several glaring problems that, when considered together, amount to 
a high risk for failure in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Though there has not yet been a critical shortage of drugs 
due to manufacturer shutdowns, the act of the shutdowns themselves may be enough to push the United States to 
reconsider its dependency on just a few countries to supply the necessary materials and labor to produce drugs for 
U.S. citizens. To make matters even riskier, those same few countries lack communication and transparency regarding 
their processes, leading to quality issues that further constrain the supply available. Within the transportation and 
delivery sections of the supply chain, there has been a massive struggle to meet the needs of customers, with so many 
service workers falling ill or refusing to work under the current pandemic conditions. Once the drug a customer needs 
becomes available, the customer must be provided with and accept the opportunity to receive their products safely 
without unnecessary risk of exposure to infection. All agents within the pharmaceutical supply chain must 
acknowledge these problems, and their accompanying risks, as well as, consider the proposed recommendations if 
they are to protect the supply chain and allow for continued growth in the future.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between renewable energy and economic growth 
which is determined by the gross domestic product per capita regarding some of the Mediterranean countries. This 
study uses data from some Mediterranean countries with medium to high energy consumption levels in 1990–2015 
(France, Italy, and Turkey) to ascertain and analyze the multiple effects of renewable energy consumption on 
economic process. The applied math analysis relies on descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and divulges that all the 
variables area unit are related; this means, on the long term, a correlation between the dependent variable quantity of 
gross domestic product and the independents variables of renewable energy consumption and energy consumption. 
Moreover, the results show that there's a better correlation between RES’ consumption and the economic growth of 
some countries that has an upper gross domestic product than with those of lower GDP. The obtained results area 
unit is consistent with different papers reviewed during this study. Analysis results show the long run linear impact 
of energy consumption on economic process.

1. Introduction 
The subject of the study is in line with the objectives set by the leaders of Euro-Mediterranean countries within the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 1 geared toward reducing the energy consumption and achieving an 
identical share of renewable energy within the final energy consumption. Thus, increasing energy potential, ought to 
result in lower energy demand per unit of value within the economy, a cut of gas emissions and the identification of 
long-term solutions to cut back the dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. The enhanced energy prices alongside 
the strategic goals undertaken globally, within the space of pollution reduction, have contributed to a lot of 
elaborated study between renewable energy consumption and the economic process. In several Mediterranean 
economies, many measures have been taken towards the energy consumption: cut back pollution by reducing the 
using of energy and stimulating the economic activity. In general, the industrial sector of a country is more energy 
intensive compared to the service sector, thus the service sector increases economic growth in the context of a

The model is developed in MATLAB and reflect the impact of energy production and renewable energy on GDP at 
the long-run equilibrium. 
 
In France, at an accuracy rate of 92%, an increase of 1% fluctuation in renewable energy in total final energy 
consumption led to 10.44% increase in the GDP Growth of France. 
 
In Italy, at an accuracy rate of 83%, an increase of 1% fluctuation in renewable energy in total final energy 
consumption led to 6.77% increase in the GDP Growth of Italy. 
 
In Turkey, at an accuracy rate of 97%, an increase of 1% fluctuation in total energy production led to 1.58% increase 
in the GDP Growth of Turkey.  
 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
On one hand, the transformation of latest energy consumption can often bring economic costs, thereby leading 
to a negative impact on economic process. On the opposite hand, economic value often disappears, thereby leading 
to the positive impact of the transformation of latest energy consumption on economic process.  
The results of the study can be summarized as follows: 
Renewable energy contributes effectively to achieving sustainable development. Its exploitation by humans does not 
have any negative impact on the environment and this contributes to its preservation, which confirms the basic 
premise. Countries with a high level of human development are also among the countries that use the most 
renewable energy, compared to those with less use. There is a direct relationship between each of the GDP and 
renewable energy consumption (REC). Where the increase in renewable energy consumption by 1% led to an 
increase of GDP by 10% in France, as well as reflect the value of p.value which is 0.92 for the significance of the 
relationship between the two variables.  
A quantity of factors has an impact on the GDP growth estimated in this study, such as investment in 
renewable strength deployment, fossil fuel production and trade, and electrical energy prices. Investments 
particularly influence GDP growth the foremost, triggered by the capital-intensive nature of renewable energy 
technologies compared to different choices. Most of the complete fee of renewable energy plants is used for the 
upfront funding on physical assets, as hostile to gasoline expenditure throughout the lifecycle of the plant. As the 
demand for electricity grows, proportionate investments in strength infrastructure will be needed. To keep away 
from lock-in with unsustainable energy systems, and recognize the potential benefits, energy sector investments 
should increasingly be directed towards renewable energy. Investment in renewable energy throughout all sectors 
must be scaled up substantially. The power region will proceed to attract most of the new investment. This report 
estimates the GDP based on renewable energy consumption for each of the 3 cases; as nicely as the capital costs, 
discount rates and different parameters required for every technology in each country and year to be able to achieve 
the growth needed.

Abstract 
 
Background – In order to withstand an increasing pressure of competition, to provide customers with constantly 
improved quality and innovations, while at the same time securing the financing from operating businesses, processes 
have to be optimized and non-value-added activities have to be eliminated. In this context, recent digital technologies 
promise significant improvements in managing complexity. Congruently, administrative power must be continuously 
increased to keep overheads low. Lean administration offers this potential. 
Purpose – This paper contributes to the discussion on the relationship of lean administration and digitalization, and 
whether companies should excel in either first before drawing to the other. 
Methodology/Approach – In order to address the research question, expert interviews have been chosen as a 
qualitative approach. Process managers and Lean experts of companies from different industrial sectors were 
interviewed to investigate the relation of lean administration and digitalization.  
Findings – Results show that on the one hand lean administration can profit from advances in digitalization, while on 
the other hand lean administration supports the digital transformation. Experts attest both a symbiotic relationship. 
Furthermore, a correlation between a company’s lean and digital maturity is observed. Rather than either of both is a 
prerequisite for the other, they rely on similar organizational conditions and requirements.

582","5. Conclusion 
 
Digitalization makes a key contribution to the sustainable implementation of lean administration. Just like lean 
administration supports digitalization. In Figure 1 most companies are situated along a diagonal line that illustrates a 
positive correlation between lean administration and digitalization. A vertical intercept of approximately 2.5 proposes 
that digital maturity is a prerequisite for lean administration. However, further development of both should ideally be 
a parallel process, rather than a sequential one. Interpreting the shift one has to keep in mind that although lean 
management is well established in production it has been neglected within an administrative setting in the past. Most 
approaches to increase efficiency in an office are to be attributed to the introduction of individual digital technologies. 
Experts agree that the lack of success of these work-place oriented measures are due to a lack of structure and a missing 
comprehensive approach. A circular relationship between lean administration and digitization is regarded as a suitable 
starting point to address this difficulties. As a starting point company’s have to focus on customers, clearly defining 
customer-value-adding targets of lean and digital efforts and in a second step aligning these with the corporate strategy. 
Finally, core processes are mapped out to reveal inefficiencies and complexities to be addressed. An already optimized 
process can be further improved and made more efficient with digital innovations. The transparency gained also 
increases the acceptance of the measures. In this context, digital technologies often open up new ways to improve 
performance, radically replacing existing processes.  
With regard to the implementation, both build on similar organizational conditions. Rather than either of both being a 
prerequisite for the other, a symbiotic relationship is attested. A parallel approach of implementation helps to 
overcome difficulties and to exploit synergies. Successful companies carefully plan both within a comprehensive 
strategy to design efforts of substantial value, rather than overhasty shooting for stars. In order to combine both 
approaches in a meaningful way, the focus must be placed on the customer as well as the employees working with the 
digitized and optimized processes, daily. The link in this relationship are organizational requirements and culture. 
These findings should be taken into account when building models and frameworks for lean and digital 
transformations in an office setting.

Abstract 
 
The most vital phenomenon in machining is optimization, as it defines the continuous improvement in the quality of 
the material. Cutting fluid becomes, nowadays, an important part of turning because it assists to minimize the 
mechanical and thermal losses. Minimization of Chip Reduction Coefficient and optimization of the cutting 
parameters contribute to protect losses of productivity and to reduce the production cost. This work investigates the 
optimized cutting parameters in dry turning and wet turning of AISI 201 stainless steel work piece using cemented 
carbide tool and finds the minimum chip reduction coefficient and compares the results of the two conditions. It 
reveals that the cutting fluid shows a significant effect on the machining and reduces the chip reduction coefficient. 
Statistical analysis ANOVA shows that Depth of Cut and Spindle speed is the most influential factor in wet and dry 
turning respectively. It uses Multiple Regressions to predict the output and to find the correlation between 
parameters. Genetic Algorithm is used to select the optimal values of cutting parameters and find the minimized 
Chip Reduction Coefficient. The optimized cutting parameters from Genetic Algorithm for both dry and wet turning 
are spindle speed of 650 rev/min, feed rate of 0.12 mm/rev and depth of cut of 0.4 mm. The minimum chip reduction 
coefficient for dry turning is 1.067651 and for wet turning is 1.020852.

1. Introduction 
The purpose of Turning is to create rotational parts by removing extra materials from the performed parts. It is the 
most important and widely used machining process to shape metals, because the working conditions and 
environment can be varied. Productivity and expense are the key focus for any company to be profitable. An 
organization wants to increase the productivity and reduce the manufacturing cost. In turning process, higher values 
of cutting parameters may improve productivity but it also increases the risk of damage in surface quality and tool 
life (Sharma et al., 2007). Orthogonal and oblique cutting are the two basic types of cutting using a single point 
cutting tool. The cutting edge of the tool, in orthogonal cutting, remains normal to the direction of feed and cutting 
velocity and the direction of chip flow velocity is normal to the cutting edge of the tool (Kaushish, 2013). In most of 
the machining processes, chips are obtained as: i) Continuous chip, ii) Continuous chip with buildup edge, iii) 
Discontinuous chips. The chip thickness (a2) usually becomes larger than the uncut chip thickness (a1) in machining 
because of compression of the chip ahead of the tool, frictional resistance to the chip flow and lamellar sliding. Chip 
reduction coefficient (ξ) is defined as the ratio of the chip thickness after and before cut, as shown in the equation 
(1).  
 
ξ= a2/a1

591",,"speed, 0.12 mm/rev of feed rate, 0.4 mm of depth of cut are the optimized cutting parameters for both dry and wet 
turning. The values of minimum Chip Reduction Coefficient are 1.067651 and 1.020852 for dry turning and wet 
turning respectively while the predicted values are 1.079 and 1.021 respectively. The minimum value of Chip 
Reduction Coefficient obtained from GA is higher for the dry turning. 
 
As future work, nose radius, tool tip temperature etc. can be taken into account as the input parameters and surface 
roughness, surface temperature, cutting force, tool wear etc. can be considered as the response parameters. Different 
level of cutting parameters can also be taken. The experiment can be carried out with different types of cutting fluids 
(water based, oil based or water-oil mixed and so on).

Abstract  
 
The verdict is that South Africa is not on track for a 1.5°C world. To achieve the Paris Commitment, South Africa 
needs to reduce its emissions to below 360 MtCO2e by 2030; to below 231 MtCO2e by 2050. In the next two 
decades (2020-2040), the global community will experience titanic shifts in the energy, transportation, buildings, 
industry, agricultural and land use sectors of the economy.  To track the progress toward the achievement of the 
national commitments, one would have to measure performance on climate change mitigation and adaptability 
strategies according to International Standards.  The International Standard Organization is yet to pronounce on a 
specific international standard on carbon emission management.  A study is in progress to make a new and original 
contribution as part contribution to the global body of knowledge in performance management of carbon emissions. 
The paper presents a SMART performance management system, one that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, 
Realistic and Timely.  The idea is to define the SMART key performance indicators that could be incorporated into 
selected and existing international standards; such that a full case study using South African data; including 
adaptability and resilience especially in terms of the projected future times, could be developed.

1. Introduction 
In accordance with decision 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework on Climate Change, South Africa’s Department of Environmental Affairs (2011, 2016, 2017, 
2019) tabled its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) such that it will embark on 
bending the curve of South Africa’s GHG emissions towards a peak, plateau and decline trajectory 
range. South Africa aspires for a low-carbon economy whilst it notes that an inclusive and just 
transition requires time.  South Africa is investing in accelerated energy efficiency and reduced 
emissions intensity programs across the entire economy and is embarking on a full transformation of 
its energy sector.  South Africa has plans to replace the inefficient fleet of ageing coal-fired power 
plants with clean and high efficiency technology that includes renewable and clean nuclear energy.  
In a presentation to the Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs (SA Parliament, 2016), 
Figure 1 illustrates the bend from business as usual to that of full compliance to the Paris 
Agreement, as presented by Eskom, the National Electricity Utility of South Africa.

Nationally Determined Contribution  
South Africa like any developing country is facings climate change challenge with overriding priorities of 
poverty and inequality. Addressing both these priorities require creating decent employment, sustainable  
economic  development, improving  basic  education, health  and  social  welfare and many  other  basic  
needs. With all these priories South Africa is facing challenges of energy shortages that is heavily 
dependent on coal and liquid fuels, with inefficient coal fired power station nearing their end of life. NDC 
needs to be understood in this context.  Table 3 illustrates the South Africa’s Intended National 
Determined Contribution submitted to the UNFCCC in September 2015. It covers adaptation and 
mitigation as well as finance and investment requirements.  
 
Mitigation 
• 
The M-INDC takes the form of a peak, plateau and decline GHG emissions 
trajectory range starting in 2020, with emissions by 2025 and 2030 in a range 
between 398 and 614 MtCO2e. 
Adaptation 
• 
Goal 1: Develop and operationalise a National Adaptation Plan 
• 
Goal 2: Mainstream climate considerations in national development at all 
government levels 
• 
Goal 3: Build the necessary institutional capacity for climate change response 
planning and implementation 
• 
Goal 4: Develop an early warning, vulnerability and adaptation monitoring 
system for key climate vulnerable sectors and geographic areas 
• 
Goal 5: Develop a vulnerability assessment and adaptation needs framework 
by 2020 
• 
Goal 6: Communicate past investments in adaptation for education and 
awareness and for international recognition 
Finance and investment 
requirements 
• 
Indicative scales of finance and investment are required for both adaptation 
and mitigation 
• 
Key programmes that will have to be scaled up 
 
Table 3: South Africa’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) 
 
In October 2019, RSA cabinet approved Integrated Resource Plan (IRP 2019). The plan marks a major 
shift in energy policy away from coal towards renewables, which is remarkable for a coal-dominated 
country like South Africa. The IRP maybe sufficient for South Africa to reach the upper end of the target 
range for GHG emissions in 2030 contained in its Nationally Determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris 
climate agreement.  According to CAT, Implementing the IRP2019 will enable South Africa to achieve 
its 2030 NDC target. However Climate Action Tracker (CAT) continues to rate South Africa “Highly 
insufficient” based on the upper end of the NDC range. They expect that South Africa’s GHG emissions 
in 2020 will be 9% to 11% lower than 2019 due to an unprecedented slowdown of domestic economic 
activity and international trade. 
 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations 
The development of a climate change performance management framework based on ISO 31000 has 
commenced. The complexity of climate change requires a multifaceted approach. The proposed 
framework will need to be internationally acceptable, be standardized in data collection, analysis, 
measurement and reporting and have measurable impacts on national economic growth, and performance 
management strategies. Climate change is equivalent to poverty; it is man-made. The exercise of 
measuring and reporting is to cease on GHG emissions as emanating from human activity of 
industrialization and mass production.

 Abstract 
Entrepreneurship courses can be vital in facilitating an entrepreneurial ecosystem among Universitas Negeri Medan 
students. An entrepreneurial ecosystem can be formed because the university itself has students from various 
disciplines who are allowed to have a meeting of demand and supply. This dynamic offers collaboration between 
entrepreneurs by creating a value chain between them to grow up together. This study will focus on developing 
standard manuals related to the achievement of Universitas Negeri Medan entrepreneurship learning, namely, 
determining the situation of entrepreneurial learning practices in initiating students to establish their own business 
through entrepreneurship courses. This study uses a quantitative approach to survey research methods. The sample 
in this study were Universitas Negeri Medan students using a questionnaire online. The questionnaire was filled in 
by contacting the respondents via cellular phone as many as 108 respondents. The results show that of the seven 
question items as a whole still do not answer the needs of students in creating and developing entrepreneurial 
learning practices in initiating students to have the ability to be entrepreneurial independently.

Radam et al, 2008, Indarti and Rostiani, 2008). Entrepreneurship is seen as being able to animate 
transactions of goods and services as well as absorb unemployment in a country. At the macro 
level, according to data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises, 
small entrepreneurs who are grouped into MSMEs alone have been able to contribute to GDP by

Abstract  
 
The Stirling engine was an industrial one invention to address the problem of constant explosions of 
steam engine boilers due to excessive pressures.  The Stirling engine converts heat energy to torque. The 
salient safety feature is based on temperature difference rather than pressure difference of the  steam 
engine. The efficiency of the Stirling engine vests with its geometric and thermodynamic properties such 
that under ideal conditions, the thermodynamic efficiency equals that of a Carnot cycle.  The Stirling 
engine operates on a closed thermodynamic cycle. The thermodynamics of the system pertains to the 
working fluids and heat transfers whilst, the geometric design incorporates the configuration, crank 
mechanism, sizing and layout. The efficiency of the Stirling engine decreases with an increase in cylinder 
size, thus multiple smaller cylinders systemically connected to a single crank shaft are more efficient than 
a bigger single cylinder engine.  This paper reviews the design of a Stirling engine to be powered by a 
laboratory concentrated solar energy heat source. The idea emanated from Nasa’s 10kW KRUSTY 
nuclear powered electrical generator that was designed for the Mars expedition.

Abstract 
 
Industry 4.0, Industrie 4.0, or I4.0 is revolutionising the working of systems and also enabling them to interact 
among themselves. Incorporating the new technologies will not bring about a complete realisation of benefits if done 
in a disaggregated manner or only a few elements of the supply chain. This study looks into the supplier side of 
manufacturers to support the development of integrated value chains. The study aims at providing a holistic 
framework to evaluate the maturity levels of Industry 4.0 across manufacturers and suppliers, which can then be 
used in the process of selection. The study also incorporates an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) evaluation of the 
dimensions to define their priorities, which will provide the weightages to arrive at an overall maturity level of 
Industry 4.0 at these entities (Manufacturer and suppliers). 
 
Keywords 
Industry 4.0, Supplier selection 
 
1. Problem Description 
Industry 4.0 can be defined as a manufacturing system that is integrated, optimised, and inter-operable and utilises 
algorithms, big data, and other new technologies. Industry 4.0 involves the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical 
System (CPS), information and communications technology, Enterprise Architecture, and Enterprise Integration. 
However, the effectiveness of Industry 4.0 cannot be seen only by the manufacturer. It must be developed across the 
supply chain with various business partners. One of them is the suppliers. The current process of supplier selection 
involves various factors such as costs, resiliene, sustainability, and the like, but a perspective of Industry 4.0 is 
lacking. A framework to evaluate the maturity levels of different aspects of Industry 4.0 can not only help evaluate 
any entity of its terms with Industry 4.0 but can also help in finding compatible business partners (in our case, 
suppliers). This is the area this paper wishes to delve into. 
 
2. I4.0 Technologies 
For a supplier to be considered Industry 4.0 compliant, according to Frank et al. (2009), Industry 4.0 technologies 
integration should be considered on the following dimensions: 
i. 
Supply Chain 
ii. Working 
iii. Manufacturing 
iv. Product 
 
The details of each of these dimensions and their respective technologies and maturity levels are discussed in detail 
in the following sub-topics.

621","6.  Discussion and Conclusion 
It can be observed that supplier S2 has a higher maturity level as compared to S1, which can help the manufacturer 
in selecting S2 if they require a supplier with a higher I4.0 maturity level. 
The proposed framework is useful to determine the implementation level of Industry 4.0 across all partners of the 
supply chain.  It enables a holistic evaluation across the dimensions viz. smart supply chain, smart working, smart 
manufacturing, and smart product. Besides, AHP is used for the prioritisation of the identified dimensions, which 
helps in arriving at a final score. This framework not only helps in the calculation of maturity of Industry 4.0 
implementation at supply chain partners but also for the selection of suppliers with the optimum maturity in Industry 
4.0.

Abstract  
 
In today’s highly competitive business environment every company thrives to increase its overall production and 
profit. Maintenance related costs contribute to some of the major expenses related to running a business. In other 
words, maintenance activities share significant operating costs in an organisation. Reducing maintenance costs 
without affecting the plant performance improves the profitability of an organisation. Reduction in maintenance 
costs can be effectively achieved by means of reducing the non-value-added costs and activities involved in the 
maintenance process. Lean thinking can be incorporated into maintenance activities through application of its 
principles, practices and tools. In this paper, preventive maintenance activities related to a coal handling plant at a 
thermal power station are assessed using value stream mapping (VSM) tools in order to identify maintenance wastes 
and to demonstrate the association between maintenance wastes and the Lean Manufacturing tools. The current state 
map revealed that non-value adding activities contributed to 16.25% of the total maintenance time. Improving the 
status quo would see the overall plant availability including the generating plant improve by 0.158%. Although this 
appears insignificant, the loss in generation due to unavailability of the coal plant has an impact. The power plant 
generates an average of 90 GWh a year and a 0.158% plant availability will translate to a gain of 142 200kWh 
annually translating to USD14220 at a cost of USD0.10 per kWh

1. Introduction 
In order to attain world class performance, companies strive to improve their equipment availability, overall 
productivity, safety and product quality. Many manufacturers are turning to lean manufacturing as a tactic to 
augment profits and cut unnecessary expenses. Companies are reducing the non-value-adding activities in all forms 
for each and every process in the entire organization. The maintenance function plays a pivotal role in the 
achievement of the strategic objectives of an organisation (Fraser, 2014). The maintenance process serves the 
production facilities to ensure high productivity. Maintenance refers to proactive and reactive activities performed in 
order out to retain an equipment or a facility to the acceptable operating conditions according to Faccio, Persona, 
Sgarbossa, and Zanin (2014) in Mostafa, Lee, Dumrak, Chileshe, and Soltan (2015). This implies that the primary 
function of maintenance is to make machined reliable and safe. When this happens the quality of output of the 
machine increases and the value of the asset is also preserved. Previously the maintenance function has been 
considered as expense to the organisation and was relegated to reactive functions that are usually executed under the 
emergency situations such as machine breakdown. Nowadays maintenance is being recognised as an investment that 
requires a proactive strategic element of revenue generation for organisations. According to Khazraei and Deuse 
(2011), twenty-first management now understands the role of maintenance in critical elements of production plants 
such as product quality, safety requirements, and operating budget levels. Lean tools can be employed improve the 
productivity of maintenance activities by reducing wastes in maintenance. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and 5 S 
are the most efficient tools of lean thinking and have proved their value in increasing process transparency and 
visibility (Klotz, Horman, Bi, and Bechtel, 2008) and its benefits in reducing lead time and inventory in different 
areas (Abdulmalek, Rajgopal, and Needy, 2006). VSM has been used as a practical method of visualising the 
condition and interaction of actions (Wenchi, Wang, Wang, and Chong, 2015). Maintenance costs are directly

Maintenance is a critical contributor to progressing towards world-class manufacturing of any organisation. It has 
rapidly grown into a very complex undertaking as technologies, competition, and product characteristics have 
evolved. In order to achieve world-class performance, the maintenance strategies should be linked to manufacturing 
strategies such as the lean concept. Applying an effective maintenance strategy can ensure a high degree of 
utilisation, reliability, and availability of manufacturing facilities especially in a continuous production process. 
VSM and Lean Maintenance provides an opportunity for effective maintenance. Moreover, it promotes the culture 
of continuous improvement aiming at maintenance excellence. Nevertheless, commitment and direct involvement of 
an organisational management along with employee training and teamwork development can be a catalyst to 
accelerate the transformation process. However, Lean Maintenance approach cannot just be a mirror image of a lean 
manufacturing approach because the business dynamics of asset maintenance and those of production are 
fundamentally different. Therefore, it is clear that there is a need to develop an effective process to collectively 
integrate and customise lean thinking into the maintenance with long-term strategic perspective.

Abstract 
Polyurethane foams are found in almost every home, whether in flexible or rigid form, and the demand for this 
product is high since it is a vital product for every home. Thus, there is a need to improve the quality and production 
rate of this valuable product. In this research, simulation and performance evaluation of a mixing and mould unit of 
a batch foam production plant were conducted. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to determine the effect 
of the stirrer in adequate mixing of the foam reactant chemicals, the velocity distribution of the flow through the 
mixer, temperature and flow rate of the product at the outlet of the foam mixing tank. The CFX- solver, on 
completion of the simulation, provided the flow variables. The results obtained at the inlet of the foam mixing tank 
include an average inlet velocity of 0.3m/s, the average inlet pressure of 30,460 Pa, and an average mass flow rate of 
0.000148 kg/s. The temperature of the fluids at the outlet corresponds to 323K showing an increase in the flow rate 
of the fluids after mixing with the mass flow rate of 0.000780 kg/s. Therefore, it was concluded that CFD is a viable 
tool in predicting fluid flow behavior in mixing equipment.

1. Introduction 
 
Polyurethane is one of the most important classes of a special polymer. Ideally, a typical polyurethane may contain 
in addition to the urethane linkages, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ether and other groups. Flexible 
polyurethane foams are one of the most important classes of cellular plastic used in the manufacture of such 
materials as foam mattresses, pillows, furniture, cushioning materials for automobiles, packing, recreation, shoes, 
etc. The research is aimed at using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Simulation of the Mixing and Mould 
Unit of a Mini Foam Batch Production Plant to show the viability of CFD being a viable tool in predicting fluid flow 
behavior in mixing equipment. The objectives of this research include to: study the simulation software (SS) that has 
previously been used for prediction of fluid flow behavior during foam mixing operation in a Batch Production 
Plant; suggest better SS for predicting the fluid flow behavior during mixing operation in a Batch Production Plant; 
show the viability of the SS and conduct performance evaluation of the mixing and mould unit of the batch 
production plant. 
 
2. Review of Literature 
 
The global consumption of foam was estimated to be above 7 million metric tons in 2007 and the average annual 
growth rate is about 5% (Woods 1990, Avar 2008). In general, industries that produce foams use fillers to modify 
the material’s properties in some way to achieve dimensional stability ease of retraction from the mould and service 
density (Saliba et al. 2005, Bartizan et al. 1999). When adding a filler to a polymer to form a conjugated biphasic 
material, the tension applied to the polymeric matrix will be transferred in part to the disperse filler phase since it 
presents properties superior to the pure polymer (Callister 2000). The use of several fillers to achieve improved

640","Another reflection of the effective design of the foam mixing machine is the constriction of the pipe that supplies the 
foam chemicals into the mixing tank. For efficient mixing to occur, there must be high turbulence of the fluids. This 
was improvised in the design by creating a wider inlet trough or funnel to allow inflow of the foam chemicals and 
then constricting the inlet diameter to a smaller size with respect to the trough. This would force the fluids through 
the trough down into the foam mixing tank thereby creating random chaotic fluid movements and disturbances. At 
the point where the inlet trough connects their pipe leading to the mixing tank, there occurs a sudden rise in the 
fluids’ velocity through the pipe. This continues up until the point the fluid enters the foam mixing tank. At that 
point, their velocities drop drastically. However, it can be noticed that the velocity of the fluids’ increases as the 
fluid nears the rotating stirrer’s impeller blades and exit through the outlet (Fig.19). This is due to the kinetic energy 
contributions from the rotation of the stirrer. The average outlet velocity is 2m/s. This also reveals that there’s an 
increase in the flow rate of the fluids after mixing. This is evident from the computed mass flow rate of 0.000780 
kg/s. Thus, it can be concluded that CFD is a viable tool in predicting fluid flow behavior in mixing equipment.

6. Conclusion 
 
The results obtained from the simulation is an exposition and demonstration of the working principle and operation 
of the fluid mixing process. The following results were obtained at the outlet of the foam mixing tank on completion 
of the CFD simulation. They include average outlet velocity of 2.0 m/s, average outlet pressure of 11.46 Pa, average 
mass flow rate of - 0.000780 kg/s (negative sign indicates mass flow out of domain), and average outlet temperature 
of 323 K. Besides, there was an increase in the flow rate of the fluids after mixing. This is evident from the 
computed mass flow rate of 0.000780 kg/s. Thus, it can be concluded that CFD is a viable technique for effective 
prediction of fluid flow behavior in mixing equipment.

Abstract 
 
This study focuses on the development of a mixing and mould system for the production of flexible polyurethane 
foam. Foam is a vital material used in every home and the demand rate of this valuable product has increased over 
the years. It was estimated to be seven million metric tons, with an average growth rate of 5%. Considering this 
factor, there is a need for improvement in the manufacturing process of foams. This research aims at developing a 
standard mixing and moulding unit of a mini foam (petroleum-based) batch production plant. The major components 
of the machine include the electric motor, which is the prime mover of the machine, a mixing tank, baffles, hopper 
through which the reagents are poured into the mixing tank, ball valve, and the mould. The result showed that the 
machine produced a high-quality foam with a moulded foam density of about 0.03g/cm3 although this value was 
dependent on the foam formulation.

1. Introduction  
The current population of Nigeria based on the latest United Nations World Population Estimation is roughly 
187,896,647 as of September 2016, this implies that Nigeria population is equivalent to 2.48% of the total world 
population and is estimated to double that figure by the year 2050 (Worldometer, 2016).  Nigeria population has an 
average growth rate of about 2.6% resulting in an increased in the demand for flexible polyurethane foam in an 
average home. There is hardly any home where polyurethane foam is not used, whether in flexible or rigid form, 
thus mechanization of the production polyurethane foam will be a welcome development. Furthermore, most small-
scale producers of foam have issues with their product because in most cases the mixing of the raw materials is done 
mechanically with stirrer driven by an electric motor, but turned manually into the mould, hence, there is time 
wastage before pouring which can affect the foam formed.  The research is aimed at developing the mixing and 
moulding Unit for a Foam Batch Production Plant, integrating them into a single unit, hence to reduce human 
(operator) effort, processing time as well as the cost of production using suitable engineering materials without 
compromising the efficiency of the machine. The major objective of this study is the development of mixing and 
molding system for easy production of foam. The sub-objectives include to: Study already existing batch production 
plants and look at ways of possible improvement; design and construct the molding and mixing unit using a ball 
valve as the connector, and other locally sourced materials; assemble the various component of the batch production 
plant into a single machine and conduct a performance test on the developed machine.

The estimated density of the foam produced was excluding waste material was evaluated as; 
Experiment 1 
Mass of product = 454.2g 
Volume of product = 13291.2cm3 
Density = 0.034g/cm3 
 
Experiment 2 
Mass of product= 767.7g 
Volume of product = 25474.8cm3 
Density = 0.0301g/cm3 
 
The fabricated machine was tested on two different occasions using the foam formulation as shown in Table 4. The 
graph of foam constituent against quantity produced is presented in Figure 16. Detailed diagram showing the test 
procedure of the developed machine is presented in Figure 17. The agitation process was quite effective with a 
mixing speed of about 5secs. The result from the test formulation was the flexible foam of density of about 
0.03g/cm3. 
 
6. Conclusion 
An efficient batch foaming machine mixing and moulding unit was designed and fabricated. Small scale tests were 
performed on the completed setup and the machine was observed to be very efficient with a mixing time of about 
5secs per set. The fabricated mini foam production plant would be able to meet all basic need of foam users in 
homes, hospitals, hostels and other facilities. Development of larger setup is strongly recommended for future 
research. This would make foam production cheap and high-quality products can be available at an affordable rate. 
Young people can venture into the business of production of quality foams.

Abstract 
This paper unpacks the extent to which rail-network and road-based public transport networks integration exists 
between Gautrain, Rea Vaya, Metrorail and Metrobus within the City of Johannesburg public transport system. A 
case study research design approach that involved an empirical enquiry using spatial and qualitative methods of data 
collection and analysis was used. The case study research approach was used to formulate the study problem for 
detailed investigation, and to gather relevant and accurate information. The key informant interviews and community 
social mapping were used to supplement data collection methods. Data analysis and interpretations were conducted 
using techniques such as main content analysis, focal statistics analysis, and Geographic Information Applications. 
The results reveal that there are some areas where the route networks between the public transport systems are 
integrated. The results indicate that there are limited spaces where networks of urban public transport systems are 
integrated, and large sections of the networks are disconnected with no partnerships and sharing on infrastructure. The 
paper advocates that integrated public transport planning improves a city’s connectivity, providing a better mobility 
service, shorter journeys for the commuters, and brings people and places closer together. The network integration of 
the public transport modes will lead to better-quality service delivery, inter-connectivity of places of economic activity 
and advance quality of life.

1. Introduction  
Over the past decades, the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) together with Gauteng Provincial Government and South 
African National Department of Transport has focused its investments on development of integrated and efficient 
urban public transport systems.  The public transport network efficiency discourse has been towards increasing the 
integration and efficiency of urban public transport modes. This was seen by the formulation of pertinent policies, 
strategies and frameworks that are pursued in the development and operation of integrated and efficient urban public 
transport systems aimed at facilitating the attainment of the so-called smart cities and smart mobility status within the 
city (Risimati and Gumbo 2019; Chakwizira et al 2019; Walters 2013). This status is perceived as the solution towards

right into Rivonia Road, and proceeds left into Fredman Drive, then left into Fifth Street and left to the Rivonia Rea 
Vaya station beside the Sandton Gautrain Station”.  With Rea Vaya, the is adding to the transport modes in Sandton 
Central and improving those already in place.  
 
4. Recommendations  
Integrated public transport planning improves a city’s connectivity, providing a better mobility service, shorter 
journeys for the commuters, and also brings people and places closer together. As part of this, public policy and 
planning actions should consider integrating infrastructures and operations of urban public transport systems and 
create easy connections with non-motorised transport (such as walking and cycling).  Well integrated public transport 
modes will increase their usage by commuters. This paper’s departure point is that as commuters get more value for 
money, they will consider public transport as a more convenient mobility option that private motorized transport. One 
of the main benefits is that integrated transport systems foster social equality, providing access to services, jobs, 
education and entertainment and access to the whole city. Peoples’ use of more sustainable modes of transport can 
reduce congestion, emissions, travel times and, if managed properly, even road accidents. 
 
4.1. Contempt of modal integration for spatial connectivity 
Because different spheres of government have implemented their projects independently in Johannesburg, spatial 
connectivity through multimodal urban public transport networks is still not effectively pursued. This has led to 
creation of modes of public transport which are operationally disintegrated. Even different types of innovative urban 
public transport systems (Gautrain and Rea Vaya) operate independently of other existing forms or modes of urban 
transport. Thus, duplication of multiple modes of public transport in the same geographical area without making any 
difference is inevitable. It should be acknowledged that mini-bus taxis transport most commuters from previously 
disadvantaged communities and therefore should form an integral part of the public transport modal integration. The 
mini-bus taxi industry is still completely disregarded in the current transport innovations, despite them being 
responsible for transporting sizeable numbers of commuters from disadvantaged communities. The previous 
recapitalisation programme did not do justice to the transformation of the mini-bus taxi industry. Instead, public funds 
were spent without even redressing the alarming safety and crime concerns. This was also done without regard for 
modal integration. This continues to be case even with implementation of innovative urban public transport systems 
consistent with the IRPTN national government strategy.  
 
It is evident from the study findings that without an integrated (multi-modal) urban public transport network, spatial 
integration will be hard to attain, regardless of how many technologically advanced modes of public transport are 
introduced. The appropriateness of a mode of public transport for the people and the purpose it serves was found to 
be also essential when devising strategies for modal integration. In this regard, the Gautrain was found to be costly to 
implement, while also having high travel costs. It significantly excludes the urban poor and previously disadvantaged 
communities, thus making its significance limited to connecting major economic nodes for business related trips 
through serving the middle-upper income transport commuting market (Chakwizira 2007). Thus, the need to integrate 
all (innovative and traditional) modes of public transport is encouraged as the backbone of effective functioning of 
economic communities. When integrating varied modes of public transport, it is important to define the purpose of 
each type of public transport in the overall public transport network to ensure improve urban mobility.  For example, 
the Gautrain may be designated to connect major economic nodes, while other modes transport commuters between 
residential and economic or other urban opportunities. A multimodal public transport network will enhance spatial 
connectivity, densification, reduce travel ties and costs and thus enhance efficiency of public transport systems. 
Through modal integration, infrastructure investments will be utilised more effectively to enable comprehensive 
public transport throughout municipal areas instead of unnecessarily duplicating services. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper has deliberated on the spatial patterns of urban public transport systems within the City of Johannesburg. 
Spatial analysis of both forms of innovative urban transport systems (Rea Vaya and Gautrain) and traditional urban 
public transport systems (Metrobus and Metrorail) were conducted. Urban public transport systems spatial 
connectivity was discussed with reference to the effects of urban public transport mobility. this chapter explored the 
extent of routes network integration of Gautrain, Rea Vaya, Metrobus and Metrorail within the Johannesburg urban

systems are integrated, and large sections of the networks are disconnected. In particular, the existing transport 
networks are spatially segregated and there is no partnership between the four modes of public transport since they 
operate independently. The results can further be used as a reference to spot underserved areas by transport and 
estimate the transit demand for planning purposes.

Abstract 
The impact of COVID-19 on life around the world is shocking, and non-profits are not immune to the disruption.  
Unsurprising consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for non-profit organisations (NPOs) are a drops in funding, staff 
and volunteers.  The funding outlook in many NPOs can only be described as ‘rough and scary’.  Even though the 
COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges some opportunities emerged.  Many leaders of NPOs lack 
strategies to build and maintain a financially sustainable organization to continue providing vital services.  Focusing 
on the NPO’s operations strategy, this single longitudinal case study explored strategies the NPO leaders used to 
maintain survivability for sustainability during a general economic downturn caused by COVID-19 pandemic.  Using 
observations and in-depth semi structured interviews, questionnaires and organisation’s records, this study has shown 
that for the NPO under study, working from home was feasible.  However, not all programs and services offered by 
the NPO could be digitalised.  The pandemic, therefore inspired the NPOs to be more agile, to pivot and approach 
issues innovatively.  It also challenged NPOs to look at their operations differently going forward.  While it has been 
difficult in many ways, it also has been positive in adapting their cultures to be more flexible and paperless.  
Partnership is one aspect said to be worth exploring in order to keep staff by sharing employee’s time and cost of 
employment.  The study makes a contribution by revealing the complex sources that cause challenges for NPOs; 
stressing the changing nature of challenges during a pandemic; showing the importance of NPOs’ willingness to adapt; 
and conceptualising with organisational theories/views such as: process view of an NPO; organisational resilience and 
sustainability; performance and change management; resource dependency theory and resource based view.

1. Introduction  
The existence of non-profit organizations (NPOs) has been traditionally explained by the “market failure” theory, thus 
NPOs are established as community solutions to fill the void of market failure (Valentinov, V., 2008).  However, the 
market failures they address are consistent with the motivations of non-profit magnates.  Non-profits have historically 
had a significant impact on society (Benoy, 2018).  They play a vital role in trying to resolve the challenges and 
inequalities within our communities.  In the past decades, the NPO sector has experienced some significant diversity 
and complexity changes as well as growth.  Nonetheless, many NPOs lack strategies to build and maintain a 
sustainable organization to continue providing vital impactful services.  Needless to say, organisations use strategic 
planning to provide a structured process that defines their success and more importantly, that determines their 
operational steps to get there and align resources and staff to achieve the goal in any given time.  A major obstacle to 
strategic planning, is finding the needed time to slow down and focus on the important instead of the urgent.  Strategic 
planning is always important but rarely urgent.  Crafting, revising and updating a strategic plan are valuable exercises 
for a successful non-profit but often these get pushed off for latter.  The current pandemic crisis changed the 
circumstances quickly and radically.  Strategic plans have turned into assets such that those NPOs who had active 
strategic plans in place had a huge advantage towards prioritising resources and providing clarity in decision-making.  
In these uncertain times the plans have become living documents that are agile and flexible.   
Non-profits ordinarily struggle to maintain financial sustainability (Bowman, 2011) and create new pathways to 
accomplish their mission.  While innovation has become a core driver for the success and survival of organizations

680",,"Although in the time of Covid-19, most NPOs have seen donations drop, doors close, and cash reserves decrease and 
generally the pandemic has brought many huge uncertainties, it has also been a time of opportunities.  It has been a 
time to reimagine who and what your organization is about. 
Existing theoretical frameworks could be applied for the purposes of identifying NPO conditions for successful 
adaptation of external variables that threaten the existence of the organisation.  The NPO in this study demonstrated 
the ability to adapt and succeed, regardless of the circumstances.  The NPO strives to do better all the time.  The 
board, the management and existing operations processes of organisation played a major role.   
From the finding of this study, it is possible to understand that if an organisation has a stable structural arrangement, 
appropriate staffing levels, funding, technology and strategic plans then it may have greater capacity to respond and 
adapt to sudden disruptions.  The findings of this study might contribute to positive social change by providing 
information to NPO leaders to help improve operational strategies and sustainability for impact during general 
economic downturns. 
The longitudinal study showed that the NPO was constantly testing their thinking whenever circumstances changed 
and used scenario thinking to develop the capacity to adapt.  For them strategic planning was about setting the 
groundwork for what they will learn along the way.  While it is difficulty for any NPOs to know how local, national, 
or even global events will affect society, the economy, or their own field six months or a year later, the NPO under 
study is navigating the uncertainty caused by COVI-19 with greater confidence by building scenario plans that can 
help them continue to pursue their mission. 
The pandemic has somewhat pushed the NPO under study to plan for the immediate, medium- and long-term?  They 
were able to continue delivering their services because they communicated with clarity, re-evaluated their operations, 
closely monitored cash flows, collaborated for impact and prioritised technology.  The idea of NPOs becoming data 
driven is not necessarily new.  Good data and accompanying analyses give rise to good tactics and ability to weather 
the storms. 
For NPOs to ensure their relevance, it is recommended that: 
• 
NPOs look at their operations differently going forward 
• 
NPOs be more agile to pivot and approach issues innovatively 
• 
NPOs consider exploring partnerships in order to share resources such as staff 
• 
Some of the NPOs programs be digitalised 
Risk assessment, risk mitigation, contingency planning and risk monitoring be accommodated in NPOs. 
There is need to articulate a multi-dimensional framework for measuring and managing NPO effectiveness.  A 
Strategic Flexibility Analysis (SFA) framework can also be used.

Abstract 
There is inadequate and fluctuating supply of ethanol in Zimbabwe, leading to the failure in meeting a constant 20% 
blending ratio of ethanol to unleaded gasoline. Blending the gasoline with ethanol increases the fuel octane rating by 
blending up to 20%. Ethanol production for fuel blending is an economic technique by taking advantage of the starchy 
organic biomass for fermentation and producing ethanol. This work focuses on the production of ethanol from waste 
cotton textile. Waste cotton textile contains 99% cellulose which can be utilised for ethanol production. Experiments 
were carried out in the laboratory to assess (a) the acid and alkaline hydrolysis of the waste cotton textile for cellulose 
conversion to glucose using different concentrations of 2,4,6 and 8M, temperatures of 90,100 and 121⁰C and 1.5atm 
for 1h (b) propagation capability of the yeast pre-fermentation at 28,30 and 32⁰C . The different propagated yeast 
samples were also taken for fermentation at 32⁰C and produced an average of 10% alcohol content which was then 
distilled to produce 85% hydrous ethanol.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the challenges associated with the inventory management system at a 
gypsum plasterboard manufacturing company in South Africa, hereafter referred to as Boardplant. The study is a 
case study that was conducted in the warehouse of Boardplant at a facility in Johannesburg. The facility 
manufactures a wide range of plasterboard products for ceilings and drywall partitioning. The study was conducted 
after the company’s management had raised concerns on the inventory losses and on the management approach that 
was not supporting the strategic goals of the company. The data was collected through interviews and the data 
collection instrument was a questionnaire with open ended questions. Participants were purposively selected from 
the sales, operations and planning functions of the company. Participants had between one to ten years of experience 
in the company. Data was analyzed through thematic approach. It was found out that the company’s processes, 
procedures and records were not adequate to enable proper management of the inventory. Moreover, the warehouse 
was not integrated with the other key functions of the company. Boardplant needs to invest in an integrated 
inventory management system.

689","been put in place to mitigate the inventory challenges currently experienced. Despite benefits of having to use a 
technological advanced ERP to manage inventory, skills and expertise to use the system to its full functionality 
remains a challenge for warehouse inventory controllers. Further to the study, a conclusion has been drawn that lack 
of application of inventory management techniques has resulted in trends of inventory losses namely, 1) Increased 
inventory holding 2) slow moving stock 3) inventory damages and scrapping. Despite the losses, there is one benefit 
of reduction of obsolesce stock seen through application of FIFO/LIFO technique. Literature surrounding inventory 
management done by (Heizer, Munson, Barry, 2017), (Chase & Jacobs, 2018), (Muller, 2011) and (Vrat, 2014b) 
strongly suggest that proper application of inventory management techniques aids in mitigating inventory 
management challenges. Adoption of these techniques can assist the organisation in successfully managing their 
inventory. 
 
The findings from this study are also significant in identifying the need for Boardplant to provide extensive training 
needs on inventory policies to their inventory controllers, findings show that 45% of participants are not 
knowledgeable on inventory policy currently in use as per table 1.6. The study concludes that despite the challenges 
seen on inventory control, Boardplant has a warehouse design advantage to manage inventory efficiently, the 
warehouse is designed  with a WMS in place to support efficient flow of inventory in and out of the warehouse, 
further to conclude, Boardplant need to invest in adequate resources (Skilled IT, and Stuff) to support their inventory 
investment. According to (Sohail & Sheikh, 2018) return of investments of inventory management will come as 
increased margins, supportive employee morale and customer satisfaction. 
 
6. Recommendations 
 
In light of the study findings and conclusions, it is recommended that Boardplant need to improve their inventory 
management practice through efficient use of their inventory management system and policy. Boardplant needs to 
revisit their inventory policy, redesign it while incorporating concepts such as JIT, manufacturing systems, EOQ and 
ABC classification so that their policy can be adaptable to changing customer needs and warehouse practices, this 
concepts will aid with improved management of inventory practices. Resource allocation and training investment 
needs to be party of company strategic development to succeed in investment management.

Abstract 
 
In the modern world, the economy and society are affected by ongoing changes triggered by a multitude of influencing 
factors, e.g., digitalization, (g)localization, and global pandemics. Therefore, industrial engineering education needs 
to focus on the ongoing evaluation and the continuous development of new, respectively adapted, teaching and 
learning approaches to contribute to the continuous development of abilities, skills, and competences of the human 
workforce. Based on the implications of current teaching and learning theories, this paper focuses on the 
conceptualization of the lecture ‘digitalization and digital transformation in metal forming’. As a result, the authors 
present a module-based structure that includes theoretical lectures, practical demonstrations, group discussions, and 
industrial case studies. The developed teaching and learning concept can be used as a reference guideline to contribute 
to professionalization and lifelong learning for the industrial engineering profession.

Introduction 
Industry 4.0 approaches offer a multitude of new concepts and technologies to increase the competitiveness of 
manufacturing enterprises by relying on the basic principles of digital interconnectivity, autonomization, self-control 
of systems, and big-data analysis (Bosch et al., 2017; Woschank and Zsifkovits, 2021). Thereby, the usage of new 
technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, as well as other IT-related innovations, will 
have a significant impact on the many fields of action within a manufacturing enterprise, e.g., on the strategic and 
tactical process optimization, cyber-physical systems, predictive maintenance, hybrid decision support systems, 
production planning and control systems, and the improvement of operational processes (Woschank et al., 2020).  
 
In this context, the systematic evaluation of potential barriers and necessary requirements for a successful 
implementation of Industry 4.0 initiatives indicates a tremendous need for the realignment of current learning and 
teaching approaches in industrial engineering education (Dallasega et al., 2019; 2020; Woschank and Pacher, 2020).

uncertainty throughout the supply chain network. Until the end of 2019, most worldwide 
organizations did not realize the actual need for this type of supply chain model. We all assume 
that materials can freely flow globally, empowering them to the source, produce, and circulate 
items at the least cost areas around the globe. COVID-19 illustrates that many companies are not 
fully aware of the vulnerability of their supply chain relationships to global shocks. Now entire 
industries, start rethinking and transforming their global supply chain model.  
Now we need to focus on a few things. 
 
• The significant challenges facing the industries due to COVID 19 
• 
The need to offset effectiveness with adaptability and versatility in supply chain organize 
a plan 
• 
The need for developing more resilience supply chain model and minimize the negative 
operational and financial impact

 Abstract 
The program for the establishment and management of Village-Owned Enterprises (BUMDESA) is one of the 
strategic steps to create an independent village in accordance with one of the dream priorities, namely building 
Indonesia from the periphery by strengthening regions and villages. However, the implementation of the program is 
considered less than optimal due to implementation barriers. In this regard, this study aims to explore and map 
implementation barriers that hinder the establishment and management of BUMDESA and formulate policy 
recommendations to address these problems. This research is included in the realm of policy research with a 
qualitative approach using data collection techniques, namely semi-structured interviews, observation and document 
collection. The technique of determining informants is purposive with data analysis techniques using interactive 
models and data credibility testing techniques using triagulation. The results of the study explain that the awarding 
of the Tumpatan Nibung village-owned enterprise has been going well and maximizing the existing human 
resources through the concept of implementation barriers. The potential continues to be explored to support the 
process of increasing the income of village-owned enterprises. One of the recommendations given to the village is a 
business unit that matches the demands and needs of the village community.

Abstract 
 
The presence of unwanted waste can constitute a threat on a global scale. This is because waste 
negatively affects human health, wildlife, marine ecosystems and the environment. Plastic wastes pose 
serious problem to the environment. This burden is evident in South Africa due to lack of plastic waste 
solutions as about 10% get recycled.  From reliable studies, up to 34.1% of South Africans are subject 
to open burning, illegal dumping and picking in order to sell plastics to buy back centres. Picking boost 
the income for poorer communities. The rapidly increasing population has underscore the need for 
municipalities to provide effective waste management in growing communities. Apart from the 
increasing need for effective waste management, limited government interventions and legislations can 
limit waste management. This paper attempts to review the current state of both private and public waste 
management practices in South Africa. This highlights the current initiatives and methods of waste 
management as well as the gaps in each initiative. The study use literature review and case study 
approach to analyse the major issues and the effect of growing population on the subsisting waste 
management system. The results highlight suggestions that promises significant benefits in 
transforming and improving the existing management practices.

Introduction 
Plastic wastes are undesirable materials of plastic origin found within the natural environment. The 
presence of these unwanted  materials negatively affects human health and wildlife, these dangers are  
attributed mostly to plastic waste (City of Westminster, 2020). The presence of plastic waste is a global

716","particularly in the rural areas. This is to ensure that the waste is disposed efficiently and safely 
without affecting community members. 
5. As the population is increasing and more communities are developing, priority should be given to 
waste management during development.  
6. The waste management acts should be summarized and more focused on one goal which should be 
made clear to society. This should eliminate any misunderstanding and allow regulatory bodies to 
monitor organizations more effectively. 
7. On a business level, all recycling organizations could play a role in improving plastic waste 
management in South Africa by improving their own recycling processes. For example, 
improvement in efficient production planning and investing in efficient labour and equipment. This 
is to allow for more efficient recycling and recycling a larger quantity of plastics. 
8. Forms of awareness for the entire nation focusing on the most efficient waste management practices 
should be implemented. This can eliminate all inefficient waste management practices. 
9. All future planning on waste management should be done based on future projections on the 
population and improvement of technology. 
 
Conclusion 
This paper has reviewed the current state of plastic waste management in South Africa, government 
legislations, public and private interventions as well as the effect of the escalating population on the 
plastic waste management in South Africa. This paper has provided a comprehensive review on the 
common techniques of waste management and interventions. It has been highlighted that the increasing 
population and increasing consumption of materials has created a burden on the waste management 
system particularly on municipalities. Therefore, current legislations and interventions are no longer as 
effective as before in meeting the waste management needs in South Africa. This is evident in the low 
recycling statistics and the percentage of South Africans that do not have access to safe waste 
management practices. Improvement on waste infrustructure, educating South Africans, and increasing 
availability of waste services is indeed necessary in improving the state of waste management in the 
country.

Abstract 
For any weapon manufacturing company to be competitive globally, it should come up with strategic activities that 
will assist it to manage its technology innovations.  As the world is moving to the fourth industrial revolution, there is 
a need for organisations to continuously be innovative.  Competition in the defense sector is increasing rapidly and 
weapon manufactures need to be proactive and gear up their technology in order to remain globally competitive. This 
paper presents the results of a study that sort to find out how a South African weapon manufacturing company 
strategizes in order to promote innovation among its employees.  A qualitative approach using semi-structured 
interviews was taken.  The results show that most of the weapons produced are in maturity and technology limit phase.  
Additionally, finance and knowledge acquisition have an important role in influencing the innovation activates within 
the company.  Organisational systems and practices as well as innovation targets were found to be major contributors 
to the success/failure of the management of innovation.  The study proposes a frame for managing innovation in a 
defence technology company.

1. Introduction  
Fast technological change is one of the most notable symbols of the recent developments in the economy.  These fast 
changes in technology are promoting generation of knowledge, which in turn forces competition among organisations 
(Bay & Çİl, 2016).  Because of these changes, organisations need to be constantly innovative to remain competitive.  
Rapid and constant changes in processes, technologies and products make innovation as well as innovation 
management be fundamentally important (Bay & Çİl, 2016). 
Cormican & O’Sulliva (2004) specified that it is becoming more noticeable that survivors in this dynamic environment 
will be those organisations that are determined to adopt innovation in order to use and develop new products more 
profitably, efficiently and effectively.  For organisations to be innovative and manage innovation effectively and 
efficiently managers need to provide and develop suitable and supportive infrastructure systems (Cormican & 
O’Sulliva, 2004).  Generally, innovation improves living standards and the quality of life, intensifies and sustains 
organisations’ performance, builds competitiveness among industries and plays a part in supporting the economy 
(Gopolakrisnan & Damanpour, 1996).  Due to this, innovation and innovation management have become of prime 
thought to the scholars, trading world and political leaders (Cormican & O’Sulliva, 2004). 
Innovation plays an important role in sustaining organisations.  It helps organisations to remain competitive.  It is 
therefore critical to have an innovation strategy as well as good innovation management practices in order to be 
competitive.  However, innovation and innovation management are multiplex processes and are challenging regardless 
of the organisation size or type (Bay& Çil, 2016). It is therefore necessary for researchers to focus their research on 
how innovation and its management can be simplified in order to make it practicable in organisations.  
With this type of background it is clear that for any weapon manufacturing company to be competitive globally, it has 
to have strategic activities that enable it to manage its technology innovations.  The Weapons Industry is a global 
industry responsible for the manufacturing and sales of weapons and military technology.  It typically includes the 
commercial industry involved in the research and development (R&D), engineering, production and servicing of 
military material, equipment, and facilities.  With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, organisations need to 
be continuously innovative.  Competition in the defense sector is increasing rapidly and weapon manufactures need 
to be proactive and gear up their technology in order to remain globally competitive.

Some of the strategies in table 2 are yielding positive innovation outcomes for the organisation.  However, the 
organisation can either expand its innovation strategies or decide to focus on a few in order to be a competitive leader 
in innovation.  With this view, all three dimensions need to be evaluated and prioritised.  Given the nature of the 
business, different strategies may be applicable at varying times depending on the local and/or global environment.   
The perception that the company does not use patent license and other intellectual property as innovation indicators 
stems from the reality that most of the company’s intellectual properties were registered long ago, hence they are not 
part of current innovation indicators.  Other than that there are no commonly known and used innovation indicators.  
The absence of innovation targets is in line with the non-existence of current innovation indicators.  From the 
investigation results it is noted that having innovation targets will influence the employees to be innovative.  
The respondents reasoned that products manufactured use software for functionality and precision and this software 
is integrated in the hardware and yet the company sales are limited to the hardware.  It was strongly maintained that 
the software technology in the weapons is what makes the clients interested in the products.  This clearly indicates 
that the company uses both tangible and intangible technology, however the sales are limited to tangible technology. 
The respondents claimed that due to financial challenges the company experiences, there is no development in 
innovation taking place.  Therefore, currently there are no products that are in emerging phase.  Most of the products 
were in emerging and maturity phase, the respondents argued that weapons that are produced do not reach the 
technology limit.  The weapons are upgraded to prevent them from reaching the technology limit phase.  The interview 
respondents argued that weapons remain in emerging and maturity phases for a long time.  It was also affirmed that 
there are some products that were invented more than 10 years ago that are still in emerging phase.  From this results 
it can be noted that most of the weapons produced are in maturity phase. 
Most applicable innovation type in the weapon manufacturing organ are addition to existing products and 
improvement to existing products.  Financial challenges have been cited as the main reason why the organization is 
not inventing new to the world products and new product lines.  From the interviews conducted it was found that cost 
reduction processes are practiced moderately in order to save some cash.  Clients always want reasonable prices, 
making it essential to have cost reduction processes.  Respondents echoed that there is no noticeable effort in 
repositioning the deliverables, the organization’s focus is still on manufacturing weapons. 
The interview respondents argued that knowledge transfer conducted with external institutions is more effective 
compared to the internal knowledge transfer. The organization has knowledgeable human resource, which enables 
innovation to take place however the knowledgeable employees hardly transfer the knowledge to the newly employed 
or to junior employees.  From these results it can be seen that having processes in place and ensuring that the processes 
are followed, contribute significantly to the success or failure of innovation management. 
The interview respondents stated that there are no measures in place to enforce innovation.  There is no drive to 
promote innovation.  The interview respondents also stated that inability to complete innovations that were developed 
10 years back was mentioned as a sign that management is not committed to innovation activities.  The respondents 
stated that top management is available to listen and support innovative ideas from the employees, top management 
provides trainings and resources required to implement the innovation, however the current financial situation is 
limiting the top management role. From this results it can be seen that top management plays huge role in influencing 
innovation activities. 
 
6.  Conclusions, Implications and Recommendations  
This investigation has taken a step towards combining very diverse literature into a single framework.  The proposed 
framework can be used to evaluate an organisation’s innovation activities, discover the extent to which the 
organization is supposedly innovative or whether or not innovation is entrenched in the organization, and identify 
areas for improvement. 
From the analyses of the results obtained during this study it is evident that there is no clear known strategy in the 
company.  Without a clear known strategy it is a challenge not only to implement innovation but also to manage the 
innovation process.  Having a visible strategy will assist the organisation to come up with effective innovation 
management processes that include innovation targets, incentives and indicators.

734","Having a well-articulated strategy in place is important but crucial step is communicating the strategy so that the 
employees are aware of it.  Awareness will make the implementation manageable.  The communicated innovation 
strategy, organisational policies and processes should all be aligned to the corporate strategy.   
There are numerous approaches to innovation that organisations can take, but perhaps the first step is to recognise that 
innovation has to be a priority.  An evolutionary approach to innovation where low investment and low risk dominate 
may assist in keeping innovation activities afloat.  Recommended starting areas of innovation are: 
• 
Improvements to existing products (improving functionality of the existing product) 
• 
New product lines (products are only new to the organisation not to the world) 
• 
Cost reduction (new process development providing products with similar functionality at a lower price). 
• 
Repositioning (existing products retargeted for new application) and  
• 
Lean innovation (reducing waste in the discovery, creation, and delivering of new value to customers). 
For weapon manufacturing company to be able to sustain itself and remain competitive in the market, it should have 
an innovation strategy and innovation management process.  To be a dominant competitor, the company should 
outperform and outmanoeuvre through innovation.

Abstract 
 
The stress analysis of developed Al-3.7%Cu-1.4%Mg/1.5%wtRice husk ash nanoparticles (RHAnp) composite for 
the production of pump impeller for industrial and agricultural applications has been investigated.  Impeller speed of 
1050, 1250, and 1450rpm were used for the stress analysis. The Al-3.7%Cu-1.4%Mg/1.5wt%RHAnp composite can 
be successfully used in the production of the pump impeller. It was observed that the maximum von misses' stress 
obtained is far lower than the yield stress in the materials. This result imply that using these developed materials in 
the production of the impeller is safe based on the judgment of the strength obtained in the work. Since the factor of 
safety is above one, it also indicates that failure may not occur before the design life is reached.

Introduction 
Centrifugal pump impeller has a significant role in the agricultural and industrial sectors [1]. The performance of 
this impeller depends on the design of the blade and the properties of the material (Lan-Ying and Yan-Lin, 2011). 
The most common materials used in the production of the centrifugal pump impeller are mild steel (Mane et al., 
2017). The choice of mild steel is a result of high strength and low cost, however the high corrosion and less fatigue 
strength have lower the current use of mild steel in the production of pump impeller for industrials used (Srivastava 
et al., 2018).  Aluminum alloys, stainless, and Inconel have been reported as candidate materials for the replacement 
of mild steel in the manufacturing of pump impeller for the enhancement of fatigue strength and lower of the 
corrosion rate (Rajanand, 2016). The use of stainless and Inconel in the production of pump impeller usually 
increases the cost of the pump impeller for the rural people to purchase for use in their agricultural purpose (Dadhich 
et al., 2012). To produce impeller that will be less expensive than stainless and Inconel and have better corrosion 
resistance and lightweight than mild steel that motivate interest in this current research. Hence the aim of this novel 
work is the modal and stress analysis of pump impeller produced from composites materials using agricultural 
waste.  
 
2. 
 Materials and Method 
The modal and the stress analysis of the open centrifugal impeller were done with composites of Al-3.7%Cu-
1.4%Mg/1.5%wtRice husk ash nanoparticles. The selection of this grade of composites was based on the previous 
work of the author and his co-worker (Atuanya and Aigbodion, 2014). In this work, the simulation of the open 
centrifugal impeller developed from Al-3.7%Cu-1.4%Mg/1.5%wtRice husk ash nanoparticles was conducted using 
Autodesk software. The prototype of the open centrifugal impeller and complete assembly used for the stress 
analysis is displayed in Figure 1. The mechanical properties of the composite used for the analysis are displayed in 
Table 1. The pump impeller was subjected to the speed of  1050, 1250, and 1450rpm as per the pumping rating 
recommended for ASME Class 300.

The good linear structural analysis of the developed impeller with composite material was attributed to the stiffness 
and strength obtained in this composite which resulted in high toughness obtained by the reinforcement that gives a 
minimum factor of safety. The tensile strength and factor of safety obtained are within the recommended standard 
for impeller application it was observed that the maximum von misses' stress obtained in this work is far lower than 
the yield stress in the materials by using the factor of safety. This can be concluded that using these developed 
materials can be used in the production of the impeller is safe based on the judgment of the strength obtained in the

 Conclusions 
New information was obtained in using the developed composite in the production of pump impeller for industrials 
and agricultural applications.  The Al-3.7%Cu-1.4%Mg/1.5%wtRice husk ash nanoparticles composite can be 
successfully used in the production of the pump impeller. The tensile strength and factor of safety obtained are

Abstract 
Rice husk is one of the agro-waste that is causing environmental pollution worldwide. The work have provided new 
information on the rice husk waste management for potential used as anti-corrosion and wear resistance of coating 
of mild steel. The rice husk was turned into rice husk nanoparticle (RHAnp), Epoxy-2wt% RHAnp was developed 
on the mild steel surface, corrosion, wear and hardness test were used to determine the coating performances. It was 
established in this work that waste rice husk can be used to increases the coating thickness, polarization resistance 
and hardness values, decreases the coefficient of friction, corrosion rate and wear rate of epoxy coated mild steel.

 Introduction 
 
Waste management problem of one of the main environmental pollution affecting not only Africa countries but the 
world at large, this is attributed to the facts that large quantities of waste are generated from industrials and 
agricultural activities (Bahrami, et al., 2015; Ezema and Aigbodion, 2020). Rice husk is one of the agro-waste that is 
causing environmental pollution worldwide (Soltani et al., 2015). A large quantity of the rice husk is been disposed 
to open burning in my Africa countries and effort has been by the researcher to converted this waste for the use of 
mankind (see Figure 1) (Suwanprateeb and Hatthapanit, 2002; Hassan and Aigbodion, 2016). Some of the recent 
potential application of rice husk exist in literature (Fernandesa et al., 2018). The authors reveal that rice husk 
contains carbon, silica, calcium, magnesium, iron and has been used in the production of composites materials, glass 
and soil stabilization. Bahrami et al (2015) reviewed on the development of metal matrix composites using 
agricultural and industrial waste for engineering applications.  They reported that agricultural and industrial waste 
materials can be effective used in metal matrix production. Aigbodion (2012) develop an Al-Si-Fe composites using 
rice husk ash. Pode (2016) report the use of rice husk in biomass power plant. Yao et al (2016) studied the thermo-
physical properties of rice husk and rice straw. Cuthbert (2014) present energy features of coffee husks blend with 
rice husk. Sekifuji and Tateda (2019) study the production of silica fertilizer using rice husk. Many past researchers 
show that corrosion of mild steel is a mace in the marine industry, oil and gas sector as well as construction and 
building industry (Brostow et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2013; Ramezanzadeh et al., 2014). This paper is an attempt to 
contribute to the conversations in rice husk waste management in a manner that can motivate interest in using rice 
husk as a potential materials for anti-corrosion and wear of mild steel.

Abstract  
Among the global problems emanating from vehicular traffic across various cities, which include but not limited to, 
security, parking, pollution and congestion and with the fact of the impracticality of changing the infrastructure of 
urban area, researchers in most cases consent that such problems may be alleviated by correctly staging the traffic 
lights which helps in improving the flow of vehicles across cities. In order to efficiently solve this congestion issue, 
reduce the total journey duration experienced by each vehicle, increase the total number of vehicles reaching their 
destination per unit of time and to decrease the amount of pollution emitted by the moving vehicles, this problem is 
addressed. Two different approaches are proposed, the first approach is a proactive approach based on Recurrent 
Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the traffic congestion in advance by training 
the machine learning models with the collected historical data. The second proposed approach is a real time reactive 
approach which is using different meta-heuristics and compare them together to find the near optimal solution for 
traffic light cycle time.

1.Introduction 
Nowadays, traffic congestion is considered one of the hottest research topics around the world for both individuals 
and stakeholders. Problems such as high delays, CO and CO2 emissions and car accidents caused by traffic congestion 
should be mitigated. One of the intuitive solutions is to expand the infrastructure to accommodate the significantly 
increasing number of road users, but this solution is not economically effective McCrea et al. (2010)-J. C. Spall and 
D. C. Chin (1997). So, most research directions are heading towards the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) to handle 
this growing issue which are affecting many sectors.  
Smart traffic light is deemed to be one of the applications of ITS. Traffic lights were firstly used in Westminster, 
London in 1868 and the first usage of the current traffic light with the three colors (red, yellow and green) was in 1918 
in New York, where it is manually controlled by a human Hewage et al. (2004).  
 Two other traffic lights appeared lately, which is the pre-timed traffic lights which is preprogrammed to work 
according to a predefined fixed time. The other type is called traffic actuated lights, where the traffic light cycle time 
is dynamically determined based on the collected information by cameras and sensors, to identify the traffic density 
Prabuchandran et al. (2014). Many technologies are playing a vital role in designing a smart traffic light, such as the 
Information Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. A lot of advantages 
brought by the advent of the ICT concept, which can be simply summarized by the performance improvement it brings 
to the city operations in general and traffic flow in specific. These advantages are caused by the embedded 
communications involved between different physical devices (sensors, vehicles, digital technologies, etc.) which helps 
in collecting information needed to make a better decision about the traffic light cycle time M K et al. (2018).

Compared to the medium congestion scenario, the model takes more time to converge but also it has an excellent low 
error values with not a lot of distortion. As shown in figure 5(b), the mean square error is very low with almost no 
distortion between the training and test data. It takes almost 225 iterations to converge to the best solution. When RNN 
model is used instead of LSTM, distortion is clear in the figure 5(c) and 5(d) with more time to converge as well. 
When comparing our obtained results with linear regression and neural network regression. It is clearly shown that 
our prediction algorithms (RNN and LSTM) outperforms other algorithms in terms of MAE, MSE and Coefficient of 
Determination as shown in figure 6. 
 
5.Conclusion 
 
In this paper, two approaches have been proposed in order to tackle road congestion issue, one of the promising 
research areas is to design dynamic algorithms to control the traffic lights. With the advent of machine learning, a lot 
of applications with huge data used machine learning algorithms to have a data-driven decisions. These decisions 
would have a direct/positive impact on improving the quality of life, revenues for companies, quality of service for 
the services provided for the end users, etc. In this paper, we used two well-known deep learning techniques, namely, 
RNN and LSTM and compare them with other machine learning algorithms to perform road congestion prediction. It 
has been shown in the results section that our proposed algorithms outperform other machine learning algorithms in 
terms of convergence rate, loss values and coefficient of determination factor. Many hyper parameters have been tuned 
to give us the best possible results in a reasonable amount of time. In the future, we have introduced an architecture 
which will be responsible to find near-optimal solution for the green time assigned to each traffic light with an 
objective to minimize the waiting time for each user in the road network. This meta-heuristic optimization algorithm 
will take benefit from the output of the first proposed work, which stores the predicted congestion at each traffic light 
in a separate database. The usage of meta-heuristic optimization has been justified because of the complexity of the 
defined problem, which is considered as an NP-Hard problem.

Abstract 
In the weaving process, especially in the loom shed process, yarn breakage is frequently found to be a 
critical problem since it results machine downtime. This study aims to develop an optimal set of process 
parameter values by taking speed, air pressure, warp tension, backrest height, and relative humidity. Signal 
to noise ratio, optimal parameter combination, and ANOVA are determined using a Taguchi designed 
experiment. All parameters are found significant and the yarn breakage rate is reduced from 87 to 32 shift. 
Possible optimal regions and a predictable regression model is built using the response surface method. The 
regions are found capable by reducing the breakage rate to less than 32 per shift. Moreover, a genetic 
algorithm is employed using Matlab2014a so that the lowest possible yarn breakage rate is recorded, for 
which a model is identified using best-fit regression analysis. It can, therefore, reduce the yarn breakage 
rate from 87 to 8 per shift. Thus, this finding is determined to be significant for various textile weaving 
industries.  
Keywords:  Genetic algorithm, looming parameters, response surface method, Taguchi designed 
experiment, yarn breakage.  
 
1. Introduction  
Manufacturing industries play a crucial role in economic growth, especially for developing countries. 
Ethiopia is one of the few African developing countries that has experienced rapid growth in the 
manufacturing industries, reports from Tekeba E., (2018) and central statistics agency (2000) survey. From 
the available manufacturing industries, the textile sector contributed a large proportion as Embassy of 
Ethiopian Economy and business, (2008) reported. 
Therefore, assuring the capacity of textile products, on behalf of economic growth, needs individual effort. 
Though each textile processing department has its own role for achieving the desired capacity, it is mostly 
determined by the weaving process. Not only this, but enough academic studies also hadn’t been conducted 
in the weaving process (K. Khurana, 2018). Some factors limit the weavability or operability of loom to 
achieve the desired fabric quantity. Yarn breakage, availability of spare parts, inspection time, electric 
power cut, article and beam change, and operator absenteeism are the identified factors while this study 
was conducted. Similarly, the loom downtime has also challenged the other weaving industries. Hence, 
numerous scholars are attempted to minimize the frequency of loom-machine downtime.

3. Results Discussion  
So far, it is discussed on the methods how yarn breakage is minimized; indeed, the objective of 
the study is not a comparison of optimization techniques rather an acquiring of the lowest yarn 
breakage rate. From the collected fact, the expected downtime caused by yarn breakage was 0.54hr 
per shift and 8.9m loss. Therefore, one yarn break can record 0.006hr downtime; divide 0.54hr per 
shift by 87 breaks per shift. In general, the findings are presented in the following table.

The objective of the study was to develop an optimal set of process parameter values of the weaving process, 
in looming division using Taguchi designed experiment, response surface method and genetic algorithm to 
investigate the lowest yarn breakage rate. It has been found that the rate of yarn breakage can be lowered

test so that it has concluded for employing the confirmed one.  This could be achieved when the yarn 
strength is in between 9.05 cN/tex to 15.44 cN/tex for sized and 6.87 cN/tex to 12.07 cN/tex for unsized. 
But results obtained from the response surface method and genetic algorithm hadn’t been carried out for 
confirmation test. Hence, future researchers had better look through statistically analyzed results with real 
results to confirm it.

Abstract 
 
Since the world is constantly generating electricity, we need a means to store any excess energy that we get, so as to 
not waste any of it. Surplus renewable energy can be stored in the form of hydrogen. This stored energy can be used 
in different applications like fuel cell electric vehicles, power generation, fertilizers and other chemical industries. 
Energy production as hydrogen through water electrolysis has been getting massive attention in the world as the 
excessive  renewable entry on their energy grid. The aim of this paper is to provide information about the production 
of hydrogen and the countries which are shifting towards green hydrogen in the world, and to calculate the 
environmental benefits of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) when they use the hydrogen that is being produced with 
the surplus renewable energy in Canada.    
Keywords: Fuel cell Electric Vehicle,  hydrogen, renewable energy, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM 
FC), Electric Vehicle  
 
1. Introduction 
Hydrogen is an energy source that appeals to reducing climate change. Limiting global warming to below 2 degrees 
Celsius (°C) requires that CO2 emissions decline by around 25% by 2030, from 2010 levels, and reach net zero by 
around 2070 (IPCC, 2018). To stay below 1.5 °C of warming, which is a more feasible goal, global human-produced 
net CO2 emissions should be reduced by 45% by 2030, from 2010 levels, reaching net zero by around 2050 (IPCC, 
2018). That being said, instead of decreasing, emissions have in fact increased (UNEP, 2018).  
 
Of the world’s GHG emissions, 66% come from energy-related sources, mainly CO2. An energy transition is needed 
now to break the link between economic growth and increased CO2 emission. The International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) developed a report to examine the possibilities of using hydrogen as a form of clean energy along 
with other types of fuels; the examinations were focused on preparing future strategies and long-term goals. This 
report was requested by G20 Karuizawa Innovation Action Plan on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for 
Sustainable Growth. On September 25, 2019, in Tokyo, Japan, this report was presented for the Hydrogen Energy 
Ministerial Meeting (IRENA, 2019) 
 
The European Commission, the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan, and the European Community Research 
Program highlight goals to be completed regarding GHG emissions; 40% of new cars and vans to be zero- or close to 
zero- emissions by 2030 (European Commission), reduced GHG emissions by 2050 using hydrogen fuel cell 
technologies, and shifting priority to electricity-powered transportation respectively (European Parliament). The 
collaborative research and development (R&D) technological projects in Europe are funded by the European 
Commission (Larruscain et al., 2017); and sustainable transport is one of the priorities for transport research and 
innovation in Horizon 2020 (H2020) (European Commission). It is predicted that the annual sales for fuel-cell 
applications (like FCEVs) are 0.4 – 1.87 million units from 2020 to 2025 (Edwards et al., 2008).  
 
Fuel cell technologies for transportation are mostly implemented in cars (E4tech, 2018). With a total stock of 11,200 
FCEVs, around 4,000 of them were sold in 2018, which is a 56% increase over 2017 (AFC TCP, 2018), which is 
miniscule compared with the 2018 battery electric vehicle (BEV) stock of 5.1 million (IEA, 2019a) or the global car 
stock of more than 1 billion. In ranking order of most to least, the countries that account for the most registered FCEVs 
are the US (~50%), Japan (~25%), Germany and France (combined 11%), and Korea (8%). Of these FCEVs, Toyota, 
Honda, and Hyundai, with Mercedes-Benz starting to lease and sell Plug-in HEVs that implement a fuel cell, make

4. Conclusion 
Currently, the world is shifting towards becoming as emission-free as possible by finding any way to cut down on 
GHG emissions into the atmosphere. We have looked at various countries researching and developing their own 
renewable-energy generation facilities with the aim of having a greener society. One of the more recent findings is 
storing surplus energy in the form of hydrogen, which we can use for different applications. Our calculations have 
found that if we use the hydrogen generated in Canada by such means in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. The amount of 
CO2-eq emissions saved in tons as compared to typical Electric Vehicle being charged by conventional grids is 455, 
500, 910,000, 2,293,200, 4,004,000, and 7,280,000 in the years 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040, respectively. As 
such, by switching to FCEVs, we can reduce GHG emissions significantly; and thus, our move to a cleaner and safer 
environment becomes positively attainable.

Abstract 
Ethics are moral principles that direct or influence peoples’ attitude and conduct. It also has an incontrovertible impact 
on legitimacy and value standard of any profession. However, there has been lots of questions raised on low level of 
ethical standard among Quantity Surveyors in Nigeria. Due to the development, this study aims to identify and analyze 
factors contributing to unethical conduct among Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry. Well-structured 
questionnaire covering the various factors contributing to unethical behavior by Quantity Surveyors were administered 
to the construction professionals. 228 legitimate reactions were retrieved and analyzed using Mean Item Score (MIS) 
and Factor Analysis (FA) respectively. It was revealed from the study that excessive love for money (greed), salaries 
of workers are delay and economic downturn were the top three factors contributing to unethical conduct by Quantity 
Surveyors in the construction industry. Furthermore, Factor Analysis was employed in reducing these factors to six 
major contributing factors. Thus, the study recommended that there should be total enforcement of the code of conduct 
on Quantity Surveyors by the professional bodies. Results from this study give adequate confirmation and helpful 
pointers in clarifying some misinterpretations about factors contributing to unethical conduct by Quantity Surveyors 
in the construction industry and possible solution.

ABSTRACT 
 
Real-life stochastic problems are better addressed by adopting metaheuristic techniques. One of the interesting 
metaheuristic techniques for defining the shortest path is the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. A considerable 
number of maps for shortest path have been considered in time past using classical techniques which is appropriate 
for deterministic variables. For stochastic or nondeterministic decision variables, metaheuristic techniques are much 
more appropriate. This is possible by mimicking the path navigation and swarm propensities of natural entities to 
provide real-time quality geographical images representing diverse areas or terrain for easy access to routing and path 
planning for sustainability and economic benefits in systems. In this research, the solution power of ACO has been 
demonstrated to predict customers’ behaviour in a popular retail outlet, using the travelling salesman problem (TSP) 
for stochastic shortest path during the purchase of items in a big-box facility with multiple products and sixteen (16) 
sections. Data obtained from the facility has been validated. The tour length was subjected to pheromone optimization 
to obtain a pheromone update of 0.00345 per metre as the maximum and 0.001725 as the best update at varying 
evaporation rate. In conclusion, out of the selected sections, two major paths in the big-box facility yielded optimal 
tour length and as such either of the paths can be followed by customers to spend the minimum required time in the 
facility.

1. Introduction 
Over the years, a considerable number of maps have been developed by strategist and operational scientists in a bid 
of providing real and quality geographical images representing different areas of the earth for easy navigation, routing, 
transporting of goods for the economic benefit of man. With the recent advancement in technology globally, the 
development of more sophisticated maps with novel function like tracking of locations, description of routes between 
places and so on is no coincidence but an achievement that was merely time-dependent. In a bid of improving 
subsequent maps by discovering more routes which would serve as a linkage between cities and as well limit road 
hours, researchers have shifted their attention to swarm intelligence which is an aspect of computer technology. Swarm 
intelligence is a problem-solving technique that is inspired by observing the behavioural activities of a living organism 
with emphasis on insects and some other animals (Hlaing & Khine, 2011). The advancement in computer technology 
is geared towards developing algorithms which mimic the behaviour of insects in solving problems. An in-depth study 
of the swarm intelligence has shown that the ant colony algorithm is one of the most successful and effective

Abstract 
 
Internet of Things (IoT) have a tremendous support to healthcare in the aspect of information capture and 
processing, which could much improve the healthcare service quality. Hospital needs to consider several factors in 
implementing IoT. This study aims to select and determine the appropriate IoT solutions in the hospital with the 
most of minimum risks and challenges. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to calculate the priority 
weight of IoT implementation in hospitals based on challenge factors, meanwhile The IoT implementation is 
assessed with probability and severity scale to get the risk score. Then after obtaining the risk score and weight of 
challenges, the priority weight and risk score of IoT implementation in the hospital are used for the development of 
models using AHP-ZOGP. And finally, Zero One Goal Programming (ZOGP) Method is used to create a selection 
model for IoT implementation in the hospital. The final results from the model showed that Hospital Patient Queue 
Management System is chosen in every available scenario, with remarkable result that could decrease 38.5% 
Technical risk, 46.2% Personnel risk and 69.3% challenge in healthcare.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Internet of Things (IoT) brings convenience to Hospital in terms of gathering & managing the information which 
could improve the healthcare service quality. Service quality in hospital has become the most significant factor to 
retain patient’s loyalty (Dachyar and Minar 2018). Since IoT has ubiquitous computing nature, all of the healthcare 
sevice components (people, equipments, medicine) can be monitored and supervised continuously (Rahmani et al. 
2018). By collecting patients’ real time health data, IoT implementation in hospital enable the treatment before the 
condition become critical (Anurag et al. 2015). IoT implementation in healthcare keeps increasing, where 4 times 
increment on the number of its device is expected in these past 5 years (Statista 2019). Numeruous implementation of 
IoT have been made in healthcare services, such as patient monitoring (Dhevi et al. 2018; Li, Hu, and Zhang 2017), 
object or equipment tracking (Stoller et al. 2013), Patient queue management system (Ghazal, Hamouda, and Ali 
2015), Smart ambulance (Fong, Fong, and Li 2018), medical drug storage (Gupta et al. 2018) etc. 
Despite the vast development of IoT in the hospital, the implementation of IoT has some challenges such as managing 
heterogeneity, design, trust, privacy, security, etc [10], [11]. The heterogeneity of various devices, environment, and 
applications needs to be managed for enabling IoT. In designing IoT, the challenges are how to design efficient 
architecture, mechanism and protocols, and how to manage large amounts of information to provide useful services. 
The trust, privacy and security challenges are how to secure the architecture of IoT, and to protect the user’s personal 
information [10]. In 2017 A survey held by Cisco to 1800 stakeholders of IoT initiatives showed that only 26% IoT 
project has succeeded. 
In IoT implementation, all devices have to be connected to local network and internet otherwise it will not work as 
intended. Many attackers on the internet steal confidential information. The attacker can abuse the data and 
information obtained which could harm the victim (Lu et al. 2014).   From various surveys and previous cases, it can 
be concluded that the risks and challenges of IoT implementation need to be addressed. This paper aims to 
determine and select IoT implementation in the hospital with minimum risks and challenges. The combination of

800","In Table 9, the selected IoT implementation on the first scenario is only Patient Queue Management System (X5) 
while the second scenario shows that it also selects e-Trak Equipment Tracker (X4) besides the Patient Queue 
Management System (X5). From the scenario results we can conclude that the change in objective priority weight and 
limit value of each risks affected the selected IoT implementation. 
4.2 Analysis of ZOGP Scenarios 
In Table 10 we can see the differences of the objective functions’ weight (stated as W1, W2, and W3) and technical 
(T) and personnel (P) risk limits of each scenario that is carried out.

In scenario 1 there is a change in the objective function value and the results of the chosen IoT implementation. The 
normal condition shows that the selected IoT implementation was X5 (Patient queue management system) and X7 
(RFID-enabled Wristbands) while in scenario 1 it becomes only X5. It can be concluded that the higher technical 
risks will make hospitals more selective and careful in selecting the IoT implementation. 
In scenario 2, the selected IoT are X4 (eTrak-Equipment Tracker) and X5 (Patient queue management system). It can 
be concluded that the Personnel risk of eTrak-Equipment Tracker and Patient queue management system are quite 
low so that they both get selected when there are differences in the priority weight in the selection model.  
5 Conclusion 
The selection problem of IoT implementation based on risk and challenge factors can be solved using the AHP-ZOGP 
method. This study found 6 challenge factors (16 subfactors), namely Network Foundation, Security, Privacy, Trust, 
Managing Heterogeneity and Design and 9 risk factors classified into technical risk and personnel risk, which need to 
be considered in implementing IoT in hospitals. IoT implementation that can be implemented in all scenarios is the 
Patient Queue Management System which could decrease 38.5% Technical risk, 46.2% Personnel risk and 69.3% 
challenge.

Abstract 
The forestry and plantation sectors are always experiencing developments every year. This development was carried 
out with the aim of obtaining sustainable productivity. Sustainable productivity will provide stable natural resources 
as raw material or food for the benefit of human life. One of the steps taken to obtain sustainable productivity is by 
replanting. Replanting activities need to be carried out to maintain the output from plantations and forestry to 
survive in order to meet high demand. Dynamic modelling is needed to provide an overview of the optimal form of 
replanting for the expected sustainability of productivity. This research will discuss the use of dynamic models in 
various parts of the country to model replanting activities in the forestry and plantation sectors. Each dynamic model 
used in this research still requires calibration to obtain high accuracy values. This will be an encouragement for 
researchers and management of the forestry and plantation sectors to obtain dynamic models with high accuracy 
values.

1. Introduction 
The forestry and plantation sectors have experienced very significant developments in recent years to meet industry 
demand as raw materials for the production process. Plantation and forestry are sectors that greatly affect global 
conditions both economically and their impact on the environment [1]. The productivity of the forestry and 
plantation sectors is influenced by a variety of dynamic variables. This condition of course makes it necessary to 
develop tools that can help management to optimize the management of the plantation and forestry sector by taking 
into account these dynamic variables. Currently, few studies have been conducted to analyze the optimization tools 
needed by management in the forestry and plantation sectors [2]. 
 
 
 
 
  
There are many variables that affect the productivity of the plantation and forestry sectors. These factors 
include the genetics of the plants themselves, climate and environment, and human intervention. These variables are 
dynamic and change over time. Therefore it is necessary to have a model that is used to predict changes in each 
variable in order to optimize the results of the two sectors [3].  
 
 
 
 
This research was conducted to determine the use of a dynamic model approach to solving problems in the 
forestry and plantation sectors. The dynamic model approach is expected to optimize the productivity of the 
plantation and forestry sectors to achieve the output targets set by management. 
 
  
2. Literature Review 
2.1. Model 
Models are tools used to understand, describe, and predict existing real systems. The development of types of 
models is currently experiencing a significant increase, including empirical and exponential models, semi-empirical 
models, and theoretical models. There are many other forms of models that can be used to analyze real systems [4]. 
 
2.2. Plantation and Forestry 
Plantation and forestry are two sectors that greatly affect the economy as well as global environmental factors.

From the data above, it can be seen that research on dynamic model approaches to optimize replanting 
activities is still dominated by Asian countries. China was the largest paper contributor in this study with a 
percentage of 28% of the eighteen papers that were selected. Five papers obtained from China discuss replanting 
activities that use dynamic models to get the best pattern based on factors that affect the growth of a plant. These 
factors include plant age, soil contour, gas emissions, environmental conditions, and the condition of the plant 
canopy. Research originating from China also compared three forms of dynamic models that were used to find the 
best model that could be used in the replanting method. 
 
 
It is quite surprising that the percentage of Russia is quite high considering that Russia does not have a 
large enough forest area. Russia which is known as one of the ice countries has the second highest percentage in the 
papers selected in this study. Russia's position is followed by India which is also an Asian country with its southern 
region which is still classified as a tropical region. From each dynamic model used in the selected paper, it is still 
necessary to recalibrate it to get the accuracy value that is closest to the actual condition. Various previous models 
were analyzed and re-evaluated for improvement in order to obtain high accuracy values. Improvements are made 
starting with adding the number of related variables, decreasing the error value, reducing the deviation value, and 
making necessary model modifications according to the actual conditions in the field. This development has been 
carried out quite rapidly in the last five years. However, this research is mostly carried out by countries in the Asian 
continent. 
 
 
The use of dynamic models for optimization of non-forestry plantation processing by management shows a 
significant development. Each dynamic model in the study undergoes development and calibration to increase the 
efficiency and effectiveness of its use. The use of dynamic models is very important to predict dynamic variables in 
the future. The results of this prediction will be used as material for analysis and evaluation for management to 
prepare themselves for future conditions [20]. 
 
 
Most of the dynamic models used are in the form of a regression mathematical model. In addition, the form 
of the model used is also a programming in computer software. Several articles also make use of the two forms of 
the model and compare to get the form of the model with the smallest error value [4]. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Dynamic models for the plantation and forestry sectors are always developing from time to time. Recent research is 
always carried out to test existing models in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the model. The 
purpose of developing the model is of course to get results that are closest to the real form that occurs in the field. 
The smaller the error value of the model, the greater the opportunity for management to make improvements and 
also to develop the plantation and forestry sectors.

Abstract  
 
The technological innovations that are increasingly available to air travel have significantly grown over the years since 
the deregulation of the airline industry within South Africa and the African continent. Within the low cost carrier 
sector of the airline industry, the competition is tough and longevity of the low cost airline is prompted by the 
innovative ideas that direct customers to the “no frills” sector of air travel. This research study aims to determine the 
impact of customer focused innovative technology implementations on the passenger numbers of a low cost carrier 
airline in South Africa. The research focuses on one domestic low cost carrier known to be technologically forward 
thinking and consistently uses advanced technology in the competitive market within which it operates. An overview 
of the business models used by low cost carriers across the world is explored with a focus on the selected carrier in 
South Africa. The data is time series in nature where the granger causality statistical model is employed to assess how 
the customer technology projects affect the customer numbers. The results indicate that there is a causal relationship 
over time between the implementation of technology and the growth of passenger numbers. 
 
Keywords  
Low cost carrier airlines, customer focused technology, airline deregulation, airline distribution systems, granger

1 Introduction 
 
In 1991 the deregulation of the South African airline industry opened doors for the entry of low cost carrier (LLC) 
airlines to operate in the domestic transport environment. Since August 2001, when the first low cost carrier airline 
began operations, several other LCC airlines have entered the domestic market thereby increasing the competitiveness 
of the airline industry (Mhlanga, 2017). In South Africa the competition is even more intensified as both full service 
and low-cost carriers are in competition for the same market (Fernando, Mat Saad and Sabri Haron, 2012), the same 
routes and operating from the same hubs. This suggests that LCC’s have to do more to remain competitive and 
sustainable in order to service. 
 
While low cost carriers (LCCs) are operating in a growth market for budget air travel, placing pressure on full-fare 
airlines, there is much to be considered for the success of their continued operation , including revenue optimisation 
and improving customer relations (Kelemen, 2003). To this end, LLCs have relied on high volumes and reduced cost 
structures to be able to attract more passengers at lower fares who would normally use other modes of low cost 
transportation such as buses and trains (Lubbe, 2011).

817","the impact on customer growth had a causal relationship with the innovative technologies implemented and the value 
they provided. 
 
With passenger number (pax) as the dependent variable, it was discovered that the variables campaigns (0.9858) and 
revenue (0.4339) did not (granger) cause the growth of passenger numbers on Standard Air for the period under 
review. This meant that these two variable did not influence or cause the growth of passenger numbers. While low 
cost carrier airlines such as EasyJet saw the potential of social media platforms to engage customers, Ryanair did not 
use a social media as a marketing strategy for their airline. This abstention from this marketing strategy did not 
diminish the rising passenger number, load factors nor profits of Ryanair (Poulsen et al., 2016). As indicated by the 
results of the granger causality test of this research for Standard Air, marketing did not have a causal effect on the 
growth of passenger numbers thereby echoing some of the reasons why Ryanair did not invest in marketing as a 
strategic imperative to grow their passenger numbers (Poulsen et al., 2016). According to Acha-anyi (2016), in South 
Africa, marketing remains one of the biggest weaknesses of the airlines regardless of the marketing strategies explored. 
The marketing is seen to be elitist and did not adequately filter to the majority of the population. This again was further 
indicative that passengers continue to fly with no particular influence by marketing which in itself in South Africa 
targets a small demographic of the population (Acha-anyi, 2016). 
 
A granger cause bi-directional test was performed on each of the variables Projects, Campaigns and Revenue on the 
Pax variable. It was determined that there is no bi-directional granger cause on the Pax variable by the projects and 
campaigns variables of the data set of the tested variables in the data set. However, the results do show that Pax has a 
granger cause effect on revenue. This result supported the reasonable logic that the greater the number of passengers 
booking seats, the more the revenue that is expected. Iberia Airlines showed increased market share of the customer 
segmentation propelled by new technologies had positive effects on revenue (Van der Merwe, 2000). 
The relationship between innovation and technology and how airlines need to adapt is becoming more and more 
critical to understand by airline strategists. One such strategist is Fernando Estrada, chief strategy officer at Vueling 
which is part of the International Consolidated Airlines Group has suggested how mobile features have a positive and 
constructive effect on customers’ travel experience. To quote Estrada, “Since then, we have added many handy 
features to smooth customers’ travel experience, with the app receiving more than two million downloads to date, 
with a usage of 1.5 million every month” (Brewer, 2015). 
 
As this market is very competitive, price is an important factor for customers but is not always the key determinant 
for them to make that purchase. Other factors also weigh in on their decision and these include products and services 
that the airline offers. With the advent of increasing mobile usage and technology advancement airlines are introducing 
products and services that are being facilitated by these tools to improve the customer’s access to them (Kim and Lee, 
2011). There is a constant need to re-think and design new innovative products and services with increased 
functionality. Being innovative is essential for many reasons, amongst which is to better serve customers and to meet 
the demands of mobile devices and smartphones users more easily and faster further building customer value (Brewer, 
2015).

Conclusion 
 
The main objective of the research was to determine if there was an impact of the customer focused technology projects 
on the growth of passenger numbers on Standard Air over the period under consideration. The passenger growth of 
Standard Air may be determined by various factors in the operational lifecycle of the airline. The research study took 
into account another variable which airlines use to deliberately target their customers, which are marketing campaigns. 
The marketing campaigns did not seem to have a positive impact on the growth of passenger numbers nor did they 
have a positive impact on the revenue growth. This suggested that from an operational perspective the efforts of the 
campaigns did not have an impact on improving the passenger booking numbers. It would have seemed that marketing 
campaigns would assist in improving passenger numbers.  
 
Over time there was a notable positive linear relationship of passenger growth and revenue. This stands to reason as 
the assumption is the more passengers that are booked on Standard Air the more the expected revenue. This assumption 
is also highlighted in the correlation matrix that shows that there was a very strong correlation between the passenger 
numbers and revenue.

826","The granger causality test of the relationship between passenger numbers and customer innovation technology shows 
that there was a granger cause that the projects did have an impact on the growth of passenger number. This meant 
that providing customers with innovative technology that provides more information and improved access to products 
and services does grow the passenger numbers on a low cost carrier airline. The technology projects that have been 
implemented have added customer value to the passengers giving them information, ability and autonomy to make 
purchases of the airlines inventory.  
   
It is therefore recommended that low cost carriers need to adapt to implementing customer innovations that can deliver 
relevant solutions to their customers to enhance their ticketing booking experience as well as their travel journey from 
the first “click” to the arrival of their destination.

Abstract 
 
The electronic procurement (E-Procurement) system in Indonesia faces several critical problems such as low process 
efficiency, insufficient transparency, and a high potential for procurement corruption and fraud. This study aims to 
design improvement of Indonesia’s E-Procurement system that can minimize corruption and improve efficiency in 
the procurement process by using Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and Structured System Development 
(SSD) methods. BPR is performed by modeling and simulating current (As-Is) and proposed (To-Be) process. SSD 
in this study consists of four stages; the creation of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), relational tables, use case 
diagram, and Data Flow Diagram (DFD). This study provides three improvement scenarios to solve issues in the E-
procurement system by implementing an integrated information system linkage across government agencies and a 
real-time bidding solution. The three scenario models' simulation has different solutions to minimize corruption and 
produce different cycle times for each scenario. Using the SSD method, the information system model is designed to 
support business process improvement with the best scenario.

1. Introduction 
 
Corruption has become a significant problem globally, which causes stunted economic growth, distorted investment, 
and low quality of public services. Public procurement is one of the government sectors most vulnerable to 
corruption. In addition to the volume of transactions and financial interests at stake, corruption risks worsen by the 
complexity of the process, the close interaction between public officials and businesses, and many stakeholders 
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2016). In Indonesia, public procurement is a high-risk 
sector that is consistently being in the top three cases handled by the Corruption Eradication Commission every year 
(Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, 2018). 
 
E-Procurement is a system to support the procurement of goods and services by utilizing internet-based information 
technology. The entire transaction process can be carried out electronically without the need for face-to-face 
meetings between the procurement committee and participants (Komakech, 2018). The use of E-Procurement is 
considering as one of the ways to prevent corruption and fraud in the procurement sector. Indonesia has 
implemented an E-Procurement system in its public procurement processes. Even though it has been done 
electronically, however, there are still a lot of gaps to commit deviations in the procurement sector. One of the 
reasons is the process of evaluating procurement documents and the determination of tender winners, which is still 
done manually. A face-to-face meeting between the procurement committee and tender participants is still taking 
place. One example is the process of proving qualifications. In fact, ideally, every transaction can be done through 
an electronically digitized system (LKPP, 2018). Besides, the limited availability of the procurement database and 
supporting system infrastructure also becomes an obstacle to the electronic procurement process, the efficiency of E-
Procurement is also still very low.

829","4. Conclusion 
 
This research has successfully redesigned the E-Procurement business processes and information system that was 
previously not yet fully digitalized and still has a lot of gaps in corruption practices into a system that is more 
digitalized, efficient, and more corruption-free by applying real-time bidding and integrated information system by 
using relational database across government agencies. 
 
The proposed E-Procurement model improvements are divided into 3 To-be scenarios. The best scenario to be 
implemented is the 3rd scenario, which is designed by combining the BPR best practice approach and information 
system improvement approach.  
 
Suggestions for further research is to conduct a Risk Management related to find out possible risks that may occur, 
how to prevent these risks from happening, and how to overcome these risks if they occur in the E-Procurement 
process.

Abstract  
 
The pharmaceutical inventory management process adopted by the hospitals are facing challenges in data 
communication, which implied to excess inventory problems as the leading cause of bad forecast of their lack. This 
study aims to redesign the information flow and business process in the pharmaceutical inventory management by 
increasing its efficiency by implementing Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) supported by the Internet of Things 
(IoT). Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and Structured System Development (SSD) as a method used in this 
study.  Four stages of SSD consist of structuring Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), relational table, use case 
diagram, and Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for process improvement. This study proposed five improvement scenarios 
simulated using iGrafx. The best scenario for the hospital to consider in conducting improvement is VMI intervention, 
IoT technology in the form of QR Code or RFID Tag, and Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) 
development. The proposed model resulted in pharmaceutical inventory management's time efficiency to 95.64%, 
which previously took 22.11 days to 7.72 hours.

1. Introduction  
 
Indonesian State Hospitals generally allocate 23% of its annual expenses to pharmaceutical spending and the numbers 
are expected to rise in the coming years (DBS Vickers Securities Group Research, 2015). A high pharmaceutical 
allocation must be used carefully in order to maximize performance. The fact in practice suggest contradictory to this 
concept as cases of suboptimal budget are frequently discovered with a large number of expired drug stocks. Findings 
by financial government auditor in 2019 claims two problems in pharmaceutical services, which implied in the 
discovery of expired drugs scattered in various hospitals and other health services that inflict financial loss equivalent 
to IDR24,058,151,347.00 for the Indonesian Government. Followed by potential IDR96,171,940,620.00 loss in case 
if the medicine supply that is expiring in six months is not appropriately utilized (Badan Pusat Keuangan, 
2019)(Sunardi & Angelia, 2019). Inventory shortages due to poor data communication and supply lead to bad 
forecasts, which implied excess inventory problems (Al Juffali et al., 2019)(Vila-Parrish et al., 2012). 
 
This study aims to redesign the information flow and business process in the pharmaceutical inventory management 
by increasing its efficiency through the implementation of Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) supported by Internet 
of Things (IoT). This study was conducted at one of the state-owned hospitals in Jakarta, involving four interviewees 
from procurement, pharmacy, and recipient goods units. The study began with the data collection process by document 
review and in-depth interviews to map the current pharmaceutical inventory management process (as-is model) using 
iGrafx software. Statistical reports generated from the simulation used to identify processes in need of improvement.  
Statistical reports supported by Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis generate the design improvements that suit the 
user needs. Analysis related to pharmaceutical inventory management design is reviewed based on a comparison 
between the results from the current process statistical simulation (model as-is) and the proposed process (model to-

841","5. Conclusion 
This research has successfully redesigned the pharmaceutical inventory information system and business processes 
previously dominated by manual and offline processes into a system that applies IoT-based Vendor Managed 
Inventory (VMI) in the form of QR Code / RFID Tag. The proposed new business process design in scenario 5 
succeeded in creating a leaner process. The implementation of IoT-based VMI improves data accuracy for 
pharmaceutical inventory and results in optimation of inventory level. 
 
For future research, it is necessary to analyze the readiness for VMI implementation since the VMI itself has never 
been applied in Indonesian hospitals.

Abstract 
This paper analysis the usage between electricity and natural gas in automobile manufacturing for the periods 2015-
2018. Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) is employed to decompose the electricity and gas consumption data 
of company ABC (a large automobile manufacturer in South Africa). The main results reveal that company ABC for 
the period of study has made a shift in their energy consumption use, by increasing the use of gas as its source of 
energy which simultaneously saw a reduction in electricity usage, therefore reducing the amount of carbon emission 
emitted by company ABC. 
Keywords:  
LMDI, Natural gas. Electricity and energy. 
1. Introduction 
Industrial facilities around the world have been viewed as the major consumers of energy, about 37 percent of global 
energy usage is consumed by the industrial sector (Olanrewaju et al., 2012). In South Africa alone over 40 %  of the 
country’s energy is consumed by the industrial sector (Mahotas, 2010). Looking back into history this  large 
consumption is mostly owed to the lack of awareness towards energy efficiencies and the low prices of energy (Inglesi-
Lotz, 2012). Like other developing countries around the world South Africa now faces an energy crisis, hence 
sustainable manufacturing has become a vital subject. 
In 2015 South Africa’s energy supply was led by coal with 59% of the primary energy supply, followed by 20% owed 
to renewable resources and crude oil with 16%. Natural gas contributed 3% while nuclear contributed 2% to the total 
primary supply in 2015 as presented in Figure 1 (Keneilwe Ratshomo, 2018).

853","Overall Figures 7 and 8 summarizes the total decomposition results for periods 2015 – 2018. From figure 7 it can be 
noted that although the overall electricity energy consumption increased, the increase was minor considering the 
outlook presented by the effects. The activity effect contributed significantly towards the increase, whereas the 
structural and the intensity effect made a significant contribution towards the reduction of energy consumption arising 
from the shift in the composition of industry output towards less energy-intensive sectors. From figure 8 it is noted 
that the total gas energy consumption increased significantly with all effects making a contribution. This increase is 
because of company ABC reducing its electrical energy consumption by using more gas. 
7. Conclusion 
In conclusion Anon (2014) stated that gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) when combusted compared 
to coal or oil. Therefore, by Company ABC increasing the use of gas has a positive environmental outlook as compared 
to when electricity is used as the dominant energy source. This paper aims to show automobile industries one method 
of reducing their carbon emissions by using the resources they already have.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is a fairly large archipelago in Southeast Asia. The country is often hit by earthquakes which often claim 
victims due to low-quality buildings. This research is a preliminary study of making a strong particleboard 
earthquake-resistant for housing walls using corn stalk wastes. This research aimed to study the effect of corn fiber 
orientation; [00/00/00], [00/900/00], and random [00/450/900] to a styrofoam/xylene matrix with the concentration 
17.5%, 27.5%, and 37.5% (w/w). The product value of the particleboard composite characterizations was following 
the  ASTM, but the justification of the feasible product was referred to as the Indonesian National Standard (SNI). 
Due to the test results, it was found the screw test to the product specimens did not meet the SNI which was defined 
as not suitable for bending application but referred from other mechanical tests it was justified as a strong material 
for wall housing.

 1. Introduction 
Indonesia is one of many other countries every year experiences on earthquakes. As the largest archipelagic 
country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has a unique geographical position because it layed up at the center of the 
collision of the Australian Indian Tectonic Plate in the south, the Eurasian Plate in the north, and the Pacific Plate in 
the northeast. This has caused Indonesia to have a complex tectonic arrangement from the direction of the collision 
zone [1]. As a result of the phenomenon of tectonic shifts or earthquakes often occurred has causes buildings that 
partly were low-rise buildings or commonly known as simple housing with the poor quality wall material. 
According to the Indonesia Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Disaster on Mitigation (DVMBG), the 
meeting plate of northern Irian and North Maluku has produced stack energy in a certain strength of scale. The 
sudden release of the energy will be caused to impact the building damage [2]. The majority of fatalities of falling 
walls that occurred were made of bricks or concrete were happened not met the shock-resistant requirements.  
 
 
2.Literature Review 
The walls of the concrete block are waterproof, but store heat and prone to cracks and breaks due to shocks. 
Concrete was a material made from a mixture of cement, water, coarse, and fine aggregates with certain additives. 
The mixture must be homogeneous with no segregation occurred. The smaller cavity in the concrete mixture will 
result in high-pressure strength. There are some disadvantages of using concrete; 1) execution of work requires high 
accuracy 2) heavy loads 3) great sound reflectivity, and 4) low tensile strength, so it easily cracks and can not 
withstand shocks. Based on the experience of earthquakes that occurred, the collapse of buildings claimed a large 
number of lives. Therefore, the building must be planned to provide a minimum performance of life safety, thus 
minimized the possibility of casualties. The earthquake-resistant bricks are very important for pre-earthquake 
preventive action because most of the concrete and brick houses that are built in Indonesia do not have good quality, 
so were prone to be damaged. The weight of earthquake-resistant bricks is much lighter than conventional concrete 
or concrete blocks. This was a distinct advantage in terms of safety. It can be made from natural fiber with a mixture 
of polyester and styrofoam matrices printed in the form of bricks for the foundation for earthquake walls. Utilizing

863","Test using the same specimen dimensions and corn fiber length is 3-5 cm. Overall, from the test results it was found 
that the orientation of the [00/00/00] fiber at all matrix concentrations was the smallest value of 0.011 J/mm2 (17.5%); 
0.008 J /mm2 (27.5%), and 0.007 J/mm2 (37.5%). This assumes that if the fiber was made in one direction would not 
provide good mechanical strength. Meanwhile, if the fiber was made in [00/900/00] orientation at a matrix 
concentration of 17.5% and 37.5%, the highest strength was 0.015 J/mm2 and 0.011 J/mm2 respectively, the result 
will be different if the matrix concentration was 27.5%. It can be concluded that the strength of the particleboard 
was much better if the fiber orientation is not in one direction, which was  [00/900/00] and [00/450/900]. 
 
Conclusion 
From the results of testing the physical and mechanical properties of earthquake-resistant bricks using fibers from 
corn stalks waste with variations in the direction of fiber [00/00/00], [00/900/00], and [00/450/900] combined with the 
styrofoam matrix with w / w 17.5%, 27.5%, and 37.5% can be concluded that; 
 
1. 
The results show that the density of particle board ranges between 0.982-1.005 gr /cm3 (meets the requirements 
of SNI 03-0349-1989). The water absorption capacity of particleboard ranges from 0.683% to 1.77% (meets 
the requirements of SNI 15–2094–2000). The screw holding strength values range from 19 kg to 27 kg (not yet 
meeting the requirements of JIS A 5908-2003). The impact strength of particleboard ranges from 0.007 to 
0.015. The factors of the amount of styrofoam in the matrix, fiber orientation, and the fiber compositions in the 
manufacture of the test specimens have a significant effect on the density, water absorption, screw holding 
strength, and impact test of earthquake-resistant particleboard. 
2. 
The results of all physical test studies meet the existing SNI standards. Meanwhile, the mechanical test did not 
meet the standards because the fiber composition used in this study was only 30% of the total weight of the 
specimen tested. But on the other hand, the effort to use cornstalk fiber has other advantages, the use of 
cornstalk fiber and styrofoam has a positive impact on the environment because it uses wasted resources so that 
it can produce new materials and it is hoped that in the future it can overcome the problems of handling 
earthquakes in Indonesia. 
 
Future Work 
1. It would beneficial to using the old age cornstalks fiber this related to the maturity of the fiber and the amount of 
fiber for every corn stalks 
2.  Avoid the bubbles formed during the process it would be effected the several tests  
3.  The drying temperature of the composites should not exceed 100 0C because the polyester matrix was 
thermosetting so that the board becomes softening. 
4.  It is necessary to carry out further tests such as bending tests, tensile tests, gas emission tests, and SEM, it would 
be necessary to collaborate work to civil engineering to test the construction of building structures of the material 
that potentially efficient new material to be used as a foundation, temporary shelter walls aftermath earthquake 
or can also be a permanent wall material specifically for earthquake-prone areas in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
With the recent development of wearable technology and the untact society's advent due to COVID-19, various 
home fitness activities were being activated. To reflect the needs of consumers, smart fitness clothing has been 
researched and developed. Among them, the development of clothing that checks each muscle's status and activity 
based on the EMG (Electromyography) signals is slow because there are limitations in various engineering and 
clothing aspects. When the EMG sensors are attached to the inside of the clothing, the sensor may not be correct in 
contact with the skin due to the body movements (joints and muscles), and thus accurate measurement may not be 
performed. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal sensor position for each muscle group by attaching 
several sensors to each muscle, then analyzing the signals. EMG electrodes were attached to 9 muscles (two in the 
upper arm, one in the chest, one in the abdomen, two in the back, two in the thigh, and one in the calf) in the body, 
and EMG data were analyzed to find the best sensor attachment position. The amplitude, noise, and SNR (Signal to 
Noise Ratio) of EMG signals were measured when performing an exercise to activate each muscle. As a result, it 
was possible to confirm the optimal EMG sensing position for each muscle. It is expected that more accurate high-
quality signals could be obtained in consideration of physical characteristics when developing smart fitness clothing.

Abstract 
 
Mine ventilation aircrossing is one of the most important equipments which is used in a mine ventilation system, 
especially in coal mining. When designing any mine ventilation system or network, it is important to estimate the 
local resistances of the ventilation system to plan for an effective and well-designed ventilation system. Currently, 
no mathematical models or empirical formulas are available to estimate the shock loss effect associated with the 
aircrossings. The aircrossing analysis performed in this study was done through numerical analysis using 
commercial software ANSYS Fluent 2019 R1. Shock loss factors on an aircrossing were investigated numerically 
on various geometries. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model proposed, was validated using numerical 
results reported previously. The study indicates that the ANSYS numerical code is appropriate to evaluate shock 
losses in mine ventilation aircrossings. The research, therefore, has the potential to provide an important step 
towards, understanding flow patterns and shock losses effect at the aircrossing. This will assist in improving the 
design and selection of mine ventilation aircrossings, ventilation planning, and improve the working environment 
for underground mineworkers.

 1. Introduction 
 
One of the most important equipment which are used in a mine ventilation system, especially in coal mining or 
board and pillar and or tabular bodies, is a mine ventilation aircrossing. It is also known as mine ventilation 
overcast. Aircrossings are an essential ventilation control structure used to direct airflow to where it can be usefully 
employed in the mine. Ventilation components such as aircrossings, doors, airway with a regulator, moving or 
standing mine cars and trains, bends in the fan drift, and objects offer some local resistance to the airway 
(McPherson, 1993).  This local resistance results in shock losses to the mine airways. 
When the air flow rate is high, the shock loss can be significant in an airway, and the power cost in overcoming the 
local resistance will also be significant (Purushotham & Bandopadhyay, 2009). The effects of these shock losses are 
usually neglected when planning for ventilation or taken into account while estimating total energy loss in the 
system, by ventilation engineers, management, and in mine network ventilation simulation software. The effect of 
shock losses is less as compared to the frictional losses in mine ventilation network but these losses can be 
significant if too many intersections and abrupt area changes are present in the mine (Hartman, 1982). Therefore 
various shock losses should be investigated and quantified when attempting to reduce pressure losses and power 
requirements for a ventilation system. Losses due to bends, area changes can be reduced significantly by tactical 
planning or minor revision of the mining system.  
The losses due to friction are generally estimated using Atkinson’s equation, which gives accurate results (Hartman, 
1982). Ventilation engineers, however, encounter difficulty when estimating shock losses and they usually select 
these values randomly without relying on a rational basis and or based on past experiences. Shock losses do not fit 
into precise calculations because of their great range of variability in occurrence and because of a lack of 
understanding about their actual nature. Aircrossings are major sources of shock pressure losses in underground coal 
mines. Shock losses, in general, account for 40% of the total pressure losses in mine ventilation systems (Banerjee, 
2003). This consideration justifies the need for detailed understanding and quantification of these losses for the 
different flow geometries characteristically encountered in mine ventilation systems.

This contraction and expansion of airflow results in some form of change in the cross-sectional area which 
results in shock losses. These velocity streamlines show that after the sharp turn, the cross-sectional area of 
the airflow changes. The area change results in an increase and a decrease in the velocity of the model 
depending on expansion or contraction.  
• 
The velocity streamlines of a 60° aircrossing shows that there is less formation of eddies at the corners and 
the walls. The cross-section area of the airflow in the airstream region is slightly larger than in the case of 
90   aircrossing.  
• 
The reduction area in the airflow movement is improved with less formation of vena contracta. The airflow 
velocity is lowered at the airstream as a result of increased air passage area.  
• 
This analysis shows that lower velocities, result in fewer energy losses in the system and minimum 
disturbance of the airflow. 
• 
The velocity streamlines of a 45o aircrossing show that fewer shock losses will be experienced at the source 
due to low sudden velocities changes, low angle obstructions resulting in less formation of vena contracta.  
• 
There is less interruption in airflow along the 45o aircrossing which results in less velocity variation at an 
aircrossing as compared to 60o and 90o configuration. 
• 
Fewer shock losses are achieved as a result of the change in configuration from 45o to 30o. Therefore shock 
losses at aircrossing are primarily caused by a sudden change in angle, which also causes a change of the 
cross-section of the airflow (due to the vena contracta formation). 
• 
Streamlines show there is a positive influence on resulting airflow properties. Therefore, from the 
interpretation of the flow characteristics using pressure contour and streamlines, it is apparent that the best 
design is the 30o option. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 
In conclusion, this study shows that shock losses are primarily generated as a result of the configuration angle. The 
severity of shock loss depends on this angle, with minimum angles giving minimum energy losses to airflow. These 
pressure losses are used to calculate shock loss coefficients of aircrossings. To assist in the assessment of each case, 
the values of the shock loss coefficient of each aircrossing are determined. These variations and range of shock loss 
will limit and assist the design ventilation engineers in selecting an aircrossing that is effective and efficient with 
minimum flow separation and fewer shock losses. This can be achieved by selecting an aircrossing which gives a 
low shock loss coefficient.

Abstract 
 
A vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is the type of turbine that uses aerodynamic drag to rotate 
vertically and generate electrical energy. Wind energy is considered an important renewable energy 
source and the development of VAWTs is ever increasing. A household application of VAWT as a 
complementary energy source is considered. The study focused on the analysis of the performance of 
VAWTs at varied blade Angle-of-Attack (AoA). Two NACA Selig/Giguere series aerofoils were 
modelled for varied thicknesses and chord lengths to analyze the power of the turbine at different AoA 
using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A Dynamic mesh technique in the ANSYS Fluent 2019 
R1 commercial software was used to model a three-H-shape VAWT that simulated a varied AoA as 
cam would on pivoting blades was effected through a User-Defined-Function. The varying AoA 
produce a higher momentum deficit in the wake, but also a faster wake recovery. The AoA reaches both 
the minima and maxima of the power it can produce before stalling wind over the aerofoil and forming 
large vortex shedding and wakes behind each blade that should have been less from a low-speed VAWT. 
Consequently increasing noise levels which is undesirable for urban applications. The varied AoA show 
a bimodal distribution of vortex shedding retracting from the blades.

1. Introduction 
 
Wind energy is progressively becoming popular and competitive in the arena of renewable energies. It 
holds much of its technology and potency from the aerodynamic principles which makes it much 
attractive for aeronautical and mechanical engineers to contribute towards the generation of electricity. 
The continuous development of wind energy is ever becoming important to meet the EU’s 2050 low 
carbon economy objectives (Nguyen, et al., 2020). Now, wind energy is best captured, utilised and 
harnessed through the means of a wind turbine. Wind turbines are catalogued primarily to how the 
rotational axis is orientated. Their classification can be classified as horizontal axis wind turbines 
(HAWTs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) (Peng, et al., 2020). It has been determined and the

Figure 13a shows that vortex sheets downstream the blades to be stronger and travelling further when 
on fixed AoA. This is another indication of the varied AoA to lower the stall separation. Therefore, the 
vortex sheet from varied AoA is quieter too. The varied AoA reduces flow separation and weakening 
the instability that periodically generates separation vortices, which leads to the vibration of rotating 
machinery and noise generation (Liu, et al., 2019). 
4. Conclusion 
 
The potential use of varied angle-of-attack in VAWT and has been numerically investigated. The power 
coefficient Cp in VAWT is maximum at very low values of TSR (λ = 0.6). The results show that blade 
of SG6043 aerofoil with a chord length of, c = 0.5m yields the best energy capture in presence of varied 
or fixed angle-of-attack. The noise caused as demonstrated by the vortex sheet is noted but not fully 
modelled and analysed in this study. The observation is that the noise level and distribution is reduced 
on varied AoA of the blades. However, future work is needed to address the limitations of the current 
the study that includes range to revolutions of the turbine and for the azimuthal increment over 3600 
revolutions.

Abstract 
 
The growth of blockchain technology, a decentralized database of immutable information stored in “blocks,” has 
recently fostered much interest due to its potential usage and integration from a business standpoint. Blockchain 
application yields greater transparency and traceability of products, an asset for wine sales by ensuring quality and 
authenticity. This paper examines the potential application of blockchain to commercial wine produced by the Wine 
and Viticulture Department at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). This study 
examines existing and future supply chains along with various blockchain formats and accessibility levels. We suggest 
a permissioned public blockchain be implemented for Cal Poly’s commercial wine program.

1. Introduction  
The need for wine supply chain traceability presents itself in the face of issues like counterfeiting, adulteration, and 
the use of harmful additives. In 2016, the projected worth of fraudulent fine wine amounted to $3 billion (Schmitt 
2016). Various traceability systems - such as barcode, radio frequency identification (RFID), quick response (Q.R.) 
code, electronic product code (EPC) – present ways to store traceability information in centralized databases, but face 
concerns with authenticity, as information can be reproduced or forged at any time (Biswas, Muthukkumarasamy and 
Tan 2017). Blockchain (B.C.) technology provides a promising solution for increased traceability and security, holding 
data in a decentralized, immutable database. 
  
California accounts for nearly 90% of the wine produced in the United States, and if treated as its own country, would 
be the fourth leading wine producer globally (Bayar 2020). With the importance of wine production in local and 
national economies, the Cal Poly Wine and Viticulture Department, located in Central California, was established 
over 30 years ago, becoming one of the largest Wine and Viticulture programs in the United States (Lecot 2020). The 
Cal Poly Wine Club provides a retail outlet for the department, which is expanding with the development of the Justin 
and J. Lohr Center for Wine and Viticulture projected for completion in Fall 2021.  
  
Cal Poly Wine currently follows a 3-tier distribution system with the total wine volume sold fairly evenly through 
three general outlets: on-campus, local businesses, and online through calpolywine.com. This program may benefit 
from the application of blockchain technology to ensure transparency and traceability among each supply chain entity. 
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1. Wine Supply Chain  
The global volume of wine sold is projected to reach 2.7 billion 9-liter cases, with a value of $207 billion in 2022. In 
2017, the United States was the most valuable wine market ($34.8 billion), followed by France ($16.7 billion), then 
China ($16.5 billion). The magnitude of these markets is largely based on population size. China’s wine market value 
is expected to pass France as the second most valuable global wine market, with an estimated worth over $19 billion 
for 2020. Despite having markets with less overall worth, other European countries present more established wine 
industries, with Portugal, Italy, and France having the highest global per capita consumption (35 liters per person per 
year) (Elfman 2019).

Figure 4: Cost of Blockchain Services in Azure  
Picture and pricing information: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/blockchain-service/ 
 
For implementation, in this case, we investigated using the Microsoft Azure platform. From a cost perspective, two 
tables from the paper “Using Blockchain Services to Set Up A Business-Class Consortium Network,” the cost was 
estimated for both AWS and Azure’s blockchain solutions. Azure had a lower cost solution at $221.00 in a 700-hour 
test period, whereas AWS costs $473.20 (Mooers and Reimers 2020). As students, AWS and Azure were the most 
available platforms to us, so we looked into these to estimate the cost. Other options include a homegrown blockchain 
solution or working with a contracting service, but those were outside of our available budget. Since Azure supports 
our needs with their Quorum technology that alters the existing Ethereum technology to meet the privacy requirements 
of an enterprise, this supports our needs for Cal Poly wine. We estimated the monthly cost using Azure in a production 
environment as follows:  
 
For Cal Poly’s application on blockchain, we would have three members (Growers, Producer, and Distributor), would 
likely not need more than 10 G.B. of storage, so the cost calculation is as follows:  
Node Cost: 3 members * 1 node/member * .318/node/hour * 700 hours/month =  $667.80 
Storage Cost: 3 members * 1 node/member * 10 GB/node * .05/GB/node/month = $1.5 
Total monthly cost using Azure: $669.30 
 
Note: If extending the blockchain to entities outside of Cal Poly, “Blockchain-based Wine Supply Chain Traceability 
System” recommends including the entities: grape growers, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, 
filler/packer, finished goods distributor, wholesaler, and retailer. In this model, the wine producer, bulk distributor, 
filler/packer, finished goods distributor, and wholesaler make up the consensus group. Modified to Cal Poly Wine’s 
supply chain, this blockchain would include the entities mentioned, excluding the bulk distributor, transit cellar, and 
wholesaler, which are not separate entities in the supply chain. (Biswas et al. 2017) 
 
5. Conclusion  
Developing a consortium blockchain system on the Azure platform would cost roughly $669.30 a month but will 
provide the consumers of Cal Poly wine accurate, verified, and thorough information of where their wine is produced 
and distributed from. It will also benefit Cal Poly as they work to manage their blockchain as they will now have 
easier access and control over their supply chain database, will have more accessible means of record-keeping, and a 
simpler time connecting with the different entities. For the next steps, we recommend that Cal Poly Wine look into 
integrating one of the permissioned public blockchains discussed in this paper. This will allow Cal Poly Wine to 
improve their experience with managing and analyzing their Supply Chain data, as well as provide their consumers 
with a more reliable and extensive report on the wine they purchase.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain management is not only crucial for manufacturing industries but also for service industries. It 
deals with managing the process of having the right item in the right quantity at the right time at the right 
place for the right price in the proper condition to the right customer, and the importance of collaboration 
of supply chain management with data management is undeniable in the health care management system. 
This research aims for an integrated and collaborative approach between healthcare supply chain 
stakeholders that optimizes the supply chain in providing high-quality service at a relatively lower cost with 
more accurate forecasting, exploring trends in different calendar parts to effective decision-making. It also 
focuses on managing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) efficiently through inventory monitoring using 
Data Management and Data Analytics tools, improving safety, and enhanced Quality Assurance. As the 
health care supply chain systems differ based on the country and their health care management system 
facilities, this study was only concentrated on the health care supply chain of Bangladesh.

1. Introduction  
The healthcare system accounts for providing high-quality healthcare services at affordable expenditures being a 
fundamental right for the citizens of a nation. The healthcare system is confronting rising challenges of providing the 
services at lower costs due to striving from operational inefficiencies of which expense, about 45% comes from the 
supply chain itself that  comprises suppliers, drugs, and consumables (Alotaibi & Mehmood, 2018). Organizations 
have to look for an approach that optimizes their supply chains through more accurate visualization and predictability 
of any demand surge or factors that affect materials planning through proper management of Electronic Medical 
Records(EMRs). A Digital Transformation of the Supply Chain of the healthcare sector can address the issues 
prevailing in the business process of a healthcare service sector that impedes efficient management that pertains 
unavailability of medication to patients in proper time impacts the overall quality of care received by a patient. 
The healthcare supply chain involves multiple stakeholders that generate a massive volume of Electronic Medical 
Records(EMRs) stored by healthcare organizations opening a new horizon of improving services by extracting 
information analyzing data in the current era of advanced technologies. Such data analysis measures and data 
management can facilitate inventory monitoring seeking solutions for existing issues, and eradicating fraud, abuse,  
waste, and errors (Alotaibi & Mehmood, 2018). Thus, Integration developed through Digital Supply Networks 
enhancing connectivity among stakeholders can promote the inventory replenishment cycle's visibility, which allows 
better surveillance of a firm's operations.

905","In this process, we can observe that the wholesaler controls the whole database system and the hospital authority. In the previous 
case, we can remember that wholesaler was unable to know the demand at the actual time. The wholesaler was informed about the 
demand when the authority of the hospital tried to inform. And at that time, wholesalers have to fulfill the demand without knowing 
the capacity of the wholesaler's inventory. When the wholesaler finds out the capacity he had, then he started packaging and 
delivering.  
 
The main difference is that the wholesaler was unable to know the actual scenario of the hospital inventory earlier. The wholesaler 
used to know about the demand when the hospital authority informed him whether the needed product available in the hospital 
inventory or not. As a result, the needed medicine or product was becoming stock out at hospital at a certain period and it was 
becoming a very crisis moment until the new package arriving at the hospital from wholesaler. But with this solution the wholesaler 
will be monitoring the hospital inventory and his own inventory by the central database system every day and will be able to know 
about the amount of medicine present in the hospital inventory. By knowing this information, the wholesaler will be able to decide 
when to replenish the hospital's inventory with which product with exact amount needed. There is no chance of stock out of any 
product in the hospital inventory anymore. And the patient will get their service very well indeed which is the main priority for any 
healthcare organization. 
 
5. Challenges and Limitations 
Although digital footprint data analytics offer a wide range of opportunities to enhance healthcare supply chain performance 
through integrated database management in inventory monitoring, it also comes up with multiple challenges.This mainly occurs 
due to the criticality of the healthcare industry's inventory management, being different from other industries. The critical 
challenges in the path of implementing digital footprint database management in the healthcare supply chain can be illustrated as 
follows. 
 
5.1. Digital Infrastructure Related Challenges 
Having adequate infrastructure favoring the application of digital supply chain, integrating stakeholders’ inventory data, usage of 
data analytics tools is a prerequisite for effective utilization of its potential that can optimize inventory management. In order to 
gain competitive advantages and take the journey forward, high speed and stable internet connectivity need to be ensured, which 
has been one of the key challenges to confront.  
 
5.2 Mutual Conflicting Goals of Stakeholders 
Stakeholders in the healthcare supply chain differ from their goals arising conflicts upon compliance of information sharing, 
accessibility that impedes in forming a transparent and collaborative network. Based on proper awareness programs and knowledge 
propagation of the benefits such as advanced risk prediction and greater supply chain visibility, this barrier can be brought to a 
minimalistic level, paving the way for compliance on database accessibility. 
 
5.3. Data Safety and Cyber Security Concerns 
To prevent harm to IT infrastructure and a firm’s reputation, it's a challenge to keep digital assets secured and the stakeholders have 
to abide by data protection laws and privacies. For instance, different measures, such as secure cloud archiving and complaint cloud 
backup, need to be undertaken for safety concerns of their high-value information while extracting value from digital footprint 
making way for data management plans (Digital Footprint Data Management, 2020). 
 
5.4. Lack of Trained Personnel in the Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
Digital footprint data has a lot of potential in managing the healthcare supply chain with improved efficiency through appropriate 
database management. To utilize such potentiality, needs of trained personnel with database management and data analytics skills 
is undeniable. Hence, managing data in a meaningful manner, from the onset of data collection, storage and exploration require 
trained professionals to make the best use of possibilities. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
This paper focuses on the implementation of efficient management of inventory undertaking VMI Approach through effective 
monitoring of inventory data generated from the digital footprint. Embracing modern technologies in inventory monitoring can 
have a positive consequential impact on low inventory control methods providing tremendous time and cost savings as well. A 
study reveals the adoption of data analytics-based inventory monitoring in Cardinal health has experienced an 84% improvement 
in time spent placing orders (Lange, 2020). Improved data analysis from the digital footprint of inventory order, replenishment, 
storage, and the delivery cycle can better aid in having enhanced visibility, predictability, and trend analysis. This can facilitate a 
dynamic digital supply chain design to reduce figures of 28% order delivery failure due to stock unavailability obtained from an 
analysis (Mustaffa & Potter, 2009). Hence, data-driven inventory management through collaboration utilizing digital footprint 
database management can analyses data patterns and support informed decision making among healthcare supply chain 
stakeholders improving overall system performance.

Abstract 
 
In this modern era, the use of digital wallets has become a trend in people's lifestyles in the transaction. In Indonesia, 
there are 38 digital wallets with official licenses, one of which is OVO. In its development, OVO is considered to have 
a very rapid growth to successfully occupy the position of the two most popular e-wallets in Indonesia. Because of 
this, this research was conducted to determine consumer preferences in using OVO in Bandung. 
In this study, the method used is a quantitative method with descriptive analysis and factor analysis as data processing 
assisted with SPSS. The sampling technique used is a nonprobability sampling technique with a purposive sampling 
type. The respondents surveyed in this study were 100 people who reside in Bandung and use OVO for transactions. 
The results showed that eleven initial factors became consumers' preferences in using OVO in Bandung. Based on the 
results of data processing with descriptive analysis, consumer preference variables are included in the high category, 
with a score of 81.85%. Based on factor analysis, the factor formed is one factor, namely competitive advantage, with 
the dominant factor being security, which has the most considerable correlation of 0.929 or 92, 9%.

1. Introduction 
Organization must response to how the environment changes, furthermore the leader must maintain their organization 
to every change inside their organization and adjusting to the transform itself (Fakhri et al., 2020). Technology is 
change rapidly in the current digital era. All aspects have begun to change from what was once traditional and now has 
shifted towards digital needs. People are obtaining various digital benefits by accessing different things through 
smartphones and the internet network. Within the financial sector, there are several innovations, one of which is in 
technology-based financial services with a modern concept known as financial technology or fintech. Financial 
technology is a term used to refer an innovation in the field of financial services. The impact of fintech is the 
development of electronic payment systems or e-payments, where the value of money is stored in electronic media 
based on chips or servers. Several electronic media that support the use of e-payments in the community are chip-
based e-money and server-based e-wallets. The E-wallet itself is application-based electronic money, where the use of 
e-wallet has a broader and more dominant term for daily non-cash transactions by the public, starting from offline 
shopping needs at retail and online outlets. Online transactions are increasing goes along with e-wallet growth 
(Pradana & Novitasari, 2017). In Indonesia, there are many digital-based financial services. In major cities, this service 
is commonly used by many people for practical reasons. There is no need to prepare cash when making transactions. 
In Indonesia, according to data from Bank Indonesia, there are 38 digital wallets or e-wallets with official licenses. 
However, of the 38 e-wallets, there are only ten e-wallet platforms that are popular in Indonesia. Majorly speaking, 
local developer e-wallet applications still dominate cashless payment methods in the country. The top five locally-
owned e-wallet applications with most users are still Go-Pay, OVO, Dana, LinkAja, and Jenius. Competition between 
e-wallets is indeed very tight. However, Go-Pay still dominates the e-wallet market in Indonesia, where the position 
remains stable in the first place. However, there are lots of newcomers, such as OVO and Dana. Dana is arguably quite 
aggressive because, at the time of Q4 2018, Dana was immediately ranked second as the most popular e-wallets in 
Indonesia. Dana has done to strengthen its position by collaborating with other e-commerce, which is something that is

6. Factor Labelling 
After grouping the factors, the final step in analyzing the data is by using the factor analysis method, which is naming 
the new factors (labeling). Based on the results of the total variance explained data processing, it is known from eleven 
initial factors that exist. Eventually, only one factor is formed, where the factor that is created is called the OVO 
consumer preference factor. This factor consists of sub-factors/ sub-variables such as easy to make an account, more 
innovative products than traditional banks, the greater level of trust, efficiency, security, benefit, promotion, 
connectivity, product quality, product features, product style, and design. Those variables are essential things that 
OVO must have to compete with its competitors and attract consumers to continue to use OVO as a transaction means. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of data processing with descriptive analysis, consumer preference variables consisting of eleven 
sub-variables studied sequentially, with an average total score of the highest, namely: connectivity 85%, efficiency 
83.95%, security 82.8%, promotion 82.25%, product style and design 81.95%, profit 81.9%, easy to make an account 
80.6%, more innovative products than traditional banks 79.95%, product features 79.8%, greater level of trust 79.72%, 
and product quality 79.46%. So that overall, the 11 sub-variables are consumer preferences in using OVO because 
they are included in the high category with a total average of 81.58%. According to Fakhri (2019), the level of 
satisfaction must be maintained with carefully, because it can show the level of organization strength 
Based on the results of data processing with factor analysis, a single new factor is formed called the OVO consumer 
preference factor, which consists of 11 successive sub-factors, namely: security, connectivity, efficiency, the greater 
level of trust, promotion, style and product design, product quality, more innovative products than traditional banks, 
profits, easy to make an account, and product features. Of the eleven OVO consumer preference sub-factors, it can be

Abstract 
 
Production systems generally struggle with defective products resulting from human error, machine break-down, or 
an imperfect production system. Reworking is one of the strategies to deal with this issue and rework planning involves 
the production planning and scheduling of defective items along with the master production planning. The importance 
of rework planning becomes more important when the products are perishable with a limited lifecycle. This research 
presents a linear bi-objective mathematical model to determine the production lot-sizing and scheduling as well as 
rework scheduling in a parallel machine system for perishable products. The optimization model aims to minimize the 
cost and the makespan of the production and rework processes at the same time. We test the model results on a small 
size problem solved using CPLEX algorithm and address the complexity of the large size problem using BAT 
metaheuristic algorithm. Numerical experiments and sensitivity of the results to the model varying parameters are 
analyzed on a sample case study with varying size.

1. Introduction  
In a manufacturing environment, the main goal of planning is to fully utilize the resources to satisfy the customers’ 
demand while gaining maximum profit over the planning horizon. The scope of planning can be categorized into 
three levels of time ranges: long-term, medium-term, and short-term. The long-term planning deals with facility 
location and allocation, tools, and process choices without paying much attention to lower level details. The 
medium-term focuses on forecasting production quantities or lot sizing over a finite planning horizon, and the 
short-term planning mainly deals with scheduling of daily operations (Hu and Hu 2016, Karimi et al. 2003). While 
the lot sizing problem is a medium-term production optimization problem to determine the production quantity in 
each period to meet the customer demand, it could also be formulated to address the multi-level planning problems 
where there exist inter-dependencies among items at different production levels, typically imposed by the

920",,"to process products in a multi-product setting. The complexity of the problem is handled by utilization of BAT 
algorithm as a meta-heuristic which has shown to be very efficient in producing objective values with noticeable 
improvement of solution time. While the process time has a noticeable effect on the inventory and production costs, 
the rework inventory and rework production costs are mainly affected by the rework inventory costs. In addition, 
the proposed model is shown to improve the maximum completion time of the products, shortage, and total costs. 
Based on our analysis, there exist multiple promising research directions. While we are assuming each product is 
processed only on one machine, application of the proposed model on cases where there exist sequence 
requirements in the production processes could make the modeling more challenging specially when the setups are 
sequence dependent. In addition, as the planning problem deals with future periods planning, the inherent demand, 
cost or capacity uncertainty could officially be considered in the modeling framework. Finally, machine 
breakdowns are another reality in the production systems which could affect the production systems performance. 
Consideration of machines downtime could make the problem more interesting yet more complex.

Abstract 
 
Recently, the issue of environmental preservation has become an international topic of discussion. Amid the severe 
environmental conditions that occur, awareness has emerged in the community about environmental preservation, 
which is marked by the emergence of organizations and movements that care for the environment such as Green 
Peace, Earth Hour, and Go Green. One of the products that are beneficial to consumers but, on the other hand, is also a 
source of pollution to the environment is cosmetics. The Body Shop is one of the companies in Indonesia that has 
pioneered green marketing. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze what factors build consumer Green 
Brand Awareness on The Body Shop products. 
This research uses descriptive quantitative methods. The population in this study is the consumers of The Body Shop 
products who live in Bandung. The sampling technique in this study is non-probability sampling with purposive 
sampling technique with a sample of 100 respondents 
Based on the research results, it can be concluded that the respondent's responses to the green brand awareness 
variable have a percentage of 75.5%, which is in a good category. The results of this study generate two new factors 
called the product perception factor and company perception. The most dominant factor is the product perception 
factor with a variance value of 61.230 and the second component has a variance value of 10.322.

1. Introduction 
Organization must response to how the environment changes, and the leader must maintain their organization to adapt 
with the transformation itself (Fakhri et al., 2020). Environmental preservation has become a discussion in the 
international community, where several issues have become a critical concern for the whole world, along with the 
many problems that arise. Amid severe environmental conditions that occur, awareness has emerged in the community 
about environmental preservation (Purnomo, et al., 2020). Awareness of environmental preservation is marked by the 
emergence of organizations and movements that care for the environment such as Green Peace, Earth Hour, and Go 
Green. This concern for the environment changes the way consumers view and consider the choices of goods, their 
behavior, and their purchasing decisions. The theory of consumer behavior states that consumer purchasing decisions 
are influenced by external factors that come from outside the consumer and internal factors that arise from within the 
consumer. Nowadays, consumers have a better understanding of choosing products that environmentally friendly, safe 
for health, and other green products that minimize harshness to the environment, and it is also connecting with 
customer satisfaction wherein the increase of satisfaction can guarantee to improve performance (Fakhri et al., 2019). 
Various studies that have been conducted over the last few years (Nassani, et al., 2020; MateusJerónimo et al., 2020) 
have indicated that consumers are aware of and willing to pay more for ""go green"" efforts. 
According to Bellucci (2020) people who care about environmental sustainability will change their consumption 
behavior, such as making savings or replacing consumer goods with goods that are more environmentally friendly. 
The results of a survey by WWF-Indonesia and the Nielsen survey in 2017 show that as many as 63% of Indonesian 
consumers are willing to consume environmentally friendly products at a higher price. This thing indicates a 
significant increase in consumer awareness of the consumption of environmentally friendly products and indicates the

8. Factor Labelling 
The naming of new factors using the surrogate variable is seen from the variable that has the highest loading factor 
value. Based on the results of the data, ten factors initiate the highest results from table 7, refer into two factors which 
are the Product Perception and Company perception factors 
 
5. Conclusion 
There is a preliminary study of 10 initial factors that are used as consumer preferences in establishing green brand 
awareness of The Body Shop products, namely; Product Perception, Company perception, Meaning of the 
environmental slogans and symbols, Notice an environmental label, Packaging, Label, Content Composition, 
Remember some of the environmental symbols, Environmental efforts and Environmental label's and slogans 
Based on the results of data processing in the factor analysis, two new factors were formed from ten factors, which is 
Product Perception with a value of 0.925, and Company perception with a value of 0.917 The most dominant factor is 
the Product Perception factor with a variance value of 61.230. Therefore, the most potent value factor in building 
consumer green brand awareness of The Body Shop products is Product Perception. Then the second component is the 
Company perception which has a variance value of 10.322. Hence, The Body Shop must maintain its strongest value 
in order to increase customer brand awareness toward their products. If a company can innovate and maintain its green 
base product, it will produce and increase awareness of consumers while using the company’s product (Widodo & 
Wahid, 2020).

Abstract 
 
To extend the lifetime of a distributed power network, that consists of several generators supplying several load 
centers, according to a joint Gaussian probability distribution functions (PDF) of various random variables with 
estimated probabilities of source-load power coverage. The probability of any generator covering a load center is 
assumed to be readily known from statistical data. The nth order joint Gaussian PDF of all generators to any load 
center is calculated according to variations in the value of the mean covered power. This procedure is expanded to all 
load centers with the assumption that they are independent. The overall joint PDF with probabilities above a certain 
threshold value, are selected in an algorithm to prolong whole network lifetime by removing redundancies in powering 
all generators in same time. The contributions of each generator in supplying overall network loads, are then estimated 
in an intuitive method according to the evaluated probabilities of each generator supplying whole network load. The 
lifetime extension is demonstrated in a case study example.

1. Introduction 
One of the most important economical concern in power generation networks is the lifetime of power generators, as 
well as associated machines, auxiliary and supplementary equipment. The overall network lifetimes can be extended 
when generators are loaded adequately, or when there exist a halt in their operation, such as elapsed times for 
maintenance, overhaul, check out and repair occasions, cases that are difficult to achieve when maintaining power 
supply to load demand is crucial. Generators are normally synchronized in parallel to increase availability for load 
demands, which means that all machines are spinning continuously, even for light loads. In low voltage (LV) power 
distribution networks, such as gas turbines, diesel engines and wind turbines, it is required to activate all generators 
of such lower ratings to cover distributed load centers continuously. To increase the overall network lifetime, some 
generators need to be disconnected at certain times, as outlined in many books (Glover 2002), (Freris 2008), (Boyle 
2003). 
 
This study investigates probable powering schemes to make the distribution network more resilient to unnecessary 
high operating costs, and to enhance the extension of the network lifetime, since lifetime and consumed energy are 
strongly related. With such distributed networks, it is required to arrange for combination groups or subsets of 
generators, powered at different times during a certain load cycle, and as a result, redundancies of activating all 
generators are avoided, leading to an increase of the lifetime of the units that are idle or inactive, as well as that their 
overall operational costs will be reduced. These power networks are analogous to ad hoc sensor networks (Jing 2014) 
in which subsets of sensors covering target zones, a case widely investigated in the literature for the purpose of 
increasing ad hoc and wireless sensors network lifetimes, with employing algorithms such as greedy optimum 
algorithm (Hongwu 2009) distribution coverage algorithm (Dhawan 2009) and energy balance algorithm (Zhang 
2009).

939","Table 4. Generator combinations with random variable variation values 3, 4 and 5 
 
 
 
The values of these variations are comparable with the mean and variances of the assumed PDF’s of the three generators. 
We may consider as many variations as inticipated from realistic situations, and the average of these variations is to be 
used. As seen from Table 4, generators X, Y and Z share 62.3%, 14.6% and 23% respectively of the total operating time, 
when average variations are imposed. We can conclude from the above calculations, that 190% of the total generators 
lifetime is saved. 
 
It must be noted, that whereas a threshold value of  0.5e-4, has been selected in the overall joint probability, for Table 1, 
any other appropriate value can be selected, yet the contributions of generators activation, will be changed accordingly. 
This threshold value depends on many factors, such as limitations on minimum or maximum allowed generated power 
of generators, accuracy of the method used, estimate of the variation of covered power, etc. Further work may be 
investigated in selecting this threshold value. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The lifetime of a network comprising a number of generators supplying the demand of several load centers, is increased 
by removing redundancies by activating only some of the generators with individual contributions, using a novel 
algorithm that calculates each generator probability of supplying the total load. In a case study of 3 generators supplying 
two load centers, the lifetime is increased by 190%. 
 
In this study, we calculate the joint Gaussian PDF of several assumed random probabilities of network elements, such as 
maintaining continuous supply probability, different fault probabilities, least cost probabilites, etc. that can readily be 
estimated from available statistical field data.  
 
It is noted that redundancies removal depends on the amount of variations considered in the mean values of the selected 
random variables. For every variation, redundancies are removed by selecting the maximum probabilities among the 
different combinations of generators’ combinations. Adequate values of variations are assumed for the same case study 
example, in which the average is used in the evaluation of the total joint Gaussian PDF. 
 
It is assumed that the joint probabilities of all generators to any load, are independent, and whereas cross multiplication 
of of all these probabilities is implemented in finding total or resultant probability, other methods can be used, such as 
calculating the minimum joint probabilities in 2 or 3-dimensional space.

Abstract 
 
Supply Chain Collaboration is cross enterprise and can be vertical and/or horizontal. Vertical supply 
chain collaboration involves collaboration and coordination with customers and suppliers whilst 
horizontal collaboration involves collaboration with competitors, government institutions and other 
important stakeholders. It is generally accepted that supply chain collaboration leads to competitive 
advantage. Whilst a lot of literature has been published that shows the importance of both horizontal and 
vertical supply chain collaboration in enhancing competitive advantage, very few studies have focused on 
the factors that influence successful virtual collaboration and the achievement of competitive advantage 
due to supply chain virtual collaboration. This paper proposes a conceptual model that attempts to close 
this gap utilizing the concept of virtual clustering.

Introduction 
Clustering 
The general idea of clustering appears to have been first introduced in the literature in the 19th 
century around 1920 by Alfred Marshall through studying the economic importance of what he 
termed ‘industrial districts’, and then later the same idea was refined around the early 1990’s by 
Michael Porter, who renamed the phenomenon as ‘clusters’ (Bell 2005; Lublinski, 2003; 
Wennberg and Lindqvist, 2010; Feltzensten et al, 2012 and Kulakova, 2014). Marshall (1920) 
noted that an industry concentrated in certain localities created certain advantages for firms 
located close to one another. The arguments raised in Alfred Marshall’s work was that there were 
many advantages for organizations following the same skilled trade to organize closely to one 
another. One of the advantages of this industrial agglomeration as discussed by Marshall was 
that the mysteries of the trade became no mysteries anymore since these mysteries appeared to 
be in the air with everyone in the locality easily getting access to them. Notwithstanding the

on collaborative capability. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Having reviewed both the organizational clustering literature and supply chain literature the 
model in Figure 1 seems to have a potential to move the current knowledge and understanding in 
virtual inter organisational collaboration forward. This is achieved by addressing both issues of 
what makes virtual organizational clustering and technologically driven supply chain 
collaboration relationships successful. Such collaborations involve both vertical supply chain 
(buyer-supplier and supplier-customer relationships) and horizontal supply chain (university-
industry relationships and government-industry relationships). This research will also advance 
the debate on organizational clustering paradigm, which has traditionally focused only on 
geographic space, especially as technology shrinks the world into a small global space. This 
research will proceed into the next stage which will operationalize the model proposed in Figure 
1 and test the necessary hypotheses in comparison with the traditional clustering concepts.

DMAIC methodology is fundamentally viewed as a process that focuses on improvement and variation

‘gap’ activities is recorded, the ‘gap’ analysis is conducted using causes and effect diagram and Pareto charts. 
And the outcome has revealed areas that have contributed to the Line Manager (LM) daily routine inefficiency, 
among which include ‘meetings’, ‘scanning’, ‘follow-up’, ‘walking’ and others. Proposed improvement is listed

Introduction 
 
The current Covid-19 pandemic has added to the already turbulent economic condition facing the world at large 
and the manufacturing sector in particular. Also, with the growing competitiveness and customers demand for 
high quality products, companies are obliged to promote efficiency, reduce production cost and enhance 
productivity (Mohamad et al., 2019). Among available strategies to be used for that end include the application 
of Six-sigma. Six-Sigma is a highly disciplined process that enables world-class quality and continuous 
improvement methods to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction (Ohno, 1988). 
According to Mohamad et al., (2019), Six Sigma efforts are directed towards the minimization of waste and 
non-value-added activities (NVA) while maximizing customer satisfaction. The implementation of a Six-Sigma 
methodology aims at achieving error-free business performances, focusing on improving quality by helping 
organizations produce products and services better, faster and cheaper (Anup and Shende, 2011). The Six Sigma 
has the potential to realize cost savings and improved quality on the shop floor (Kumar and Sosnoki, 2009). 
The word associated to six-sigma such as ‘waste’ come from the Japanese word ‘Muda’ referring to the human 
activities that exploit the resources in the company but does not create any profit or value (Mohamad et al., 
2019). Taiichi Ohno (1988), a former Toyota executive, presented this concept of ‘Muda’ in the manufacturing 
industry. In Table 1 below, seven classes of waste that typically affect a manufacturing process was defined by 
Ohno (1988): 
 
Table 1: Seven Waste of Lean Manufacturing 
Types of waste 
Explanations 
Over processing 
Adding more value to a product than the customer actually requires such as painting 
area that will never be seen or be exposed to corrosion. 
Waiting 
It is the act of doing nothing or working slowly whilst waiting for a previous step in 
the process. Waiting occurs when operators stand in between two operations for reason 
such as late delivery of essential products to replenish the current shortage.  
Transportation 
It is the movement of products from one location to another. 
E.g.: This could be from a WIP warehouse to the welding shop or from the production 
facility in china to the assembly line in America. This transportation adds no value to

961","Control  
To ensure that the “gap” is reduced from 49% to the predicted figure close to 0 %, the primary research goal 
was to examine the reason for the large “gap” as stated in Table 3 and Figure 8. Both Table and Figure have 
given ways for the Line Manager’s work process improvement. As stated by Baraka et al. (2019), ‘with 
leadership, come responsibility, competition, accountability and reward’. Therefore, a standardized process was 
developed from the exposed areas leading to time and productivity wastage. The new working procedure was 
not only drafted and branded at the view of all line operators, leaders, feeder, etc., but training was also 
administrated to all employees involved on the line. To improve the LM work process in a “out of Line 
Manager’ control”, meeting was limited to decision that requires consensus. Any direct orders from hierarchy 
were now delivered either in person or via intermediaries or by telephonic or email means. Other “out of Line 
Manager’ control” activities such as scanning” required replacement while the “follow-up” process, regularly 
used by the LM during the two days study was minimized by standardizing the LM work process. In “Within 
Line Manager’ control”, activities such as walking to various places for various reasons were a key cause of 
wastage. Reallocating of tasks to various team members permitted a line balancing. Finally, the remaining “gap” 
involved extended tea break, driving forklift or feeding the line. Just as the previous activity, a standardized 
process using line balancing was developed and the Line Manager (LM) productivity was maximized.   
 
Conclusion 
 
The intent of this research was to reduce the 49% “gap” between Line Manager’s planned activity and 
completed activities “within the Line Manager Control” and “out of the Line Manager control”. A two days’ 
time study was conducted, and the outcome has revealed “gaps” needing improvements. Among them included 
meetings, walking, requisition, scanning and other were the main reason of money and time wasting. Six Sigma 
DMAIC methodology was used with the objective of defining, measuring, analyzing, identifying, improving and 
controlling the Line Manager’s productivity. Among the ‘gap’ activities listed, some activities were classified as 
“within the Line Manager control” while the remaining were viewed as “out of the Line Manager control” in 
Figure 8.  Although no additional time was given for the implementation of this research outcome and 
improvement proposal, this research shows that DMAIC Six Sigma in Lean Manufacturing can offer 
organizations a practical way of increasing workers efficiency and reducing wastes especially during this 
challenging time of the pandemic of the Covid-19.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain strategies in the healthcare industry are vital in today’s era. As there is an evident gap in the 
literature regarding this concept, the authors propose Lean and Agile as process strategies. Lean is a popular 
methodology that focuses on providing value to the intended customer by eliminating waste, ensuring 
continuous improvement, and reducing cycle time. Agile is a widely practiced project management method 
incorporated with software development characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work 
and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans. This exploratory paper aims to bridge the gap in the 
literature and construct a robust supply chain model that should be prepared for quicker response to 
uncertainties and reducing process cycle time by incorporating lean and agile as functional process 
parameters. It also focuses on overall performance improvement in each functional sub-divisions of the 
supply chain through this hybrid strategy, facilitates faster patient service, and provides a better service 
level to the patients by utilizing available resources efficiently. Recommendations have been suggested 
taking into account several criteria including patients’ reason to visit, seasonal effect, demography, waiting 
time for OPD etc. Healthcare is undoubtedly a vast area, and the agendas and policies are different 
correspondingly to geographic entities. This study was primarily based on the healthcare industry of 
Bangladesh. Further study can introduce a new possibility of applying this strategy to other regions as well.

1. Introduction  
 
The concept of Supply Chain Management was coined around the early ’80s, and soon it became popular among 
operations managers throughout the world. Nowadays, this concept is going to be more and more vital not only in 
manufacturing industries but also in the service industries. Especially in healthcare sectors, the introduction of an 
efficient and effective supply chain has yet not been inaugurated. Health care industries worldwide have grown to a 
vast extent today, and due to scarce resources and increasing demand, the researchers are now driven to focus on new 
approaches and methodologies to withstand the newly discovered challenges associated with healthcare service 
providers. In third world countries like Bangladesh, the need for a well thought out approach and a robust, efficient 
strategy is imminent. Also, the cost cutting measurements are of vital importance in healthcare organizations. It is 
estimated that Supply chain constitutes 25-30 percent of operational costs for hospitals (Hana and Sethuraman, 2005; 
Roark, 2005; Nachtmann and Pohl, 2008). So, an equilibrium between cost and service quality in health care has been 
a highly disputed issue for a long time. This indicates that reducing lead time and associated costs without sacrificing 
the care quality is crucial. 
Even though we have a few appreciable efforts in the healthcare industry of Bangladesh, a lack of academic research 
in the field of health care supply chain management still exists (Shah et al., 2008). The present situation in the 
healthcare sector of Bangladesh is quite a bit scattered, and there is an apparent absence of any well-planned strategy 
to facilitate the effectiveness of the supply chain. The implementation of Supply Chain Management to ensure proper 
responsiveness towards the patients and provide the best possible care and medication through efficient utilization of 
existing resources, is more complex than in any other industries causing these practices not to be adopted in

973",,"Bangladesh exhibits high complexity and balancing the need for functional specialization, and efficient, high-quality 
patient flow system is an important factor (Aronsson et al., 2011). Hence, there are some limitations in regard to 
applying this strategy in the healthcare sector of this country. 
Firstly, the lack of required infrastructural integrity and the mind setup of the responsible government individuals is 
crucial. As Government hospitals are the primary destination of the general patients, we have to propose and manage 
the officials about the necessity and positive outcomes from this system. As for the private hospitals, respective 
hospital owners have to have a proper understanding of the process and this will encourage them to invest in this 
regard. As the whole challenge here is to make a behavioral change throughout the organization, this is a must that 
each and every individual has a clear understanding of their responsibilities to keep this flow uninterrupted. 
The present situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a restriction to the authors to conduct a detailed survey, 
and consequently, the sample size was inadequate. Many of the hospitals have put a restriction for the researchers and 
visitors as a preventive measure. Moreover, in this paper, Lean and Agile were studied as process parameters, whereas 
other parameters can be found and studied for further research. This can upraise the efficiency and effectiveness of 
the proposed model, as well. 
Numerous papers and researches have inspired the authors to implement a hybrid strategy by incorporating the two 
popular and widely practiced concepts in Bangladesh's perspective. This study was conducted specifically for 
Bangladesh, but this study's findings and recommendations can be further extended for a similar environment as 
Bangladesh. The authors welcome such attempts and believe collaboration and cooperation can excel in the supply 
chain's strength and uncover new possibilities for implementing the hybrid strategy.

Abstract 
 
Varying thermoelectric leg geometry and utilizing multiple thermoelectric modules (cascading) can greatly affect 
the performance of solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs), which utilize concentrated solar radiation in generating 
electricity. Hence, this conference paper presents a three-dimensional analysis of a two-stage variable leg solar 
thermoelectric generator (STEG) using ANSYS 2020 R2 software. The first-stage STEG utilizes the conventional 
rectangular leg geometry while the second-stage STEG comprises of the X-leg variable geometry. The hybrid two-
stage STEG is subjected to varying concentrated solar radiation, and the performance parameters of the first-stage 
STEG, second-stage STEG and two-stage STEG are evaluated simultaneously. Results indicate that under the same 
operating conditions, the second-stage STEG generates a higher temperature gradient, power output density and 
efficiency compared to the first-stage STEG. Results further reveal the inefficiency of the conventional rectangular 
leg in handling thermal energy in STEG systems. Finally, results indicate that the use of variable leg geometry in the 
second-stage STEG greatly improves the overall performance of the hybrid-two stage system. The results obtained 
in this paper could provide insightful information in the design of cascaded solar thermoelectric generators operating 
under varying solar radiation.

1. Introduction 
Research into the potential of the solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) as a viable and promising renewable 
energy alternative for harnessing solar energy has gained significant attention in recent times (Sundarraj et al., 
2014). This is because STEGs have several attractive features like being solid state devices & thus frictionless, 
noiseless, compact, and having little maintenance requirements. More so, they effectively convert thermal energy 
(solar irradiance or heat) into electricity through Seebeck effect (Zheng et al., 2014).  
However, to improve their efficiencies, several studies have been conducted, one of which is on the effect of 
thermoelectric (TE) leg geometry. For instance,  Al-Merbati et. al 2013 used finite element analysis (FEA) to study 
the effect of varying pin-leg geometry on the thermal stress, thermal efficiency and power output of a TEG and 
found that changing the pin geometry improves the efficiency of the device while reducing the maximum stress 
levels in the pin. Thus, they concluded that the efficiency and durability of TEGs can be increased using pin 
geometry. (Ali et al., 2015) carried out an exergy analysis on a TEG and studied the effect of bi-tapered pin 
geometry, defined by a dimensionless shaped parameter, on the first and second law efficiencies as well as the 
power output of the device. They discovered that the dimensionless shape parameter significantly affects the second-
law efficiency but only slightly affects the first-law efficiency and that the power output increases with increasing 
and decreasing values of the shape parameter. Thermodynamic analysis of a TEG was also carried out by (Lamba et 
al., 2017) in which they investigated the effect of leg geometry configuration and Thompson effect on the power 
output and efficiency of the device. Their results showed a trapezoidal shaped TEG gives a 2.32% and 2.31% 
increase in energy and exergy efficiency, respectively, as compared to conventional TEG geometry (i.e. rectangular 
legs). More so, the power output was enhanced. Validation of these results has also been done by a comparison of

The three-dimensional modelling and subsequent performance evaluation of a two-stage variable leg solar 
thermoelectric generator was conducted in this study.  ANSYS 2020 R2 software was used in solving the coupled 
thermoelectric field equations based on the finite element method. The effect of concentration ratio on performance 
parameters of the first-stage solar thermoelectric generator, using conventional rectangular geometry, and second-
stage solar thermoelectric generator, using X-leg geometry was studied. Also, the performance evaluation of the 
hybrid two-stage solar thermoelectric generator was carried out. The following conclusions are drawn from this 
study: 
• 
The X-leg geometry solar thermoelectric generator provided a higher temperature gradient compared to the 
conventional rectangular leg solar thermoelectric generator. 
• 
The temperature gradient, power output density and efficiency generated by the X-leg solar thermoelectric 
generator was 67%, 82% and 75% higher than that of the conventional rectangular solar thermoelectric 
generator.

Although the X-leg solar thermoelectric generator was placed below the conventional rectangular solar 
thermoelectric generator, it still offered a relatively higher performance compared to the conventional 
rectangular leg solar thermoelectric generator.

The use of variable X-leg geometry in two-stage solar thermoelectric generators can ensure higher 
performance parameters under the same operating conditions.

Abstract 
Siting an interconnected mini-grid project within an electricity distribution network requires a thorough investigation 
of alternative locations to determine where the solution is optimally required and guarantees quick returns on 
investment. This study employs location attributes and lifetime value of electricity consumers as decision-making 
criteria for determining an optimal location for a proposed project.  The location attributes criteria are consumer 
population, hours of supply, and energy consumption, while lifetime value criteria are profit and cost.  The paper 
utilizes an interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process as a multi-criteria decision-making methodology for the 
investigation. The study carried out a pairwise comparison of criteria using the experts’ opinion survey to determine 
the criteria weights. The study developed Location Attributes-Based Model (LABM) and Lifetime Value Model 
(LTVM) to obtain the weighted value of each alternate location. The cumulative values of LABM and LTVM are used 
in ranking the alternate locations to determine the optimal location for the interconnected mini-grid siting within an 
electricity distribution network. This model is recommended for interconnected mini-grid projects decision-making 
as utility company embraces embedded electricity generation to bridge the supply gap created by the epileptic national 
grid.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Electricity supply from Nigeria’s national grid remains unreliable, epileptic, and covers less than 60% of the 
country’s 203 million population over the 923,768km2 area it covers (Akinlabi and Oladokun 2015) (Oladokun and 
Asemota 2015) (Aliyu, Ramli & Saleh, 2013) (IEA & World Bank 2017), (CIA, 2019). The instability of electricity 
supply from the grid resulted in 80% of connected consumers being underserved with only a few hours of supply daily 
and supply gaps being filled with renewable and non-renewable electricity generation (Oyedepo, 2012) (Akinlabi and 
Oladokun 2020) (Adebimpe and Oladokun 2020). The electricity supply shortfall from 2000 to 2019 was estimated 
to be 2.4 billion kWh and has opened up the power sector for both local and foreign mini-grid investors (Oyedepo et. 
al., 2018). Nigeria's growing economy requires several mini-grids solutions to augment her generation capacity of 
12,522MW and daily generation which hovers above 4,000MW (Arowolo et al., 2019; USAID 2019).  
The Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has an operation regulation where a mini-grid is 
defined as an electricity-generating system with a capacity of not more than 1MW and distribution network 
infrastructure supplying electricity to customers connected or not connected to the licensed electricity distribution 
network (NERC, 2016). Some authors described it as local generation and distribution of between 10kW to 10MW 
electricity for less than 10,000 consumers (Franz et al., 2014; Lilienthal 2013; Greacen et al., 2013). Mini-grids can

989","4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
 The weights of the weighted criteria were obtained by inputting the experts’ opinion data into the 
mathematical model. The level of inconsistencies in the experts’ opinion was found to be ok with the consistency 
ration CR less than 0.1 and within the acceptable limit. The CR obtained is 0.092. From the experts’ opinion points of 
view on the criteria influencing the optimal siting of interconnected mini-grid in Nigeria, the results of the criteria 
weight result reveal that hours of supply (C2 = 0.4813) has the highest influence of 48%, followed by Profit (C4 = 
0.2623) at 26% and Cost (C5 = 0.1592) at 16%. Population has the least influence at just 4% (C1 = 0.0345).  
It is observed that other criteria, aside from hours of supply, accounted for 52% of the calculated weight as adjudged 
by the experts. This implies that hours of supply being the highest influencer in this study should not be taken as a 
sole decision criterion for optimal siting of interconnected mini-grid. Other criteria should also be taken into 
consideration when deciding on siting the project. 
 
5. RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Location Attributes-Based Model (LABM) and Lifetime Value Model (LTVM) developed in this study is 
recommended for quick decision making on the optimal siting of interconnected mini-grid. It will be a willing tool for 
mini-grid investors, utility companies, international development agencies when swift decision-making is required for 
the interconnected mini-grid project. The use of LABM and LTVM to obtain the weighted values of criteria in 
determining the optimal siting of interconnected mini-grid is faster than the investment-based site selection model 
developed by Akinlabi and Oladokun (2020). The volume of data required is lesser and easily available, unlike similar 
models. The model is remarkable for its swiftness in decision making for the optimal location for a mini-grid. One of 
the limitations of this study is that other factors like the infrastructural investment required, collection efficiency, 
customer tariff classification, technical, commercial, and collection losses were not considered due to difficulties in 
getting their data from the utility company. Future studies can employ other multi-criteria decision-making techniques 
and compare the outcome with the result of this study.

(Y). 
The risk variable (X2) has a tcount (5,290)> ttable (1,660) and a significance level of 0,000 <0.05. It can be 
concluded that partially there is a positive and significant effect of Risk (X2) on Financial Technology (Y). The 
magnitude of the influence of the risk variable is 33.3%. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the Variable Perception of Amity (X1) according to the 
responses of the respondents as a whole is in the very good category. This is indicated by the overall score 
obtained by the Ease of Perception variable of 81.3%, which means that it has a relevant effect, that Financial 
Technology services have easy-to-use access, application service operations are light and easy to use, easy to 
learn and able to do it yourself without help from others, and make transaction activities effective and efficient. 
Of the eight statements of the perception of convenience variables, although they were very good, the 
statement with the lowest score was that users of Financial Technology services do not need cash so that it is 
practical and easy to use, at 58.2%. This shows that cash payments are still needed without using Financial 
Technology services. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the risk variable (X2) according to the responses of the 
respondents as a whole is in quite well. The twelve statements of the Risk variable get an overall score of 
61.1% so they fall into the fairly agree category. Based on respondents' responses to twelve statements about 
the risk variable, the highest score was found in the Financial Technology service statement that is prone to 
fraud, with a score of 83.2%. This shows that Financial Technology is prone to fraud by irresponsible parties. 
Based on the results of the descriptive analysis, the independent variables of Financial Technology as a 
whole are in the fairly agreeable category. This can be seen from the respondents' answers to the twelve 
statements that obtained a score of 66.85%. Of the eight statements regarding the Financial Technology (Y) 
variable, the one with the highest score was found in the statement that Payment, Settlement, & Clearing 
services can help the transaction process effectively and efficiently, with a score of 88.2%. This shows that 
Financial Technology services, especially in Payment, Settlement & Clearing users, have helped develop 
MSME businesses in Bandung City.

The magnitude of the influence of the risk variable is 33.3%. 
Based on the results of the research and discussion that has been stated previously regarding the influence of 
the Effect of Perceptions of Ease and Risk on Financial Technology on MSME entrepreneurs in Bandung, 
several conclusions can be drawn as follows: 
1. Perceptions of ease of MSME business actors in Bandung City in the Districts of Antapani, Arcamanik, 
Gede Bage, Ujung Berung, Cibiru, and Buah Batu as a whole are in the very easy to use category. 
2. Risks to MSME business actors in Bandung City in the Districts of Antapani, Arcamanik, Gede Bage, 
Ujung Berung, Cibiru, and Buah Batu as a whole are in the quite risky category for users. 
3. Financial Technology for MSME business actors in Bandung City in the Districts of Antapani, Arcamanik, 
Gede Bage, Ujung Berung, Cibiru, and Buah Batu as a whole are in the quite agreeable category. 
4. Perception of ease and risk simultaneously has a significant effect on financial technology 
5. Perceived Ease and Risk partially have a significant effect on Financial Technology 
Based on the results of the conclusions described above, the researcher can provide suggestions that can be 
useful for MSME Business Actors in Bandung City. 
a. Based on the results of responses that have been made by respondents to researchers related to the variable 
""Perception of Ease"", the lowest percentage is shown by the question ""Financial technology does not need to 
use cash so it is practical and easy to use"". Therefore, MSME business actors in Bandung City, may not leave 
money. cash as one of the buying and selling transactions of goods or services, because not all MSME business 
actors in Bandung understand the use of Financial Technology and can be used as an alternative if the buyer 
does not use Financial Technology services. 
b. Based on the results of responses that have been made by respondents to researchers related to the variable 
""Risk"", the lowest percentage is indicated by the question ""Financial Technology Services are not effective and

1005","efficient for today's business"", meaning that Financial Technology helps improve effectiveness and efficiency 
when doing business to make it easier. . 
c. Based on the results of responses that have been made by respondents to researchers related to the variable 
""Financial Technology"", the lowest percentage is shown by the question ""Market Aggregator service users 
(DuitPintar.com, Cekaja, Cermati, KreditGogo and Tunaiku) in business"", meaning that users of Financial 
Technology services in the Market Aggregator category among MSME business players in Bandung City is 
not quite popular, therefore it is hoped that MSME entrepreneurs in Bandung City will start using Market 
Aggregator which will help business development.

Abstract 
The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has become a severe health problem for the world 
community. The massive transmission has made Covid-19 a disease that is both frightening and 
deadly. Person-to-person transmission of the COVID-19 infection has made hospitals more vulnerable 
to transmission of the virus and infection to workers and patients who come. During the Covid-19 
pandemic, hospitals have become the most visited places for examination and treatment. In this 
condition, it is necessary to manage human resources that pay attention to environmental aspects and 
protection to maintain service quality. Green Human Resources Management is a suitable system for 
managing hospital HR during a pandemic so that the hospital can still provide and maintain good 
service quality. This research was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic to answer the gap in 
hospital research previously in seeing the effect of Green HRM on service quality. The Service Quality 
concept is used in the healthcare service industry to test its application in Indonesia's state-owned 
hospitals. This study uses a data analysis method with the Variance Based Structural Equation 
Modeling technique by utilizing SmartPLS software to process data on 1004 respondents from 
workers from 19 State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) hospitals throughout Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
COVID-19 in Indonesia have continued to increase. On June 25, 2020, it increased to 50,187 
and increased again by 100,303 on July 27, 2020. As of September 8, 2020, in Indonesia, 200,035 cases of 
positive COVID-19 patients were recorded, and the number is still growing (Task Force for Handling 
COVID-19 Indonesia). On August 2, 2020, Indonesia's COVID-19 positivity rate had reached 12.6%. This 
figure is much higher than the WHO recommended maximum limit of 5%. (WHO, 2020). 
Due to the high number of COVID-19 patients, health workers who provide health services are also 
infected with COVID-19. The number of health workers infected with COVID-19 was 878 or 1.2% of health 
workers working in hospitals. There were 61 doctors and 41 nurses in Indonesia who died as of July 13, 
2020 (Jayani, Dwi, 2020). This risk is very concerning in providing health services.

Hypothesis 
GHRM to SQ has a T statistic value of 6.862, where this value is more significant than 1.96. It can be 
concluded that the GHRM to SQ relationship is substantial so that the hypothesis is accepted. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
The link between implementing Green HRM policies and practices lies in the importance of service 
quality that can provide customer satisfaction. On this basis, this study proves the hypothesis of the effect of 
the Green HRM relationship on positive and significant service quality. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 
the level of difficulty in providing health services was higher than average. It makes this happen; it is 
necessary to involve employees and provide employees with the competencies needed (Haynes & Fryer, 
2000). 
Most service sectors have linked HR strategy with HR practices to reinvent customer service 
activities to achieve customer satisfaction. In this context, HR strategies and procedures, including practices 
in the service sector, can support service quality. The application of Green HRM practices that have been 
developed over several decades answers the question that the management of Green HRM is suitable for the 
context of improving service quality (Sheehan, 2005). Effectively by managing human resources, service 
companies can develop the types of employee behavior that are important for the success of the company's 
competitive strategy, especially when providing service quality to their customers (Huang, 2001). 
Some selected HR practices, such as workplace support, training, reward systems, and performance 
appraisals, in turn, will also be closely related and affect service quality. Previous research will reinforce 
conducted by Solha Husin et al. (2012). Besides, the implementation of Green HRM practices and policies 
identified by management is essential for the success of the strategy and the influence of employee 
commitment and competence so that it can positively influence service quality. 
 
6. Implications 
This research has implications for theoretical thinking and enrichment in management, notably the 
Green HRM study of service quality in hospitals. For hospital management, this research will help create 
policies and models related to environmentally friendly human resource management to improve hospitals' 
quality of services through Green HRM. This research also contributes to a further research agenda by 
building theoretical models. 
 
7. Limitations And Suggestions 
Future research can adopt research methods and dig deeper into various theories that can be applied 
later. For a more in-depth understanding, further research can examine service quality changes due to all 
stakeholders' Green HRM influence over a more extended period. The research population is also limited to 
employees so that service quality is viewed from a self-assessment and supply-side perspective. Future 
research can be carried out across all hospital stakeholders by involving a larger population. Further research 
can also be carried out in other service industries by adapting this research to different locations and cultures. 
Suggestions to prevent more health workers from becoming infected, with the implementation of 
Green HRM in human resource management, it is necessary to continuously carry out COVID-19 tests for 
health workers and periodically to ensure and build confidence, which has an impact on improving the 
quality of service to patients. Also, providing complete personal protective equipment according to unique 
hospital standards for preventing infectious and infected diseases and providing unique changing rooms that 
can sterilize germs and bacteria from health workers who will and after work.

1.1 Background 
Lazada offers a wide range of goods for men and women that can adapt to the lifestyle in Indonesia, the 
interesting thing about Lazada is that it offers items that are trendy at the moment so that the products offered by 
Lazada continue to follow the lifestyle needs of more modern men and women. Based on the official Lazada website 
which can be accessed on the www.lazada.co.id domain, on this site there are several features that can be utilized by 
users or website visitors such as the search column to make it easier for consumers to find the desired item quickly,

1020","The relationship between E-Service Quality and E-satisfaction has a unidirectional relationship, it can be 
seen that the regression coefficient value is positive, which is 0.96, which means that if there is an addition of one 
value or number in the E-Service Quality (X) variable it will be there is an increase in the variable of 0.96. This means 
that if e-service quality is getting better, e-satisfaction will increase, and vice versa, if e-service quality is bad, it will 
reduce the level of e-satisfaction of online users. This research is also supported by previous research which is in line 
with Tobagus Anita (2017) which states that E-service Quality with e-satisfaction has a unidirectional relationship, 
besides that research conducted by Ting et al (2016) states that it is significant and unidirectional e-satisfaction with 
online shoppers.

Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of the research and discussion previously described, the authors can draw the following 
conclusions: 
a. 
Among the seven dimensions of e-service quality, the contact dimension is the most dominant dimension and 
among the four dimensions of e-satisfaction, the dimension of service ability is the most dominant dimension. 
In this case, Lazada prioritizes service abilities and transaction convenience for its users. 
b. E-service quality affects e-satisfaction of users on the Lazada site. This relationship was found to have a 
positive and significant effect. 
c. 
The relationship between e-service quality and e-satisfaction has a unidirectional relationship. If there is an 
increase in e-service quality there will be an increase in e-user satisfaction at Lazada. 
d. With the existence of good e-service quality, it will have a significant effect on e-satisfaction of Lazada site 
users. 
 
Based on the research results and conclusions that have been put forward, the suggestions in this study are as 
follows: 
a. 
Being in this research category, lazada is expected to improve and improve the quality and quantity of the 
system by minimizing the occurrence of system errors during the transaction process. 
b. It is hoped that the Lazada site can improve the compensation system for errors in shipping and sales during 
the transaction process. 
c. 
It is related to the already high category, but it needs to be improved again regarding the quality of the 
website, in terms of loading pages, merchandising and also responses to complaints or problems to make it 
better and more able to satisfy users of the Lazada site. 
 
Based on the research that has been done, researchers provide suggestions for further researchers, namely as 
follows: 
a. 
The next researcher can focus on research using a questionnaire, in further research can use the 
interview method with respondents so that the information obtained can be more detailed and in-
depth. 
b. Because this research uses only one independent variable, it is hoped that it can conduct research 
with other variables to add research variables related to e-satisfaction and e-service quality to make 
it more developed and varied.

Abstract 
The Spanish flu had a direct effect on the GDP, and it served as a perfect benchmark to anticipate the outcomes and 
implications of COVID-19 on the economy. Multiple waves of layoffs, permanent business closures, social unrest, 
and the virus's extended duration had devastating effects on the economy. Government funding in the form of PPP 
(Paycheck Protection Program), CARES (Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act), and state-funded 
grants for small businesses are just a few examples of reliefs injected into the economy to help small businesses. 
However, these initiatives had little effect in helping the financially fragile small businesses. The purpose of this paper 
is to discuss the effects of COVID-19 on micro-businesses in the service industry and provide innovative industry 
practices and ideas that have helped micro-businesses remain open during the pandemic. This paper aims to promote 
innovative knowledge and practices for managers to implement during the pandemic to keep the business open and 
operational. This quantitative research included almost 5562 micro-businesses surveyed between May 1st  and August 
30th, 2020, along with extensive relevant literature research in this field. The main question aimed to be answered: 
have innovative processes been successful in helping micro-businesses stay operational and open during the pandemic. 
The six dimensions of innovation of Hertog, Den, and de Jong (2010) were utilized to define innovative processes and 
procedures that micro-businesses can implement. Data findings in this research indicate that micro-businesses need to 
implement out of the box innovative thinking for providing their services to customers to stay operational and avoid 
permanent closure.

1. Introduction  
It is not surprising to see large chain stores that have been in business for decades are now closing due to the booming 
online business on sites such as eBay, Overstock, Amazon, and many others. Stores that have not been able to 
accommodate online demand are fading out and going out of business; such stores include Bed Bath & Beyond, JC 
Penny, and Sears, to name a few. The new challenge now is not only providing a wide selection at lower prices with 
the convenience of home delivery but also being able to stay profitable, especially with the emergence of the global 
pandemic the COVID-19, which has triggered businesses to shut down, forcing companies to implement layoffs to 
reduce costs to stay operational.  
COVID-19 has had a global impact on large and small businesses alike and has continued to push business owners to 
be more creative and innovative in the way they operate. Much research was done on small and medium-sized 
businesses and how the pandemic has affected them, but none have in-depth investigated microbusinesses during the 
2020 pandemic (Barro et al., 2020; Bartik et al., 2020; Heinonen and Strandvik, 2020). Pfitzner and McLaren (2018) 
discussed the vital role micro-businesses play in the local community they operate in, considering the close ties to the 
community.  Moreover, they provide employment opportunities and are locations for social interaction (Pfitzner & 
McLaren, 2018). Micro-businesses are those businesses with five or fewer employees, as defined by Gherhes, Vorley, 
and Brooks (2020).

Abstract 
 
Virtual learning was widely used during the Covid-19 pandemic. This situation shows that technology-based learning 
has been able to overcome the limitations of space and time. This learning has become a solution to educational 
problems during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, from virtual learning, there are still complaints among teachers 
and students about the effectiveness of virtual learning. The problem in this study is the obstacle in virtual-based 
learning in the new normal era. The aim of this research is to analyze the constraints of virtual learning in the new 
normal era. 30 teachers and 50 students who have conducted virtual learning interactions are used as subjects in this 
study. These obstacles were identified by interview and questionnaire techniques. Furthermore, the data obtained were 
analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach and using the concept of learning and learning theory. Based on the 
research results, it was found that virtual learning constraints still occur in various elements of learning, such as 
problems with teachers, learning media, teaching materials, learning evaluation, and learning interactions. So, it is still 
necessary to develop various aspects of learning, such as teacher teaching creativity, media and learning materials, as 
well as a good internet network. 
 
Keywords: virtual learning, learning problems, Covid-19, new normal 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused social restrictions. Social restrictions have changed the teaching and learning 
process from the real environment to the virtual environment. Virtual based learning has been carried out by various 
educational institutions throughout the world. Not only in the context of education, but also in various other 
dimensions of life. Corporate work meetings, training, seminars, government outreach and various other activities 
have shifted towards the virtual world. 
 
During this time the teacher and students do interaction learning in class. However, with virtual learning, teachers and 
students only interact in front of a computer or smartphone. The teaching and learning process is carried out from 
different places. This has shown that technology has become a solution to the limitations of space and time. Teachers 
and students still need habituation in distance learning interactions. Not only in the aspects of teaching and learning, 
but they must also improve literacy and technological skills. Teachers are required to adjust teaching methods with 
the learning media used. Students must be more motivated in learning, because it is not supervised directly by the 
teacher. 
 
The teacher usually communicates one or two directions in school, with face-to-face meeting, direct discussions and 
exercises together. The teacher will more easily give an explanation and explanation of a material, while students will 
find it easier to understand and discuss directly with the teacher. With this pandemic occurrence, it has become very 
difficult to maintain the teacher's communication style habits. Therefore, there is a need to change the style of teacher 
communication during or during the Covid-19 pandemic. The communication used is long distance in this case known 
as communication in the network. This communication, allows teachers as communicators and students as 
communicants to communicate via the internet or cyberspace. The goal is, can be controlled remotely, time efficiency 
can be done anytime and anywhere.

4.2 Discussion 
 
Based on the results of the study, it can be described that virtual learning has weaknesses and challenges. First, it does 
not represent the emotions of the wearer in this case the teacher and students, so the teacher is very difficult in 
providing understanding to students, and the teacher does not know the extent of student understanding. Second, there 
is information that is not important, or the information obtained will be very much and difficult to filter and control, 
so that the recipient of the information will be confused. Third, it takes a lot of concentration because it does not suit 
the place and time, so time management must take precedence. 
 
Therefore, to fulfill these elements of effective communication in online learning, the teacher must do various things. 
First, create online class rules, including the time and application used. Second, build a good atmosphere for discussion 
in online classes, although it is rather difficult to do but try to do the discussion whether synchronous or asynchronous. 
Do not let students who ask questions or need reinforcement not be served. Third, although in online learning, teachers 
should still use verbal and non-verbal expressions in providing feedback, reward and punishment. Here you can use 
emoticons, stickers, or sentences that motivate students. Fourth, the teacher must be able to relate the material to the 
current or current situation, so that it will be easily understood by students. Fifth, use video or animation that supports 
the material so it's not boring. 
 
Besides that, in developing communication, the teacher also needs to pay attention to several things such as the 
following. First, use language that is simple and easy to understand, and can motivate students' psychic. Second, the 
teacher must be able to understand the conditions or circumstances of his students. Third, the meaning of the message 
or information must be clear and useful. Fourth, the teacher must be able to instill respect and mutual assistance if 
there are other students who are experiencing difficulties. It may be that in this situation students are helping the 
teacher in various ways, for example difficulties in using applications. Fifth, teachers must also instill a democratic 
spirit in their students. Democracy is shown by giving freedom to each other to input during online learning, to hear 
or understand each other with the situation and be able to provide solutions to any problems experienced in online 
learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Based on a literature review and research results, it can be concluded that virtual-based learning still has many 
problems and obstacles. These problems and obstacles are found in various aspects of learning, such as teachers, 
students, media or virtual learning applications, and in learning interactions. So it still needs to be updated and adjusted 
from various aspects.

I thank the parties who helped in completing this article, especially the organizers of the Covid-19 and New Normal 
conferences. Through the conference I was able to express my ideas and research results about virtual learning during 
the Covid-19 period. Hopefully on other occasions this organization will continue to be a forum for researchers to 
continue to be productive in their work.

Constitution before the amendment, and the 1945 Constitution resulting from amendments or the NRI 
Constitution 1945). While the differences in the source of ce material are the absence of GBHN, Tap MPR No. 
II/MPR/1978 on P4, religious values, globalization, regional potential, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, and the Unitary 
State of the Republic of Indonesia/NKRI. Clearly the source of this material is the wealth of CE scientific that

5. Recommendations, Conclusion and the Way Forward  
The equation is based on the law of the high school curriculum from 1975 to 2013 in Indonesia, namely; Pancasila, 
Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia in 1945 and the National Education System Act. This rule is as permanent 
state law as the cornerstone of all applicable laws. As for the difference in the basis of this law from 1975-2013, 
starting from the provisions of MPR, Permendiknas, Government Regulations. This difference indicates a mix of 
elements of the country's elite towards the existence of Civic Education that has led to the maturity of Civic 
Education. The difference is that using different learning methods, namely Active Students (SA), How to Learn 
Active Students (CBSA) or Student Active Learning (SAL), changes the learning time sharing system, namely by 
changing from semester system to caturwulan system. 9-year program system and contains local curriculum. Unity 
in policy and diversity in implementation includes 5 groups of subjects: Kel. Mapel. His Holiness's religion and 
morality, Ex. Maple. Kn, Kel. Mapel. Science, Kel. Mapel. Aesthetics, Kel. Mapel. Penjasorkes. While the 2013 
curriculum is based on the learning experience that is selected and organized using among others: (1) value and 
moral education; (2) a widespread environmental approach; (3) active learning; (4) troubleshooting; (5) contextual 
approach; (6) integrated learning; (7) group learning (8) Civic learning practices (PBK); (9) exemplary giving; and 
(10) the creation of a class climate and school culture that is characterful in accordance with pancasila values and

1. Introduction 
The development of hospital business increases very rapidly in Indonesia. According to the data 
(Kemenkes RI, 2018), there are 2,773 hospitals in Indonesia, including public and private hospitals. The 
number of Public Hospitals does not increase as rapidly as that of private hospitals in the last six years. The 
mean growth of public hospitals is only 0.4%, while that of the private hospitals is 15.3%. 
 
Figure 1. Data of Public and Private Hospitals in Indonesia 
(Source: Kemenkes RI, 2018) 
On average, there is an increase in the number of private hospitals in every province. The drastically 
growth can be seen particularly in East Java that increase by four times (21%), by almost two times or 19% in 
West Java, by nearly two times or 8% in DKI in the last six years. Similarly, in Central Java, it increases by 
three times or 19%. From the data, it can be concluded that East Java Province is one of the highest growth of 
the private hospitals in Indonesia. It indicates that East Java province has bigger potential in developing the 
hospital industry. It, of course, will affect the need for human resources in the industry. Human resource is the 
most important asset to the development of the organization in addition to financial capital (Chu, et al., 2019),

1055","Job motivation affects significantly the job satisfaction, with a p-value < 0.001, so that H3 is supported. 
This study’s finding is in line with previous studies of Hayati (2012), Kusuma (2015), Pang (2018) and 
Suttikun (2018), they find that job motivation can improve the employees’ job satisfaction. 
Compensation affects significantly the job motivation. The result of analysis shows that a p-value is less 
than alpha value (< 0.001). It means that compensation can improve the employees’ job motivation; thus H4 is 
supported. The previous studies that supporting this current study’s finding are Kusuma (2015), Adhikari, 
(2017), Ilyinal (2013) and Demircioglu (2018). They suggest (both financial and non-financial) compensation 
that affects significantly the employees’ job motivation. 
Transformational leadership affects job satisfaction significantly. P-value < 0.001; thus H5 is supported. 
This study’s finding supports the previous studies conducted by Oto (2019), Kusuma (2015) and Aga (2016). 
They find that transformational leadership can improve the employees’ job motivation.    
The result of the test on the mediation in the indirect effect of compensation on job satisfaction through 
motivation is significant (p-value < 0.001). It means that job satisfaction plays a mediating role in the effect of 
compensation on job satisfaction, so that H6 is supported. This finding is in line with a previous study 
conducted by Kusuma (2015), she found that there is an indirect effect of compensation on job satisfaction 
mediated with job motivation. Sukidi (2016) found that giving reasonable compensation is the fundamental 
way of providing the employees with job satisfaction. This finding is also in line with Gupta (2014) who found 
that company can increase salary and compensation to motivate the employees; good and reasonable 
compensation as one of key factors affecting the employees’ job satisfaction. 
Meanwhile, a p-value for the indirect effect of transformational leadership on job satisfaction through job 
motivation is < 0.001. It indicates that job motivation can play a mediating role in the effect of transformational 
leadership on job satisfaction. Thus, H7 is supported. This finding is in line with Gennaro (2018) who found 
that there is an effect of transformational leadership on job satisfaction through job motivation. It confirms that 
job motivation can strengthen the effect of transformational leadership on the employees’ job satisfaction in 
Muhammadiyah Hospital of Lamongan. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Overall, the result of the research shows that compensation and transformational leadership are the 
fundamental instruments underlying Muhammadiyah Hospital of Lamongan in improving its employees’ job 
motivation and satisfaction. Giving reasonable compensation and transformational leadership style application 
play important role in improving job satisfaction either directly or indirectly through job motivation. Good job 
motivation can generate the employees’ satisfaction with job. In addition, job motivation is determined as 
partial mediation to the effect of compensation and transformational leadership on job satisfaction which 
means that without job motivation, compensation and transformational leadership practices can improve job 
satisfaction directly, and the presence of job motivation escalates the increase in the employees’ feeling of 
satisfaction with the company.  
Some practical recommendations are given to Muhammadiyah Hospital of Lamongan (RSML) considering 
the findings of the research. They are benefit giving and inspirational motivation by the leader of RSML as the 
key factor to reinforce compensation and transformational leadership, thereby, can improve the employees’ 
working spirit and their job satisfaction.     
Further researchers are recommended to add the indicator of compensation to make the result of the 
research more comprehensive. The object of next research should be expanded to the manufacturing industry 
sector to draw a broader conclusion (generalization).

1062","5. Conclusion 
Production of flying fish (Catching of Decaoterus spp) in the waters of Ternate City during the research 
tends to fluctuate every month during the study period. In this study, it was found the main factor that causes 
fluctuation results of this catch is Ocean waves All activities related to marine are very sensitive to any changes that 
occur at sea, these environmental parameters will affect fish dispersal, migration, aggregation, spawning and food 
supply as well as fish behavior. 
Fluctuations in the value of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the waters of Ternate City are closely related to 
the abundance of phytoplanton, where chlorophyll-a is a pigment contained in phytoplankton cells (mainly diatoms) 
which causes the distribution of chlorophyll-a to follow the pattern of phytoplanton abundance, where chlorophyll-a 
is a pigment contained in phytoplankton cells (mainly diatoms) which causes the distribution of chlorophyll-a 
horizontal distribution of the abundance of phytoplankton itself.  
The results of the polynomial regression analysis showed that there was a close relationship between the 
catches of flying fish with the concentration distribution chlorophyll-a with the catch and the concentration value of 
chlorophyll-a. It means 73.15% of the presence of flying fish in Ternate Island waters is influenced by the 
chlorophyll-a concentration value by assuming that the value of other oceanographic parameters is constant. 
So, The distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration parameters in the waters of Ternate Island in October 
2018 to February 2019 is in the range of 0.2-0.5 mg / m3 with an average value of 0.24 mg / m3, where the value of 
this concentration has a significant effect on fish catches elevated with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 in 
exponential regression.

Abstract  
 
The government and other construction companies implemented mentoring programs to utilize them as the 
solution to increase the skills of new entry construction graduates in the industry; though a number of new 
entry   construction graduates partake in mentoring programs but even after finishing mentoring programs 
they still need further training to develop their skills. This suggests that the implemented mentoring 
programs have not been effective. A mentoring program is a tool that is used to increase the skills of new 
entry construction graduates. Many construction graduates’ scuffle to perform their duties in the industry 
due to lack of experience, knowledge and skills. Many mentoring programs are not effective and they don’t 
produce the anticipated results. The purpose of the paper is to look at   the effectiveness of mentoring 
programs for new entry construction graduates. This study will determine evaluation systems which are 
used to quantify the effectiveness of mentoring programs. Furthermore, it will look at   the effects of 
mentoring programs on new entry graduate’s employees and establish procedures to improve mentoring 
programs. The study is primarily a literature review with a distinct emphasis on the human resource 
management and leadership, the data used in the report is mainly qualitative, based on the content analysis, 
case studies and historical data. The study discovered that the main vital evaluation systems for measuring 
mentoring programs were: revisiting program goals; program outcomes measuring and interviews & focus 
groups. More the findings revealed that the major effects of mentoring programs comprised: develops 
networking for new entry graduates within the organization and   exposed the main vital measurements for 
improving mentoring programs for new entry construction graduates include: plainly define roles and 
responsibilities for each graduates, increase quality of education and time expended on the programs and 
training the mentor. The results from this study can be used to contribute dynamic information to the 
government and other construction companies in terms of employing effective mentoring programs which 
will constantly produce the essential outcomes.

1072","participating in the programs.  Maguire & Pitceathly, (2002) states that mentoring programs help construction 
graduates to have good communication skills which will help them to adapt within the organization easily, furthermore 
he notes that this communications skills that graduates acquire from mentoring programs help them to be able to 
identify any problems and how to solve the problems without the help of their mentors while interacting with other 
employees within the organizations. 
 
5.3 Measures that can be taken to improve mentoring programs for new entry construction graduates  
According to Poulsen, (2006)   the construction market conditions are changing, the economy is also changing and 
the needs for competencies are also changing.in addition he further stated that mentoring programs are the only 
solution in making sure that new graduates are able to be competent in the industry. Many mentoring programs don’t 
produce the main objectives that were set when they were implemented. This is mainly caused by not following 
procedures of implementing mentoring programs and some don’t produce the required objectives because the 
principles of assessing the effectivity of mentoring programs is not followed. According to McCormick, (2014) also 
stated that mentoring programs fail because the people who implement the programs fail to match the correct Mentor 
with the correct graduate, mentoring programs are dysfunctional because they are not being implemented to suite the 
set objectives. The relationship between the mentor and the graduate is very vital for mentoring programs. This is the 
core point of mentoring programs as both the parties needs to share the same interest on the programs. According to 
Holley and Caldwell, (2012) many graduates and mentors don’t finish the duration of the programs because their 
relationship is not concrete. very vital for both the mentor and the graduate to have common grounds in terms of 
sharing ideas to avoid dysfunctional relationships which might cause either one to pull out of the program. The 
program facilitators should encourage good relationship between the mentor and the graduate. Many formal mentoring 
relationships might consist of mentor graduate pairing which might not work, but the program facilitators should 
encourage a good relation to avoid future problems during the process of the mentoring program. Poulsen, 
(2013) Suggests that the first step in making sure that the organization gets the mentor that will produce the required 
outcomes is to focus on showing the mentor how he is going to experience learning opportunities from the program. 
This will interest the mentor and make him to be the correct candidate to take over as the programs mentor who will 
connect with the graduates. Sanfey et al., (2013) Noted that the graduates must be clear and sure about their goals as 
they are new in the industry. According to Rhodes, (2006) positive effects of mentoring programs are derived from 
the support and role modelling coming from the mentor. The communication between the mentor and the graduate 
is very vital for the graduate. The interaction between the mentor and the graduate must consist of the graduate’s 
work-related goals and some personal problems if the graduate is experiencing such. According to Noe, (2006) citing 
Kram (1985)   the graduate must use the time he spends with the mentor effectively in order to ask unclear questions 
and discuss some problems with the mentor. Lyons & Oppler, (2004) States that the frequency of meeting between 
the mentor and the graduate is crucial for developing the graduate’s career. Wanberg, (2007) citing (Dindia, 2003; 
Hinde, 1997; Reis & Shaver, 1998)   States that self-disclosure by the graduate is the most important process within 
the mentoring relationship and is vital for career development including good communication between the two parties. 
It is very vital for this sector to be effective but like other sectors the construction industry needs resources in order to 
be effective for the economy. One of the main important resource is the personnel. The kind of personnel that is needed 
needs to have the required skills to be able to perform the correct construction practices. Without these skills the 
construction industry will not be effective and this will affect the economy. 
 
6. Conclusion and recommendation  
The major evaluation systems that can be used to measure the performance of mentoring programs and the findings 
were in common agreement with the literature reviewed. The findings of this study will contribute a lot to the 
government and construction firms implementing mentoring programs as they will help them to implement effective 
mentoring programs for construction graduates. The study further notes that regular inspections and improvements on 
the progress of mentoring programs is vital for them to be successful. It is recommended that the organization and 
government must consider the already introduced E- mentoring programs which will be time effective for the mentors. 
Literature revealed that there are many evaluation systems which can be used to measure the performance of mentoring 
programs. The literature further outlined the main evaluation systems which are vital for measuring mentoring 
programs. In addition, the literature revealed the major effects of mentoring programs on participants and also the 
literature revealed the main measures which can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of mentoring programs.

Abstract 
The Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain are some of the most popular and most significant trends in technology 
right now. To some extent, one can even say the technologies are a perfect pair as some of the issues like security and 
trust that come with IoT are taken care of by integrating Blockchain. The decentralized and encrypted nature of 
Blockchain makes it more robust and tamper-proof than the centralized systems used for IoT. This paper is a literature 
review that discusses the origins and workings of these technologies as well as discusses the application areas by 
integrating these two technologies and the challenges faced in integrating these technologies.

1. Introduction 
The internet of things (IoT) means a network of objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate with 
each other. At its core IoT is a network of devices that monitor the desired metrics through sensors and embedded 
chips, collect the metric data, and can send this data to other connected devices in the network for further processing 
or triggering a particular automated response. Various types of chips, sensors can be embedded in physical, real-world 
objects that can transmit data over the internet. The internet of things can find applications in various sectors and can 
add value to any scenario in which they are deployed. However, the internet of things does have security and privacy 
concerns. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a cryptographic distributed ledger that can allow secure data transfer in 
the network. Essentially, Blockchain can enable more secure communication of data by the devices in an IoT network. 
The paper is divided into the following sections: Section 2 discusses the internet of things technology, its history, 
working, architecture, applications, and challenges in implementing the applications. Section 3 discusses the 
blockchains technology, and finally, section 4 discusses the integration of Blockchain and the internet of things 
technologies. 
2. Internet of Things 
2.1. 
History 
This section explores the origins of the Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet of Things can be referred to as an 
autonomous network of machines or objects that are connected to the internet, and that can communicate by 
exchanging data with other real-world physical devices or applications in the same network. Examples of such tools 
that can gather data from the real world, compute and transmit this data are smartphones, tablets, computers, etc. The 
concept of a network of smart devices was first put forward in 1982 when a Coca-Cola vending machine was modified 
to become the first appliance to be connected to the internet which could provide accurate data about the inventory of 
the drinks in the vending machine and the temperature of the drinks (Palermo 2014). Raji (1994) coined the concept 
of integrating and automating everything using the internet to send data in small packets. The term ‘Internet of Things’ 
was coined by Ashton K. (2009) for a presentation for Procter and Gamble while trying to link the use of RFID 
technology and the internet to its supply chain. Evans D. (2011) of Cisco Systems has defined the Internet of Things 
as “simply of point in time when more things or objects are connected to the internet than people.” He also claims that 
as of 2020, there are more than 50 billion connected devices with 6.58 devices per person, according to a study 
performed by Cisco. Suresh et al. (2014) have given a brief history of the Internet of Things by providing a timeline. 
The following diagram can be a visual representation of the growth and development of the internet of things.

Abstract  
 
Polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in the industry, because of the unique physical properties ranging from 
soft to rigid. The research on polymer using renewables sources urged to be developed, without exception to PU it 
was supported by enormous resources which possible to replace the decline reserved for petroleum. This work was 
done by processing 2,4-toluene and 2,6-toluene di Isocyanate isomers to be blended to soy-polyols forming foam 
formation as a balanced reaction between blowing and gelation. The best catalyst concentration can control the 
reaction and the synergistic to chain extender can achieve foam stability. It was found the best concentration was 1% 
(v/v) sulfuric acid at temperature 600C. The method used in this research was a one-shot system. The goals were to 
determine the best process and production of PU. The chain extender used in this work was ethylene glycol, 
methanol, and butanol. The sulfuric acid was used for the catalysis and comparison purposes the butanol was 
catalyzed by bentonite. The morphology of the foam cellular, density, compressive strength was determined to 
support data.

1.Introduction 
The use of renewable natural resources to replace petroleum for various applications is currently increasing. This 
was triggered by various considerations such as environment, availability, and lower prices [1]. The polymer 
industry, especially polyurethane (PU) producers, has taken various steps to maximize the use of natural reagents. 
Indonesia as one of the largest countries in the Asia Pacific (excluding Japan), statistically proven that it is a part of 
17% of the world's Polyurethane users. Until now, most of the local polyurethane needs are still using products from 
abroad.  
The preparation of polymers from renewable resources was economically significant to petroleum. The excellent 
numbers of edible oil can be utilized in reproducing valuable polymeric materials. The oils contain fatty acid, its 
unsaturated C=C can be chemically and characterized by the hydroxyl values. The soy-epoxide into soy-polyol is 
proceeding processing from soybean oil. The soy-polyol reacted to isocyanates to produce PU, elastomer, and 
coating [2-4]. Soybean is an expensive preferred raw material for developing industrial oil product applications due 
to the relatively unreactive in polymer formulations and readily available renewable resource that provides an 
excellent platform for polymeric materials. The fatty composition  of the soybean oil in percentage by weight are 
(16:0) 17.75%; (18:0) 3.15%; (18:1) 23.2%; (18:2) 55.5% and  (18:3) 6.31% [5]. This soy-oil can be functionalized 
by hydroxylation of the carbon-carbon double bonds, or functionalize the reactiveness oxirane by opening ring 
reactions to nucleophilic compounds using peroxy acids or alcoholysis with triols like glycerol or triethanolamine to 
reach a hydroxyl value which was useful for PU foam production [6-9].

Conclusion 
Polyurethane is a tailormade polymer. The property of the product from soft to rigid can be managed by choosing 
the type catalyst because the homogeneous catalyst will result in different properties to heterogeneous catalyst even 
though using the same epoxide and ratio. Another thing that should be considered the chain extender performs a 
major role in resulting in the property of the product besides the time of the processing.

Abstract 
The need to reduce defects and ability to track frequent activities in a film packaging industry is vital to allow smooth 
operation. The focus of this paper is to develop and implement a semi-automated model to accelerate the rate of Kaizen 
in film packaging industry. A study was carried out for process enhancement by improving a nonconformance closure 
system in order to eliminate scrap rate. Ishikawa analysis and 5 whys were integrated in order to construct a semi-
automated model for nonconformance closure. The semi-automated model led to drastic improvements and with this 
semi-automated model of nonconformance corrective action it was further evaluated that recycle process was 
consuming a lot of energy and the new quicker recycle method was introduced. Effective nonconformance closure 
system resulted in good adherence to international quality standards. It was concluded that effective troubleshooting 
process plays a big role in generating improvements and avoiding frequent occurrences of the same problem.  
Although the framework has been developed for the film packaging industry, it can also be applied in control of non-
conformances irrespective of the industry.  
Key words: Kaizen, non-conformance and semi-automated model

5. Conclusion 
The smooth flow of a non-conformance closure system results in good compliance to international standards.  
Organisations are responsible for implementing systems that would accelerate the rate of Kaizen or system 
enhancement in order to remain competitive. An implementation of semi-automated model for non-conformance 
closure led to a high rate of continuous improvement in reduction of non-conformances for a case study company. It 
was concluded that effective troubleshooting process plays a big role in generating improvements and avoiding 
frequent occurrences of the same problem. The significance of this study is that the framework that has been developed 
in this study for the film packaging industry can be applied in control of non-conformances irrespective of the industry.

Abstract 
 
The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has become the main focus for economic development and competitive 
advantage for countries and sectors. The advancement of the 4IR technologies introduced the era of digital technology, 
whereby all sectors, government institutions, small and medium enterprises are seeking these technologies such as the 
internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and machine learning to name but few. Yet, there is a perception that 
the South African manufacturing sector is lagging behind with the adoption of these advanced technologies. Moreover, 
some of these manufacturers are still depending on their traditional methods and conventional machine tools. 
Meanwhile, the era of digital technology has presented these tools with sectors that had successfully achieved a 
competitive advantage within the marketplace. As a result, this paper analyses the factors contributing to economic 
growth and sustainability in relation to the adoption and usage of new technologies. The paper provides some insights 
into the readiness and adaption of the South African manufacturing sector of the new technologies as well as the global 
conformity with 4IR. Sectors are being forced to rethink their business processes and the way they conduct business. 
In response to the challenges deriving from globalization, manufacturing companies today face the need for more 
flexible and agile manufacturing equipment. Also, the pressure has been posed by their competitors that have taken 
advantage of these technologies and noted significant improvement in cost reduction, cycle time, productivity, and 
safety issues.  Clearly, the usage of the industry 4.0 tools such as automation, robotics, smart production, artificial 
intelligence, and big data presents opportunities. From the South African manufacturing perspective, 4IR is 
challenging a sector that has been in decline for the past decade due to a lack of adopting advanced manufacturing 
technologies. Whereas this sector is one of the sectors that is expected to strengthen economic growth and job creation. 
Findings suggest that there is a need to rethink the current production systems in order to develop a manufacturing 
digital transformation model that enables the conversion to smart factories, automation processes, real-time data of 
production process, and marketplace. The findings also revealed that there are few component elements that need 
serious attention, namely, ICT infrastructure, high tech skilled retention, development of the high-tech skilled 
workforce, particularly digitally skilled workers -  which is the main problem in both developed and developing 
countries.

Abstract 
Digital transformation is enabling the organization to deliver on commitments to customers, partners, shareholders, 
and employees using technology to optimize every organizational interaction. However, organizations cannot be a 
success by only transforming to a digital environment. Success depends on many technologies and success factors. 
An analysis of the literature was conducted to identify a gap within published articles between the years 2015 to 2020 
that are relevant to digital transformation. Many authors emphasize on the importance of digital transformation in 
improving organizational performance and indicated that the key technologies and key success factors that need to be 
followed in a digital environment. It is recommended that organizations should play an active role in ensuring that the 
implementation of key technologies and key success factors to triumph in digital transformation.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the problems encountered during the implementation and maintenance of 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) at a marking and bolts manufacturing company in Namibia, herein referred to as BMS 
Namibia. The study is a single case study that was carried out at the factory of BMS Namibia in Windhoek. The 
factory manufactures a wide range of bolts, pin, cotters, and machine parts for export purposes. The study was 
conducted at the time when the company management wanted to optimize processes in order to improve 
productivity. Data was collected through a questionnaire with open ended questions. Participants were purposively 
selected from the operations and planning units of the company. A thematic approach was used to analyze data. It 
was established that the company’s processes were sufficiently equipped to enable the implementation of LSS. 
However, the company does not have continuous improvement program to keep the employees and management 
informed of the efficiency of their production system. Since LSS is one of the best productivity improvement 
methodologies embraced around the world, BMS Namibia needs to invest in the implementation of LSS and in 
providing relevant training to the employees and management.

1134","Figure 5: Employees Views 
As shown on the pie chart above, about 50 percent of the workers cited the CNC machine as the most necessary tool, 
whereas 20 percent of the respondents cited the mass production machines as the necessary tool. Thirty percent of 
the respondents had no idea of the necessary tool for LSS. BMS does not have robot arms and conveyer belts for 
easy movement of scrap and finished products. For successful implementation of LSS, BMS will have to invest in 
modest machinery and LSS training for the employees.  
The company is applying the lean concepts of waste control. This was evidenced by the results which showed that 
the waste control was being used. Though some of the workers had no idea of the recorded waste, this was a smaller 
proportion and consist of those in the production department who appeared not to be taking note of the supervisors’ 
work. The company also measures different kind of waste like daily scrap, defects and minimum waste so as to see 
if the production is going with little or no defects.   
The results obtained showed that there are no LSS trained personnel or practitioners. The lack of any belt holder at a 
big company like BMS Namibia will imply that the LSS concept cannot be maximized. More so, the company has 
not even organized any LSS trainings or workshop and this is a clear recipe for LSS failure according to Pham 
(2017).  
Another root cause for the problems encountered stems from the results that all the 50 respondents had no idea of 
the standard deviation or sigma level even though they measure waste on a daily basis. This according to Harrison 
(2008) leads to partial adoption of the LSS methodology. Furthermore, the production metrics like job cards and 
waste controls sheet are just mere collection of data as 100 percent of the respondents at BMS Namibia have no idea 
on the impact of these metrics on LSS application. This deters the success of LSS application.  
5. Conclusion
The single case study was conducted at BMS Namibia in Windhoek to analyze the problems encountered during the 
implementation of LSS. BMS Namibia manufactures a wide range of bolts, pin, cotters, and machine parts for 
export purposes. Data was successfully collected through a questionnaire with open ended questions. Purposive 
sampling was used to selected participants from the operations and planning units of the company. It was found that 
the company’s processes were sufficiently equipped to enable implementation of LSS. However, the company does 
not have continuous improvement program to keep the employees and management informed of the developments in 
LSS. It was concluded that BMS Namibia is using some Lean practices but there is no team that monitor the 
successful implementation. This will lead to LSS implementation failure. BMS Namibia needs to invest in the 
improvement of LSS structures in the company, and in providing relevant training to the employees and 
management.   
6. Recommendations
6.1 Implications for Competitiveness of the BMS Namibia
Using the results obtained from the respondents’ answers showed that the company’s LSS need a lot of input for the
company to reap the benefits of the methodology.  BMS Namibia need to adopt the critical success factors for LSS
deployment, these include management commitment, education and training.

1143","The commitment by the top management at BMS Namibia towards LSS application can be questioned as there is no 
LSS training that has been done. As long as the top management is not able to offer the LSS training one can say 
that there is no commitment towards LSS success, and this ultimately leads to failure. The top management must see 
to it that the whole package and resources vital for LSS are provided and try to remove all the hurdles that may 
hinder progress.  
On the lack of LSS champions and belt holders at BMS Namibia, there is need for education and training of the 
workers. Though this will cost money and time to the company, it will be a long step in enhancing the 
competitiveness of the business. There are many companies offering LSS training, and these must be hired to offer 
training and this will result in abridged LSS execution time which will in-turn result in higher savings due to lower 
labor costs.  
6.2 Implications for Policy formulation 
Policy makers in Namibia and Africa as a region need to put more investment in the education sector. Most LSS 
training companies are based in the developed countries and it is no coincidence that the LSS programs in these 
developed countries have excelled. LSS training centers need to be put in place so that different levels of belt 
holders can be ordained in the country without going overseas living their families behind.  
Since the LSS methodology is not only meant for the manufacturing industry, there are many success stories of LSS 
application in the service sectors like health and finance. Namibia can benefit much improvement and cost reduction 
by the use of LSS concepts in banks and hospitals after subsidized trainings are offered by the state.  To reduce a 
heavy burden on the already struggling Namibian fiscal, the government can make a policy that requires all the 
major service and manufacturing firms to have specified number of LSS practitioners.  
6.3 Production layout 
The production layout at BMS Namibia is well organized however, the company should invest in modest machinery 
such as a robot arm and conveyor belt to be installed at the workshop. The robot arm will assist to remove scraps 
from the CNC machine to the scrap bay at the end each cycle of operation. This will reduce the machine cleaning 
time and result in more cycles per day. The robot arm will also be responsible to place the finished products onto the 
conveyor belt. The conveyor belt will transport the finish products straight to the inspection point. This arrangement 
will speed up the process and result in more process cycles per day compared to manual picking of scraps and finish 
products. 
6.4 LSS Training 
For BMS Namibia to successfully implement LSS, the Company must invest in a proper LSS training for the 
employees. An organization can have all the machineries suitable for LSS implementation, but it will still fail if its 
personnel have no idea of the methodology. The company need to have some experts in LSS like Black belt holders 
to lead the projects. One of the challenges that BMS have in implementing LSS is the lack of trained employees in 
LSS. It is highly recommended that BMS send its employees for LSS training before implementing this 
methodology into the company production system.

Abstract  
 
The aviation industry has experienced high growth in recent years and is projected to continue to increase rapidly in 
the future. As a result, it is also one of the world’s fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Whilst this industry has focused on fuel and operational efficiency, more still needs to be done to further limit the 
negative impact it is having on the planet. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is being investigated as an alternative fuel 
and uses sources like biomass, which have lower GHG emissions. In South Africa, there exists an opportunity for 
organic waste and invasive alien plants (IAPs) to be used as a biomass source for SAF. However, no research on the 
establishment of a supply chain for using biomass to produce SAF in this country could be located. A supply chain 
design and cost analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether biomass, to produce SAF, is feasible in South Africa

1 Introduction 
 
Prior to the Covid 19 pandemic, air travel was one of the safest, fastest and more profitable modes of transport in 
modern history.  “Flights are energy-intensive and depend on fossil fuels. Subsidies from fuel taxes give the airline 
industry an unfair advantage over other transportation modes. While many sectors are beginning to reduce their 
emissions, aviation’s have continued to grow” (Green, 2020). As a result, it has been one of the world’s fastest 
growing sources of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which cause climate change. In 2019, flights globally 
produced 915 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per annum which is 12% of all transport sources CO2 
emissions. “Carbon emissions from the airline industry grew by 75 per cent from 1990 to 2012. It’s expected they 
will continue to grow rapidly until 2050. If left unchecked, they could consume a full quarter of the available carbon 
budget for limiting temperature rise to 1.5 C” (Green, 2020). 
 
Net carbon emissions from international aviation will be capped through carbon neutral growth from 2020 (ATAG, 
2020). As a result, the world is turning to governments and business to reduce the impact that all transportation 
modes, especially the aviation industry, have on climate change. Whilst the aviation industry has focused on fuel 
and operational efficiency, which has helped the industry limit its emissions, more still needs to be done to further 
limit the impact it is having on the planet. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is, therefore, being investigated and is 
crucial to providing a cleaner source of fuel to power the world’s fleet of aircraft (ATAG, 2020; ATAG, 2017). 
Whilst there has been some progress in the aviation industry with regards to fuel and operational efficiency, more 
still needs to be done to further reduce the impact that the airline industry is having on the environment

Conclusions 
 
Due to the high and increasing GHG emissions from the aviation industry, which is detrimental to the environment, 
an alternative fuel with a less negative impact on the environment needed to be investigated. This involved 
investigating a fuel derived from biomass, namely, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In order to gauge whether SAF 
was a viable alternative to conventional aviation fuel, an investigation into a biomass supply chain needed to be 
completed. South Africa displayed several biomass types that could be harvested for SAF, but this supply chain 
would need to be understood, designed, costed and compared to the coal supply chain cost. To properly compare the 
biomass supply chain to the coal supply chain, the harvested biomass (which had very low calorific values) would 
need to be processed into a form that exhibited calorific values that were closer to that of coal. This process was 
densification and involved compressing chipped/shredded biomass into wood pellets. Three types of pelletized 
products supply chains were analysed, namely white pellets, black pellets and fuel rods for a conservative biomass 
availability scenario and an optimistic biomass scenario. This involved completing analyses for 20 different 
processes separately for the conservative and optimistic scenario. Fuel rods with sieving came out to be the most 
feasible option across both scenarios but did not have enough supply to meet the maximum required demand of 5 
000 000 tonnes per annum. This, coupled with the relatively new technology of fuel rods, made white pellets, 
sieving with project shredding the next best option.  
 
The optimal biomass supply cost curves were over 600% more expensive than the coal supply cost curve. Based on 
this alone, it can be ascertained that the biomass supply chain is indeed infeasible. However, the biomass supply 
chain costs could be further reduced if the COG analysis was run again, with the towns with rail sidings as priority, 
as some rail sidings were more affordable than road transport.  
 
Furthermore, the need for GHG emission reduction and the imposed carbon tax liability could make the biomass 
supply chain for SAF viable. This, coupled with the fact that SAF is created from a renewable feedstock; is 
categorized as a drop-in fuel, which can be blended with conventional aviation fuel to varying degrees with no 
impact on the infrastructure whilst still meeting the aviation’s industry safety and quality requirements would make 
SAF a serious consideration in future.  
 
It is therefore recommended that further investigations pertaining to the negative financial impact that carbon tax 
liability will have on the aviation industry as well as the potential price that SAF could yield considering the

these criteria could not only make SAF (and thus the biomass supply chain) viable but profitable.

Recommendations 
 
The following studies are recommended to ascertain the viability of the biomass supply chain in South Africa in 
future: 
• 
Complete this COG analysis again with rail sidings as a priority. This will allow more towns with rail sidings to 
form part of the study, which may lower the supply chain costs and will lower the potential impact on road 
congestion and environment. 
• 
Conduct a COG analysis again after areas that exhibited very high biomass availability have been split out to 
include more towns in proximity with less biomass. 
• 
Conduct a study to ascertain the impact the primary and secondary transport will have on the roads in terms of 
traffic congestion. 
• 
Conduct a GHG emission analysis on the primary and secondary transport for the biomass supply chain as well 
as the transport used to move coal to Secunda and compare the two emission profiles.. 
• 
Investigate the negative impact that the carbon tax liability will have on the aviation industry as well as the 
potential price that SAF could yield considering the increase in demand due to the depletion of coal and natural 
gas in future.

Abstract 
 
This study is a desk study that reviews the impact of lean principles in the Small and Medium Enterprises in the 
construction industry. The study used a systematic approach to review books, thesis, conference material, and 
journal articles that were written on lean principles. The review process covers construction micro, small and 
medium companies involved in civil engineering projects, residential and non-residential buildings. The results 
revealed that lean principles were poorly implemented and that most SMEs had minimal knowledge of lean 
principles. There was a clear understanding of some lean tools, and in most cases, they were applied on an activity 
and not for the entire duration of the project. This revealed that most SMEs were using lean tools but were not aware 
of their usage in their organizations. These findings assist local construction companies to identify opportunities for 
reducing operating costs. The researcher proposes interventions that the local and central governments should make 
in order to help the SMEs develop into a competitive segment of the industry. The interventions assist in; growing 
the SMEs, creating more job opportunities for the citizens, and generating revenue for the treasury.

Abstract 
 
With regard to higher education institutions in Africa, it is undoubtedly ineffective, inconvenient, and time-consuming 
for students to pay student fees. In addition, the rise in the number of students studying in higher learning institutions 
has led to long frustrating queues and severe overcrowding in the majority of financial institutions when paying student 
fees. With the advent of Covid-19, the financial institutions and students do not have a favourable situation. This paper 
seeks to implement a cryptocurrency for higher education institutions. In this study, the proposed payment system was 
implemented using an object-oriented programming software development methodology.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Payment systems have become a critical component of contemporary societies' economic existence. The smooth 
functioning of payment systems is important for the overall effectiveness and reliability of the payment systems 
(Payment system oversight and interoperability). The Digital Financial Services Ecosystem maps the overall 
ecosystem of Digital Financial Services by identifying all key stakeholders as well as looks at the critical elements 
necessary to make the ecosystem develop so that it encourages and enables financial inclusion policies (Benson et al, 
2017).  
 
Digital Financial Services (DFS) refers to accessing financial services through an electronic system or a mobile phone 
application. Digital Financial Infrastructure includes electronic financial systems, in which funds are deposited, 
making and receiving payments (Martin and Mauree, 2016). DFS has become a viable avenue for the financially 
excluded to access formal financial services. Users can safely receive funds, pay bills, make bank deposits, transfer 
funds, and buy products and services. Most convincing evidence suggests that growing access to formal financial 
services not only decreases financial exclusion but has also become an important development target to promote 
economic growth, improve welfare and minimize poverty (Martin and Mauree, 2016). As such, the recent growth of 
mobile money has allowed millions of financially excluded people to conduct financial transactions relatively cheaply, 
securely and reliably (Nandhi, 2012). 
 
The education sector is one sector that can greatly benefit from the services provided by Digital Financial Services. 
In Africa most school systems rely heavily on cash transactions. This cash reliance on financial transactions 
contributes to inefficiencies, cash leakage and carries risks to security. Furthermore, cash handling can lead to the 
further spread of Covid-19 among students and different departments in the higher learning institutions that handle 
cash. Digital Financial Services can provide unique opportunities in educational institutions such as elementary and 
secondary schools and universities. These opportunities include replacing cash and thus making learning institutions 
more efficient by improving management, increasing financial support from donors and non-governmental 
organisations, reducing financial costs and providing a concrete way to develop more multifaceted systems that would 
otherwise be impossible in a cash environment (Braniff, 2017).

1168","in the network. The proof of work algorithm is easily verifiable once another miner has presented the solution. With 
the agreed upon verification, miners in the network can include a block of transactions to the blockchain. 
 
The complex mathematical puzzle that needs to be solved is to find a number that generates a result that is within a 
certain range when combined with the meta data and data to be stored in the block and passed through a hash function. 
This number is called a ""nonce"" which is a concatenation of ""number used once."" By random guessing, miners find 
the nonce. The hash function prevents estimation of what the output will be. Miners guess the mystery nonce value 
and apply the hash function to the combination of the guessed number and the block data. The resulting hash must 
begin with a pre-established number of zeroes. There is no way to predict which number will work, as two consecutive 
integers will yield wildly unpredictable results. 
 
The miner earns some cryptocurrency as compensation for solving the computationally costly proof-of-work 
algorithm. Miners are actively attempting to mine new blocks in hopes of receiving this currency pay-out, which offers 
a mechanism for adding transactions to the blockchain.  
 
Mining also gives the cryptocurrency control over the rate of which new blocks are added to the cryptocurrency 
blockchain and how many transactions come in at once. The difficulty of the proof-of-work algorithm can be adjusted 
to control the rate of new blocks added to the blockchain. 
 
6. CONCLUSION 
 
The goal of this study was to implement a cryptocurrency for Africa’s higher learning institution.  The proposal to 
implement a cryptocurrency as compared to the cash environment was propelled by the realization of how paying of 
fees by students is undeniably inefficient, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the growth in the number of students 
studying in higher educational institutions which always results in long stressful queues and extreme overcrowding in 
most financial institutions when paying student fees. With the introduction of Covid-19, the situation for financial 
institutions and students is not favourable. Students are to use the proposed payment system to pay tuition fees and 
other student fees to their respective higher educational institution. In addition, students are to use the proposed 
payment to pay for goods and services provided by the institution and other merchants in the institution's premises. 
This would evidently reduce and to some extent eliminate cash handling by students, financial and education 
institution. This study was restricted by the lack of design and creation of a mobile application based on iOS or Android 
that would allow students to communicate with the blockchain. In order to promote interoperability between the 
proposed system and telecommunications firms, banks and microfinance institutions, a field for further studies would 
include the design and implementation of a RESTful API.

Abstract (12 font) 
 
Mentoring is experiencing renaissance because business leaders not only identify the benefits of transferring 
knowledge among workers. Although mentoring theory, research and practice have begun to be developed, 
quite few articles on mentoring, retention have appeared in the Human Resource Development literature.  
The purpose of this paper is to look at research and practice on mentoring through the lens of Human 
Resource Development in the construction industry, to discover gaps in what is known about mentoring 
that are significant to Human Resource Development specialists and furthermore the study describes better 
practices that organizations can use to resolve the threat of lost knowledge caused by changing workforce 
demographics. The data used in the study was mainly qualitative, based on the historical data. The review 
enabled the road map to source out information related to human resource management and mentoring on 
retention of graduate’s workers in South Africa. After reviewing core aspect of mentoring, central to all 
domains of Human resource development, the authors summarize the key issues that had been studied 
regarding mentoring and career development, organization development, and training and development, 
proposing new direction for future research. The study also, indicated knowledge transfer assist workers in 
cultivating their skill sets which increases their marketability.  Individuals who had been mentored reported 
high levels of knowledge transfer.

1180","More research on mentoring has focused on career development than on other areas of HRD. For protégés, mentoring 
is associated with small objective career outcomes and small to moderate subjective outcomes. 
 
Organization development 
 
There has been little attention paid to mentoring outcomes at the organizational level of analysis. Three 
organizational outcomes of mentoring have been suggested: Developing human resources, managing organizational 
culture. Improving organizational communication 
 
 
5. Conclusions  
As changing demographics have inexorably rehabilitated the business landscape, it is generally accepted that 
organizations are currently dealing with the daunting task of replacing knowledgeable and talented workers. 
Furthermore, the consensus is that there has become a shortage of talent in the workforce and that companies will 
have to actively wage war for talent in order to get the right people with the right skills into their organizations. 
Retaining organizational knowledge in the face of changing workforce demographics is a complex challenge that 
requires simultaneously confronting the problems created by an aging workforce, the threats posed by changing 
demographics were not created in a year and will not be solved overnight.   
 
The most effective knowledge retention strategies will require a multifaceted approach and a long-term commitment 
on both the leadership of an organization and the employees. In this paper, the authors have reviewed current 
perspectives on mentoring and HRD and identified directions, gaps for future research, theory, and practice from the 
perspective of the HRD domains of career development, organization development, and training and development 
within construction organizations. Noteworthy strides have been made on mentoring research, theory, and practice 
providing a solid foundation on which to build the additional work that is needed to fully understand and maximize 
the effective use of mentoring. It seems that the issue of mentoring and human resource development in construction 
organizations can generally be considered as a good field of research and vast topics of research can be defined in this 
regard.  
 
Further research is suggested to inspect what, if any programs or practices help improve the present factors that HR 
personnel perceive to be fundamental to employee retention. Our study focused on our ideas on what may help improve 
employee retention, but it did not address their ideas. In particular, research is recommended to determine how best 
organizations (those with the lowest turnover) can facilitate the meeting of employee needs and improve retention. 
Additionally, the current study does not directly assess all of the potential factors relevant to employee retention, but 
uses the preconceived ideas of the researcher. In too many cases the answer “other” was used indicating that perhaps 
a wider number of potential factors should be included in the analysis.

Abstract  
 
Supply chain management makes the company more competitive. In the Indonesian coffee trade, the bargaining 
power of coffee farmers and producers improves when the distribution channels for materials are operated 
effectively. The aim of this study is to develop a supply chain management application based on mobile devices as 
an intermediary between farmers, producers and consumers. The first step is to identify the issues related to the 
parties. The methods of analysis using the Business Model Canvas for identifying business process requirements. 
The results of the analysis used a mapping of the system's design features and finally the design method of an 
information system based on mobile devices using UML diagrams. Through the Supply Chain, the channel will be 
organized more effectively and the company will in turn be more competitive

1. Introduction 
Information and communications technology continues to evolve, making it easier for companies to improve their 
performance. The benefits gained through technology are business processes that run in real time. The use of 
technology will provide benefits for companies facing increasingly fierce business competition, which forces 
companies to work hard to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their business. Supply Chain Management is 
an important process in a company where the flow of raw materials, information and finance between companies is 
performed to fulfill customer orders. With the use of internet technology, the concept of supply chain management 
has become E-SCM[Giunipero,2008]. Internet technology provides online, real-time information sharing, so you 
can integrate the business into customers and suppliers[Golicic,2002]. The implementation of E-SCM, which 
involves all parties to the delivery process, i.e. customers, suppliers, internal and external parts of the enterprise, all 
activities in the supply chain process can be performed automatically. and guarantee the sourcing of raw materials 
from both suppliers and products so that they are available to customers at all times[Widyarto, 2019]. 
 
The production of Indonesia-made coffee experienced an increase in production during the period 1980 - 2017 with 
an average growth rate of 2.15% or an average coffee production of 523.83 thousand tons of coffee[Hari, 2013]. 
Coffee production based on entrepreneur status is dominated by coffee production that is cultivated on smallholder

1187","The product purchase process follows the following sequence: 
1. Consumers open the product catalog in the application 
2. Consumers choose products in the catalog 
3. Customers enter order details 
4. Consumers checkout by entering consumer personal data information  
5. consumers can register as customers on the application 
6. Consumers make payments in a variety of payment methods such as bank transfers and payment gateways 
7. After the order is confirmed, the order will be forwarded to the seller 
8. The seller sends the order that has been ordered 
 
Effective distribution of products and materials in the supply and demand process among channel partners is at the 
heart of e-SCM. Integration among partners is a challenge in itself. The Internet and information technology and 
systems offer such integration, but simply implementing and adopting new software is not the answer and solution to 
a sustainable competitive advantage. However, the application of Internet- based technology has great potential to 
reduce costs and increase efficiency 
 
4. Conclusion 
Technology and the internet affect the supply chain in companies that exist, easy information exchange, real-time 
communication with customers or suppliers, quick response, etc. These benefits have an impact on increasing 
customer satisfaction, efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the company's opportunities for market development. 
Companies also need to understand how technology does not automatically increase productivity, but needs support 
from knowledge management. To be a successful knowledge management company, you need to have a close 
relationship Business, binding perspectives and architecture, leadership knowledge, creation and exchange of a 
knowledge culture, continuous learning, developed technological infrastructure and systematic organizational 
knowledge processes.

consumers by accessing it via a smartphone. The back-end section can be accessed by the Coffee for sale admin 
using a computer. Maintaining the collaboration with institutions related to the agricultural industry, especially 
coffee farming. Developing the user interface on the Coffee for sale application to increase the ease of interaction 
between sellers and consumers. Developing a business model so that it can be adapted to the conditions in the future.

Abstract 
Shortage of raw materials may occur in manufacturing companies, which is caused by inaccurate orders for 
raw materials, and lack of raw material supplies. This problem causes inefficient costs due to the production 
process, the possibility of having to emergency procurement to fulfill customer orders. The solution to this 
problem is to develop a web-based system that supports ordering of raw materials. The calculation based on 
the estimated time series with the CB-Predictor. The methodology in the calculation is (1) collecting historical 
data on the use of raw materials, step (2) forecasting raw material needs, step (3) calculating the order 
quantity based on forecasting data, by comparing the deterministic method and the probabilistic method. The 
safety stock for each raw material calculated for situations outside normal conditions, for example increasing 
orders. The design method, the system to be developed uses the Unified Modeling Language (UML) modeling 
language based on the concept of Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD). The result is a web-based 
system application model to support a more efficient and accurate calculation of ordering raw materials. 
With the proposed application of information systems, the company can estimate raw material needs more 
quickly and accurately, and can determine the quantity of orders that are tailored to the needs. So that the 
costs associated with ordering and storing raw materials can be minimized

Abstract 
Indonesia, as the country with the largest economy in Southeast Asia, is one of the automotive production 
bases for export, especially to the Southeast Asia region and as the largest domestic market for automotive 
sales in the Southeast Asia region. Based on data from Gaikindo, ten automotive brands are included in the 
ranks of automotive brands with the most sales in 2019. Based on the results of interviews with 300 
respondents, a percentage of 75.5% of respondents saw that ten automotive brands were included in the 
highest sales in Indonesia and the results of the pre-research questionnaire showed that the brand image of 
automotive products in Indonesia which consists of recognition, reputation, affinity, and domain has not

Conclusion 
 
The conclusion of this research shows that there are three factors of brand image of automotive products that are 
in good category, namely Recognition, Reputation, and Domain, and there is one factor of brand image which is in 
very good category, namely Affinity. Respondents felt that the response was less than the recognition factor, namely 
the tagline of ten automotive product brands that was less easy for consumers to remember, while what was felt was 
lacking was the reputation factor, namely information about the product that was less easily obtained by consumers, 
while the affinity factor that was felt was lacking was that the brand image was less reliable. attract public attention, 
while the domain factor that is felt is lacking, namely the brand image of the ten brands of automotive products does 
not have a clear difference. For automotive selection based on brand image, it is ranked first and so on is occupied by

Abstract 
 
In the contemporary working environment, Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies offer a multitude of possibilities 
to increase productivity and, therefore, the long-term success of industrial companies and small and medium-sized 
enterprises, as well. In this context, the systematic development of digital competencies is a major success factor of 
modern industrial engineering education in higher education institutions. Therefore, this paper reflects the theoretical 
concept of competencies within modern educational approaches, e.g., ‘Education 4.0’ in Europe, with a special 
emphasis on digital competencies. Moreover, the authors present the design of the course ‘logistics system engineering 
and material flow management’ to illustrate the implementation and application of digital technologies in university 
teaching. The module-based concept should further be used as a reference for the realignment of engineering lectures 
in higher education institutions to contribute to the professionalization of industrial engineering education.

Introduction 
In today's transformation society, the teaching of relevant and up-to-date skills is indispensable and represents a central 
element of the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPS, 2020). Thus, high-quality education should be made available 
to all people, so that they can actively and self-confidently make a significant contribution as citizens regarding further 
development and ongoing innovation. The European Competence Agenda of the European Commission (2016) makes 
it clear that Europe has a lot of catching up to do in this respect since around 70 million people are neither able to read 
and write properly, nor do arithmetic, nor do they have digital skills and are, therefore, at risk of poverty, 
unemployment or social exclusion. The demand here lies in fundamental reforms of education systems and their 
orientation toward future-oriented knowledge, skills, and competencies ‘adapted to the digital age’ (EUCO14/17, 
2017). Since technological progress (keywords: artificial intelligence, robotics, IoT, etc.) is developing rapidly, a 
lifelong investment in key skills and, above all, digital skills is required. The tertiary sector is particularly forced to 
push sustainable reforms in terms of skills development and labor market trends to ensure that the next generation of 
professionals is available. Practical experience, new learning instruments, and materials, the use of digital 
technologies, and a lifeworld orientation must be incorporated into modern curricula (European Commission, 2018). 
This paper aims to respond to this demand. In the first step, the concept of competencies will be examined in more 
detail. Moreover, the authors focus on the concept of digital competencies by considering current studies in the context 
of learning and teaching approaches in industrial engineering education (Dallasega et al., 2019; 2020; Woschank and 
Pacher, 2020). In the final chapter, the course ‘logistics system engineering and material flow management’ will be 
used to illustrate the usage and implementation of digital technologies in university teaching.

Conclusion 
 
In this paper, the authors identified modern industrial engineering education in higher education institutions as a major 
success factor within the framework of Industry 4.0 concepts and approaches.  Thereby, a special focus should be 
placed on the systematic development of digital competencies to ensure an ongoing professionalization of the 
industrial engineering profession.  
 
Based on recent theories of competencies and competence development, this paper has introduced a module-based 
concept for the course of ‘logistics system design and material flow management’ by using a set of online and offline 
teaching and learning methods combined with interactive case studies, online sessions, augmented reality 
demonstrations, and discrete event simulation tools. 
 
In this context, future research should focus on the investigation of holistic competence-profiles in the context of 
industrial engineering education in higher education institutions for the engineers of tomorrow. New teaching and 
learning methods are needed to enable students to acquire the necessary transversal skills for the post-industrialized 
world. Higher education must provide future experts with future-oriented knowledge, skills, and competencies for 
maintaining competitiveness and strengthening the European economy. For all students, especially those in STEM 
(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects, the acquisition of extensive cross-sectional and key-
competencies is a major success factor.

Abstract  
 
The essential component of any nation's transportation system is transportation infrastructure. The significance of transport as a driver for 
socio-economic growth has increased in conjunction with the instigation of society and the escalation of foreign relations due to the 
globalization processes. Diverse facets of transport infrastructure growth operations have become rapidly the focus of scientific research. 
Transport is an indicator of economic performance as an economic factor and, at the same time, transport is a function of economic 
growth. Therefore, the issues of evaluating the efficiency of transport infrastructure and the relation between transport infrastructure and 
economic development are the topics for debate in both academic and non-academic circles. This paper evaluates the role of transport 
infrastructure in world economic growth, explains the idea of transportation infrastructure as an essential component of the transport 
system in a nation. Trade practices both in the global and local sense play a key role in economic and social development. Efficient flow 
of goods hinges extensively on transport infrastructure. The transport infrastructure will promote economic growth by promoting the 
movement of goods. This paper addresses four common types of improvements in transport infrastructure, and how they impact economic 
development.

1.0  Introduction 
Transportation infrastructure, as a broad array, links cities and encompasses human actions coupled with the industrialization and 
population increase of the social economic, and environmental structures. The transport network also adds to socio-economic 
development and a higher quality of life by creating inter- or intra-city ties during urbanization (Ebara et al., 2003; Hoff et al., 2010; 
Huang et al., 2016; Kaluza et al., 2010). Therefore, objectives such as low-carbon, robust and sustainable growth should not be 
overlooked when extending the transport network (Huang et al., 2016; Saretta et al., 2019). In-depth, urban transport infrastructure 
contributes to urban convergence and dissemination, thus significantly improving national and international economic development (Holl 
& Mariotti, 2018; Tong & Yu, 2018). Nevertheless, unreasonable transport infrastructure planning also causes adverse effects, such as 
environmental destruction, massive traffic fatalities, environmental issues, CO2 pollution and reduced transport performance (Andrey et 
al., 2014; Laurance et al., 2014; Neeson et al., 2015; Tong & Yu, 2018; Verburg et al., 2011). Numerous effects on transport 
infrastructure from published studies need to be identified. 
Recently, the influence of transportation infrastructure has become a contentious issue, and more focus and discussion has been given to 
the economic impact of transportation infrastructure, due to the promotion of significant economic development of both regions and 
industries (Cohen, 2010; Giang & Sui Pheng, 2011). Scientometric experiments were used to review the literature and identify patterns in 
certain particular subjects, like that of the transportation hypothesis and public transport, to investigate various impacts of transport 
infrastructure (Sun & Rahwan, 2017; Tsay & Lin, 2009).

Abstract  
 
Organisations in recent years have opted for an Integrated Management System (IMS), especially in Quality, Environmental, and 
Occupational Health and Safety, which by design are generally considered to be compatible or rather easier to integrate. IMS is intended 
to consolidate the resources of the organisation in terms of people, documentation, auditing, compliance, etc. and as such it reduces costs 
and brings focus to the business. However, the downside is that the implementation process is not a “same fit for all”, but rather each 
situation is dependent on many factors including the state of readiness of the organisation, its size, maturity level of individual 
management systems and support from the executive management.  Despite the rise in the number of organisations that have implemented 
the IMS in the last number of years, problems related to integration difficulties and lack of alignment with business strategy still exist. 
This paper presents a practical perspective of the challenges and critical factors concerning the implementation of the IMS in a Fast-
Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) business, which by its nature is susceptible to quality, environmental, and safety risks due to its high 
speed of operation.

1.0  INTRODUCTION 
Organisations in recent years have opted for an integrated management system (IMS), especially in Quality, Environmental, and 
Occupational Health and Safety, which by design are generally considered to be compatible or rather easier to integrate (Azadeh et al., 
2019; Muzaimi et al., 2017; Nuhnes et al., 2017). IMS is intended to consolidate the resources of the organisation in terms of people, 
documentation, auditing, compliance, etc. and as such it reduces costs and brings focus to the business. However, the downside is that the 
implementation process is not a “same fit for all”, but rather each situation is dependent on many factors including the state of readiness of 
the organisation, its size, maturity level of individual management systems and support from the executive management.  
 
The integration process needs to be aligned with the overarching business strategy to benefit all stakeholders including the organisation, 
customers, investors and surrounding communities. Garengo & Biazzo (2013) posit the view that despite the benefits that come with the 
IMS in ensuring that the separate management systems align with the organisation’s strategy, not enough studies investigate how a 
comprehensive combination system should be designed and implemented. Furthermore, only a few organisations are aware of the 
difficulties in aligning their IMS as a strategy, hence the need for further research on this topic (Barbosa et al., 2018).  
 
1.1 Background of the Study 
There has been an increase in the number of companies that have adopted global standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 
18001 in the last decade (Poltronieri et al., 2015). This rise was driven by many factors, including the increase in competition (Simon et 
al., 2014), high rate of workplace accidents and fatalities, as well as environmental hazards (Sampaio & Neves, 2012; Santos et al., 2013; 
Oliveira, 2013). Lately, the focus has turned towards the IMS for reasons that are influenced by many factors including organisational, 
financial and benefits for employees (Domingues et al., 2015).

Abstract 
 
Sustainable aviation practices have significantly reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions over the years. 
However, these practices have not shaped the aviation industry in achieving the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs) to its full potential. The increasing volume of air traffic and the benefits reaped in 
this sector has hindered sustainable airline operations. This paper brings up a small scale-literature review on several 
tools and methods used for sustainability assessment in the aviation industry to address this concern, covering all the 
socio-economic and environmental sustainability dimensions. A review of various models and techniques used in 
the eco-efficiency assessment for sustainable airline operations are also discussed. Decision Support Systems (DSS) 
using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep learning, and Neural Network (NN) models also formed the basis of this 
study. This paper's tools and models support strategic and tactical decision-making to foster sustainable operations 
in the aviation industry; thus, helping mitigate the current challenges.

Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
 
1. Introduction 
Industries in the emerging economies worldwide have sought to considerably reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions by adopting sustainable, carbon-neutral development practices (Alsarayreh et al., 2020; Kutty et al., 
2020). The airline industry is no exemption in this regard. Among all the other industries, the aviation industry has 
halved its carbon footprint compared to its operations in the late 1990s (ATAG, 2020).  Introducing new 
technologies such as sustainable fuel alternatives and zero-emission engine designs has promised to cut down the 
aviation emissions, particulate soot, lead contrails, and cirrus clouds (García-Olivares et al., 2020). A decline in 
aviation emissions amounts to a simultaneous decline in the climate change-related impacts thus, addressing the 
Sustainable Development Goal 13: tackling climate-related challenges.  
Despite attempts to significantly cut down the CO2 emissions over the next coming years, the GHG emission values 
are expected to increase drastically due to the airline industry spreading its wings for expansion (Wang et al., 2019). 
Economic progress through enhanced connectivity, clean and sustainable energy utilization and, improved climatic 
conditions are some of the targets set forth by the aviation industry for reducing CO2 emissions by 2050 (EU 
Climate Action, 2020). Promoting development by adopting SDGs across the global aviation sector and building a 
corporate image can foster sustainable operations.

Abstract 
 
This paper proposes a location and design warehouse methodology, starting from the premise that there’s at least 
one existing distribution center (DC), in a manufacturing logistics network. The paper uses current methods with a 
new proposed integral methodology, that covers from a general diagnosis of the current state of the company, up to a 
validation phase for the network redesign. This structured guide aims to simplify the way companies research for 
and develop their expansion and warehouse design projects. Furthermore, it presents a method to take qualitative 
factors into account while deciding on the warehouse location and suggests a validation method that takes more than 
a single stock item’s behavior into account, so results could be more accurate.

1. Introduction 
 
Patiño (2013) explains that Mexico, because of its geographic location, represents a strategic point to attend markets 
such as United States, Central America, and South America. Given this, the country’s government has started the 
development of logistical, specific, and specialized cities, of which the following have been selected: Manzanillo, 
Lázaro Cárdenas, Querétaro, Ciudad de México, Guadalajara, and San Luis Potosí, cities belonging to the central 
point of the country. On the other hand, as stated by Morales (2013), the federal government selected 85 logistic 
platforms that will prioritize strategic projects for the growing and development of logistic infrastructure.  
 
According to Forbes (2019a), DHL, 4th worldwide largest logistic company (PackTech, 2018), has four logistic hubs 
located in Mexico, three of them in the central region of the country. Notwithstanding, as said by Rodríguez (2019), 
Amazon, #1 worldwide biggest e-commerce (Forbes, 2019b), possesses three distribution centers in México located 
in the central region of the country, installations with more than 100,000 square meters for storage space. Also, 
according to (Huq et al., 2006), the quick response ability and client proximity has turned into a significant metric of 
performance and competence. Also, it demonstrates that a scenario with two warehouse replenishment systems, 
instead of one existing warehouse scenario, reduces significantly delivery lead times. 
 
Mexico’s logistic tendency points to companies to get closer to the country’s logistic hubs, primarily located on the 
central region, therefore achieving to obtain a quick response to the consumer’s necessities. This work seeks to 
address the initial situation described, using decision tools and a developed methodology, responding to the existing 
gap with current methods found in the literature.  
 
The proposal outlined in this paper appears to offer significant advantages and contributions to existing literature in 
that in: 1) the location problem is addressed from an existing warehouse scenario; 2) a qualitative index for the

1239",,"families, constituted by the SKUs that represent 15% of the sales revenue. For these group two different methods 
were used: Silver Meal and EOQ. The decision is based on the coefficient of variation of each family. For a 
coefficient of variation less than or equal to 0.2, the EOQ method for variable demand is used; otherwise, for the 
coefficients greater than 0.2, the Silver meal inventory policy is used. For group C, the EOQ policy for stable 
demand was used. Silver proposes that within an ABC analysis, the elements belonging to group C are elements of 
low dynamics and low economic contribution, so the inventory method or policy used is indifferent. 
 
Once the inventory maximums were obtained, the general dimensions in racks and floor necessary for the storage of 
the different products were determined. from the numbers obtained from the inventory policies and according to the 
type of storage required for each product. The result of the analysis showed that 2,125 rack spaces and 623 m2 of 
floor space were needed. Detail design specifications are not provided for confidentiality reasons. 
 
The planning horizon for this DC was 5 years. The reason for this time is due to strategic aspects of the company 
where the corporate objective is to grow twice every five years; however, given the factors of national GDP that this 
type of product has and background in the growth of the group, an intermediate scenario in which the DC design 
will be able to withstand a 45% increase in demand in the same five years. 
 
Among some other steps of the design phase, aspects were defined as the general structure of the warehouse where it 
was determined that the internal flow of products that the DC will have as well as technical aspects of the Layout 
where the number of loading and unloading doors was determined that the warehouse must have given the demand it 
would receive. The adjustment of the office area was carried out in proportion to that of Monterrey. 
 
4.4. Validation 
 
To validate the design a simulation was carried out from an external file of arrivals with random numbers, which 
was prepared with a database with the actual orders of the company for three full months, in order to generate the 
same effect on the simulation as in the current process and get the results that most closely resemble reality. The 
period in which the simulation was carried out was in the month with the highest demand of the fifth year; or in the 
planned intermediate scenario with an increase of 45% of the current demand. 
 
Among the final results that the simulation shows a 30% in the use of the loading doors, which indicates that the 
number of doors that the warehouse has is sufficient and is capable of supporting a greater demand for which it was 
designed. The forklifts used in the process have a 65% utilization. The average number of trucks to be loaded per 
day is 14 with 85% of its capacity which is very efficient given the variety in product dimensions. 
 
The simulation gave us the opportunity to make important decisions on issues that concern and impact the company 
as well as operational processes, money and time. For this reason, it is essential to continue exploring simulated 
scenarios together with the client to obtain more findings and make better decisions.

Abstract 
 
Machine control systems have experienced a paradigm shift, from centralized computer numeric control to 
automatic control. The question, how can the manufacturing industry access the technology flexibility potential 
available to the industry class? Is answered by the adaptive capabilities inherent to technology-based flexibility. The 
objective of this research paper is to distill and develop a process that can render a manufacturing process flexible, 
based on the technology of the manufacturing system. The approach will offer a view that is in contrast with the 
widely held scientific management principles. Technology flexibility is the capacity for a manufacturing process to 
take action when required to meet new system requirements, whether intended or unexpectedly occurring. This 
paper declares that the system flexibility value is an inherent advantage of manufacturing system’s technology. A 
qualitative research approach is adopted to explore and explain how the manufacturing system can be modelled to 
access its flexibility potential.

1247","5. Conclusion (12 font) 
 
Attribute of flexibility, such as multi-skilling labor, which is a manifestation of division of labor, are critical for the 
emancipation of firms to flexible production system. For example, multi-skilling implies acquisition of skills that cut 
across functions and, therefore in environments in which product variety and speed require fluid response, multi-
skilling overcomes the rigidities that set in from the division of labor (Adler, 1988). 
To the extent that the flexibility of the firm’s production system is constraint by its most rigid part, firms will not 
access their flexibility potential even if they were to employ flexible manufacturing technologies (Košťál et al., 
2010). Therefore, for firms to realize their flexibility potential, design principles that are different from the scientific 
management principles must be employed and production systems must be designed to abandon hierarchical modes 
of command and control and facilitate parallel processing. Most importantly, production systems must be designed 
to foster a learning environment in which the system is able evolve incrementally from initial inputs.

Abstract 
 
In the era of technological advancement it is still critical to analyze human errors that are responsible for failures of 
pressure vessels. This is because the adoption of latest technologies cannot totally or abruptly displace the role played 
by human in design, fabrication and maintenance of equipment including pressure vessels. Thus, this paper adopted a 
case study research methodology aimed at examining human errors and their causal factors responsible for pressure 
vessel failure. The analysis feedback established that the slip error in original design contributed to the pressure vessel 
leak. Furthermore, the design error served as a latent error in the fabrication, inspection and maintenance process until 
the leak developed in the longitudinal weld of the shell. The lapse error and mistake due to the inadequacy of the 
repair or replacement procedure resulted in the partial re-fabrication of the shell with its original design error. This 
discussed the causal factors responsible for the identified human errors and then made recommendations to enhance 
design and repair or replacement processes so as to minimize human errors. This paper makes contribution by 
providing insights on pressure vessel failure analysis in viewpoint of human errors and their causal factors.

1. Introduction  
 
Pressure vessels are used in various industries such as petrochemical, power generation, chemical processing, pulp 
and paper and many more for storage of different fluids in different phases. Designs and repairs of pressure vessels 
are governed by legislations and health and safety standards. So those who design and repair pressure vessels should 
also ensure that they comply with the requirements of applicable standards and regulations. 
“Shell, head, attachments, and piping are some of the components that commonly fail” in a pressure vessel (TRC 
Engineering, 2004). Human beings play a major role during the design, fabrication, operation and maintenance of 
systems or equipment. Now, human interactions with the systems or equipment varies according to the phase, but they 
are subject to deterioration due to human error (Dhillon, 2014).  In the paper by NOPSEMA (2015), human error is 
viewed as “a failure of a planned action to achieve a desired outcome”. The design, fabrication, inspection and 
maintenance of pressure vessels are highly reliant of human activities. Dhillon and Liu (2006) classified human errors 
according to the phases under which they occur. Their classification included operating errors, assembly errors, design 
errors, inspection errors, installation errors and maintenance errors. Thus, human reliability is key to the success of 
pressure vessel life-cycle so as to minimize failures related with human error. There are various causes that give rise 
to human error. In Reason (1990) and Alkhaldi et al. (2017) human error is classified as follows: 
• 
Slip error – sometimes referred to as procedural error which means not performing the activity as desired or 
planned.  
• 
Lapse error – means that the action was missed.  
• 
Mistake – means the insufficiency of the plan to accomplish the desired outcome.  
Both a good plan of activity but performance of an unintended action as well as poor plan of activity but performance 
of an intended action lead to an undesired outcome or human error. “Past experiences indicate that during the 
equipment design phase often errors are made that adversely affect equipment maintainability and, directly or 
indirectly, the occurrence of maintenance errors” (Dhillon, 2014). These design errors can be seen as latent errors 
during fabrication, operation and maintenance of an equipment. Poor repairs as part of maintenance errors have a 
significant influence on various equipment breakdowns which accordingly can give rise to risks associated with 
failures of equipment and personal accidents (Mason, 2007 cited in Dhillon, 2014). “Errors are seen as consequences

1256","The results of the study are in line with the conclusion reached by Myszewski (2012), which indicated that human 
errors are ineffectiveness of organizations. This is also supported by Rothblum (2000) who concluded that “most 
human errors tend to occur as a result of technologies, work environments, and organizational factors which do not 
sufficiently consider the abilities and limitations of the people who must interact with them, thus “setting up” the 
human operator for failure”.  
 
3.2. 
Recommendations  
 
Based on the results and discussions presented above, the following recommendations were made: 
• 
The failure investigations should focus on both technical causes of failure and human error equally.  
• 
Human error should not be viewed as a cause of failure but rather as a weakness of a process, system and 
organization.   
• 
Human error should present a company with an opportunity to improve organizational processes rather only 
retraining and disciplining or punishing those that commit errors.  
• 
Manufacturers should review and improve their design review processes  
• 
Checklists should be used to ensure critical steps in design, maintenance and repairs of pressure vessels are 
adhered to.  
• 
There should be awareness training on human errors for manufacturers or designers of pressure equipment.  
• 
There should be proper job design and planning to minimize the impact of time pressure 
• 
Calculations sheets or software packages should be validated for accurate analysis and results.  
To try prevent repair / replacement issues from reoccurring or to enable the repair process to properly identify the root 
cause of failure, the basic process is proposed in Figure 2 below.

1263","It should be noted that this basic repair / replacement process should be followed together with best practices in failure 
and root cause analysis. The design verification process should always use independent set of calculations to ensure 
that the critical features of a pressure vessel are complaint.  
 
Conclusions 
 
The aim of this paper was to unearth human errors responsible for cracks and leak of a pressure vessel and their causal 
factors. Design error was discovered to be the main contributor to the pressure vessel failure which then served as a 
latent failure in the fabrication, operation and maintenance process. This study presented and discussed various causes 
of the design error. The vessel could have also failed after repairs since the user did not incorporate human error 
analysis in the failure diagnosis process. Thus, the user began to refabricate the vessel using the original design 
documents that were found to contain an error.  This paper discusses the causes of the manufacturer to miss out the 
design error and recommendations that were made. The paper makes the following conclusions:  
• 
The designers of pressure vessels should establish robust or enhance design review practices so as to 
minimize design errors. This is because the design review process of the manufacturer was found to be not 
well developed to assist in the identification of design errors especially when there are time and economic 
pressures.   
• 
Users of pressure vessels should be able to do basic pressure vessel calculations to verify if the pressure 
vessels that they have purchased are adequately designed or not. This would have helped to identify the 
design error in the original design phase.  
• 
The repair or replacement process should include proper failure analysis or root cause analysis so to identity 
and eliminate the original cause/s of failure.  
It should be noted that the legislation and health and safety standards are not manuals but they give minimum 
requirements to ensure safe design, fabrication, use and maintenance of pressure vessels. Thus, the engineers are still 
responsible for good engineering judgement to ensure proper analysis of design results and the adoption of adequate 
repair and replacement practices. Future work can be extended by including a number of case studies and even using 
quantitative methods to further unearth the contribution of human errors in failures of pressure vessels.  
This study makes contribution in the human factors engineering domain and pressure vessel design, and replacement 
by providing insights on human errors responsible for pressure vessel failure and their causal factors. This study can 
be used by designers, manufacturers and users of pressure vessel to minimize failures associated with human error. It 
can also be used by researchers as part of the agenda to address human errors in pressure vessel design, fabrication, 
operation and maintenance.

Abstract 
Nowadays, internet of things (IoT) is considered a new generation of internet technology. IoT is a system 
of interrelated computing devices that can transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human 
or human-to-computer interaction. This paper investigates the adoption of such technology in one of the 
leading chains of Saudi retail pharmacies (Al-Nahdi). Currently, Al-Nahdi has an approximate annual cost 
of SR 250,000 due to the refrigerator's failure. Installing IoT sensors was one of the proposed solutions to 
reduce such cost. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of utilizing IoT by calculating the 
return on investment (ROI) of IoT technology. Agent-based simulation (ABM) is used to simulate the 
refrigerators' behaviors of 30 branches of Al-Nahdi. Two different levels of IoT are examined. ROI is 
calculated for the IoT project to determine its profitability. The simulation results show a slight reduction 
in the total cost by applying the first level of IoT while the second level of IoT shows magnificent 
improvement.

Introduction  
Al-Nahdi Medical Company, headquarters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was founded in 1986. The 
company manages more than 1194 pharmacies. It operates a wide national network spread over 
125 cities and villages across the Kingdom, making it one of the most widespread and fastest-
growing companies in the region. The company has more than 135 trucks and four distributions 
centers. Currently, Al-Nahdi has an expected cost due to its refrigerator’s failure. The experts 
suggest an approximate annual cost of SR 250,000. Adopting IoT technology was one of the 
proposed solutions to reduce such cost. 
Internet of things (IoT) is recognized nowadays as one of the most important elements of future 
technology. It is gaining remarkable attention from a wide range of industries (Whitmore, 
Agarwal, & Da Xu, 2015). The information refers to the birth date of the term Internet of Things 
back to 1999 for the first time, as it was mentioned among the contents of a presentation reviewed 
by KIT co-founder Kevin Ashton in front of Procter & Gamble. He draws the attention of senior 
management to an exciting new technology called RFID. IoT is a system for transmitting data 
through various types of media, and it can be described as a global network linked to different 
types of networks.

Nowadays, internet of things (IoT) technology is recognized as one of the most important elements 
of future technology. This technology is gaining huge attention from a wide range of industries. In 
this paper, a conceptual study to test the feasibility of adopting IoT technology is proposed. Agent-
based model (ABM) is built to simulate the behaviors of the refrigerator in one of the leading 
chains of Saudi retail pharmacy. The ABM results indicate that a positive ROI is achieved as early 
as year 5 with 13.39 % when the failure is reduced by 95%. Finally, the limitations and the future 
works of this study are mentioned in Table 7.

Abstract 
 
This paper gives some preliminary results of systems analysis for ethanol production and utilization options as 
residue from sugar mills. Analyses are carried out for all production-chain, with a particular interest in scenarios in a 
middle and large time, where ethanol and hydrogen from biomass resources seem very promising. Peru has a great 
opportunity for using renewable sources biofuel in the public transport, energy demand in micro – small enterprises, 
specially converting traditional crops, like sugarcane, into ethanol to be blended with gasoline or used directly in 
internal combustion engines. Ethanol and sugarcane residues have the potential to reduce our greenhouse gas 
emissions from fossil fuels and the same time to diversifying and to give dynamical to the bioenergy sector.   We 
have identified a market niche in the public transport in Lambayeque, a small town at the north of Peru, where 
existing more than 30000 mototaxis (motorcycles adapted for transport of persons and loads) an economic way for 
public transport based upon gasoline. Lambayeque is an agricultural region characterized by sugarcane and rice 
production and where a new energy scenario could have a positive impact to extend the land base available for 
agricultural activities and to create new market for small rural farmers. These positive impacts in the dynamics of 
the rural economy could have a substantial role in reducing the traditional exodus to urban areas and could create 
more favorable conditions for investment in rural infrastructure, health, and education.

1. Introduction 
 
Motorized transport is essentially based on the internal combustion engine: the engine burns a mixture of air and 
fuel to produce energy that powers the vehicle. Reducing the amount of pollution per kilometers of travel consists in 
using cleaner fuels, and burning fuels more efficiently. Growing transportation problems, including gasoline prices 
and carbon dioxide emissions, are forcing urban governments to consider implementing better public transportation 
initiatives in an effort to reduce the impact of the declining oil economy on our environment and financial markets., 
but research and development of renewable energy sources will require increased funding commitments from

1276","Now, a 7.8% biofuel blending scheme is being promoted by the government's environmental office, but refiners and 
automakers are already questioning whether such blends would damage the fuel systems of Peruvian old vehicle 
fleet. Methane (CNG) and propane (LPG) are now established in Lima but will be almost impossible (at least in the 
next 20 years) to take the all the country to a gas energy system. Geographical, economic and cultural factor made 
difficult a large scale from gas because it could not be fully competitive. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Peruvian producers enjoying preferred access to the United States will be able to export more under a special 
agreement to meet increasing demand caused by the market expansion and policy energy (Pacheco 2019). Taking 
advantage of these new opportunities will demand significant improvement in productivity and output. There is 
growing interest in substituting conventional fuel with much cleaner fuels because ambient concentrations of 
particulate matter are higher than standard. In this case, the local government needs to adopt policies to encourage 
the switch to ethanol (Fernandes 2019). Policies might include taxes for fossil fuels and establishing emissions 
standards for public transport.  But will be necessary beginning in house trying to improvement transport and 
environmental situation. Increasing production and rehabilitant sugar mills will have a great socio-economic impact 
in all the communities from Lambayeque. 
 
A new approach in the development strategies of the region offers the possibility of being able to reduce the 
environmental impact, improve the enterprises’ economy and the creation of jobs (Gaspar et al. 2020). In the middle 
term, cost reduction due to increased production and better use of waste, as well as a shift towards fuels less 
polluting like ethanol, it will open the doors or be the bridge to a solar economy (Figure 2).

Sugar mills are ready for ethanol production to be blended in transport sector and selling out the remaining. Then, 
implementing green harvesting, gasifier and integrating rice husk and other non-biomass renewable resources could 
be promising a new sustainable energy system. We are called developing country, but we don’t need to do the same 
technological path from developed countries. Peru’s challenge is adapting technology to local energy resources. It 
has become clear that electricity does not contribute much to the development of target communities if it is delivered

Abstract 
South African transportation still faces quite a few challenges despite the implementation of BRT 
systems across various metropolitan cities. These include, “lack of public transport accessibility in semi-
urban areas, low ridership, equity imbalances and traffic congestion”. Observations have revealed that 
the BRT has not been effective in meeting all its objectives. This paper evaluates the strategic integrated 
transport growth and development in South Africa and particularly focuses on the City of Johannesburg 
based Rea Vaya. A qualitative research design using one-on-one semi-structured interviews was used for 
data collection. Twelve participants were purposefully selected, which included the commuters, drivers, 
cleaners, fare collectors, security officers, and managers who had been working or using the BRT 
transport system for not less than a year. Qualitative content analysis techniques were used for analysing 
the data and providing an audit trail; the writing of thick descriptions and a reflexive journal were used 
to attain research quality. The findings suggest that there is a high number of car ownership, 
overpopulation, large BRT lanes, road renovations and traffic light malfunctioning which are all factors 
responsible for traffic congestion in the City of Johannesburg, despite the introduction of the BRT system 
that was developed to foster integrated transport particularly to encourage sustainable growth and 
development. Furthermore, findings revealed that the impact of the BRT transport system in the City of 
Johannesburg was positive in terms of saving travelling time, low-prices and creating job opportunities. 
The negative impact, however, is that the advent of BRT has led to the closure of small businesses that 
are located on the road. Poor service delivery, corruption, resistance by taxi drivers, disrespectful 
passengers, inadequate number of buses, and poor remuneration for the employees and interference by 
road users, were found to be the challenges of the BRT operational system.

1. Introduction 
Public transport systems face a multitude of challenges despite its development as a mechanism to 
encourage growth and perpetuate development through Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). These 
challenges range from lack of affordability, lack of accessibility often with long lines of waiting and 
insecurity. These are among the real problems in the province. In perspective, the management of the 
provincial public transport has the intent of improving the efficiency of the system to correct the past 
inequalities and transport challenges (Walters, 2013:26). Urban Public Transport systems such as the 
BRT was a project established in many urban cities in South Africa owing to its ostensible success in 
places such as Curitiba and Bogota. BRT systems become operational in the year 2009 in Johannesburg 
and Cape Town in 2011 (Wood, 2015:568). Rea Vaya, the Johannesburg BRT, was the first 
comprehensive project to be developed as a case study on the African continent and tested during the

1284","at the bus station. Construction of additional roads should be considered to link some part of Gauteng 
that does not have access to the BRT lane. Participants suggested that top management should not take 
decisions for all stakeholders but instead allow all stakeholders to be involved in the decision-making 
process. 
3. Conclusion 
The study seeks to examine the Strategic Integrated Transport for growth and development strategy in 
South Africa particularly to compare BRT systems in metropolitan areas that have implemented 
integrated development strategies such as the City of Johannesburg. The investigation disclosed that a 
high number of car ownership, large BRT lanes, road renovation and traffic light malfunctioning are 
the major causes of traffic congestion in Gauteng Province. Poor service delivery such as constant 
system offline, an unprofessional attitude of some employees, reckless driving, overcrowding, late 
arrival of buses, corruption, resistance by the taxi drivers, disrespectful passengers, inadequate number 
of buses, interference by road users and poor remuneration for the employees are all factors which 
contribute to the malfunctioning of this system. 
To examine the Strategic Integrated Transport for growth and development strategy in South Africa, 
particularly to compare BRT systems in metropolitan areas that have implemented integrated 
development strategies such as the City of Johannesburg, I, therefore, recommend that BRT stations, 
routes and more buses be allocated and allow all stakeholders involved in the decision making process.

Abstract  
 
The main objective of the current paper is to select an appropriate tobacco curing solar thermal collector. Tobacco is 
the second largest foreign currency earner after gold in Zimbabwe. The crop’s post-harvest activities have adverse 
effects through application of fossil fuels especially firewood. Firewood and coal burning have negative 
consequences of increasing the greenhouse effects, air pollution, high levels of deforestation causing subsequent 
land degradation and soil nutrients depletion. Small-scale tobacco farmers are economically disempowered and 
resort to use firewood as the main tobacco curing fuel source. In embracing modern trends of going green, 
introducing solar thermal technology in Zimbabwe becomes a prerequisite. In a survey conducted among small-scale 
tobacco farmers in July 2020, majority of them unanimously accepted a paradigm shift towards sustainability 
through adopting tobacco curing solar technologies. The system should be robust, reliable, durable, affordable and 
sustainable for farmers to have usage confidence and guaranteeing uninterrupted performance as tobacco is 
temperature and humidity sensitive. The main energy generation component is the solar thermal collector with solar 
photovoltaic supplying the system’s electricity needs. The paper develops solar technology selection criteria through 
literature review. Selection made upon reviewing all the factors is the solar thermal air flat-plate collector.

1. Introduction 
Worldwide research carried out on renewable energy (RE) resources and systems in the last 
decades proved that RE conversion systems are cost effective (Kalogirou, 2004). Increased 
greenhouse gases through fossil fuel use add to heat trapped or reduce heat radiated from the 
earth’s surface, raising its temperature (Kalogirou, 2004). RE systems decrease environmental 
pollution by substituting electricity and conventional fuels (Kalogirou, 2004). A farmer 
maximizes available energy resources by distribution optimisation among different consumers 
including solar dryers (Al-Neama and Farkas (2018). An integrated farm solar energy system is 
designed without redundancy by provision of hot water for use. Designed solar air dryers use 
lower temperature for space heating. Medium and higher temperature solar heaters use liquid 
collectors. Crop drying systems employing motorized fans and/or electrical heating are 
inappropriate in many rural locations of most developing countries (Echukwu and Norton, 1999).

Brown et al (2012) cite climate change vulnerability of women due to increased agricultural 
workload, shortage of safe, clean drinking water, gendered division of household labour, extra 
time and exposure to violence and sexual abuse when travelling greater distances to collect water 
from alternative sources, which may be unclean or unsafe. Vulnerable sectors were urged to 
optimize rain feeding, adopt improved short-season seed varieties, efficiently use available 
moisture, apply irrigation and water harvesting techniques, apply mechanisms for improved use 
of water impoundments, increase networks of water storage facilities and adopt improved 
agricultural water use efficiency (Brown et al, 2012). 
 
 
5 Thermal collector selection and recommendations 
Twin calamities of climate change and deforestation are depleting the water resource in 
Zimbabwean farming areas. Unpredictable rainfall and erratic droughts lead to depletion of both 
surface and underground water. Human, animal and plant conflict on the remaining meagre 
water resource available escalates restricting water usage to vital few basics. People draw water 
for use from faraway places and both domestic and wild animals die due to lack of pasture and 
water. Plants and crops including tobacco wilt and die as a result of water scarcity. Farmers are 
financially disempowered to construct weirs, reservoirs and capital intensive borehole drilling. 
Solar water thermal equipment is too sophisticated to be understood and operated by most small-
scale tobacco farmers with literacy slightly above mere reading and writing. Warm water borne 
legionnaires presents challenges. Expected economic life of solar technology systems is 20 years 
of which the water scarcity would have escalated, reducing the solar thermal water collector 
system to a white elephant. Water has better thermal properties such as specific heat capacity and 
conductivity than air but the option available in semi-arid areas is air. A solar thermal air 
collector backed up with an eco-friendly auxiliary heat energy source and solar photovoltaic for 
drives and controls is strongly recommended. This reduces incidences of tobacco fires, 
deforestation by less wood usage as top up auxiliary, land degradation and optimizes water usage 
in competing areas of need. Forests reclamation through establishment of green belts begins.  
 
6 Conclusion 
Following an in depth analysis of solar collectors, availability of solar energy and water in 
Zimbabwean AEZs, a solar air thermal collector system is selected in developing a small-scale 
farmer’s tobacco curing energy system. SAC air heater is a solar thermal harvesting technique 
which have gained tremendous popularity (Saini et al, 2018). System designs would address 
solar air collectors (SACs) weaknesses through follow up on research done to overcome lower 
thermal efficiencies and improve SACs performances (Deng et al, 2015). SACs apply in space 
heating and drying processes due to simple manufacturing and maintenance, freeze resistance 
and less corrosion compared with solar hot water heating systems (Deng et al, 2015). SACs 
energy systems will be developed for Zimbabwean tobacco farmers and the world in general.

1. Introduction 
Lectures at the University of Kanjuruhan Malang always follow the technological institutionalization. One of the 
lecture models is e-learning. Lectures with e-learning adapt to the DARING program implemented by the Directorate. 
The one strategy used is Blended learning. Blended Learning is a flexible lecture approach, utilizing emerging 
technologies that combined learning both face-to-face and online (Garrison and Kanuka 2004; Graham 2012). 
 
One of the obstacles in the implementation of Blended Learning lectures is the use of laptops by students where in 
general not all students have laptops (Sung, Chang, and Liu 2015). As a result, some students are still joining other 
students to do online lectures. To anticipate online lectures that should be done individually by each student is to use 
a smartphone owned by most students. Utilization of smartphones in Blended Learning can accommodate the online 
lectures (Alden 2013; Lum, Bradley, and Rasheed 2011). 
 
Selection of applications in smartphone must be appropriate because with the appropriate application also has an 
influence on the implementation of Blended Learning. The text-based application is one application that can be used 
in Blended Learning (Qamar and Riyadi 2016; Fattah 2015). Some text-based applications on smartphones are 
messenger apps like Whatsapp, BlackBerry Messenger, Line, and Telegram. To be able to reach all the good students 
who have laptops and smartphone then Blended Learning using Telegram applications. Telegram applications have 
the advantage of being able to use a laptop without a smartphone or use a smartphone without a laptop (Iksan and 
Saufian 2017; Nizam et al. 2016). So that, all students can follows Blended Learning.

Abstract  
 
In the Indonesian coffee trade, the bargaining power of coffee farmers and producers can be increased if the 
distribution channels are effective. This study aims to develop a mobile device-based supply chain management 
application as an intermediary between farmers, producers and consumers. The first step is to identify the issues 
related to the parties. The analysis methods consist of market analysis, industrial analysis, and Business Model 
Canvas to determine business processes. Meanwhile, financial analysis is performed on cash flow, present value, 
return on investment, payback back period, and breakeven point to determine the profitability of a project. The 
results of the analysis are used to map the design features of the system. The design method uses UML diagrams. 
Through this start-up application, the channel is more effective, and, finally make the company becomes more 
competitive.

Abstract 
Coal-Fired Power Plants (CFPPs) in the country constitute the largest share of electricity for its demand is 
relatively high but its drastic effect on the environment is quite observed. In other industries, Green production is a 
practice to achieve a sustainable perspective that in effect with the increase in the efficiency of production and reduce 
the use of resources such as fuel, water, spares, etc. The power industry like CFPPs has a big contribution to reducing 
environmental problems. 
This study aims to identify the applicability of Green Maintenance of CFPPs in the Philippines. This study 
used interviews and surveys to gather data and information. A series of statistical tools, such as Descriptive Statistics 
and ANOVA were used to study and interpret the data.  The study was able to assess the current maintenance strategies, 
practices, and maintenance-related performance of CFPPs, to determine the significant operating and maintenance 
parameters affecting the environmental performance and to formulate a Green Maintenance Strategy. It is concluded 
that the principles of green systems for maintenance can be applied in CFPPs in the Philippines. 
To be able to improve this study, it was recommended to conduct more analysis in the improvement of the 
Green Maintenance Strategy.

1. Introduction 
Energy is defined as an ""engine of development"" because of its important role in economic and social 
development, including a higher standard of living, advanced health outcomes, and an increased life age (Greenpeace 
2016). The use of energy in human society has been the measure of advancement in the adaptation and control to the 
society and environment. Electricity is the most-consumed energy source in the world and is one of the indicators of 
economic activity and growth (Lekshmi S.,2010). 
In the Philippines, the generation of electricity is by using different sources such as coal, natural gas, oil-based 
and renewable energy known as green energy such as geothermal, hydrothermal, wind, solar energy, and biomass. 
Based on the Department of Energy (DOE), coal has the largest supplier to the Philippines's present electricity 
generation at 39 percent because it is known to be the cheapest and reliable source of energy. According to the 
Philippine Bureau of Energy Development (BED, 1981) coal is widely available in the country with an estimated 
potential at 1.7 billion MT. But at some point, coal is one of the major causes of climate and environmental changes, 
and some of it in the air, soil, and water pollution that undermines human health and the environment. Also, coal is

Furthermore, to conclude the hypothesis using ANOVA on a significant difference in the current maintenance 
practices among New CFPP and Old CFPP in the Philippines the below table shows the P values. 
 
 
Table 14 Current Maintenance Practices of New and Old Plant 
Based on the Table 14, the P-value is greater than 0.05 which means the null hypothesis is accepted for an old 
and new plant for lean tools implemented in the company. Both old and new CFPPs in the Philippines have P-value 
resulted in 0.63 and 0.11 respectively, which suggests that there is no significant difference in the perception survey 
of both plant employees regarding their lean tools. This implies that employees on both plants are aware and are 
conforming to the maintenance practices and strategies set to their respective company specifically on the lean tools. 
In this case, lean tools as part of maintenance practices and strategies are very important to obtain sustainability. 
For the MP2 of old and new plants, the P-value is 0.003 and 0.000 respectively which means that the null 
hypothesis is rejected. This implies that the organizational focus for both plants is not a basis of compliance with 
maintenance practices and strategies. 
For MP3 of old and new plants, the P-value is both 0.000 which means that the null hypothesis is rejected. This 
concludes that the identified maintenance waste is not a basis to evaluate the maintenance practices and strategies of 
the plants. 
For MP4 of old and new plants, the P-value is 0.025 and 0.003 which means that the null hypothesis is rejected. 
This implies that the current maintenance strategies and practices of the plants are insufficient to achieve sustainability. 
Table 15 Maintenance Practices and Strategies for Sustainability 
Following the decision rule P-value > 0.05, Table 15 presents that the P-value is 0.756 in the old plant accepted 
the null hypothesis. This implies that the old plants have the same knowledge of the maintenance practices and 
strategies to be implemented for sustainability. Based on Table 15, the P-value of new plant is 0.000 which means that 
the null hypothesis is rejected. Based on the result, the new plants have different ideas on maintenance practices and 
strategies to be perfumed to a sustainability approach. 
Regardless of plants where employees are, it is still not the basis of compliance to maintenance practices and 
strategies if the company itself has state of the art facility or a longstanding one. But this can be seen in the maturity 
level of old plants in the analysis on what to practice/implement in the future to have a sustainable performance in 
terms of maintenance aspects 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study was conducted to develop a Green Maintenance framework that can be applied to CFPPs in the 
Philippines. The objective of the study was: (1) to assess the current maintenance strategies, maintenance practices, 
and maintenance-related performance of CFPPs in the Philippines; (2) to determine the significant operating and 
maintenance parameters affecting the environmental performance of CFPPs; and (3) to formulate a Green 
Maintenance Strategy framework and recommend a Green Maintenance Program for Philippine CFPPs. 
To assess the current maintenance practices and strategies of the existing CFPPs in the Philippines, this study 
used a survey and series of interviews. The survey consisted of current maintenance practices and strategies and target 
respondents were asked the level of implementation of their current practices. On the other hand, current maintenance 
strategies asked the level of satisfaction of implementation. 
With this, the study identified that the CFPPs current maintenance practices were observed as being reviewed for 
improvement. Furthermore, the current maintenance strategies were deemed very satisfactory. Also, the researcher

Abstract  
 
The problem in business is that the procurement process is still manual. As a result, purchasing and supplier 
departments are limited in sharing information and negotiating. As a foreign supplier, this is an obstacle and creates 
various problems for the company, especially for the purchasing department. Therefore, companies need an 
electronic procurement (e-procurement) to resolve problems in the procurement process. The methodology used is 
(1) value network analysis method with impact analysis approaches and value creation analysis, (2) design method 
with object oriented analysis and design (OOAD). The result is a prototype of a model for e-procurement for 
information exchange, negotiations with suppliers. The selection of a supplier is more objective and based on the 
evaluation of the supplier's performance.

1. Introduction 
The information.revolution has pushed business competition to become increasingly competitive. Every 
company is required to increase competitiveness in order to be able to win the competition business. The 
role of information technology is very strategic in supporting competitive advantage[2]. Business people 
have begun to think about how to adapt to the development of information technology so that companies 
have an advantage and are able to compete.  
The information system application is a form of contribution to the application of information technology 
to be able to create and support business competitiveness and business processes in the company[3]. At 
the current distributor company, the company's procurement system still uses manual methods, from 
contacting suppliers, agreement’s on prices and product orders, only using telephone, fax or e-mail, 
causing the purchasing department and the supplier to have limitations in exchanging information. Of 
course this becomes an obstacle and causes several problems for the purchasing department in the 
procurement process, such as errors in the number of product orders, errors in the products ordered, errors 
in choosing the right supplier and price accordingly, and changes in the ordering schedule that suddenly - 
arrived because marketing has agreed to change orders with customers. These problems have an 
unfavorable impact, which causes customer satisfaction is not fulfilled[4].  
The company realizes the need to implement e-procurement to maintain its excellence and improve 
customer service, as well as to overcome problems that often occur in conventional procurement 
processes[5]. Companies need to take a purchasing strategy that can provide convenience in relationships 
with suppliers and speed of exchanging information regarding procurement of goods. One of them is by 
changing its old procurement system to e-procurement. 
Procurement.refers to all activities that involve the process of getting goods from suppliers including 
purchasing and also inward logistical activities such as transportation, incoming goods and storage in 
warehouses before the goods are used[6]. Procurement functions include information to complete 
purchase orders, modification and overall supplier searches.

Finally, the create evaluation supplier page that appears when the admin accesses the supplier evaluation

4. Conclusion 
The slow process of ordering products is because the company's business processes are still 
manual and result in a lot of costs. The number of suppliers is very large and the company carries 
out the supplier selection process only for the extent of working experience. Through the 
development of an e-procurement system, it will improve the performance of procurement of 
goods to be more effective and efficient, and can assist in the supplier selection process

Abstract 
 
The research investigated the effectiveness of Thermoelectric Coolers (TEC) as a viable cooling option for outdoor 
refrigeration purposes used outdoor activities e.g. sport events, graduations and wedding ceremonies. The model 
utilized the technology of a TECs which are solid state current devices that operate by applying DC power and 
transfers heat from cold side to hot side, acting as a heat exchanger. The performances and effectiveness of the unit 
was studied by determining the maximum cooling time of system, the number of peltier devices and the optimum 
positioning of the peltiers needed to produce the required refrigeration of a 10L water tank. Solid Works was used to 
carry out thermal simulations on the designed water cooler in a real time environment at outdoor ambient 
temperature to observe the effects of the parameters described above.  The designed system was able to cool down a 
water tank of 10L from 30℃ to 10℃ in 20 minutes by using 4 peltiers with a total refrigeration power of 240W by 
using 280W solar power. Thermostatic control was seen to reduce power consumption of the system by 37.5%. 
which in turn reduced the size of the solar panel. For maximum efficiency the cold side of the peltiers must be 
attached to heat sinks with fins for maximum heat removal from the tank.

power. Thermostatic control was seen to reduce power consumption of the system by 37.5%. which in turn reduced 
the size of the solar panel. For maximum efficiency the cold side of the peltiers must be attached to heat sinks with 
fins for maximum heat removal from the tank. For maximum heat shield mechanism of the water tank from direct 
sunlight, the structure must be painted white with at least three or more insulator covers connected thermally in 
parallel.

Abstract  
 
Zambia’s transportation policy highlights gaps in the transportation sector. This review focuses on analysing railway 
freight services and provides a departure from other similar reviews through a critical review of the Zambia railway 
sector gaps. The study sought to review existing literature, reports, and online information sources on Zambia railway 
freight services by grouping challenges into thematic groups. Causal loop analysis is used to identify cause and effect 
relationships among challenges specific to Zambia. Findings indicate that Zambia’s railroad infrastructure quality 
score (2.4) benchmarks below the average mean score (3.5) of all countries in 2017 and further benchmarks below the 
income group ‘eight-year average’ mean scores on infrastructure quality and train efficiency. Zambia has been 
recording declining railway volumes in terms of ton-km over a 37-years period. Five main thematic areas are identified 
as the main challenges for the railway sector in Zambia. These include infrastructure/ equipment gaps, quality gaps, 
human resource gaps, investment gaps, policy/political will/regional coordination gaps, and business viability gaps. 
The study recommends the need to improve investments in the railway sector and strengthen government commitment 
to resolve the majority of challenges currently associated with Zambia’s railway sector.

Introduction 
Transportation plays a central role in economic growth (Zorina, et al., 2018; Berg, et al., 2017; Eftestol-Wilhelmsson, 
et al., 2014; Hong, et al., 2011) and has become an important aspect of the modern day activity (Sawadogo, et al., 
2012). There are arguments by both academic and policy experts for a “big push” for Africa to narrow its infrastructure 
gap with the rest of world in light of reducing poverty and narrowing the gap in income per capita (Calderón, et al., 
2018). Freight transportation globally has increased by 1,000 times and the resultant effect of increasing flows and

1347","Figure 3 further illustrates that government commitment and appropriate policies and regulatory frameworks are likely 
to form a reinforcing loop strong and appropriate policies are likely to further strengthen government commitment to 
the promotion of the railway sector freight agenda. Appropriate policies and regulatory framework are illustrated to 
positive influence intercountry railway access occupational and operational safety which further influence cargo 
volumes. Government commitment is further illustrated to positively influence operational costs leading to increased 
maintenance activities responding to both poor state of railway infrastructure and a lack of consistence maintenance. 
Sustainable financing for railway infrastructure is arguably achievable in Zambia through implementation of a private 
public partnership model (MNDP, 2018). Strengthening government commitment by instituting appropriate policies 
and regulatory framework for railway freight services will improve private public partnership implementation in 
Zambia.  
5. Conclusion and Recommendation  
The study undertook an analysis on the transport usage in Zambia by specifically reviewing the current railway freight 
services from 1960 to 2018. The review found that even though Zambia intends to revamp the railway sector through 
investments in the railway, its current performance is lower than most of the countries in the Sub-Saharan region. The 
review showed that key policy and strategic documents such as the 7th National Development Plan, National Transport 
Policy (MTC, 2019), National Transport Policy Implementation Plan, and Statutory instrument No 7 of 2018, all 
stimulate the growth of the railway freight services in the sector. The review also indicated that Zambia scored lower 
in the quality, efficiency, performance in relation to goods moved in the industry and other countries in the sub-
Saharan region. It can be concluded that Zambia’s railroad infrastructure is old, dating back to the early 1900’s, and 
this lowers its ability to transport more cargo and achieve higher speed. Additionally, the poor performance can be 
attributed to a single-track system that poses challenges. A further review of the challenges highlighted in literature 
and reports indicates that a lack of investment in railway infrastructure in Zambia has led to the poor state of railway 
infrastructure. The main challenges impacting the railway sector in Zambia include infrastructure/Equipment Gaps; 
Quality Gaps; Human Resource Gaps; Investment Gaps; Policy/Political Will/Regional Coordination Gaps; and 
Business Viability Gaps.  
A causal loop analysis reviewed that a clear linkage between improving investments in railway sector and 
strengthening government commitment to resolving the majority of the challenges currently associated to the 
performance of the railway sector as a whole, was significant and high recommended. In order to achieve the 
movement of Zambia to become a regional hub for transportation services in the SADC, the study recommends that 
Zambia should address the multiple challenges that have been outlined in the situation analysis of the railway sector.

Abstract  
 
The aim of this research was to investigate the causes of time overrun in telecommunication projects in Zambia. To 
achieve this goal a multi-mode descriptive study was adopted by using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. 
A detailed literature review was undertaken in which 34 factors that cause delay in telecommunication projects were 
identified and verified through interviews. These factors were then categorised into five generic elements using a 
fishbone diagram framework. A questionnaire containing 34 identified factors was distributed to the rest of the 
professionals involved in telecommunication projects including network operators, equipment vendors, contractors, 
telecommunication infrastructure support companies. The results gave a response rate of 78%. Findings showed that 
eight highest ranked factors were identified with the highest frequency of occurrence and impact on the schedule. 
Most of the interviewed experts pointed to poor planning as the main cause of project schedule overrun, which affects 
subsequent project phases. Based on the fishbone framework, it was also found that process-related factors were the 
major contributors to project delays. These results highlight the need to adopt the Project Talent Triangle to enhance 
project time performance for telecommunication projects that improves time management processes and is considered 
and the emerging trend.

1. Introduction 
Time is one of the major considerations throughout a project management life cycle and can be regarded as one of the 
most important parameters of a project and a driving force to project success. Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) projects, like other infrastructure projects, experience frequent time overruns or schedule slippages. 
With the telecommunication industry having reached maturity stage in its cycle, bringing better products to markets 
faster has become more critical not only for revenue but competitive advantage. The ICT industry is one of the fastest 
evolving sectors influenced by constant technological changes, diverse and constantly changing customer

1359","stakeholder engagement, especially at an early stage as the cause for poorly developed schedules. According the 
PMBOK Guide (PMI, 2008), stakeholder identification is the first step of the stakeholder management knowledge 
area done during project initiation phase. The effect of stakeholder involvement cannot be over-emphasised. Involving 
the customers and other stakeholders during initiation improves the probability of shared ownership, deliverable 
acceptance, and, customers and other stakeholder satisfaction (PMI, 2008). There should also be incentives for 
procurements and works done ahead of schedule, as well as penalties for delays at any project phase. 
For process related delays, the results show that a flawed schedule development process and poor information 
gathering before timelines are decided are the main contributors. Under-estimation of activity duration and over-
optimistic estimates both highlight the tendency by project managers and sponsors to overestimate benefits and 
underestimate negatives. This was pointed out by Flyvbjerg (2011) in his study of root causes of overruns in major 
projects. Under-estimation of activity duration is a consequence of what he termed “optimism bias”, a tendency by 
managers to make decisions based on “delusional optimism rather than on a rational weighting of gains, losses, and 
probabilities”. Over-optimistic estimates are “principal-agent problems”, where top management push for project 
completion as quickly as possible (Flyvbjerg, 2011). However, the uncontrolled pressure risks the quality of the work, 
resulting in reworks and failure at closeout (acceptance) stage. 
The standout contributor is the lack of dedicated project teams for most of the telecom projects. Aminah and Chai 
(2013), categorised these as structural causative factors where teams can either be appended, stand-alone or partnership 
structure. Operations teams are involved in project activities, resulting in, the project manager has no complete control 
over the team, and relies on the functional managers for availability of the resources; it results in conflicting/competing 
priorities between operational and project activities. Operations teams tend to rank operational activities higher, as 
this is their main key performance measure; and the added workload over-stretches the operational teams, resulting in 
inefficiency of both operational and project activities. 
Concerning equipment related factors, late delivery of project materials and a long procurement approval process were 
cited as the main contributors under equipment related delays. This points to the failure in the “Conduct Procurement” 
and “Control Procurement” during the project execution and monitoring and control respectively, as guided by 
PMBOK® Guide (PMI, 2008). Interview results showed that there is usually a disconnect between the project team 
and the supply chain management (procurement) team, and the two may not attach the same priority to the project. 
Late delivery of materials was attributed to logistical challenges in shipment of materials, warehousing processes and 
inefficiencies in the equipment suppliers. 
Environment related delay factors 
With regards to environmental related delay factors, the results obtained show that environment related factors affect 
the project schedule the least. This is highlighted in Table 4 where the highest ranked factors are support infrastructure 
availability and space acquisition and preparation, with score of nine. The low score of environmental factors shows 
the differences between construction and telecommunication projects, as highlighted by Sherif (2006) and Taylor 
(2004). 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation  
Delays are inevitable; however, they can be avoided or minimized when their causes are effectively identified and 
analysed. This research has identified and, based on the quantified factor importance indices, determined the influence 
ranks of thirty-four (34) factors causing delays in telecommunication projects in Zambia. The stakeholder perception, 
through the questionnaire survey, revealed the top eight ranked factors as: (1) Unclear project scope and deliverables 
at initiation; (2) Poor stakeholder identification and involvement; (3) Under-estimation of activity duration; (4) Over-
optimistic estimates; (5) Lack of project surveys or feasibility studies; (6) Lack of dedicated project teams; (7) 
Procurement approval process; and (8) Late delivery of project materials by suppliers. From the five categories of 
Management, Process, People, Equipment and Environment, it was concluded that process related factors are 
responsible for most of the delays experienced in Zambia. From the results, it was identified that either the project 
managers (PM) do not have the required experience or power to control the activities of the project.

1368","In order to address the project schedule slippages experienced in the telecommunication industry in Zambia, the study 
recommends that there is need to improve project planning by adopting the bottom-up approach through brainstorming 
sessions and use of knowledge management practices. Most of the telecommunication projects are similar in nature 
and learnings from previous projects can be used as valuable input into the planning process. The study also 
recommends that project activity coordination be improved for competence and experience of project managers, to 
attain success. The project managers should have enough control to ensure over and under-estimates do not occur 
during schedule development. Finally, the study implores the adoption of modern approaches such as the Talent 
Triangle to enhance project time performance.

Abstract  
 
Contract implementation is one of the most fundamental but challenging part of procurement contract management. 
The study focused on assessing how the application of the balanced scorecard can enhance effectiveness in contract 
management performance at the Lusaka Provincial Administration in Zambia. This was done by investigating the 
factors affecting the practice of contract management and examining the effectiveness of the balanced scorecard. The 
study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods. While data was collected using an interview guide and a 
semi-structured questionnaire. Purposive and simple random sampling were used as sampling techniques. The sample 
size of 76 respondents all took part in the survey giving a 100% response rate, while six (6) technocrats were 
interviewed. The study findings revealed various challenges affecting the success of contract management. There is 
also a relationship between balanced scorecard and contract management performance. The study developed a 
framework that can be used for the implementation of balanced scorecard in bringing about improved contract 
management performance. The study recommended the need to formulate policy that enhance application of balanced 
scorecard across the public sector. The study further proposed a model for the implementation of the balance scorecard 
that can be used to mitigate the challenges.

6. Conclusion and Recommendation  
The study objective of assessing how the application of the balanced scorecard can enhance effectiveness in contract 
management performance at the Lusaka Provincial Administration. Effective contract management improves service 
delivery in terms of cost, saving time, standardization of processes and procedures as well as facilitates the provision 
of up-to-dated information on the contract and improved compliance. The study concluded that the application of a 
balanced scorecard is fundamental in effective enhancing of contract management, and that impacts on positively on 
both internal and external business processes and organizational growth.  
The study recommended a model was developed for the implementation of a balance scorecard for contract 
management performance. The model shows that in implementing the balanced scorecards in an institution, there must 
be proper development of human resource to ensure the management’s behaviour or people with relevant skills 
(interpersonal and management skills) to manage these relationships and interconnections of balance scorecard at 
multiple levels in the organization. It is also recommended that a similar study be replicated in other institutions in 
the public sector where this tool can be adopted. Further research should also be done involving all the employees at 
Lusaka Provincial Administration, to evaluate the challenges and successes of implementing a balanced scorecard at 
Lusaka provincial Administration once adopted. The study limitations include the narrow span of time for conducting 
the research could not allow to test and validate the proposed model. Additionally, the research was confined to the 
viewpoints of Lusaka Provincial Administration only and technocrats from ZPPA, RDA, and Ministry of Finance, 
excluding the viewpoints of other public and private institutions or companies.

Abstract  
 
It has been argued that constructing urban markets through the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) allows for 
quality provision of urban infrastructure at relatively affordable cost in rentals to the public. However, this is not the 
case in Zambia, despite existing policies, PPP Act and Framework, the country still faces challenges in managing 
Chachacha and Luburma public markets in Lusaka District. This study aimed at establishing the causes of poor 
delivery of urban market projects procured using PPP arrangements. The study used an exploratory research design 
through a mixed method approach in which in-depth interviews and questionnaires were used to collect primary data 
from 59 respondents. Findings disclosed that the causes of poor delivery are centred on project structuring. The study 
concluded that poor delivery was due to inexperience in PPP structuring which impacted risk assessments and 
allocation. Economic and financial risks were ranked at the very top after political interference, poor contract 
management, inexperience and poor negotiation as the key reasons why the delivery of public markets have been poor. 
The study proposed a risk management model and recommended it to be adopted for future urban market project 
delivery with PPPs agreements.

Introduction 
At global level, public private partnerships (PPPs) are a popular model through which infrastructure is developed since 
the early 1990s. The Project Management Institute (PMBOK) (2017) opines that the need for sustainable development 
and effective service delivery has always been at the top of the agenda of all governments around the world. In most 
developing countries, issues of poor infrastructure and lack of requisite infrastructure has been a major impediment to 
sustainable development and effective service delivery (World Bank, 2017). A number of countries in developed 
economies, such as Australia, Canada, USA, and the UK, developing economies and middle-income countries from 
Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe have procured infrastructure through the use of the PPP schemes (PMBOK, 2017). 
Transactions made through PPPs are usually very complex, and extensive, of which they require due diligence by both 
Contracting Authorities and private parties before concluding a PPP Contract (World Bank, 2017). Most PPPs have

The purpose of the study was to establish the causes of the poor delivery of urban market projects procured using PPP 
arrangements. The research findings disclosed that the causes of poor delivery are centred on project structuring. 
political interference, poor contract management, inexperience with PPPs and poor negotiation were revealed as the 
key reasons why the delivery of public markets has been poor. The research also verified that despite the enactment 
of a PPP policy and Act in 2009, which was amended in 2018, the regulatory framework in Zambia is still weak. All 
the findings matched with what is prevailing on the national, regional and global scene which gave the researcher 
confidence that the findings were reliable.  
Given the findings of this study, it is recommended that decision makers should adopt as a way ameliorating identified 
problems discussed in this research through the creation of an enabling regulatory environment that will make risks 
inherent in PPP projects become much more threatening to project success. Additionally, systematic training and 
development is required to capacity building of professionals in managing PPP projects during implementation. The 
adoption of the proposed risk management model is poised to enhance PPP project planning, implementation and 
monitoring for urban markets, as it suggests processes that could be used to implement PPP projects within the urban 
market industry. The proposed model was validated through interviews. The study limitations include concessionaires 
who have been involved in PPP projects that have been poorly delivered did not show willingness to share their 
experience; and most departments had inadequate experience working with PPPS.

Abstract  
 
In spite of the many studies on the role of stakeholders’ engagement in road construction projects in Zambia, little is 
known about their impact on performance. One pertinent issue was to address the challenge of ineffective stakeholders’ 
engagement in road construction projects by way of considering stakeholders’ needs and expectations prior to 
commencement of project implementation. This study was undertaken with the intention to evaluate the impact of 
stakeholders’ engagement on performance of road construction projects in Lusaka District under the L400 roads 
project. The study’s aim was achieved through the assessment of relationships between stakeholder engagement and 
the three performance parameters namely; project cost, project schedule and project specifications. The research 
approach that was adopted was a quantitative with descriptive research design. Both primary and secondary data were 
collected using a semi structured questionnaire which gave a 98% response rate. Findings revealed presence of a strong 
and positive correlation between stakeholder engagement and project schedule also between stakeholder engagement 
and project specifications. Results also showed that stakeholder’s engagement was strongly but negatively correlated 
to project cost. A model was recommended for the development and adoption in the management of stakeholders 
during road construction projects with room for future improvement.

1.    Introduction 
The World Bank report (2018), stated that improved infrastructure leads to increased productivity and growth either 
directly or indirectly thus contributing to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The construction sector is widely considered 
to be the major GDP contributor for any nation (Mirawati, 2015). Rhodes (2015) revealed that in the year 2014, the 
United Kingdom’s (UK) construction industry managed to contribute One hundred and Three billion pounds towards 
the economy, translating to 6.5% of the total economic output. Although infrastructure is critical to the development

1396","6.    Conclusion  
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of stakeholder engagement on performance of roads construction 
projects in Lusaka District under the L400 roads project. The study concluded that stakeholder engagement was 
strongly but negatively linear related to project costs in roads construction projects under the L400 roads project in 
Lusaka District, Zambia. The study also concluded that stakeholder engagement significantly relates to project cost, 
schedule and specifications. The study found that stakeholder engagement during stages of project scheduling was 
strongly and positively linear related to project scheduling. Furthermore, it was found that stakeholder engagement 
during stages of project scheduling was applied to a great extent.  
The study recommends that stakeholder engagement in road construction projects should be enhanced as this would 
significantly contribute to performance of projects in-terms of cost. The respondents indicated that stakeholder 
engagement strongly but negatively relates to project cost such that when one variable increases the other variable 
decreases. The study also recommends that stakeholder engagement in project costing should not be detached episodes 
but rather be applied throughout the project cycle. The study further recommends that, stakeholders should be involved 
throughout the stages of project scheduling in order to ensure that project produces required outcomes as set by 
concerted efforts. Thus, it is recommended that a model developed for implementing stakeholder engagement in road 
construction projects be adopted with room for other researches. The study limitations was that some participants 
especially the Civic Leaders were not very conversant with the Lusaka Four Hundred (L400) Roads project as they 
claimed to have less knowledge about it.

Abstract 
Zambia’s transportation policy highlights gaps in the transportation sector. This review focuses on analysing railway 
freight services and provides a departure from other similar reviews through a critical review of the Zambia railway 
sector gaps. The study sought to review existing literature, reports, and online information sources on Zambia railway 
freight services by grouping challenges into thematic groups. Causal loop analysis is used to identify cause and effect 
relationships among challenges specific to Zambia. Findings indicate that Zambia’s railroad infrastructure quality 
score (2.4) benchmarks below the average mean score (3.5) of all countries in 2017 and further benchmarks below the 
income group ‘eight-year average’ mean scores on infrastructure quality and train efficiency. Zambia has been 
recording declining railway volumes in terms of ton-km over a 37-years period. Five main thematic areas are identified 
as the main challenges for the railway sector in Zambia. These include infrastructure/ equipment gaps, quality gaps, 
human resource gaps, investment gaps, policy/political will/regional coordination gaps, and business viability gaps. 
The study recommends the need to improve investments in the railway sector and strengthen government commitment 
to resolve the majority of challenges currently associated with Zambia’s railway sector.

1. 
Introduction 
Transportation plays a central role in economic growth (Zorina, et al., 2018; Berg, et al., 2017; Eftestol-Wilhelmsson, 
et al., 2014; Hong, et al., 2011) and has become an important aspect of the modern day activity (Sawadogo, et al., 
2012). There are arguments by both academic and policy experts for a “big push” for Africa to narrow its infrastructure 
gap with the rest of world in light of reducing poverty and narrowing the gap in income per capita (Calderón, et al., 
2018). Freight transportation globally has increased by 1,000 times and the resultant effect of increasing flows and 
distances between firms has increased the demand for intermodal services (Sawadogo, et al., 2012). Among world 
regions, Sub-Saharan Africa has recorded a decline in road infrastructure over the past 20 years and with railroad 
network similarly continuing to deteriorate as indicated in 2014 (<0.002 km per square km of surface area) (Calderón, 
et al., 2018). Intermodal transportation imply the “multimodal chains or networks involving at least two transportation 
modes, freight being packed into a “container” and not being handled at intermodal-transfer terminals on its trip from 
its origin to its destination” (Crainic, et al., 2018).  
Literature has shown evidence that there is a strong linkage between transport infrastructure and economic growth, 
according to Hong, et al. (2011) who reviewed evidence from 31 provinces in China. They indicated a strong linkage 
between transport infrastructure and economic growth. While Cigu, et al. (2019) who reviewed evidence from 28 
European countries concluded that transport infrastructure status had a significant impact on economic development. 
Literature further shows that in developing countries, transport infrastructure development has a positive feedback on 
economic activity (Fisch-Romito & Guivarch, 2019). Tendedziso, et al (2019) and Bröcker and Rietveld (2009) stated

(ZIPAR, 2016); and poor coordination between regional railway companies (Foster & Dominiguez, 2011; PMRC, 
2019). Figure 3 illustrates how strengthening Government commitment, on the basis of railway industry being fully 
own by government is likely to improve performance in the railway sector.  
Geopolitical challenges and lack of influence on neighbouring railway companies (MOF, 2010; MOF, 2014) are 
seemingly risks worth noting and planning for in respect to managing and operating railway services in Zambia as per 
illustration in figure 3 as these are external to control of policy and planning and Zambia railway industry decision 
making.  
 
  
Figure 3. Causal Loop Diagram on Railway Industry for Freight Services in Zambia 
Figure 3 further illustrates that government commitment and appropriate policies and regulatory frameworks are likely 
to form a reinforcing loop strong and appropriate policies are likely to further strengthen government commitment to 
the promotion of the railway sector freight agenda. Appropriate policies and regulatory framework are illustrated to 
positive influence intercountry railway access occupational and operational safety which further influence cargo 
volumes. Government commitment is further illustrated to positively influence operational costs leading to increased 
maintenance activities responding to both poor state of railway infrastructure and a lack of consistence maintenance. 
Sustainable financing for railway infrastructure is arguably achievable in Zambia through implementation of a private 
public partnership model (MNDP, 2018). Strengthening government commitment by instituting appropriate policies 
and regulatory framework for railway freight services will improve private public partnership implementation in 
Zambia.  
5. Conclusion and Recommendation  
The study undertook an analysis on the transport usage in Zambia by specifically reviewing the current railway freight 
services from 1960 to 2018. The review found that even though Zambia intends to revamp the railway sector through 
investments in the railway, its current performance is lower than most of the countries in the Sub-Saharan region. The 
review showed that key policy and strategic documents such as the 7th National Development Plan, National Transport 
Policy (MTC, 2019), National Transport Policy Implementation Plan, and Statutory instrument No 7 of 2018, all 
stimulate the growth of the railway freight services in the sector. The review also indicated that Zambia scored lower 
in the quality, efficiency, performance in relation to goods moved in the industry and other countries in the sub-
Saharan region. It can be concluded that Zambia’s railroad infrastructure is old, dating back to the early 1900’s, and 
this lowers its ability to transport more cargo and achieve higher speed. Additionally, the poor performance can be 
attributed to a single-track system that poses challenges. A further review of the challenges highlighted in literature

1417","and reports indicates that a lack of investment in railway infrastructure in Zambia has led to the poor state of railway 
infrastructure. The main challenges impacting the railway sector in Zambia include infrastructure/Equipment Gaps; 
Quality Gaps; Human Resource Gaps; Investment Gaps; Policy/Political Will/Regional Coordination Gaps; and 
Business Viability Gaps.  
A causal loop analysis reviewed that a clear linkage between improving investments in railway sector and 
strengthening government commitment to resolving the majority of the challenges currently associated to the 
performance of the railway sector as a whole, was significant and high recommended. In order to achieve the 
movement of Zambia to become a regional hub for transportation services in the SADC, the study recommends that 
Zambia should address the multiple challenges that have been outlined in the situation analysis of the railway sector.

Abstract 
 
In multi-grade petrochemical production, switching of production from one grade to another grade, a certain amount 
of transitional grade called off-spec is produced. The quantity of the off-spec depends on the sequencing of grades 
production. The off-spec is a cheap product and to enhance its quality it should be blended with premium grades. 
Therefore, sequencing of multi-grade petrochemical production is vital issue. Usually petrochemical production 
companies try to minimize off-spec production by ordering grades production according to their melt flow rates. 
Following the melt flow rate without taking into consideration customer needs will negatively affect the performance 
of the petrochemical companies.  Therefore, a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to 
determine the optimal production plan and the right sequence. The proposed model also take into consideration the 
impact of demand variations on the integrated production planning and sequencing. The model enforces the production 
to follow the melt flow rate and satisfy the customer demand, simultaneously. In addition, the obtained results indicate 
that uncertainty in demand has a high impact on the performance of the proposed model.

1. Introduction 
The petrochemical industry is a competitive and sensitive sector. Petrochemical products are used in 
household, engineering plastics, automotive parts, medical appliances and prosthetic implants. Due to the multi uses 
of petrochemical products, globalization, governments’ regulation, the global demand for petrochemical products is 
increasing with high rate. Therefore, petrochemical stakeholders have to look for ways to maximize both production 
efficiency and management effectiveness. During the last few years, it has been noticed a considerable variation in 
petrochemical markets. Therefore, some companies faced a budget deficit, and then some projects were stopped. 
Therefore, decision-makers have to adapt their production plans to tackle and incorporate any possible uncertainty. 
In petrochemical production, different multi-grades are being produced from a single raw material by altering 
some parameters such as the temperature of reactor, the pressure of reactor, catalysts, and volume of raw materials. 
These grades differ in physical and chemical properties, which leads to different levels of demand, prices, and 
production cost. Switching production from one grade to another grade will produce a certain amount of transitional 
grade called off-spec. The quantity of off-spec product depends on the production sequence (i.e. the preceding grade 
and the following grade). Each grade has its specific melt flow rate, and to reduce the off-spec production and get a 
smooth production, the grades production can be ordered based on their melt flow rate. The melt flow rate is a measure 
of the ease of flow of melted plastic. However, following the melt flow rate without taking into consideration customer 
needs will negatively affect the performance of the petrochemical companies.  
 
Usually, the off-spec has low-quality features that disable it from being sold and in rare cases, some off-spec could be 
sold at low price. Therefore, it is curtail to follow an optimal sequence of producing the different grades in order to 
minimize the off-spec production and at the same time satisfy customer needs. Therefore, in this study, a stochastic

The ability of the stochastic programming approach to capture uncertainty in demand is evaluated using the 
Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI). The EVPI measure is determined as the difference between the 
stochastic solution and the wait-and–see solution and it indicates how much it is worth to know the future with full 
certainty. The stochastic solution was equal to $23.5 million which is 4% better than the actual cost of year 2019. The 
wait-and-see solution is $21.7 million. 
Therefore, the Expected Value of Perfect Solution is $1.8 million which represents the amount that the 
decision-maker is willing to pay for obtaining perfect information about the demand. This indicates that uncertainty 
in demand has high impact on the generated plans. Consequently, the marketing department should accurately forecast 
the future demand. To summarize, the issue of uncertainty is very important in petrochemical production, and it is 
vital to consider randomness during optimization. 
 
Conclusion 
In this study, a stochastic mixed-integer programming model was developed to effectively integrate and 
determine the optimal petrochemical multi-grade production planning and sequencing on multi-period and multi-

polypropylene is produced. The advantage of using the stochastic modeling approach over the deterministic approach 
has been proven using the EVPI quality measure. The generated plans have considerably high EVPI values when 
considering demand as stochastic, which indicates that demand has high impact on the obtained plans. Therefore, it is 
vital to take care of the demand parameter during forecasting and estimation. Therefore, the aim of the proposed model 
is to jointly generate an optimal sequence as well as optimal production volumes to satisfy customer needs.

Abstract  
 
In this study, a typical shopping mall business was modeled as linear programming problem which was solved with 
the aid of computer software - LINGO. The results revealed that the supermarket operations can be optimized by 
enhancing her business functions, by minimizing the functions’ costs, which eventually lead to profit maximization. 
Specifically it was observed, from the analysis, that among other costs, the following costs are very critical and can 
never be zero, no matter what; dating stock cost, management reporting cost, cash sales cost, ordering and delivery 
cost.

4. Model Solution and Discussion 
A computer software – LINGO, was used to solve the resulting mathematical model, the following results were 
obtained: Updating stock cost (X32) = 1234.568, Management Reporting Cost (X34) =1653.614, Cash Sales cost 
(X41) = 1234.568 and Ordering and delivery Cost (X31) = 1680.865. Other cost were zero. This implies that, in order 
to achieve the goal of ultimately maximizing the profit of the shopping mall, most of the costs of the business functions, 
which form the decision variables, must be zero. That implies that the aim of profit maximization would not be 
achieved, if they attract any cost. This is almost impossible in practical terms except the management of the shopping 
have alternative ways of sourcing for some of the inputs without incurring any cost. However, the shopping mall’s 
profit would be maximized if the following critical cost units taken care of such that the values are not exceeded.  
In particular it was observed that all the costs under marketing/pricing are to be zero if the mall is to maximize her 
profit. These costs include: Cost of deciding what stock to sell, Cost of setting prices, Cost of discounting prices, and 
Cost of advertising campaigns 
One good explanation to this is that the business environment is such that there is no completion. The business is 
monopolistic in nature. The shopping mall is purely run by the University where it is situated. So there will be any 
need for incurring any of the following costs: Cost of deciding what stock to sell, Cost of setting prices, Cost of 
discounting prices, and Cost of advertising campaigns, for obvious reasons.

1434","The study was all about modelling Covenant University’ Shopping Mall Business using linear programming 
algorithm, with the single objective of maximizing profit. The business Functions’ Costs were minimized in order to 
achieve the maximization of profit. 
It was observed that some cost should not be considered at all if the objective of profit maximization is to be achieved. 
This idea is line with fact that the supermarket business in Covenant University is without competitors. Therefore 
costs like advertisement cost, marketing cost, discounting cost, cost of setting prices and so on, should be zero. This 
is because the university community is bound to buy, most of the time, whatever is available, with little or influence 
on the price of the items. The system is monopolistic in nature. However four major costs are very significant in order 
to achieve the objective of profit maximization. These costs include: Updating stock cost, Management Reporting 
Cost, Cash Sales cost, and Ordering and delivery Cost. If the values indicated by the results obtained from the solution 
provided using LINGO computer software, are anything to go by, then not exceeding those cost values would 
enhanced, to a large extent the possibility of maximizing the profit of the supermarket business in Covenant University.

Abstract  
Supermarkets in Covenant University are with little or no competition. However, the level of profit making is below 
the optimal. This study attempted to identify the factors responsible for the low level of profit making and apply linear 
programming algorithm to maximize the profit by identifying the factors with highest contributions in order to improve 
profit making of these supermarkets. The resulting model was solved with the aid of computer software - LINGO. 
The results obtained showed that staff turnover and late restocking are two of the factors that significantly contribute 
to the low-level profit making of the supermarkets.

4. Result Discussion 
It can easily be observed from the results above that the maximum profit for Covenant University Shopping Mall is 
the highest, P2 = 89,384, when compared with the other two supermarkets. This can be attributed to the fact that most 
students patronize this particular supermarket because of its proximity from their hostels and lecture halls. The major 
items contributing to the profit are chocolate and provisions, which are student’s delights.   
 
However, for the SBS supermarket, the maximum profit is the next highest (P3 =77.31). Most Faculty and staff 
patronize this supermarket. Few students patronize the supermarket because of the distance from student’s center of 
daily activities. The same items coincidentally, contribute to the maximum profit. 
 
The third supermarket with the lowest maximum profit, P1 = 55.71, is the Covenant University Guest House Minimart. 
The reason for this is not far-fetched; few people patronize the minimart. The main reason for its location was to take 
care of guests’ immediate needs, such as toiletries, cosmetics and so on. This explains why such items contribute 
significantly to the maximum profit. 
 
In all, items like chocolate and provisions are very significant in maximizing the profits of all the three supermarkets.  
 
5. Conclusion  
In order to optimize the level of profit making in all the three supermarkets considered in this study, the factors 
responsible should be taken seriously. These items mostly in demand. The operations expenses notwithstanding, if the 
products or items such as chocolates, provisions and cosmetics are concentrated upon, the optimal profit would be 
achieved at the three supermarkets. The application of linear programming algorithm and LINGO software have really 
aided the results obtained.

Abstract 
Characterization of waste is the first step in planning any sustainable waste management policy that will stand the 
test of time. Many published works gotten from various publication domains such as Science Direct, Engineering 
village, Springer books, etc. were reviewed to understand different approaches by different authors on the different 
solid waste characterization methods. The different waste characterization methods have been reviewed in this 
paper. The methods include two major categories viz; materials flow approach and site-specific/output approach. 
The materials flow approach utilizes the production data and product weight to estimate the waste quantity and 
composition on a national basis. The site-specific/output approach involves the sampling, sorting, and measurement 
of the respective components of a local waste stream. The site-specific approach is further divided into direct 
sampling at the source and vehicle load sampling of solid wastes. Based on some socio-economic and environmental 
factors like weak environmental laws, indiscriminate waste disposal, inadequate facilities, poor maintenance, poor 
environmental campaigns, and lack of well-structured waste collection pattern peculiar to Nigerian universities, 
direct Sampling or characterization at Source promises to be a suitable method for stratifying municipal solid wastes 
in the country’s Campuses.

1. Introduction 
Objects or materials, in any form, which are no longer needed or used by the organism or system that has been 
utilizing or producing it are termed wastes (Ugwu et al., 2020). Wastes also are materials that are intended to be 
disposed of or already discarded or required to be disposed of by the provisions of national laws stipulated by the 
producers (Ugwu et al., 2020). Waste can be classified on the basis of origin, form and property. Based on origin, 
hospitals produce clinical wastes. Households generate domestic refuse whereas agricultural waste originate from 
animal farms and farmlands. There are other types of wastes from industries and construction sites, as well as 
nuclear wastes from petrochemical establishments. Solid, liquid or gaseous wastes make up the three major waste 
forms. Based on its property, waste can be inert, toxic, combustible, biodegradable or carcinogenic (Kemp, 1998). 
Solid wastes therefore, are wastes that are no longer wanted or discarded or disposed-off materials including 
agricultural, commercial, institutional, industrial or household wastes found in garbage dumps. Most of these 
discarded wastes/materials are from municipal sources like polythene packaging bags, used papers from academic 
and administrative activities, water/beverage bottles and cans, boxes, woods, food and its leftovers, grass from lawn 
cuttings, clothing/textiles, broken furniture, electronic appliances, newspapers, automobile tires, batteries, etc. are 
called municipal solid wastes (MSW)  (EPA, 2015).

1445","typical examples of such data. It also allows stratified sampling for uniform coverage of the entire study area as well 
as reduces the risks and difficulties in sorting some highly degradable waste categories like food and vegetables, 
which decreases the amount of emission of poisonous gases into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the supposed higher 
cost incurred during characterization/sampling process cannot be compared to the long-time benefits derivable from 
a proper and reliable data characteristic of the approach. In sum, for a non-misleading data/information for an 
effective and sustainable solid waste management, direct sampling/characterization approach gives a more holistic 
and reliable information. 
 
3. Conclusion 
The different methods of municipal solid waste sampling and characterization were reviewed in this work to 
recommend an optimal method for waste characterization in Nigerian universities considering the socio-economic 
and environmental factors peculiar to Nigeria as a state. Due to weak environmental laws that leads indiscriminate 
waste disposal, inadequate facilities and poor maintenance, poor environmental campaigns, lack of well-structured 
waste collection pattern, etc., the most appropriate waste characterization method for Nigerian universities is direct 
method. It reduces the risks and difficulties in sorting some highly degradable waste categories like food and 
vegetables by providing different waste bags/containers for such wastes. However, it consumes more time, energy 
and fund. On the other hand, vehicle load sampling/characterization method can be very effectively applied in the 
university system if there exists a well-structured waste collection system. If collection trucks are made available to 
major subareas such as academic, residential, administrative, commercial areas, etc. on daily basis, it is more 
resource conservative. Though this method encourages poor waste disposal habit because most people find it 
difficult to drop their wastes at waste collection stations for waste trucks. Thereby leading to incomplete collection 
of wastes for disposal/sampling/characterization. Based on these socio-economic and environmental factors peculiar 
to Nigerian universities, the proposed optimum method for sampling/characterizing MSW is Direct 
Sampling/Characterization at Source.

Abstract 
Torsional vibration is a special form of vibrations that usually describes torsional deformation motion of rotating 
shafts that transmit torque to other components. The crankshaft of an Internal Combustion (IC) engine is connected 
to the engine cylinder piston via the connecting rods. Connecting rods are highly dynamically loaded components 
used for thrust transmission in combustion engines.   This paper investigates the effect of torsional vibration of 
the IC Engine connecting rod. Simulations were carried out using Autodesk inventor using the Raleigh model. 
Keywords: Torsional vibration, crankshaft, IC engine, connecting rod and simulation.  
 
I. 
Introduction 
Rotating shafts may experience different kinds of deformations resulting to induced vibrations from radial loads, 
axial loads, and torque loads. Torsional vibration arising from torque loads may induce torsional deformation 
motion of rotating shafts in an internal combustion (IC) engine. The causes of torsional vibration in connecting 
rods are in themselves caused by the crankshaft torsional vibrations arising from elastic deformations of the 
crankshaft body and the periodic effect of torque on the crankshaft. Hence the IC Engine Connecting Rod torsional 
vibration can be considered an elastic torsional deformation caused by the periodic excitation torques on the 
crankshaft during engine operations. Several problems associated with torsional vibration includes crankshaft 
failure, flywheel bolt failure, bearing bush pitting, increasing knock noises of timing gear, decreasing engine 
power and sometimes damage to the connecting rod. Optimization in the automotive industry is an essential tool 
as this reduces components production cost and time with a stronger and lighter connecting rod being produced. 
The connecting rod design component and weight would significantly influence the performance of the car and 
the manufacturer credibility. A change in the structural design of the connecting rod and material used would also 
significantly impact on the engine’s weigh and performance (Shaari et al, 2010).   
II. 
Literature on the Subject Connecting Rod Design 
The crankshaft is one of the most important components of internal combustion engine. The crankshaft transfers 
the loads from the connecting rods to the gearbox via the flywheel. In diesel engines the large torsional moment 
at low rotational speed causes high stress as observed in assembly of crankshaft, piston and connecting rods.  The 
high stress amplitude common with bad design or production defects can cause decrease in the fatigue life of 
engine components such as connecting rods and crankshafts. The results of failure analysis of the piston engines 
crankshafts were described in several research.  An interesting fracture study of boxer engine crankshaft was 
described by (Kailas at al, 2016). According the authors the catastrophic failure of the crankshaft observed was 
caused by poor design of the steel support shells and bedplate bridges. The failure investigations of the crankshaft 
of diesel engines were performed by (Mirehei et al, 2008). A crankshaft contains two or more centrally located 
coaxial cylindrical (""main"") journals and one or more offset cylindrical crankpin (""rod"") journals. The two-plane 
V8 crankshaft pictured in Figure 1 has five main journals and four rod journals, each spaced 90° from its 
neighbours. The crankshaft main journals rotate in a set of supporting bearings (""main bearings""), causing the 
offset rod journals to rotate in a circular path around the main journal centres, the diameter of which is twice the

Table 1 shows the part properties for the piston rod, with the materials chosen to be light but strong. Structural 
steel is chosen for this application, Table 3, with good strength and thermal properties. The model was prepared 
for simulation , Table 4, from which displacements values along each axis was determined, Table 5.  
V. 
Discussion  
The calculation result shows that the small area experiences more stress than the bigger area subjected to the same 
force. The small area of the connecting rod experiences a stress of 0.1912 MPa, whereas the bigger area is 0.0694 
MPa. The two materials selected for simulation testing using auto desk inventor were structural steel S335N and 
S235N. The FEA conducted using these materials shows that they are more suitable for fabrication of the 
Crankshaft and Connecting Rod of an IC engine since they can withstand torsional vibrations. 
VI. 
Conclusions  
From the auto Desk inventor simulation results obtain it can be concluded that the use of structural steel in the 
design and manufacturing of crankshaft and connecting rod of an IC engine would endure the torsional vibration 
effect in the IC engine.

Abstract  
 
Research studies have shown that several centrifugal pump shafts failure are due to the inability to model the 
optimal stress on the shaft during operation. Most recent studies revealed that the parameters that impacts 
backpressure have not been properly model for optimal performance during operation. The parameters that 
impacts backpressure such as stress varying on the shaft are random and therefore the tool of random 
mechanics can be used to model and simulate the optimal forces during backpressure. In this project the major 
stresses that impacts backpressure are simulated to determine the optimal stress distribution that a pump shaft 
can withstand during operation. An auto 360 diffusion desk was used in the modeling and simulation process 
and the varying stresses on the shaft during backpressure were used to determine the optimal load the shaft can 
withstand during backpressure. The following results were theoretically derived and validated during modeling 
and simulation process. It was shown that an increased backpressure during pump operation increases the stress 
propagation on the shaft spindle and as the backpressure continuous to increased, the key slot stresses increases 
which leads to an increase in straining that impact shaft performance. The simulated data revealed failure mode 
after the optimal load on the shaft was exceeded during operation. The obtained simulated results revealed that 
at extremely high backpressure beyond the optimal stress on the shaft, failure possibility are revealed on the 
pump shaft and the failure are normally originate slot keyway and propagation of the stress distribution 
increases during operation

1. Introduction 
 
The South Africa water supply system uses centrifugal pumps to supply water under very higher pressure. This is mainly 
due to the landscape of South Africa as water cannot easily flow under gravitation and therefore mechanical centrifugal 
pump are key in a water supply system in South Africa. In most cases mechanical energy is converted to kinetic energy 
and the pressure variation are optimize for efficient operation [Krisna Eka Kurniawan,2018]. Amongst the many setback 
experience by the centrifugal pump such as cavitation, backpressure failure that often leads to mechanical failure is a 
serious concern that needs a major attention. Backpressure have often led to mechanical breakdown that have often leads 
to shutdown in most water supply system. Several research attentions are focus towards optimizing the pump operation 
for efficient water supply during pump operation. Pump instability have been reported to affect the pump performance

Abstract 
 
 
several failures in centrifugal pump shaft are reported due to backpressure leading to unpredicted shaft failure during 
pump operation. several attempts have been made by engineers in designing and simulating a centrifugal pump shaft 
that can offer more enhanced mechanical properties which can withstand backpressure during operation. In this paper, 
a centrifugal pump shaft with more enhanced mechanical properties is designed to withstand backpressure. This is 
achieved by simulating the relevant parameters of stress-strain which impacts the system during backpressure. In the 
current study, an Auto desk fusion 360 was used to simulate the design shaft relationship of stress and strain parameters 
on back pressure intensity. During simulation, the centrifugal pump shaft was constrained on a drive end bearing and 
a non-drive end bearing by using frictionless constrain parameters at extreme back pressure during operation. The 
following facts were theoretically revealed after simulating the system with an Auto desk fusion 360 simulation 
software.  It was observed that, there is extremely low possibility of shaft failure at the keyway slot section and the 
propagation of failure were invisible in this section of the shaft. When the shaft was subjected to severe stress and 
strain due to high intensity of backpressure, the material experiences fatigue and the fatigue zone start propagating 
leading to material defects and failure that were visible observed across the shaft during operation. However, the 
designed shaft was able to withstand high stress/strain during operation as the new yield stress increases to 207 MPa. 
The designed simulated shaft was revealed to withstand the subjected backpressure from the system and the possibility 
of material failure during pump operation was minimize.

1479","can withstand backpressure during operation. As the stress intensity in the shaft system increases due to increase stress 
and strain due to distortional factors that impacts strain energy, the shaft does not show any sign of failure during 
operation. Therefore, the design shaft can withstand backpressure during operation. 
 
 
4. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
The aim of the current study was to design a shaft that can withstand backpressure during operation and to achieve 
that the main factors that impact backpressure which are stress and strain was model and simulated using auto diffusion 
desk 360 and the following results was revealed. Different colors that revealed different stress intensity and failure 
modes were used to analyze the design shaft ability to withstand backpressure. It was revealed that the centrifugal 
pump shaft can withstand a backpressure of 30 MPa during operation without any possibility of failure. From the 
simulation key variables of failure mode analysis, little or no orange color which revealed a possible high risk to 
failure during backpressure or red color revealed extreme failure mode due to backpressure was noticed. As the load 
of stress and strain was increase in the centrifugal pump shaft during operation, little or no failure mode phenomena 
was reported at 60 MPa and therefore the design shaft was able to withstand a pressure of 100 MPa during operation. 
Therefore, the designed shaft can withstand backpressure during operation

Abstract 
Manufacturing companies have to continuously look for ways to innovate, derive business opportunities and make 
better use of their waste streams. The value intensification for waste is a grand challenge facing many companies 
especially the steel making industry. The aim of this research was to investigate and derive new value from furnace 
slag that is produced by steel companies and currently considered as waste material. The research explored 
possible uses of cupola furnace slag that is produced as waste in the production of steel in cupola furnaces. After 
extensive literature review and chemical analysis of the waste material a hypothesis was developed that the use 
of powdered cupola furnace slag as a solid lubricant in machining processes could help improve machining 
performance and reduce the use and cost of oil-based cutting fluids. To test the hypothesis drilling experiments 
were undertaken. The results showed that cupola furnace slag is a possible effective lubricant in the cutting of 
steel as it both lubricates and inhibits heat diffusion and hence improves machining and manufacturing 
performance.  These findings are important for the steel industry since this presents an opportunity for revenue 
generation as well as reducing cost of waste disposal and improving environmental credentials. This also opens 
new opportunities for the academic community to examine the surface industry aspects and to develop 
sustainability metrics for such waste stream utilisation.

1. Introduction and Challenge Definition 
The process that produces pig iron and cast iron also produces secondary raw materials and industrial wastes. 
Furnace slag is a secondary product produced in large quantities in these processes. Two types of slags are 
commonly produced and are named according to the type of furnace used: Blast furnace slag and Cupola furnace 
slag. Each of the two is created from melting of veinstone parts of metal bearing materials, slag forming additives 
and coke ash. Generally, slag is made up of compounds of metallic and non-metallic oxides elements which form 
chemical compounds and solutions with each other and also comprise of small quantities of metals, sulphides of 
metals and gases. The utilisation of the slag in different fields of industry heavily depends on the chemical, 
mineralogical and physical properties of slag. Chemical similarity of blast to cupola furnace slag has resulted in 
studies focusing on the potential of utilization of cupola furnace slag in the production of concrete (Baricov, 
Pribulov et al. 2010).  
 
Two companies in Zimbabwe, Midland Metals (Gweru) and Craster International (Harare) both manufacture steel 
products from scrap metal. The range of products that is common to the two is grinding media, manhole covers, 
ploughs and mining spares. Raw material is mostly scrap metal and the main processes carried out are scrap 
processing, mould making, casting, fettling (if necessary) and machining. Their common furnace is the cupola 
furnace. The main challenge that the companies are facing now is how to dispose of the cupola furnace slag. The 
production of the cupola furnace slag as waste is up to about two tonnes daily. They both have slag heaps at their 
properties such as one shown in Figure 1.  Midlands Metals uses some of its city council’s land too to dispose of 
the cupola furnace slag.

1486","4.  Conclusion and Recommendations 
4.1 Conclusions 
As noted at the beginning the purpose of this research was to identify ways in which two foundry companies in 
Zimbabwe can utilise the cupola furnace slag that is currently produced as waste. This research showed that cupola 
furnace slag may be used 
i. 
 in concrete making as partial replacement of blast furnace slag as aggregate and as partial replacement 
of Portland cement as well 
ii. 
in the production of Na-A and ZSM-5 types Zeolites  
A further experiment into the research then showed that the 19%Si,13%Al,7%Ca slag may be used as a lubricant 
in steel cutting. It is effective in drilling and outperformed oil-based cutting fluid when more boreholes are drilled. 
This can be attributed to its ability to acts as a diffusion inhibitor and elongate the tool life. Looking at Table 4.6, 
the 19%Si,13%Al,7%Ca slag had Aluminium and Silicon as the elements with the highest content. This makes 
its properties closer to those of Gehlenite than the 15%Si,8%Al,14%Ca slag properties. This explains the better 
performance of 19%Si,13%Al,7%Ca slag than 15%Si,8%Al,14%Ca slag as a lubricant in steel cutting. Gehlenite 
had already showed that it can be used as a lubricant in steel cutting in earlier research. The selection of slag that 
has a high aluminium and silicon content will help in its use as a cutting tool. It is also noted that both elements 
are key constituents of coatings for cutting tools. 
4.2 Recommendations 
The use of Cupola furnace slag in Steel cutting is the easiest of the three suggestions that came out of the research. 
Most importantly it is because it can be used as a powder lubricant directly from their landfills with minimum 
post processing. The only process that is required is grinding it to a powder form. The research can be taken further 
by: 
1. carrying more drilling tests and testing the application to other materials and cutting processes.  
2. grinding the powders to different sizes and evaluate the optimum size of powders for improved 
machining performance. 
3. use of another waste stream material as an alternative to Vaseline. 
4. checking the composition of the fumes that are produced while using pastes to find out if they affect the 
operator. 
All these will help the environment by utilising cupola furnace slag which is currently just being disposed of as 
waste in landfills. The companies will benefit by not spending any more on buying soluble oils as lubricants and 
hence improving their economic and environmental sustainability

Abstract 
With increasing operational costs in banking industries, changing banking policies, procedures and processes, 
changing staffing framework, changing value chain; banking industries are currently going through a lot of major 
transformations of improving productivity, reducing costs by implementing Business Process Management projects. 
Process improvement in the banking industry helps to make sure that policies and procedures comply according to the 
banking regulatory bodies. The banking industry can benefit a lot when they deploy process mapping as “best practice” 
and by also adopting or benchmarking the experiences of other industries who have implemented similar tools and 
methods. This paper aims to investigate the roles of Industrial Engineering in driving process modelling and 
improvement in the banking industry. Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve and Control (DMAIC) methodology was 
used to investigate the roles of Industrial Engineering in running process improvement projects. Interviews and a 
questionnaire survey were used as methods of collecting data in one of the banking organizations in Botswana. Major 
findings suggest that the role of an Industrial Engineer is very key from the start of the process improvement projects, 
measuring process maturity, measuring process capability, and cost-benefits of process improvements. 
Recommendations are made that each segment should hire an Industrial Engineer(s) as they mostly provide technical 
and business advice concerning procedures, policies, processes, and process re-engineering. Improvements observed 
in Bank Y are improved process maturity by 10% in eight months (0% to 10%), improved process consistency and 
increased process audit ratings by 5% (per financial year).

5. Discussion and Recommendations 
From the analysis provided, which were based on interviews conducted in Bank Y, Industrial Engineering roles are 
very important in driving process improvement projects. It was observed that Industrial Engineers in Bank Y are the 
ones developing business process improvement strategies, driving process improvement lifecycle, facilitating process 
improvement techniques, driving process pilot projects and they have also managed to increase process risk maturity 
of the bank by about 10%. This shows how Industrial Engineers are powerful in driving banks operational efficiency 
and its customer satisfaction using Industrial Engineering techniques such as Lean Six Sigma, DMAIC and PDCA. It 
is recommended that Industrial Engineers should be hired in each segment, since that is not yet the case in Bank Y. 
6. Conclusion 
Process improvement in Bank Y has been entrusted to an Industrial Engineer who poses analytical, quantitative skills, 
listening and negotiation skills. An Industrial Engineering role is very important in a Banking industries looking at 
the way the technology is growing and  there is a need for them to drive projects from process modelling till those 
processes get automated, since they are eligible for that -looking at the techniques that they use when solving day -to-
day  business operations. The research reaches to the conclusions that the implementation of process improvement by 
An Industrial Engineer reap more benefits for process consistency. Industrial Engineer are also comfortable with 
implementing the DMAIC methodology which seeks to improve processes

Abstract 
Silica (dust) that is created during the crushing of aggregates is presently one of the main causes of silicosis to 
mining employees and to the surrounding community. The silica created normally attached to the crushed 
aggregates (road-stone) during manufacturing. This dust must be wash off to prevent the spread of silicosis and 
other illness during mining process. Currently, the major problem faced in washing the crushed aggregates is that 
the spray nozzle that are currently used by most companies required the aggregates to be washed twice, which in 
turn costs the company extra money for washing twice.  Water again is being wasted due to continuous usage. 
Currently there is no adequate study on aggregates washing at low cost under high efficiency. More so, most spray 
nozzle are so complicated to operate and they are usually very expensive. In the current study we have designed 
a spray nozzle that is cost effective and very easy to operate under high operating efficiency. The tools of fluid 
dynamic and design theorem were used to model the nozzle diameter for optimal flow of water distribution during 
operation. The parameters used in modelling are velocity of the spray nozzle, flow rate of the spray nozzle, and 
the area that the nozzle will cover. The optimal velocity, flow rate and nozzle diameter were obtained for efficient 
flow of water during operation. The following facts were theoretically revealed by the model and validated. It was 
shown that there was an optimal nozzle diameter that gave optimal flow of water. It was shown that there is a 
certain nozzle diameter size that will offer maximum efficiency during operation. It was also shown that to cover 
a certain washing area a certain angle of the nozzle must be achieved during operation. 
Keywords: spray nozzle, flow rate, velocity, nozzle diameter and efficiency 
1. Introduction
In mining industry crushing is one of the tasks which takes place every day and different aggregates are crushed 
into different sizes suitable for the task in hand. One of the aggregates that has to be crushed is the road-stone, 
which is 19mm in size. During crushing process, the 19mm road-stone will be exposed to the crushing dust and 
sometimes the other different smaller sizes will be present at the end product of the 19mm road-stone. Which is 
not a good product because of other different sizes present. This reduces the quality of the road-stone product and 
also the quality of the road to be constructed. This aggregate is used for the road construction as the top layer. The 
aggregate that has been crushed need to be clean before it is sent to the client. Aggregate has to be mixed with 
bitumen, and for it to be mixed with bitumen correctly it has to be properly washed through a vibrating screen, 
the screen will screen out the other small sizes present. The use of the correct spray nozzles has to be applied as 
to wash or clean the aggregates properly of dust. The spray nozzle must have high flow rate as to create a pulsating 
jet of fluids to wash away all the dust and other small aggregate sizes. By cleaning the aggregates this helps the

Abstract  
At University, there is a mixture of students from different facet of life and background of which the majority is the 
lower class and rural areas. Nowadays in search for better educational quality, students are increasingly travelling 
across countries, continents and cultures, and ‘international students’ now make up a significant proportion of 
students in the Universities. All these have to fit in and adopt to the university life style which is difficult for some. 
This is usually indicated by the student’s performance in the lecture others because of language barriers do not 
participate or even ask questions to the Lecturer thus they end up underperforming. Currently monitoring and 
evaluation systems have their roots in Results Based Management Approaches (RBMA). The Development 
Assistance Committee DAC, (2002:142) defined this approach as “a management strategy focusing on performance 
and achievement of outputs, outcomes and impacts”. In this light, it is clear that monitoring and evaluation concepts 
draw on the Results-Based Management Approach. In this vein, it should also be recalled that Monitoring and 
Evaluation Systems are “management toolkits” aiding decision making in any organizations, and enhancing 
development’s effectiveness through delivery of results. This approach improves organizational performance but to 
a lesser extend since it is a corrective measure. There is need to evaluate and monitor students in real time during 
lecture deliverance time. This system monitors the performance of students in real time and sends an evaluation to 
the Lecturer during lecture time. Performance of students is realized mainly when aggregating their course work. 
This system mitigates the institutes from producing poor results by solving the problem before it happens unlike 
other result based management systems. In this research, the authors designed an automated system which studies 
the lesson, the student’s responses, taking note of facial expression and notifies the tutor/lecturer how the students 
response. It sends a message to the person in charge of the lecture on his/ her mobile phone. On a general perceptive, 
not all students participate in lecture due to self esteem. The majority of the students are just passive and not active 
in lecture. This system helps in taking note of each student’s response to the lesson being taught in real time as the 
lesson progresses. It makes use of facial expressions, participation and voice notes when responding to questions or 
when asking a question. It makes use of a camera which captures students’ image and a trained algorithm to 
recognize all body languages. Matlab, Python, Java softwares are also used to design this real time performance 
monitoring system. This system proved to improve the performance of the students by more than 60%.

Abstract 
Electricity is a major form of energy that is consumed and is also in high demand by the increasing global 
population of which Sierra Leone is a part. As a result of the high demand competing for the low generation 
capacity of the utilities, the Ministry of Energy of the Sierra Leone Government, charged with the responsibility 
of generating and supplying electricity, is unable to meet this demand. The rationale of carrying out this research 
is to see how raising awareness levels on the significance of energy efficiency practices, as a recommendation 
through an energy audit process, would help bring a solution to how to meet the high electricity demand.   
A quantitative data analysis method was used in this research. A total 120 structured questionnaires were used in 
collecting data. From the results analysed, respondents agreed that energy efficiency practices in buildings around 
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, would reduce electricity consumption. Furthermore, respondents agreed that 
an energy audit in buildings around the city of Freetown would help in detecting electricity wastages in these 
buildings.  
Key Words 
Energy efficiency, energy demand, energy supply, energy audit, Freetown. 
1. Introduction 
Freetown, the capital of Sierra leone is a sub Saharan city located in the west coast of Africa. According to the 
housing and population census conducted in 2015, the population of Freetown was 1,055,964 (SL Census 2015). 
There is a challenge of electricity access of the inhabitants within Freetown and its environs. There are various 
factors responsible for the low electricity access within the city of Freetown, which includes low electricity 
generating capacity and the inefficient use of electricity by residents in Freetown. According to the report on the 
Sustainable Energy For All (SEFA) mission to Sierra Leone on the 7th and 8th of June 2012 as documented in 
the National Energy Profile of Sierra Leone (2012), the electricity sub-sector in Sierra Leone faces challenges 
with only ten percent (10%) of the citizens in the country having access to electricity. According to Kamara 
(2016), Director of Energy of the Ministry of Energy in Sierra Leone, less than 12.5% of the citizens in Sierra 
Leone have access to electricity. However, recently the electricity access has increased to 23.40% (World Bank, 
2019).

reduce energy wastage in buildings. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research on the significance of energy saving opportunities based on behavioural patterns of residents in 
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone is reported herein. A quantitative data collection method was used in collecting 
the data in this research, with the implementation of random sampling technique. 120 structured questionnaires 
were designed and distributed among residents within Freetown as the main source of primary data collection 
tool. The collected questionnaires were analysed with statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS) version 23 
and Microsoft Excel in displaying graphs and tables of the analysed data. From the results obtained and data 
analysed in this research it shows that the implementation of energy efficient practices based on behavioural 
patterns in buildings by residents within Freetown, would save electricity (Kamara et al, 2019).

Abstract  
 
Renewable energy is one of the critical solutions to address the ever-increasing demand for energy.  In developing 
countries such as Zimbabwe where the conventional generation hardly sustains half of the nation’s energy demands, 
renewable energy solutions are compensating for the deficit. Among these renewables, solar energy technologies have 
witnessed rapid growth. In most cases, solar energy installers assume to have all the knowledge required in the field. 
However, many technical barriers still exist within the field of solar energy systems. For solar energy systems which 
are synchronized to the grid, the integration of these renewables pose a serious stability and protection threat to the 
already unstable and even stable grids. In this paper, some of the technical problems being faced are discussed. Policy 
issues as well as the possible solutions needed in order to realize full, unhindered growth of solar energy are addressed.

1. Introduction  
 
Renewable energy sources include but not limited to solar energy, wind energy and biomass. In developing 
countries such as Zimbabwe solar energy or photovoltaic (PV) systems are leading on renewables. PV 
systems are vital in achieving sustainable development goals. Goal number seven aims at achieving 
affordable and clean energy. Conventional Power Stations which are coal or oil-fired produce toxic gases 
into the atmosphere, which can be totally eliminated through the use of PV systems. The setting out of 
sustainable power PV sources is a significant switch to decarbonize the power sector and moderate the 
impacts of atmosphere (Lewis 2007).  
The adoption of renewables is also a significant move in reducing the margin between generation and 
demand. In the most recent decades, there has been phenomenal development in two advances in particular 
solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power. In Zimbabwe, solar PV systems have witnessed a more 
significant growth as compared to wind power. Worldly trends show that the yearly increments of 27% and 
13% have been witnessed in the past decade for PV and wind systems, respectively, Kabir et al. (2018). 
These PV systems have played a significant role in reducing the generation and demand energy gap. In 
Zimbabwe alone, conventional power plants hardy produce 1500MW when the demand is estimated to be 
beyond 2500MW. 
Just as the growth of variable renewables continues to increase and the benefits being reaped from these 
sources, so are the PV systems. However, this growth lead to various challenges in power frameworks 
ranging from the power system network itself to social, economic and even political challenges (Lewis and 
Nocera 2006). Inability to manage these difficulties may endanger power systems unwavering quality or 
on the other hand, the accomplishment of affordable and clean energy targets. Different arrangement 
advances are accessible to alleviate these difficulties. The surviving writing, in any case, needs lucidity on

1523","its sponsors can introduce discounts and layby schemes to prospective solar users. On policy and regulatory instability, 
measures can be put in place which promote the use of solar energy by incorporating energy usage incentives to 
customers. There is a need for the introduction of highly specialized research centers, which enable the development 
and production of cost-effective storage systems for solar energy to become a primary source of energy.  
 
Training of systems designers and installers creates a broader platform of skilled manpower; hence some solar PV 
systems that are being installed can be optimized and more inefficient. Grid instability caused by the injection of solar 
energy in the national grid can be looked into at a broader scale by both the utility and private partners. For any 
network, proper system studies must be carried out to determine the appropriate position for grid integration. 
Generally, areas close the loads are the best but may also introduce some unwanted system losses in some cases.  
 
Security of solar systems is also an area still requiring further research which is best suited for the location. Research 
still needs to be done in areas such as the integration of solar PV in the national grid without compromising its stability, 
cost-effective mechanism of energy storage as this is still a significant hurdle for the country to abandon conventional 
methods of electricity production. Improvement in the efficiency of the solar cell is also another area that needs to be 
researched on and efficient anti-vandalism mechanisms on solar power plants.  
 
 
7. Conclusions and remarks 
 
Solar PV projects successfully implemented will be a great benefit to both the national and personal development. 
With the move towards smart grids, the concepts of demand side management (DSM) can further be incorporated to 
meet world-class standards. As outlined in this study, Zimbabwe has great potential to meet the standards being set 
by developed countries in as far as PV systems are concerned. With determination and unit of purpose, the goal is 
achievable. Grid interlinked PV systems can also be a fundamental way in reducing the burden on the conventional 
power systems. A centralized monitoring and control center inform of a virtual power plant (VPP) can be set up for 
these grid interlinked systems. This further helps the participation in the electrical markets platform, thus having a 
direct effect on the price per kWh of energy. Additional revenue can be saved to improve the national grid network. 
Current studies show that properly connected PV systems can contribute significantly in network losses reduction, 
thus more profit to the utility. Well formulated regulations which are already in place and some which can be crafted 
to benefit the participators may be significant motivator and also leads to more job opportunities as the installations 
increase.

ABSTRACT  
 
Access to electricity is one of the instruments for the development of any society nowadays, about 1.2 billion people 
in the world are living without electricity today. At least 600 million people in sub-Saharan African countries are 
livingwithout electricity, and the Maputo province and Maputo city in Mozambique are not any exception faced with 
the electrical shortage. The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 states that access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable, and modern energy for all people throughout the world should be achieved by the year 2030. The rate of 
electrification in the urban areas in Mozambique is about 67% and the national electrification rate is 40%. With higher 
energy potential resources such as coal, natural gas, and renewable energy resources. Mozambique still has one of the 
low electricity consumption per capita in the region about 443 kWh which is paradoxes. The government of 
Mozambique has introduced reforms in the electricity sector since 1995 and considers the access to modern forms of 
supplying electricity to be highly important in the fight being waged against poverty. The objective of this research is 
to see the process of the gas conversion to electricity using the combined cycle gas and vapor at Maputo Power Plant 
in Maputo, Mozambique. In this secondment, the rigorous chemical analysis of water in the Power Plant is of relevancy 
for obtaining improved water quality which is intimately related to good energy production. To succeed this goals, we 
look forward to implementing Desalination and demineralization methods of water from locally constructed wells that 
is actually used to operationalize the generation process of the combined system.

1.  Introductions 
The current scenario of electricity access in Mozambique is not much favorable to eradicate poverty because the rural 
area still has low rata electrifications with 27% and a compere in Sweden is 100% while the urban area in Mozambique 
is about 67%and the national electrifications rate is 40% (EDM, u.d.). With higher energy potential resources (coal, 
natural gas, renewable energy resources) Mozambique still has low electricity consumption per capita about 443kWh 
(Uamusse, et al., 2019). The Figure.1 show the electricity production and consumption of the last eighteen years. 
Today Mozambique the energy consumption average is 12 billion kWh (Mulder & Tembe, 2018). The UN Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 7 states that access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all people

Abstract  
 
 
In this paper the discharge and velocity of flow produced by a spray nozzle during the washing of 
aggregates is optimized for efficient operation of the nozzle during the washing of aggregates. This 
needed for efficient washing of crushed aggregates that produced silica that are harmful to human life 
and the environment. The increased in discharge and velocity of flow increases the jet pressure, and 
droplets that are needed for efficient and more economical washing of aggregates. In this study, the 
tools of fluid dynamic and solid works are used in optimizing the proposed design. The major 
parameters used in modelling optimal performance of the jet nozzle are flow velocity of spray nozzle 
and discharge of spray nozzle. The following results are theoretically revealed after modelling and 
simulation with solid works.  
 
It was revealed that the optimal flow velocity gave high discharge with proper scattering of droplets 
during the washing of aggregates. An optimal discharge at an optimal nozzle diameter were revealed 
for efficient discharge during the washing of aggregates. It was also shown that there was an optimal 
nozzle diameter that gave optimal flow of water during the washing of aggregates. It was also revealed 
that the optimal nozzle diameter and droplet thickness gave an optimal discharge and velocity of the 
spray nozzle during operation. Varying direction of velocities in the system during operation given was 
revealed by solid works to have different impacts on flow velocity and discharge. The correlation 
between theoretical obtained results and simulated results from solid works revealed  that the velocity 
of the water flowing in the spray nozzle have a range of velocities from 38.659m/s to maximum velocity 
of 77.314m/s as shown in the simulated result. The obtained results revealed close correlation in both 
modeling and simulation. It could be concluded that the design will function efficiently at optimal 
velocity and flow rate during operation.

1537","6MPa and the simulated results was simulated to be between 0.226MPa to maximum of 595.698MPa. From this 
observation, the computed pressure falls within the simulated values. The simulated spray nozzle has the greatest 
velocity of flow and the greatest pressures can be used. This mean that the design can function efficiently at optimal 
velocity and flow rate during operation. 
3. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The study was aimed at optimizing the velocity and discharge produced by a spray nozzle for efficient washing of 
aggregates in mining industry. To achieve this objective the principles of fluids mechanics and the relevant simulation 
was performed by solid works. The following results was revealed in the study. it is revealed that an increase in spray 
nozzle led to an increase k-value, discharge, and velocities of flow through the spray nozzle. It was also revealed that 
the flow is impacted by air which was reported to impacts the droplet thickness as velocity and flow rate increases. It 
was also revealed that the optimal nozzle diameter and droplet thickness gave an optimal discharge and velocity of 
the spray nozzle during operation. Varying direction of velocities in the system during operation given was revealed 
by solid works to have different impacts on flow velocity and discharge. The correlation between theoretical obtained 
results and simulated results from solid works revealed  that the velocity of the water flowing in the spray nozzle have 
a range of velocities from 38.659m/s to maximum velocity of 77.314m/s as shown in the simulated result. The obtained 
results revealed close correlation in both modeling and simulation. It could be concluded that the design will function 
efficiently at optimal velocity and flow rate during operation.

Abstract 
 
Hospital readmissions are indicators of the quality of service offered by hospitals and give an insight into the 
performance measures on the cost at the hospital. A readmission event occurs when a patient that has been discharged 
from a hospital after diagnosis and procedure is again readmitted to the hospital within a certain period. The Nationwide 
Readmissions Database (NRD) is part of a family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost 
and Utilization Project (HCUP). For this research, the data for the year 2016 from the National Readmission Database 
(NRD) will be studied and machine learning models built to model the relationship between readmission and various 
factors related to the patient. The models built in this research study will be used to ease the prediction of hospital 
readmission which is very important in healthcare management. Ischemic And Pulmonary Heart diseases are among the 
critical diseases in health care services. The monitoring of these diseases, therefore, should be handled with ultimate 
care and with trained professionals. Various studies have shown that readmission of these diseases has a higher rate 
compared to non-pulmonary disease, thus the need for critical research and study in these areas. The observations for 
Ischemic heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation (diagnosis codes I20 to I28) will be used for this study. 
Analysis and goodness of model indexes such as the confusion matrix, AUC index, MSE, and R squared scores and 
findings from the study will also be evaluated and reported taking into account the model parameters.

Maze Environments 
Siddhant Karmali

siddhant.karmali@gmail.com 
Abstract 
Spatial memory refers to the pathways in the brain that are needed to plan routes to specific locations and remembering 
where an object is located. This allows humans to use information about their environment to form a model of that 
environment with instructions on how to navigate it. To do so, the brain integrates sensory information with a map of 
the environment, to give information about how to traverse it. This experiment investigates whether  spatial memory 
can be transferred between 2D and 3D environments using the Rey-Osterrieth test and Minecraft. It uses one-way 
ANOVA tests, a two-sample t-test, a Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, and Linear Regression to explore the 
relationships between different factors on the time taken and errors made in completing the maze. Despite having a 
small sample size, this project shows a statistically significant positive correlation between a participant’s Rey-
Osterrieth score and the number of errors they make on a particular maze. This shows some evidence that spatial 
memory can be transferred between 2D and 3D environments because of this correlation, but there must be more 
statistical tests carried out to prove this. These tests include ones that analyze larger datasets, and could shed light on 
teen hippocampal activity and how spatial memory manifests and is transferred specifically within teen brains. 
 
Keywords 
Spatial Memory, Neuroscience, Statistics, Minecraft, Rey-Osterrieth. 
 
1. Introduction 
The purpose of this study is to explore the differences in spatial and working memory between 2-dimensional and 3-
dimensional environments and whether spatial memory is transferred between the environments. A transfer in spatial 
memory between such environments can be characterized by an improvement in time taken or reduction in errors 
made while navigating a 3D environment, after having successfully completed a two-dimensional task. 
Ekstrom, Kahana, and Fried have investigated the pathways in which spatial memory travels (Ekstrom et al. 2003). 
They found that cells that help navigate spaces (mainly located in the hippocampus) and cells that respond to 
landmarks (mainly found in the parahippocampal region) have complementary roles, meaning that spatial memory is 
composed of multiple parts and can be used to navigate virtual environments. The link between video games and 
spatial cognition has been explored by Spence and Feng (Spence, Feng 2010) for applications in teaching young 
children about spatial awareness and navigating spaces. They theorize that certain types of video games help improve 
spatial cognition, which helps verify the methodology for this particular study. The relationship between playing 
Minecraft and hippocampal activity has been explored by Clemenson, Henningfield, and Stark (Clemenson et al. 
2019). They conclude that navigating a Minecraft world is correlated with improvements in hippocampal activity 
outside of the game. This means that in a three-dimensional maze, there should be higher hippocampal activity, 
meaning that the participant is actively using their spatial memory. Cockburn and McKenzie have evaluated spatial 
memory and visuospatial awareness in 2D and 3D physical and virtual environments (Cockburn, McKenzie 2002), 
which could have applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They assert that spatial memory actually 
deteriorates when subjects are introduced to a three-dimensional environment rather than a two-dimensional one. 
However, this effect was observed for sparse retrieval tasks, and it does provide some evidence that spatial memory 
can work in both 2D and 3D environments. Burgess, Maguire, and O’Keefe have shown that the hippocampus is 
essential to spatial learning by using an environment in virtual reality that tests (Burgess et al. 2002). They assert, 
from both their VR environment and their images of the hippocampus, that the hippocampus has roles in navigating 
complex environments and remembering the positions of the objects. The study done by Burgess et al. provides 
evidence that the hippocampus is the site of certain types of spatial memory pathways that are important to this 
particular study. These five studies help set the ground for this particular one, which aims to illustrate how spatial 
memory is transferred between 2D and 3D environments, i.e. between a template and a physical or virtual 
environment. Spatial memory is an essential field of study since studying it shows how neurons in certain areas of the 
brain work together to form maps of the environment and how they aid us in traversing these maps, especially in a 
virtual world like Minecraft. This model could theoretically be used to aid drivers, especially new ones, in driving 
more safely on roads by providing them with a two- and three- dimensional template of a road, which could then

1549","Figure 8: Difference in errors between the first 3D maze and second 3D maze in participants in the 2D-3D group 
based on their Rey-O Recall score. 
These tests were used to investigate how the Rey-Osterrieth Recall score affects both the difference in time 
taken for the first and second attempts and the difference in errors made between the first and second attempts. In 
the Time reduction by Rey-O Recall Score, the r-value from the Product Moment Correlation Coefficient was 
0.7905 and the r2 value was 0.6249. Since the sample size was small, these values could not be compared to any 
critical value, so the results for these tests are not statistically significant. Therefore, the null hypothesis that there is 
no correlation between the Rey-O score and a participant’s improvement in time fails to be rejected. In the test for 
improvement in errors made, the r-value was 0.9885, the r2 value was 0.9771, and the p-value was 0.0115. Since the 
p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the Rey-O score and the 
improvement on the maze by the number of errors made can be safely rejected. This means that if someone gets a 
higher score on the Rey-O Recall test, they will probably make fewer errors the second time they complete the 
maze. 
 
4. Conclusions 
This experiment explored whether memories of 2D environments transferred to similarly designed 3D 
environments to find out whether 2D and 3D environments can aid teenagers in navigating 3D spatial memory 
tasks.. It was conducted because understanding activity in the hippocampus as related to spatial memory transfer 
between 2D and 3D environments is important in determining whether 2D templates are reliable in aiding 
navigation of 3D environments. The experiment finds that 2D and 3D tasks prepare teenagers about equally well, 
but better than not completing any task, for navigating three-dimensional spatial environments. This result supports 
the original hypothesis by demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the mean times of the group 
without prior maze experience and the groups with experience. The significant difference between the mean 3D task 
time of groups that have preparation with a maze and the group that did not, along with how there is not a difference 
between the mean time of the group with 2D vs. 3D preparation, shows that both 2D and 3D task experience could 
improve the time taken to complete a 3D task. Regardless of the Rey-O score, both 2D and 3D maze experience 
could improve completion times in 3D spatial environments. This experiment also correlates performance on the 
Rey-O test, in 2D, with a reduction of errors in the completion of the 3D maze. Since a 2D test followed by a 3D 
maze shows an error reduction on that 3D maze, there is evidence that using 2D maps to navigate 3D spaces is 
neuroscientifically reasonable. There is in fact evidence of a transfer in spatial memory between 2D and 3D maze 
environments because the Rey-Osterrieth, a two-dimensional test, was correlated with a reduction of errors made in 
a three-dimensional environment. Although the sample size of this study is not large, the positive correlation makes 
a case for how there is a transfer in spatial memory between two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments. 
Therefore, we can infer that a 2D template like the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test can provide a logically 
integrated environment that is similar to a real environment that the brain can use to give the person information 
about their orientation, heading, and important landmarks. Since the Rey-Osterrieth is a measure of spatial memory, 
and since participants with higher Rey-O scores traversed a Minecraft task with fewer errors, certain elements in

1556","Minecraft could also serve as a measure of spatial intelligence. Therefore, three-dimensional models, like Minecraft 
or virtual reality, can be used to teach or aid new teenage drivers in numerous tasks relating to navigating roads. To 
verify this, more reliable data must be collected and more statistical tests must be applied to that data. 
 
5. Improvements to the Study and Future Research 
This study can be improved by increasing the sample size, and therefore the number of participants in each 
condition. With a larger sample size, more reliable results can be derived, such as stronger correlations (if they exist) 
or a causal relationship between two variables. The experiment can also incorporate multiple regression tests based 
on a participant’s prior maze experience and their Rey-O recall score to observe the differences between time taken 
to complete (or errors made in) the first and second mazes. In this experiment, the test was only for whether there 
was a transfer or difference in spatial memory between two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments. In a 
future experiment, there could be a model that investigates what exactly that model is and how pathways in the 
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex behave in both types of environments. Potentially, fMRI could be used for this 
experiment because it isolates certain parts of the brain in an image and colors them based on their activity, which is 
measured in changes associated with blood flow. One such expected result of a future experiment would be to see 
the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex be colored since those two areas contain special types of neurons that orient 
a person in their environment and give them a heading of where they are going. If fMRI or MRI was either 
inaccessible or imprudent to use in a future study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) could be used to detect 
frequencies of brain waves coming from certain parts of the brain. One expectation for an experiment with the EEG 
would be higher frequencies in the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex for the same reasons listed above. It would 
also be interesting to observe how this would change if we moved the 3D maze from a game environment to a 
virtual reality environment. Since grid and place cells are essential to giving information about where the person is 
oriented and their current route, a virtual reality maze could increase the firing rate of those neurons or otherwise 
affect their neural pathways since the person is oriented in an environment that is more representative of the real 
world. This project serves as an investigation into spatial memory, its pathways within the brain, and its uses in 
experimentation. Future projects using the techniques and improvements discussed above will be able to provide a 
basis for stronger claims about the nature of how spatial memory differs between two-dimensional and three-
dimensional environments and a wider range of potential applications. These future projects could have applications 
in improving the safety of drivers on the road.

Abstract 
 
Poker is a very popular gambling game in casinos, but except professionals, most poker players lose money 
without applying probability statistics. This paper studies the poker probability by using a partial deck (a 
total 16 AKQJ cards with up to 6 players). The authors have used combination formula and derived general 
formulas of matching probability for each matching pattern. To simplify probability simulation, partial deck 
poker game was designed which can increase the matching probability significantly on some higher ranked 
patterns such as “Full House”. With this creative AKQJ game, the winning patterns are down to “Four of a 
Kind”, “Full House”, “Three of a Kind”, and “Two Pairs”. If all 6 players are playing, this Poker AKQJ 
game can be very competitive since the basic Poker probability would be calculated to guide each poker 
player on their betting to avoid any risky move. To study the player’s personality and psychology, each 
player has been assigned different playing characters based on the assigned degree of risk taking. Through 
this Poker AKQJ data simulation based on the worst-case probability, the poker players may avoid 
gambling disorder and lose a lot of money.

Table 12. Players’ Win or Lose Summary 
 
 
4.4 Future Work 
 
Each Poker AKQJ run takes one author about 30 minutes to collect the raw data and summarize the results and 
pattern; thus, it is impossible to complete the 92 datasets manually. The authors are developing a Python code to 
automatically simulate these random AKQJ runs and summarize the results using programming. Also, as mentioned 
in this paper, there is still room for improving the Worst-Case algorithm by either optimizing the characters’ 
confidence setting or adding additional rules like the Full House situation. The shuffling bias may be also addressed. 
This game can also be easily expanded from current one betting round to multiple betting rounds. The other 
opportunity is to consider the number of players still in the game as the game progresses, less and less players are 
still in the game which would impact the calculation of the worst-case scenario since less hidden cards may 
complicate the calculation and impact the character settings. 2-Players case may prefer more accurate calculation on 
the worst-case algorithm. 
 
 5. Conclusions 
 
This innovative AKQJ Poker Game has significantly simplified the winning probability calculation. The worst-
case algorithm has made it feasible that the Poker players could calculate their overall winning probability and make 
a rational betting decision based on their pre-set risk-taking character. The simplified AKQJ game has significantly 
minimized the players’ emotional character and limit players’ tricks to confuse the winning probability. The winner 
of each run becomes more random and less dependent on players’ psychological characters while calculating the 
winning probability quickly in real poker game becomes more critical.

Abstract 
 
The past years have revealed increased participation of individual companies in Lean Manufacturing (LM) tools and 
principles across different industries around the world. Grain milling industry, being one of Botswana’s greatest source 
of food, is not excluded from developing constructive processes to improve the productivity of grain value chain. 
Shifting this industry from traditional production setups to meet the lean manufacturing principles is a catalyst for the 
country to be self-sufficient in grain products. This work present a case study of a wheat milling company and 
applications of some lean manufacturing tools to enhance performance in the grain milling industry. The discussion 
is based on the results obtained from the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools in the production system of the 
case study company. Significant achievements have been observed in the company’s supply chain, with a clear view 
of continuous process improvement art, improved product and service quality and flexibility in the production process.

Abstract  
Centrifugal pump performance is reported to be low when the pump is exposed to contaminated fluids during 
operation. The contaminated fluids are reported to have caused pump scaling and fouling. Most centrifugal pumps 
are reported to have been damaged due to pump scaling and fouling. The suction strainers are usually used to 
prevent scaling and fouling by preventing unwanted impurities from getting into the centrifugal pump system during 
operation. The current suction strainers used in a centrifugal pump system have pore sizes that are poorly 
characterised leading to the current problem of poor separability during pump operation. Membrane technologies 
used in separation technology are reported to have better separability if the membrane pore sizes are properly 
characterised for optimal separability. In the current study, a new approach is used to design suction strainers using 
membrane technology for efficient and stable performance of the centrifugal pump. The tools of computational fluid 
dynamic and stochastic mechanics are used to model the fluid flow characteristics, and to characterize the membrane 
pore size distribution without the flow of impurity in the pump system for efficient, and stable performance. The 
following facts are theoretically derived and validated after theoretical modeling and simulation of the relevant 
parameters. The first signal of fouling of a membrane is a reduced volumetric flux, and this is caused by resistance 
which is due to concentration polarisation and reduced mass transfer coefficient. It was also shown that the design 
membrane has its own resistance which, when kept to a minimum will have a high initial volumetric flux. A better 
performing membrane will have a low resistance which subsequently will increase the initial volumetric flux, 
consequently increasing the rate at which fouling occurs. It was also shown that the trans-membrane pressure is 
directly proportional to volumetric flux; however there is a deviation when impurities are deposited onto the 
membrane surface and into the membrane pores.

1581","5. Conclusion  
A number of conclusions were drawn based on the results found in this project. From the results of the membrane 
resistance, it can be concluded that a membrane has its own resistance based on its material. This resistance is 
responsible for reducing volumetric flux during operation. However, as also shown, the membrane resistance 
depends on the thickness of the membrane. Therefore, to reduce the resistance, the membrane has to be very thin. 
With respect to time, the thin and thick membrane were compared for 5 minutes and results showed how the flow 
rate had dropped in each one. For a thin membrane, the flow rate was still higher than the thick membrane and this is 
due to the amount of resistance that is present when a membrane is thick. That is why a thick membrane is quick to 
have cake layer formation. 
From the concentration results, it can be concluded that the concentration of the fluid before and after the membrane 
should not be the same. When a membrane is effective, the concentration of the fluid after the filtration should be 
lower. And, as concluded from the results, this is better achievable with a membrane of lower resistance.

Abstract 
 
Cost optimization is a widely discussed topic in the supply chain literature, where effective supply chain 
contracts are identified as essential tools that can address the strategic issues such as ineffective costs, 
integration, information sharing and coordination. Knowing how supply chain costs are measured is vital for all 
supply chain members, where different accounting methods used to derive cost information. Therefore, 
accenting methods have implications on supply chain cost information, thereby affecting supply chain contracts 
formed among various supply chain partners. However, the studies that explored the relationship of cost 
measurement based on accounting methods with supply chain contracts are scant in literature. Therefore, we 
propose propositions considering Historical cost accounting, Fair value accounting and Creative accounting in a 
contractual framework of an e-tailer supply chain, operating in an asymmetric informational scenario.  The 
findings indicate that both historical and fair value-cost accounting methods affect supply chain contract 
outcomes when market conditions change. Furthermore, creative accounting directly impacts supply chain 
contracts if incentive-compatible constraints are not defined as it creates room for manipulating cost 
information.

1. Introduction 
Cost minimization is one of the critically important objectives in supply chain coordination (Dror et al. 2012). 
An efficient supply chain's primary goal is to fulfil customer demand with the lowest possible cost. Hence, each 
supply chain member must pay attention to cost savings methods, such as collaboration and effective supply 
chain integration (Leng and Parlar 2009). As a result, obtaining accurate cost data is vital for all supply chain 
activities and processes to improve productivity and profitability (Askarany et al. 2010). Also, cost data 
provides a clear picture of the actual situation of the supply chain than any other source (Pettersson and 
Segerstedt 2013). Therefore, knowing the cost structure of supply chain operations are imperative for deriving 
effective cost minimization strategies. 
 
Since cost minimization is widely used as an optimization objective in the supply chain (Snyder and Shen 
2011), it is imperative to identify how different supply chain members determine their cost values. In this 
context, cost measurement plays an essential role where accounting methods and accounting information drive 
cost measurement outcomes in an organization. Accounting information plays a vital role in operations 
management. It affects the decision-making of firms' operational aspects such as inventory management, cost of 
sales, management of materials, work in process and finished products (Horngren et al. 2014). Therefore, e-
commerce supply chain organizations must identify appropriate accounting methods to demonstrate accurate 
and transparent financial information, which affect operational decisions and strategic outcomes as the correct 
information is the most influential asset of online supply chains. 
 
Even though cost minimization is well studied, no attempt has been made to determine how these costs are 
measured when effective strategic interactions are formulated among supply chain members. Besides, the cost 
concepts have a significant game theory and contract theory implications for strategy formulation, information

1591","(Operational scenario 1), to illustrate the impact on FVA by two players in the contract model to the overall 
supply chain costs (Figure 3). The costs are varied from 4% to 18% when both supplier and the 3PL operator 
adopts FVA in their organizations than the HCA scenario.  
 
Hence, it is proven that both the HCA and FVA has a positive impact on the supply chain costs and contract 
outcomes as tested using proposition 1 and 2. 
 
5.2 Results Analysis of Proposition 3 
To test Proposition 3, we use two numerical illustrations, which includes all constraints in the contract model 
and does not include constraints denoted by Eq. [6] and [8].  The numerical analysis is conducted with the same 
data set. The contract model results change when Eq. [6] and [8] are removed from the model. The results reveal 
that it mainly affects sharing costs. Accordingly, the sharing costs are reduced for the 3PL operator and become 
zero for the product supplier. A comparison of the sharing costs with and without the incentive compatibility 
constraints are indicated in Figure 4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Comparison of sharing costs with and without incentive compatibility constraints_3PL operator 
 
The incentive reduction proves that reporting false or modified costs does not provide benefits from the contract. 
The cost-sharing incentive received by the 3PL operator significantly reduces, and the product supplier gets zero 
benefits, which ensures that the revelation principle-based incentive compatibility motivates players to reveal 
true costs. Thus, it eliminates the possibility of adopting an accounting method as creative accounting, allowing 
accountants to manipulate costs and report modified or false costs to create an enhanced picture. Removing 
compatibility constraints not only reduces the but also reduces overall the supply chain costs. 
  
The results disclose that the total costs of the product supplier and the 3PL operator also increase without the 
incentive compatibility constraints. Therefore, the results further emphasize that incorporating incentive 
compatibility constraints ensures better cost optimization for the product supplier and the 3PL operator and 
delivers better incentives, thus eliminating the possibility of implementing creative accounting practices within 
their organizations. Therefore, the results of the numerical analysis show that Proposition 3 developed in this 
study is accurate. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper analyzes the impact of cost measurement on the outcomes of the supply chain contracts. Cost 
measurement in supply chain organizations depends on the accounting methods adopted. Literature related to 
accounting information and contracts discusses the importance of accounting information and its impact on 
contractual outcomes. However, no clear evidence is found related to accounting information and its effect on 
the supply chain contracts and supply chain costs, even though cost minimization is one of the critical objectives 
of any supply chain operation. Therefore, this study addresses this gap and attempt to derive the relationship 
between the accounting information derived through different accounting methods and the supply chain costs 
and contracts. The study uses an e-tailer supply chain with three-player scenarios, led by an e-tailer since e-
commerce supply chains are highly dependent on accurate information.

1599","A theoretical framework is created to define the relationship of historical cost accounting (HCA), fair value cost 
accounting (FVA) and creative accounting methods adopted by supply chain members towards the supply chain 
costs, strategic decision-making, and contractual outcomes. Based on that, three propositions are tested using a 
multi-period cost-sharing contract model developed in Rathnasiri et al. (2019) considering asymmetric cost 
information. A numerical analysis is conducted for different operational scenarios, and accordingly, the results 
are interpreted, and model implications are derived for this study. 
 
The findings of this study divulge that both HCA and FVA Historical affect supply chain costs. However, HCA 
does not create an opportunity for manipulating information as supply chain costs are affected due to the 
changes in operational scenarios and not due to the changes in accounting information. In contrast, FVA has a 
higher impact on changing cost information than the historical cost accounting method. Therefore, HCA is 
better than FVA for contracts, especially when asymmetric information is present. On the other hand, FVA 
derives better cost minimization than the HCA. Next, we have tested the motivation towards adopting creative 
accounting. The results reveal that the incentive compatibility adopted contracts ensure that supply chain 
members do not have an opportunity to adopt creative accounting in their organizations and manipulate 
contractual outcomes and supply chain costs. 
 
This study can be extended in several ways in future. Even though we have considered the asset re-valuation, an 
in-depth cost analysis for each operational cost is not conducted in this study, which needs to be investigated to 
derive actual changes of assets in financial statements on supply chain contracts. Next, the implications on 
financial accounting methods used in the real-world e-tailer supply chain can be incorporated to test the model 
implications on actual business operations. Through that important practical insights can be generated to 
improve decision-making levels in optimizing operational performances of supply chains. Finally, it is essential 
to study on financial cost measurement outcomes in other types of contract models where analytical propositions 
can be developed.

Abstract  
 
Post-use disposal of non-biodegradable plastic waste is a major challenge world-wide resulting in unprecedented 
accumulation of plastic waste in the environment. This poses hazards to the environment and health of human 
beings. Solutions to this challenge are still being sought. In this study, therefore, the feasibility of employing 
plastic waste energy recovery process as a plastic waste management tool was investigated and optimised. 
Polypropylene, polyethylene, and a mixture of the two plastics were used in the investigation. Energy recovery 
was done using the pyrolysis process. The Taguchi method was used for process optimisation and parameter 
design. Feedstock composition, temperature and heating rate are the parameters investigated. The energy was 
recovered in liquid form as oil. Optimum conditions were found using polypropylene plastic and a temperature of 
500 oC and a heating rate of 15 oC/min were found to be the optimum conditions. Parameter interaction analysis 
showed increase in the oil yield as temperature increased from 450 °C to 500 °C, after which the yield decreased.

1. .Introduction 
 
Plastics production has increased by an average of almost 10% every year on a global basis since 1950 (Daugaard 
and Brown, 2003). The increased consumption of plastic in modern society is inevitable due to their versatile 
utilities, functional values, and a relatively small amount of energy required for their production compared with 
other materials (Ng et al., 1995).. Plastic wastes can be classified into two categories based on their origins as 
municipal (post-consumer) and industrial (pre-consumer) plastic waste. These groups have different qualities and 
properties; thus, they are subject to different management strategies. Of the total plastic waste, over 78% of this 
total corresponds to thermoplastics and the remaining to thermosets (Panda et al., 2010). Thermoplastics are 
composed of polyolefin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (Mudzengerere 
and Chigwenya, 2012) and can be recycled. On the other hand, thermosets mainly include epoxy resins and 
polyurethanes and cannot be recycled (Panda et al., 2010). Pre-consumer plastic wastes, which are also known as 
primary (industrial) waste, emanate from manufacturing, processing, and packaging industries (Patni et al., 2013). 
They are a result of process purging and scrap during virgin plastic manufacture. Post-consumer plastic wastes 
are a fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) whose life cycle range from medium to short term (Chanda, 2017). 
The composition of municipal plastic wastes (MPW) vary with the lifestyle and economy of the people as well as 
the season of the year. MPW is a heterogeneous mixture that includes items such as disposable plastic plates, food 
containers, packaging foam, disposable cups, compact disks, cutlery, cushioning foams, carbonated drink bottles 
and plastic pipes. 
 
Most plastics are not biodegradable, and hence disposing them after use has become a major problem worldwide. 
This increase in plastic burdens financial resources of local authorities tasked with solid waste management and

Figure 4 shows that oil yield increases as the feedstock is changed from PE to PP and decreases when the two 
polymers are mixed. Also, as the temperature and heating rate increase from 450-500°C and 10-15°C/min oil 
yield increase respectively continual increase in the two factors is marked with a decrease in oil yield. Using 
these plots optimum conditions were determined as feed composition of polypropylene at a temperature of 
500°C and heating rate of 15°C/min. 
 
4 Conclusion 
The amounts of oil obtained during the pyrolysis experiments are evidence that energy embedded in the plastic 
waste can be recovered. Energy can be reclaimed in liquid form as oil, solid form as char, or as a gas. Plastic waste 
is bulky, occupying a larger volume; pyrolysis reduces the bulk of the trash. All products obtained from pyrolysis 
can be put to good use, making pyrolysis an efficient method/tool for waste management. In conclusion, pyrolysis 
is effective in recovering energy from plastic waste as a tool for waste management

1609",,"At the end, the operation time per component was reduced, which would hence contribute 
in aslight increase of the total number of components per month. Another aspect which 
was significantly reduced was the transportation time of the component from one station 
to another. This was mainly done by changing the plant layout. Once the plant layout was 
changed, the need for manual transportation was eliminated, which thereby also 
eliminated the need of manpower for carrying. Hence the overall resources optimization 
can be done by using the above mentioned techniques. 
 
 
FUTURE SCOPE OF PROJECT 
The concepts and ideas in the project can be applied in various manufacturing industries 
to maximize the workers and to eliminate the wastage in the line of operation. Though 
there are many aspects in the manpower optimization the operator should be well trained 
and skillful for the existing techniques. 
Future research need to be attempt on the other aspects of improvement activity in order 
to increase the line efficiency. Besides that, the company may try to use other types of 
line layout for study the line efficiency value so that the company may have more options 
in choosing the most suitable line for their product and simulating those concepts can be 
done through software which gives the exact results regarding the manpower 
optimization percentages and no of operators required per production etc. The application 
of line balancing technique may have adverse results in the optimization of all the 
resources in firm.

Abstract  
 
Energy underpins economic growth globally regardless of the levels of development achieved this far. It 
is key to the production of food and water supply and other goods and services in sub-Saharan Africa 
(SSA) and globally. However, energy production and utilization and  the interdependent economic 
activities, Agriculture, Forestry and Other land Use, results in high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Using qualitative analysis, we evaluated the different primary energy sources within the energy supply 
chain network from generation, through its conversion to utilization to determine the energy efficiency 
and quantify the opportunity to mitigate these losses. We found that about 90% of the primary energy is 
lost through unsustainable conversion processes and only about 10% of the energy is utilized. 
Specifically, there is an opportunity for energy efficiency strategies to improve bioenergy capacity in SSA 
by about 40% on both the supply and demand side to reduce energy poverty and drive economic growth 
while transitioning to a low-carbon economy and climate-resilient energy sector, thereby enhancing 
sustainability and delivering universal and affordable energy access to all in SSA.

 1. Introduction 
 
The demand for energy in Africa is generally growing at double the global rate, and Africa’s abundant renewables 
resources and decreasing technology cost has doubled the deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) and other 
renewables on the continent. With this high demand for modern and more efficient energy resources, Africa has also 
become one of the world’s major oil and gas markets. This tag-of-war between fossil fuels and renewable is not so 
easy to defeat with renewable resources (UNIDO, 2009). 
 
Almost 50% of the African people (600 million people) did not have access to electricity by 2018, while around 
80% of sub-Saharan African organizations endured successive power outages which lead to financial losses. Further, 
around 900 million people do not have access to clean cooking facilities and this has led to annual premature deaths 
of almost 500 000 people from biomass air pollution-related diseases (Imasiku, Thomas, & Ntagwirumugara, 2020). 
It also contributes to forest depletion resulting from unsustainable harvesting of fuelwood, as well as imposing a 
considerable burden and loss of productive time, mostly by women (IRENA, 2019; UNIDO, 2009).

4. Conclusions  
 
Although Africa only contributes about 2% of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions to date, it suffers 
disproportionately from the climate change effects alongside food insecurity, health risks and economic 
insecurity. Further, 80% of the consumed energy in SSA is solid biomass (wood) and in its transformed 
form (charcoal), of which only 12.4% and 6% are available useful energy for cooking. This gives energy 
efficiency strategies an opportunity to optimize the bioenergy resource in SSA on both the supply-side 
(Generator) and demand-side (Conversion Appliances). Optimal sustainable bioenergy use of energy at 
all stages of the supply/demand chain could reduce the negative impacts of energy consumption, while 
still allowing the same economic development, thereby enhancing sustainability and delivering clean and 
affordable energy access to all in SSA.

Abstract  
 
Hand hygiene has been shown to prevent respiratory illness COVID-19 and is recommended after coughing and 
sneezing and/or on entering the home having come from outside. Functioning handwashing facilities with water and 
soap are recommended to be available within 5m of all toilets, both public and private. This paper proposes a design 
of a piped water scheme for an identified rural centre to increase sustained access to safe water as a primer solution 
to the fight against COVID-19. For the identified borehole, the safe pumping yield is taken as 80 % of capacity test 
and is given as 1.2m3/h. A special user defined excel simulation program was developed and employed that 
specified a 1.7kW motor pump, powered by a 1000 Wp solar array delivering a peak flow rate of 1.2m3/hr (12m3 of 
daily water yield) for the least insolation day at a TDH of 63m with overall pumping efficiency of 11l/Wp. The 
Hazen-Williams method was used to specify a 32mm Class 6 HDPE pipe that stretches for 530m as the pumping 
main. The mass balance curve gave a minimum balancing water storage of 30m3 on considering the risk of water 
quality deterioration given the absence of a disinfection regime.

1. Background  
  
As global awareness of climate change increases, current energy generation and usage practices face growing 
scrutiny from governmental institutions and the general public (Pushak, N and Briceño-Garmendia 2011). More 
pressure is being placed on individual organizations to become more critical of their own energy sources and 
transition to cleaner technologies. While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking 
water and sanitation, many people mostly in rural areas still lack these basic services. Worldwide, one in three 
people do not have access to safe drinking water, two out of five people do not have a basic hand washing facility 
with soap and water, and more than 673 million people still practice open defecation (AMCOW, 2011).  
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the critical importance of sanitation, hygiene and adequate access to 
clean water for preventing and containing diseases. Hand hygiene saves lives. According to the World Health 
Organization, handwashing is one of the most effective actions you can take to reduce the spread of pathogens and 
prevent infections, including the COVID-19 virus (United Nations, 2020). Yet billions of people still lack safe water 
sanitation, and funding is inadequate. Availability and access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is 
fundamental to fighting the virus and preserving the health and well-being of millions. COVID-19 will not be 
stopped without access to safe water for people living in vulnerability, UN experts said (AMCOW, 2011). The 
impacts of COVID-19 could be considerably higher on the urban poor living in slums, who don’t have access to 
clean water. There exists a need to urgently facilitate access to running water and handwashing in informal 
settlements. Young children are in need of urgent support in the form of with basic water, sanitation and hygiene 
facilities, especially those children who are cut off from safe water because they live in remote areas, or in places 
where water is untreated or polluted, or because they are without a home, living in a slum or on the street. In 
response to the COVID-19 outbreak, governments across the world are adjusting their WASH services to prevent

3.6 Storage Volume 
 
As there are other sources of water and the level of service is not to match that of urban areas in Zimbabwe which 
requires 2 days’ storage, and taking into consideration economic aspects, one (1) day storage is taken to be adequate.  
Considering that the water is not disinfected, long storage times may result in deterioration of water quality. In light 
of this, a storage volume of 30 m3 is specified.

Water will be pumped by 1.7kW motor pump driven by a 1000 Wp solar array delivering a peak flow rate of 1.2m3 
per hour translating to approximately 12m3 of daily water yield for the least insolation day at a TDH of 63m for an 
efficiency of 11l/Wp. The pumping mains is a 32mm Class 6 HDPE pipe that stretches for 530m. A Lorentz PS2-

Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
WASH is a prerequisite for quality care, and is particularly important for the safe management of COVID-19. The 
provision of safe water conditions is essential for preventing and for protecting human health during all infectious 
disease outbreaks, including of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ensuring evidenced-based and consistently 
applied WASH practices in communities, homes, schools and healthcare facilities will help prevent human-to-
human transmission of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The designed system is 
capable of supplying a daily water yield of 12m3. Ensuring universal access to WASH services in health care 
facilities is a solvable problem with a return on investment per day which is adequate to provide basic WASH 
services. The design was limited to sizing only the Solar Pumping systems and the related mains pipeline and 
storage. Further research can be developed to determine the distribution network distribution piping total length, 
spacing of the demand centres and the number of standpipes allocated for each demand centre. Key 
recommendations for Rural water supply (RWS) that can be adopted as priority actions in the fight against COVID-
19 include developing a national program to repair and rehabilitate wells and boreholes. Placing responsibility and 
asset ownership of RWS with rural district councils, and build their sector capacity, whilst encouraging support from 
communities and the private sector and rethinking maintenance/spares policy and develop a regulated, competitive 
drilling industry.

Abstract 
The present study is concerned with the elastic/plastic buckling of a thin rectangular plate when nonlinear strain terms 
are put into consideration in the equation of uniqueness. Buckling analyses of the plate was placed under different loading 
conditions i.e. uniaxial compression, biaxial compression and pure shear loading. The equilibrium and stability equations 
are derived and analysed based on the elastic theory presented by Hooke’s law and two theories of plasticity i.e. 
deformation theory (DT) and incremental theory (IT). Rayleigh-Ritz method was used as a discretization technique to 
solve the buckling of plate equation. A comparison of results between nonlinear strains versus linear strains was carried 
out and a 6.7% difference was observed when the plate was subjected to pure shear loading. The variation between the 
two cases was seen to increase as boundary equations became complicated when pure shear stress was considered. 
Furthermore, different parameters have been discussed i.e., effects of aspect ratio, thickness to width ratio and loading 
ratios, effect of different boundary condition and the type of plasticity theory considered.

1. Introduction 
Plates and plated structures have a variety of purposes in engineering applications and are frequently subjected to different 
boundary conditions and loadings. The vast majority of applications of plates is seen in aerospace, marine engineering 
and civil structures such as bridges. Due to their relatively small thickness to length ratio, the design strength of these 
structures is commonly governed by their buckling capacities. Buckling is as a phenomenon in which a structure 
undergoes visibly large transverse deflection in one of the possible instability modes. Buckling of a structural component 
may affect the strength or stiffness of the whole structure and may even result in an unexpected global failure of the 
structure. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to know buckling capacities of such structures in order to avoid 
premature failure. Bryan (1891) was one of the pioneers who first carried out a theoretical examination of buckling of 
plates. In his research, he analysed the buckling of rectangular plate under uniform uniaxial loading using the energy 
criterion of stability. Many researchers have seen that the application of the energy criterion proved to be a very useful 
analytical tool for the buckling problems which could not be solved by conventional analytical methods. Many of them 
have studied the buckling of a plate with various shapes, loading and boundary conditions using a variety of methods for 
analysis. In elastic buckling research, it has been assumed that buckling occurs when the critical load remains below the 
elastic limit of the plate material. In real life situation the plate may be stressed beyond the elastic limit before buckling

5. Conclusion on Uniaxial and biaxial loading 
The constitutive equations were obtained based on incremental theory (IT) and deformation theory (DT) formulations 
and procedures were worked out in detail using the energy method and Rayleigh-Ritz method. The results for code1 were 
compared with previously published data to verify the established methodology and procedures, it was observed that the 
results obtained by the deformation theory were much closer to the practical results obtained by Anderson[44]. The effects 
of aspect, thickness to length and loading ratios, boundary conditions, deformation and incremental theories and uniaxial 
and biaxial loading on the buckling coefficient were studied in detail. Based on the numerical results, the following 
conclusions are reached: 
 
The aspect ratio has considerable effect on the buckling coefficient in IT and DT and it was observed that the 
buckling capacity had the most significant variation over a certain range of aspect ratios and as the aspect ratio 
increased the results became constant. A plate under the same boundary condition was analyzed and was 
concluded that the buckling mode shape is also determined by the type of plastic theory used.  
 
Plastic buckling coefficients depend on boundary conditions, thickness to length and aspect ratios, loading 
parameter and type of theory of plasticity. 
 
The variations of plastic buckling mode shape are less in biaxial compression rather than in uniaxial loadings. 
Moreover, the buckling mode shapes are more affected by loading parameter. 
 
The discrepancy between IT and DT increases by applying more clamped boundary conditions, increasing 
thickness to length ratio. 
 
The buckling coefficient increases as the loading parameter changes from uniaxial compressive (𝛽𝛽̅ = 0) to 
biaxial compressive loading (𝛽𝛽̅ = 1)    
 
With increasing the loading ratio in biaxial compression, the differences between theories increase. 
For a plate under these loading condition it can be concluded that the nonlinear strain terms do not have a significant 
effect on the results obtained when the incremental theory or deformation theory were used. This confirms the Kirchoff’s 
plate theory in which these terms are neglected. 
5.1 Conclusion based on pure shear loading 
With the aim of determining the effects of including the non-linear strain terms into the equation of uniqueness the effect 
of shear deformation is taken into account in the analysis by adopting the Von karman plate theory. The results are 
extensively compared with the case when the non-linear strains were neglected and it has been observed that as in the 
case of elastic buckling, the effect of shear deformation lowers the plastic buckling stress parameter and the effect is more 
pronounced for the results obtained by IT when compared with their DT counterparts.  
The effect of aspect ratios and thickness-to-width ratios on the plastic buckling stress parameters were investigated. It has 
been observed that the influence of including nonlinear strain terms cannot be neglect when a plate is under pure shear 
loading. This was due to the 6.7% difference between the results of nonlinear and linear. It was also observed that the 
percentage difference between nonlinear and linear results is more pronounce as the boundary condition becomes more 
complicated. It was found that the buckling mode switches at particular aspect ratios for CCCC plates. Moreover, the 
cusps locations also depend on the type of plasticity theory used. This indicates that the plastic buckling mode shape may 
be different from its linear strain terms counterpart for a given aspect ratio. However, as the aspect ratio becomes large, 
the effect of the a/b value on the ultimate shear capacity of plates fades out 
For small thickness-to-width ratios, the plastic buckling solutions are close to their linear counterparts while, for large 
thickness ratios, the plastic buckling solutions are substantially lower than their linear counterparts. Generally, the plastic 
buckling stress parameters obtained by IT are larger than their DT counterparts. The difference increases with increasing 
thickness-to-width ratios. Apparently including the nonlinear strain terms has no effect on the change of IT accuracy, still 
the buckling loads predicted by the deformation theory, despite its physical shortcomings, are found to be in better 
agreement with experiments, whereas those based on the incremental theory are found to be significantly higher than the 
experimental ones. However, as far as pure shear loading is concerned, we cannot quickly neglect the nonlinear strain

Abstract 
 
Going green is an inevitable manufacturing practice in the midst of growing concerns over the need to reduce 
environmental waste. Compared with the pre-industrialization era, the carbon footprint has increased from 228 ppm 
to 413.3 ppm, landfills have increased and so has the leaching of toxins into nearby water bodies. The food industry 
is one of the largest contributors to the current state of the environment and hence, the reality of the need for waste 
reduction within the industry cannot be overemphasized. This paper assesses the dairy, soft drink and bakery 
industries, and brings the following to the attention to the manufacturer: waste production, energy losses, pollution 
and its impact to the environment during each stage of the product lifecycle. Particular attention is paid to the 
current production processes, and these are critically analyzed, considering the raw materials, the processing, and the 
final products. Finally, the paper proposes solutions on the manufacturing process and on how the wastes can be 
avoided, reduced, reused, recycled, recovered, treated and disposed responsibly.

1. Introduction  
Green manufacturing is a system that integrates product design and process design aspects that affect the production, 
planning and control in order to identify, quantify, assess and manage the flow of environmental waste, with a goal 
of reducing waste, maximizing resource utilization and subsequently minimizing the negative impact to the 
environment (Dilip Maruthi and Rashmi, 2015). It is concerned with both the process and product related impacts on 
the environment, and its aim is to reduce the generation of hazardous substances in both the design and 
manufacturing phase (Paul et al., 2014). It reduces production waste while at the same time, creating less pollution 
to the environment. Waste refers to anything that takes up manufacturing time and cost without adding value to the 
product. This can be non-value adding processes or residues from the semi-processed product. Value is what the 
customer is willing to pay for (Helmold, 2020). Sustainable manufacturing practices such as energy substitution, 
hybrid energy technologies, resource-efficient production, waste minimization, cleaner production and recycling 
result in a significant reduction of the manufacturing costs and improves product quality (Rusinko, 2007). The food 
industry plays an integral part in the wellbeing of the people. It cannot be overemphasized that without the dairy, 
bakery and soft drink industry life would not be the same. It is also important to note these industries have to abide 
by strict regulations in order to remain operational. Production cost has to be minimized in order to sell the products 
at a competitive price. Hence there is a need for maximum utilization of resources and minimization of waste, that 
is, to do more with less. As a hybrid approach, green manufacturing takes into account the environmental and 
economic approach (Leong et al., 2019). This brings viability through environmentally friendly manufacturing 
processes, and it is very critical at this time when the food industry is facing pressure from supply-demand and the 
stringent climate change regulations. The world is ever-changing and customer needs keep on changing.

Abstract 
 
There are several methods available used to extract essential oils. There are conventional and non-conventional 
methods with the latter being more efficient than the former. Currently at the Pharmacy department of the University 
of Zimbabwe there is no functional extraction machine. The ones that were used have worn out and thus have since 
been decommissioned. With this in mind, the present project sets out to solve this problem by coming up with a new 
system design that uses the subcritical water extraction method to extract essential oils faster and more efficiently as 
compared to the previously available steam distillation machine. The machine has a pressure tank which acts as the 
extraction vessel and the subcritical water is passed through the plant material inside the vessel. The temperature of 
the water inside is maintained at a specific temperature. The tank is pressurized using a pump and valves to maintain 
the pressure inside the extraction vessel. The products of the extraction process cooled and separated. The extraction 
tank and the pipes are analyzed using Autodesk Inventor to determine the safety of the design.

1. Introduction 
 
According to Abdelouaheb and Amadou (2012) essential oils’ broad medicinal values have been realized since ancient 
times and continue to be of prime importance until now. There has been a growing demand for natural medicine such 
as essential oils due to an increase in demand to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals to fight infections. This is due 
to the fact that microorganisms are resistant to synthetic antimicrobials (Rassem, et al., 2016; Nazzaro, et al., 2017). 
The increasing knowledge of the composition of essential oils and their pharmaceutical uses have led to development 
of their cultivation and markets where they represent an important industrial raw material for the pharmaceutical 
industry of commercial importance (Marques, et al., 2012; Abdelouaheb & Amadou, 2012). 
Presently there are several methods of extraction of essential oils, such as hydrodistillation, Solvent extraction, steam 
distillation, cohobation and maceration (Rassem, et al., 2016) and among all these methods the most used is steam 
distillation, especially for commercial scale production  (Tongnuanchan & Benjakul, 2014). The present project 
intends to introduce large scale local production of essential oils for pharmaceutical uses by designing a system that 
can harvest the oils from selected plants.

for the design 
4.4 Von Mises analysis for assembled pressure tank 
The maximum stress being 207.5 MPa. Since it is required that the von Mises stress be less than the yield stress of the 
material for the design to be considered safe, the designer can safely assume at this point that the design is indeed safe 
since,  𝜎𝜎𝑣𝑣< 𝜎𝜎𝑦𝑦 (i.e. 207.5 MPa < 230 MPa) 
 
4.5 Von Mises stress analysis for pipes 
The maximum von Mises stress shown in the analysis of the pipes is 106.6 MPa which is less than the yield stress of 
the material used, thus the design is indeed safe. In addition to the von Mises stress analysis, the strain analysis was 
also carried and the results were as follows:

5. Recommendations and conclusion 
 
Although the design has been shown to be safe, it has done so by a small margin. In light of this some improvements 
may be done to the design to improve its strength and reliability and these are; 
● 
The design safety factor has to be increased in order to stronger components 
● 
The heating method may need some improvements. The oven can be replaced by a more efficient heating 
element which heats the vessel directly. 
● 
The design needs to be automated. 
The present design has the potential of delivering a more efficient, faster and a greener method of essential oils 
extraction which will produce high quality products that satisfy the world’s standard.

Abstract 
The world faces a fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, following the first three revolutions: 
mechanizing production, energizing production, and automating production. Industry 4.0 focuses on digitizing and 
optimizing production in order to keep up with the increasing and ever-changing customer demands. This research 
establishes a maturity model (MM) for companies and organizations to assess their readiness towards integrating 
Industry 4.0, regardless of their business domain. The utilization of the maturity model allows these professional 
associations to develop a personalized implementation plan for Industry 4.0.

1. Background 
What started as a push by the German government, Industry 4.0 has been adopted globally, with countries such as the 
U.S., China, and South Korea coining their own initiatives [1]. With such an increase in exposure and research, 
companies have begun to recognize the benefits brought forth by Industry 4.0 adoption. Following three industrial 
revolutions, Industry 4.0 initiatives aim to improve upon current industry practices via data-driven insights, 
integration, and connectivity. Such initiatives are set to bring forth benefits such as an increase in productivity, higher 
quality products, ability to customize, transparency of data in real-time, greater connectivity, and decrease in downtime 
[2]. However, while some companies have prospered, others have continued to face heavy barriers, making it difficult 
to reap the benefits brought on by widespread adoption. These barriers are more prevalent for Small and Medium- 
sized Enterprises (SMEs), who often lack the capital and market share needed to effectively implement Industry 4.0 
[3]. In the U.S. specifically, SMEs make up approximately 99.9% of businesses; therefore, reducing the barriers to 
entrance for SMEs is essential for widespread Industry 4.0 adoption [4]. Such barriers may be a lack of knowledge 
regarding Industry 4.0, a lack of capital, or lack of appropriate human resources [5]. Larger enterprises may also fall 
victim to these barriers, especially a lack of knowledge, as many enterprises may not be aware of the initiative’s 
applicability to their own operations. 
 
For instance, Industry 4.0 represents a new era for the manufacturing sector; however, its initiatives apply to a variety 
of other industries like that of healthcare. In such cases, the Industry 4.0 movement has been adapted to meet the area's 
needs, with initiatives such as Health and Care 4.0 being coined, yet widespread adoption of these initiatives has also 
been scarce [6]. Concerning the mass movement toward data-driven optimization, Industry 4.0 continues to be the 
leading term. Therefore, regardless of industry, all initiatives that have been adapted from the Industry 4.0 initiative 
will be referred to as Industry 4.0 for this paper, which aims to produce a general maturity model and an 
implementation plan applicable for businesses of any size in any industry. 
 
2. Relevant Literature 
The exact year of the maturity model is debated due to its creation in 1986 but publication in 1993 [7]. Regardless, 
academic and business organizations still employ maturity models as step-by-step assessments to determine their 
maturity or readiness at a given point in time. These steps, or stages, help many industries to develop strategies or 
plans to achieve the highest level of maturity and obtain a certain level of success. For example, a Social Media 
Maturity Model with At Internet Online Intelligence Solutions was created to aid individuals and companies in

Abstract 
 
The depletion of high grade and easily extractable gold ores has inspired development of innovative approaches for 
sustainable beneficiation of complex (refractory) gold ores. A complex gold ore is generally defined as an ore that is 
difficult to treat by using the conventional metallurgical unit operations. This difficulty is mainly due to their complex 
mineralogy that is associated with a low degree of liberation. Mineralogical characterisation strongly assists in defining 
the amenability of the complex ore to conventional treatment processes. This paper reviews the currently available pre- 
treatment and processing routes in order to determine future research in the treatment and processing of complex gold 
ores. The overall goal is to inspire knowledge improvement for the development of a commercially effective technique. 
 
Keywords  
Complex gold ore, Sustainable beneficiation, processing, conventional treatment 
 
1. Introduction 
Gold is a noble metal with excellent physical and chemical properties and is therefore found in nature in its pure metallic 
form (Adams, 2016). However, the rapid depletion of amenable gold ores has alert researchers to come up with effective 
techniques in extracting gold from the refractory/ complex ores. 
 
Complex ores are defined as the ores that are difficult to treat by using the conventional metallurgical unit operations 
largely due to their complex mineralogy. Complex ores can be conveniently classified as cyanide consuming, oxygen 
consuming or preg-robbing (Ilyas & Lee, 2018). Cyanide consuming ores are not economical and environmentally 
friendly as they require high concentrations of cyanide for leaching. This is mainly due to the presence of other minerals 
species such as silver and copper minerals that complex with cyanide. Cyanide consuming ores have low recoveries and 
often require a pre-treatment step to remove the metals that compete with gold for cyanide. Carbonaceous material such 
as wood and organic carbon adsorb dissolved gold from solution during leaching and act like activated carbon hence the 
name ‘preg-robbing’. This results in reduced gold extractions during leaching to less than 80% (Marsden & House, 2009). 
Carbonaceous gold ores require pre-treatment before cyanidation and methods such as chemical oxidation, bioleaching, 
roasting and others can be employed (Afenya, 1991). Complex ores can also be termed refractory as they often give very 
poor recoveries. 
 
Refractory gold ores can be defined as those ores that give less than 80% gold recovery with simple cyanidation when 
ground to a conventional size of 80%-75μm (Yannopoulos, 1991).  The major causes of refractoriness are physically 
locked, chemically locked gold and passivation of gold (Asamoah, 2014).

1708","Figure 3. Illustration of gold dissolution mechanism in cyanide (Yannopoulos, 1991) 
 Although leaching is easily controlled and highly predictable, it is costly and uses toxic chemicals such as cyanide and 
is environmentally unfriendly. Froth ﬂotation has thus been employed to preconcentrate gold ore before leaching as it is 
much more cost-effective and environment friendly.    
 
3.3 Coal-oil gold agglomeration process 
 
Coal-oil gold agglomeration (CGA) utilizes the natural hydrophobicity of coal and gold (Sen et al, 2005). In this process 
intensive agitation causes the coal – oil agglomerates to form in a coal slurry and oil. Under intensive agitation the pre-
formed agglomerates are added into gold-bearing ore slurry where the gold particles then contact, collide and attach with 
the coal-oil agglomerates, and eventually penetrate into the agglomerates (Akcil et al, 2009). 
Generally this process is more environmentally friendly compared to the conventional methods as the tailings produced 
in CGA process only contain small amounts of harmless contaminants, such as coal fines, oil, collectors and possibly 
lime. Also, concentrations of these pollutants will be far below threshold levels in environmental regulations. However, 
there is need for further research on cost effectiveness of this process (Akcil et al, 2009). 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The pre-treatment and processing of complex/ refractory gold ore is becoming more and more pronounced and is an 
inevitable trend to gold development due to the rapid depletion of high grade ores. Significant progress has been recorded 
in recent years as scientists continue to explore ways of pre-treating and processing refractory gold ores sustainably. A 
process for gold recovery will only be deemed successful if the cost of implementing the process is much less than the 
value of the precious metal itself. In addition, environmental issues should be valued in the selection of a process.  
 
A review of the potential pre-treatment and processing technologies has shown that the main problems that need urgent 
attention in the gold industry are the need to improve on recovery, cost and environmental issues. A highly cost efﬁcient 
and environment friendly technology to improve gold recovery from complex ores is therefore needed in future. In 
summary, as the proportion of low grade ores is becoming larger and larger, it is imperative to develop technologies for 
lower cost and higher gold recovery rates to ensure sustainability in the gold industry.

Abstract 
 
The researcher was working on the idea that machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence has proved more 
accurate than humans in predicting heart diseases. Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) are responsible for a greater 
percentage of infant mortality worldwide, hence the need to detect and predict the diseases at birth for the 
administration of proper and on time treatment. The target of the project was to come up with an algorithm that can 
be linked to a device(s) for inputs or that can receive inputs entered manually and give a prediction of potential 
CHDs. This has been previously addressed as the prediction of heart disease in general but there has not been 
enough focus on Congenital Heart Diseases hence for this study. The researcher made use of the K-Nearest 
Neighbours (K-NN), Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to develop three prediction 
algorithms in Python Programming. The prediction accuracies of the three in algorithms were compared and the one 
with the highest score was selected. According to the selected SVM algorithm the researcher saw 73% accuracy in 
prediction. One recommendation is that more specific data on CHD should be collected to create better datasets.

1. Introduction 
 
A Congenital Heart Disease (CHD), also referred to as a Congenital Heart Defect, is a problem in the structure of 
the heart, already present at birth [1]. CHDs involve the heart’s wall, valves, arteries, and veins close to the heart, 
and these defects have the potential to disrupt the normal blood flow through the heart – slowing it down, 
misdirecting it, or preventing it completely [2].  
 
Some commonly known symptoms of heart defects in severe cases, those that can be fatal if untreated, include: 
cyanosis (blueish lips, skin and fingernails), fatigue, rapid and short breath especially during feeding and poor 
blood circulation seen by swollen legs, abdomen and area surrounding the eyes. The serious CHDs are usually 
prevalent during pregnancy, at birth or during the first few months of life and the less intense ones are usually 
discovered later in the child’s life seen by symptoms such as quickly getting short of breath during exercise, fainting 
during exercise, easily tiring and swollen hands, feet or ankles [3]. A blowing, whooshing or rasping sound in 
heartbeat known as a heart murmur, pounding heart and weak pulse can also be symptoms of CHDs [4].  
 
According to the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States, Centres for Disease Control and 
Prevention in 2017, heart disease was the leading cause of human death[5]. Currently, in young children and infants, 
congenital heart disease contributes a large 30% to 50% to the mortality resulting from birth defects. Although 
mortality resulting from CHD during childhood and infancy is reportedly decreasing, its prevalence among adults is 
increasing.

11. Conclusion 
The main purpose of this project was to develop a system that will allow for the prediction of congenital heart 
diseases at birth and some weeks after birth that uses machine learning to improve the accuracy of prediction. Three 
algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine) were tested with the dataset 
to select the one with the highest accuracy. The support vector machine algorithm was taken up and the disease 
prediction system was developed. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 73% which met our objective target 
of 70%. In the proposed system the database is password protected making information stored secure and the front-
end interface developed in PHP and HTML is simple and easy to use.  
12. Recommendations 
There are several limitations that were encountered in this study that when addressed in future studies would make 
for more efficient, reliable, and convenient congenital heart disease prediction systems. Firstly, more data directly 
focussing on congenital heart disease should be collected to build specific datasets that will be used to train the 
machine learning algorithms. Also, in future studies, before coming to a concrete conclusion more machine learning 
algorithms should be tested with the dataset to pave way for more accurate CHD predictions. As the data volumes 
grow computers with greater processing power will also be required to perform the predictions. In the light of the 
full implementation of Health 4.0 to keep up with the times, portable heart disease input device(s) that can 
continually monitor the parameters sending the collected results to the cloud server remotely should be developed.

Abstract 
The optimality of supply chain networks (SCN), associated with inventory management, is one of the mandatory 
objectives for industries.  The main purpose of this research is to minimize the total expected costs of collaborative 
supply chain networks. This research investigates the applicability of the modified firefly algorithm for minimizing 
the total cost of collaborative supply chain networks based on large-sized problems, in which the vendor uses VMI 
policy for collaborations and direct-delivery policy for non-collaborations.  It is assumed that industrial plants with 
assigned warehouses are willing to share their existing capacities with other industrial plants with no assigned 
warehouses to reduce the undesirable costs associated with shortage and extra inventory.  Since this problem is one 
of the larger problems related to industrial supply chain networks, commercial software cannot obtain the optimal 
results for these problems considered in this research.  To achieve better findings, we applied a modified firefly 
algorithm to solve the problem.  The computational time of the proposed algorithm was also reduced as compared 
with commercial software and standard firefly algorithm.

1. Background 
Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) plays an essential role in the optimality of supply chain networks associated with 
location-inventory assignment problem.  Regarding supply chain networks (SCN), designing an effective and suitable 
network associated with location-inventory assignment problem is one of the most important aspects that assures 
profitability for companies in a competitive environment under uncertainty.  In this paper, we consider that the vendor 
plays a significant role in the collaboration strategy between the industrial plants with assigned warehouses and those 
without.  Some industrial plants with no assigned warehouses may have demands more than other plants with assigned

Abstract  
  
Since the 1980s, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has changed their recommended childhood vaccination 
schedule from 22 doses of seven vaccines by the age of six to 50 doses of 14 vaccines by the age of six. In a similar 
timeframe, the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has increased. It is possible that these two are related. 
This paper intends to hypothesize that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) could be utilized to detect levels of 
mercury and aluminium in the brain, due to the magnetic properties. TMS works by sending magnetic field pulses into 
both the Peripheral and Central Nervous System. If we can connect the magnetic field pulses to the magnetic properties 
of mercury and aluminium, we can potentially track how the mercury has affected the brain and determine if this may 
have caused ASD.

1746","5. Future Research   
Many signs point to a correlation between the increase of vaccines and increase in autism. However, it is 
important to recognize and consider all aspects that have a potential relation to the increase in autism in the United 
States. Examples of changes in the past few decades that may cause changes in ASD prevalence could be 
environmental changes such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), as well as an increase in daily radiation 
exposure (increased usage of cell phones, laptops, and other electronics) that may be releasing minute amounts of 
radiation that could be affecting development. It is also important to think about how the ASD criteria for diagnosis 
has changed and expanded which could add to the increased prevalence of autism in the world.  
  
6. Conclusion  
In less than half a century, the number of recommended vaccines for children younger than six has more than 
tripled. In the same span of time, the occurrence of ASD has also increased drastically from the early 1990s being 
about 1 in 2500 to the 2018 reports from CDC’s ADDM statistics claiming approximately 1 in 59 children in the USA 
are likely to be diagnosed with ASD [13]. Many researchers and scientists have hypothesized that the two are related. 
This paper draws a connection between this standing hypothesis and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. TMS can be 
utilized to gather more information about ASD as well as to help manage many of its symptoms.

Abstract 
 
Critical thinking skills are essential for 21st century citizens to possess (Halpern, 1997).  Educators and 
employers are assessing these skills many different ways ranging from multiple-choice tests to subjective 
observational protocols.  This research focused on the assessment of undergraduate students nearing degree 
completion in a technology program.  The assessment instrument used was the Critical Thinking Assessment Test 
(CAT), developed by Tennessee Technological University under the sponsorship of the National Science 
Foundation (Stein & Haynes, 2011).  It is an assessment tool that is designed to measure important components of 
critical thinking.  This test also provides feedback that can assist the faculty in determining some measure of the 
effectiveness of coursework, curricula, and departmental learning activities.  Characteristics of critical thinking 
include the abilities to evaluate information, to think creatively, to learn, and to solve problems.  These skills are 
desired by employers and are a valued capability of technology graduates (Davies, 2013; Scott, 2008).  Because they 
are necessary for the future success of undergraduate technology students, it is valuable to have a direct measure of 
critical thinking skills.  By using an empirical assessment of these skills, faculty can assess what critical thinking 
skills are present or are lacking in undergraduate students and make curricular improvements to better develop these 
skills.  
 
Over a three-year period, the CAT exam was administered to six groups of undergraduate students at a 
large midwestern research university during their final year of study. A total of 209 students from all four different 
degree program options offered at this institution (Agricultural & Biosystems Management (ABM), Machine 
Systems (MS), Manufacturing (MFR), and Occupational Safety (OS)) participated in this study.  The reported test 
score national mean was 19.04.  The test score mean of this sample of upper division technology students from all 
options was 18.62.  These undergraduate technology students performed with no statistically significant difference 
from the CAT exam population, t(208) = 1.22, p = .22. When considering CAT exam performance by degree option, 
the ANOVA indicated difference existed, F(3,205) = 3.27, p = .022.  The application of the Tukey HSD test 
revealed that the only significant difference between the means, p < .01, existed between the Agricultural & 
Biosystems Management (M = 19.85, SD = 5.19) and Occupational Safety (M = 15.50, SD = 4.42) students. 
 
This current research confirms that the CAT exam is useful for assessing the critical thinking skills of 
undergraduate technology students.  A difference in exam scores of the ABM students and OS students warrants 
further investigation.  Future research with this same undergraduate student sample includes analysis of individual 
CAT scores, ACT scores, and high school grade point averages to determine their relationship.  Also, the CAT score 
relationship to grades in prerequisite degree coursework and grades in technology specific courses will be examined. 
Future research can better assist faculty members in identifying particular course and curriculum opportunities to 
further develop critical thinking skills in undergraduate technology students.

Abstract 
Broadcasting requires a large setup in order to function well. It is very important for the reader to look directly into 
the camera while reading the teleprompter. Looking at the camera is vital so that the viewer sees the reader looking 
directly at them. Current equipment is large, bulky, expensive, and hard to move around. With everything getting 
smaller yet more powerful, why have broadcasting systems remained so big and tedious? The first step to solving this 
problem is to look at the camera. Cameras in portable devices today are powerful enough to match larger cameras. A 
much smaller camera taken from a smartphone could be powerful enough to get a clear recording of someone reading 
from a teleprompter. Modern smartphone cameras can record video in 4K with 60 frames per second. That amount of 
quality should be enough to broadcast at a high standard. The next biggest problem would be the monitor. Current 
Teleprompters have a screen placed horizontally with a slanted mirror on top to reflect what’s on the monitor. This is 
not space efficient. In order to solve this problem, the camera could be placed behind the monitor. No mirrors would 
be involved, and the monitor would be upright. There are some ideas as to how to get the camera to see through the 
screen. The first idea was to put a small hole through the liquid crystal display of the monitor, so that the small phone 
camera can see through. This caused problems because any hole through the display would cause the liquid crystals 
to leak and cause bleeding on the monitor. Another proposed idea was to use a transparent display. That idea could 
work with 100 percent transparency, but that rarely is the case. The slight dim on the screen would be visible to the 
camera, and the quality of the video would suffer. The third idea was to split the screen into four displays, with the 
camera in the center of them. The issue with this was cost efficiency, since it requires 4 separate monitors. Another 
important part of this project is setting up the perfect system. The system that is required is one with a motherboard 
that is powerful enough to record and stream the video as well as have enough inputs and outputs to work with all the 
equipment. A unique feature of the system is to include a SIM card reader, so that there can be cellular data connection. 
The idea is to bond the wired connection of the system and the cellular data connection together in order to stream the 
video without sacrificing quality. In order to follow the mission to make a smaller system, the hardware will utilize a 
motherboard that is much smaller than a regular desktop motherboard. Many of the potential boards were dedicated 
for mobile devices or embedded systems, and thus, are a good size for this project.

Abstract  
 
The study aimed at ascertaining whether National Council for Construction (NCC) registered contractors classified in 
Grade One employ safety, health, environment and quality (SHEQ) to mitigate risks at projects. The study also sought 
to establish the SHEQ policies employed in the construction industry and the risks incurred due to non-conformance 
with policies. An exploratory sequential mixed method was adopted in which a structured interview guide and a 
questionnaire was used as data collection tools from a sample of 54 respondents out of which 38 (72%) responded. 
Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Findings reviewed that 
leadership, individual behaviour, management commitment, and communication are correlated to the implementation 
of SHEQ policy. Risk management variables established are safety and health performance, managed construction 
costs, and quality and environmental performance. Risks encountered by contractors for not implementing SHEQ were 
political, economic, social, technical, environmental, legal, and management risks. It was established that failure to 
employ SHEQ policies had a high impact on the management of risks on site, hence, a strong correlation between 
SHEQ policy implementation and risk management. The study recommends the use of the developed risk management 
framework that incorporates SHEQ to mitigate risks.

Introduction 
The construction sector plays an important role in growing economies and employment creation world over for 
millions of unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled workforces (Claris, 2017). According to the Labour Force Survey 2018, 
in the European Union (EU) 12.7 million workers (7.9 % of the total EU-15 workforce) are employed in the industry. 
However, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) (2019) estimated that 6,300 people die every day as a result of 
work-related diseases and injuries which is more than 2.3 million deaths per year globally. According to Mwanaumo 
and Mambwe (2019), the ILO report (2018) indicated that the construction industry accounts for 30-40% of the world’s 
fatal injuries with nearly 100,000 workers killed each year and 4% of GDP is the estimated cost of occupational 
accidents and ill-health in all sectors. According to Donkoh et al. (2015), about 60,000 fatal accidents happen on

1757","The Proposed Risk Management Framework Incorporating SHEQ policy  
From the study results, it was found that the best-fit risk management framework as advanced by HSE (2018), Renault 
and Agumba (2016) and Pillay (2014) and they include risk policy, establishing the context, risk identification, risk 
assessment, risk monitoring and risk evaluation, risk control and close risk. The firms need to create an enabling 
environment for the management of risks and SHEQ implementation. This was done through the firm’s organization 
strategy approved by the board and full mandate given to management to run with it. This also entails factoring in 
SHEQ in all these processes. Therefore, all business processes for contractors can integrate SHEQ policies with risk 
management for them to benefit from risk management. The study integrated the planning stage from the Plan-Do-
Check-Act Deming Cycle (Henshall, 2020).  
Additionally, identifying all small risks, medium, or mega ones, and documenting the risks in the appropriate risk 
register was found to be essential. In assessing and quantifying each risk, the contractor have to ascertain the 
probability of the risk occurring and the consequences of its occurrence and also develop response strategies such as, 
avoid risk, treat risk, transfer risk, accept and exploit risk. When risks are identified, recorded in the register, and 
assessed, they must be monitored and assigned to an officer responsible for mitigating them. Lastly, evaluation and 
determining if the process adds value to the overall organization strategy and progress must be done. This leads to the 
closing of the risk after mitigation. The strategy was not part of the scope of this study. However, embedded in this 
study, was the SHEQ policy implementation processes in which policy, leadership and accountability, management 
commitment, communication, and individual behaviour were found to be vital in the implementation of projects and 
were included in the model as illustrated in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2 Risk Management Framework Incorporating SHEQ Policy  
6.    Conclusion and Recommendations 
The study sought to establish the impact that employed SHEQ policies had on the management of risk and proposed 
the best risk management framework with the incorporation of SHEQ. The study found that the SHEQ policy, 
management commitment, leadership and accountability, communication, involvement of employees in SHEQ 
processes activities, supplier/contractor/customer engagement, zero harm, environmental sustainability and quality 
products or services, training roles and responsibilities and performance monitoring, review and responsibilities, are 
variables that can be adopted in construction by contractors when implementing SHEQ management systems. Among

accountability, individual behaviour, communication and management commitment. The study hence, concluded that 
a risk management framework that incorporates SHEQ policy variables would be an effective tool to reduce incidents 
at projects such as accidents, injuries, fatalities and ill-health.  
The study recommends possible adoption of the proposed risk management framework that incorporates SHEQ policy 
variables to mitigate health and safety risks. The study further recommends the implementation of the established 
variables as a means to reduce incidents at construction projects by contractors in Zambia. The study was limited by 
the outbreak of the Covid-19 which hindered collection of data as most respondents were working on shifts.

Abstract 
Regression modelling is used to establish the qualities of pervious concrete that treats AMD. In order to investigate 
the relationship between dependent and independent variables, regression modelling technique was used. This 
technique is used to analyze several variables. Regression analysis helps to understand the effect of each 
independent variable on the dependent variable. In this research regression modelling is done to establish the 
properties of pervious concrete that treats AMD and to understand the relationship between the AMD treatment 
variables.  Familiar methods of regression analysis  such as linear regression is used in this research. The AMD 
quality is modelled as  the dependent variable and all other variables are independent variables. It was found that 
the thickness and the aggregate size of the pervious concrete slab does effect the metal concentration and PH of 
AMD as it passes through the pervious concrete.

1. Introduction 
In order to investigate the relationship between dependent and independent variables, regression modelling 
technique was used. This technique is used to analyze several variables. Regression analysis helps to understand 
the effect of each independent variable with the dependent variable. This research is done to establish the 
properties of pervious concrete that treat AMD and to understand the relationship between the AMD treatment 
variables [9].  Familiar methods of regression analysis include linear regression and ordinary least square 
regression. Linear regression method is a linear approach that involves modelling the relationship between 
dependent and independent variables, whereas ordinary least square regression is used to model unknown 
parameters in a linear regression method. This research focuses on linear regression method. The AMD quality is 
modelled as a dependent variable and all other variables are independent variables. The dependent variable is 
shown on the y-axis and the independent variables are shown on the x-axis.  
2. Linear Regression as a Modelling Tool 
This is the most applied technique in statistical analysis and modelling. It establishes the relationship between 
dependent and independent variables [1]. Dependent variable is the variable that will be predicted, and 
independent variable is a variable that influences the dependent variable. Linear regression modelling also helps 
to identify the most independent variable that closely affect the dependent variable. Linear regression analysis is 
divided into two approaches such as  simple linear regression which models the relationship between the 
dependent variable and one independent variable and multiple linear regression is when independent variables 
includes two or more variables [2, 3]. In this research a multiple linear regression is used and Excel software was 
used to develop the linear model. Mathematically linear regression modeling is defined by:

The effect of aggregate size was also investigated by using different size of aggregate size, Figure 3 shows that 
there is a direct relationship between the aggregate size of the concrete and the pH.  
 
 
Figure 3: AMN pH and aggregate size. 
5. Conclusion 
The linear regression model in Figure 2 establishes the properties of pervious concrete that threat AMD. These 
results can be used when designing the concrete wall which is the subject of another paper. This regression model 
clearly shows that there is a core relationship between the aggregate size and the thickness of the pervious concrete 
slab [4-6, 9].  
Equation 2 can be used to design a concrete block that can treat AMD depending on the pH value that is required. 
The thickness of the pervious concrete decreases as the aggregate size increases and vice-versa. For example if 
the value of aggregate size is 6.7mm using equation 2 the thickness of the concrete wall will be y = -3,8462(6.7)+ 
145,77 = 120mm , the volume of the concrete doesn’t make the difference on the PH value and the metal filtration, 
as long the thickness and aggregate size are correct. Equation 2 can be used to determine other paramerterts such 
as the size of the aggregate  and the thickness of pervious concrete barrier.

Abstract 
 
This article discusses the use of a European type of put option called a cash-or-nothing put option to calculate the 
agricultural insurance premium price based on the rainfall index. The data used in this study are rainfall data and 
rice production in Banjarnegara Regency from 2014-2019 which are arranged in a quarterly form. The research 
was completed with a literature study and online secondary data search. From the research results, rainfall data 
with strong correlation is the second quarter rainfall (August - November) so that the rainfall data in August - 
November is used as the rainfall index. From the calculation results, at the 5th percentile, the rainfall in the 
second quarter is 16.66 mm. For 16.66 mm of rainfall, and using the reference of rainfall of 15.20 mm which is 
the last data on the rainfall index, the premium price is obtained of IDR 3,499,000. The calculation results 
provide a very large premium price, whereas the maximum benefit per hectare per planting season is IDR 
6,000,000.

which has a lognormal distribution is the share price. So, the underlying asset for agricultural insurance based on 
the rainfall index is the lognormal distribution, namely the rainfall data that becomes the index (or rainfall index 
data). 
Calculation µ  is carried out annually. In this case, the observation data is the rainfall data with the highest

3.7  Premium Price Analysis 
The premium for Asuransi Usaha Tani Padi (Paddy Farming Business Insurance) for one hectare of land per 
planting period is 3% of the maximum benefit value of IDR 6,000,000.00 (Prabowo, Mamat, and Sukono, 2019). 
With a total premium of IDR 180,000.00 the farmers only pay 20% or IDR 36,000.00. Meanwhile, the 
government will bear the remaining premiums of Rp. 144,000.00. 
 
The implementation of AUTP stipulates that farmers only need to pay IDR 180,000.00 per hectare per 
planting season. The premium price generated in this study is a ready-to-sell premium, not a pure premium (pure 
premium). This is because compensation of IDR 6,000,000 is calculated based on field condition which includes 
all costs required in one planting season. 
 
From Table 6, the choice of percentile also greatly affects the size of the premium. The amount of premium 
increases as the percentile increases. This is because the higher the risk of failure or loss in the agricultural 
sector. For

Conclusions 
The implementation of Asuransi Usaha Tani Padi (Paddy Farming Business Insurance) stipulates that farmers 
only need to pay IDR 36,000.00 with government assistance of IDR 144,000.00 so that the total AUTP premium 
is IDR 180,000.00 per hectare per planting season. The results showed that the premium price was IDR 
2,753,296.00 when the last rainfall data reference (15.2 mm) was used. That is, it is very far from the premium 
price set by the government. 
The suggestion that can be conveyed is that the use of reference rainfall data in determining the premium 
price does not use the latest data on the rainfall index data. It is recommended that the first data, mean, median, 
mode, quantile, or percentile be used as reference data.

Abstract  
 
The Covid-19 has resulted in universities shut all across the world. Globally, over 100 million college students 
are out of classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of Learning 
Management System (LMS), whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. As online 
learning has gone mainstream, it has never been more important to choose an educational LMS tailored to 
institution’s mission and goals. Sentiment analysis tells user whether the information about the product is 
satisfactory or not before they choose it. Sentiment analysis can classify the polarity of the text in sentences or 
documents to see whether the opinion on the sentences or documents are positive or negative. This research 
focuses mainly on sentiment analysis of user preferences on Google Classroom data using Improved K-Nearest 
Neighbor method which is helpful to classify opinions in text into positive or negative categories. From the 
results obtained, testing with different input values of k results in different accuracy percentage values, for k = 2 
of 74.00%, for k = 5 of 79.00%, for k = 10 of 83.00%, for k = 15 of 83.00%, for k = 20 of 84.00%, with the 
highest accuracy with a value of k = 20. Based on the test results, it can be taken conclusion that the k value has 
an effect on the accuracy of the classification system.

1. Introduction 
 
The Covid-19 has resulted in universities shut all across the world. Globally, over 100 million college students 
are out of classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of Learning 
Management System (LMS), whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. As online learning 
has gone mainstream, it has never been more important to choose an educational LMS tailored to institution’s 
mission and goals.  
Customer satisfaction is very important for public service providers, customer satisfaction can be delivered with 
a survey application or writing criticism that can be used to evaluate and improve service (Muktafin et al. 2020). 
Though it belongs to the artificial intelligence domain, namely is considered a machine learning technique, 
sentiment analysis is defined as a text data analysis that provides a deep analysis about opinions, sentiments, 
appraisals, attitudes, and emotions and it allows us checking how many negative and positive keywords are included 
in a text message (Păvăloaia et al. 2019). Sentiment analysis tells user whether the information about the product is 
satisfactory or not before they choose it.  
Previous researches have been done till now in the context of sentiment analysis to detect the polarity of the 
sentiment using text mining techniques classification and clustering. Sentiment analysis of movie to find out positive 
or negative user sentiment using improved k-nearest neighbor achieved an average accuracy of 96% (Arora et al.

The measurement results in Table 4 show that labeling using ImpkNN and TF-IDF produces an accuracy 
66.00%, precision 73.86%, recall 85.53% and F1-measure 79.27%. Overall the test results showing positive results 
show machine learning has good performance. 
 
As can be noticed, the experimental results indicate that GC performs good for sentimental terms selection and 
sxhibits and exhibits good performance for sentiment classification in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. As 
for the accuracy, it does not appear to be so good due to several problems including login, file upload, download, 
and update. Among these problems, the most common problem faced by users is the problem with login. 
  
3.2. Testing of the k Value Effect 
 
 
The test has been carried out five times to determine the effect of the proportion of test data in each category and 
the k value on the effectiveness of the classification system. There are 1.000 datasets consisting of 900 documents as 
training data and 100 documents as test data. The results of system testing based on k value using 100 test data can 
be seen in Table 5.

Based on the results of the system test in Table 5, it can be seen that the highest accuracy is at the k value = 20 of 
84.00% and the lowest is at the k value = 2 of 74.00%. So it can be concluded that if the k value is getting higher, 
then it is likely the test data correctly classified the higher it will be, but the category of nearest neighbor that used is 
not yet same as the category you are looking for, thus causing the counting result opportunities are fickle.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
 
In this paper we present a framework for text classification based on ImpkNN algorithm and the TF-IDF method.  
Classification using the ImpkNN and TF-IDF algorithm can result in better of sentiment analysis. Testing with 
confusion matrix produces a value 66.00% of accuracy, 73.86% of  precision, 85.53% of recall, and 79.27% of F-
measure.  
 
Tests carried out with different input k values resulted in different accuracy percentage values, for k = 2 of 
74.00%, for k = 5 of 79.00%, for k = 10 of 83.00%, for k = 15 of 83.00%, for k = 20 of 84.00%, with highest 
accuracy with a value of k = 20. Based on the results of testing and analysis that has been done, it can be taken

1. Introduction 
Research and Community Service Institute is an implementation of the tri dharma component of higher education 
which is the main task of the lecturer. For lecturers, research and community service cannot be avoided because it is 
a necessity that must be carried out as well as teaching. Research and community service have enormous benefits for 
students, lecturers, institutions, as well as the nation and state. The benefit obtained by students is knowledge that is 
always up to date(Sadia et al., 2016). For research lecturers, community service is one of the elements for the 
promotion of lecturers' academic positions, up-to-date knowledge and learning materials that are always up to date 
according to the times. Another benefit for the institution is to increase accreditation, improve the quality of 
Lecturer, Student Resources so that pensioners and students can produce students who can be immediately accepted 
in the community. Meanwhile, the benefits for the nation and state are that the results of research are expected to 
become a reference for determining the direction and policy of national and state development, as well as the benefits 
of community service, one of which is to find out the public response regarding policy making (Healey, 2005). 
Pakuan University Research and Community Service Institute, hereinafter known as LPPM Pakuan University, 
is present as the frontline in facilitating and mediating lecturers and students to actively carry out research and 
service in accordance with their scientific disciplines so that they are beneficial to society and the nation. It is an 
effort of Pakuan University in developing research and community service atmosphere and opening opportunities for

Abstract 
 
The presence of students and lecturers in lectures and practicum activities is very important because it is related to 
the ongoing process of lecture activities and practicum itself. In addition, the presence of students will affect the 
achievement of lectures and practicum related to a course, as well as the presence of lecturers. The presence of 
students and lecturers in lectures and practicum activities serves as a form of evaluation of a course that students 
participate in and are taught by the lecturer. This makes the presence of students and lecturers very important in the 
implementation of these lectures and practicums. Therefore, a proper attendance monitoring system for students and 
lecturers is needed to facilitate the evaluation process of lecture and practicum activities. In addition, the monitoring 
system also functions as a control system for lecture and practicum activities. With a monitoring system that applies 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as the input medium, it can provide solutions and alternative abscesses so 
that it doesn't take a long time. By implementing RFID, students and lecturers no longer need to sign attendance, but 
simply tap as a sign of attendance.

Introduction 
Monitoring is a way to control an activity, whereas existence is a form of one's presence at a time and place. 
Attendance monitoring means controlling the presence of a person at a time and place. Monitoring attendance is not 
an easy thing to do. Several institutions such as universities have started implementing and developing advanced 
technology in monitoring the attendance of students, lecturers and teaching staff. The presence of students and 
lecturers is related to each other in the continuity of the learning process. If students take a class or practicum but the 
course supervisor is not present, the learning process cannot be carried out, and vice versa. If the learning process 
cannot be carried out properly, then the achievement of a course cannot be achieved. 
Monitoring is defined as a cycle of activities that includes gathering, reviewing, reporting, and taking action 
on information about the process being implemented. In general, monitoring is used to check between performance 
and predetermined targets. Monitoring related to performance management is an integrated process to ensure the 
process goes according to plan. Monitoring can provide information in the form of a process to determine steps for 
continuous improvement. In practice, monitoring is done while a process is in progress. The monitoring system 
review level refers to activities per activity within a section (Thyas 2017). 
Monitoring has two basic related functions, namely compliance monitoring and performance monitoring. 
Compliance monitoring serves to ensure processes are in line with expectations or plans. Meanwhile, performance 
monitoring functions to determine the development of the organization in achieving the expected targets. Monitoring 
results in the form of a process progress report. Output is measured both descriptively and non-descriptively. Output 
monitoring aims to determine the suitability of the ongoing process. Output monitoring is useful for improving the

feature for monthly reports, printed, date and month input to see the recapitulation by month and year. The staff 
access rights in the form of displaying input forms or updating of account data, courses, students, schedules and 
lecturers which are equipped with an add and reset button. Lecture History is a page that displays the results of the 
course history. The presence of students and lecturers who have been confirmed by the committee. The history of 
the course attendance can be seen in Figure 4.

3.2 Attendance model 
This attendance model uses a black project box measuring 148 mm long, 97 mm wide, 50 mm high, which will be 
designed according to existing needs. nodeMCU is stored in the box so that it is neat and well organized, then the 
RFID is also inside but the scanner leads out of the box then the LCD is stored at the top of the box as seen in Figure 
5. 
 
Figure 5. Attendance scanner model 
This system works when the RFID Tag is brought closer to the RFID Reader so that the code reading process 
will occur. Then the data in the form of code will be sent to the NodeMCU ESP 8266 microcontroller. NodeMCU 
ESP 8266 will connect the system to the internet network. If it is connected, the data will be sent to the database and 
then displayed through the website interface. If the card has not been registered it will be sent to the check id table in 
the database, the admin must register the card to the student data, if the card is registered then when tapping the card 
will automatically be sent to the attendance data.

Conclusion  
The Student Attendance Application presents a display in the form of a recapitulation of student and lecturer 
attendance data. Attendance is made by tapping on the RFID reader. Every time a student or lecturer confirms

Abstract 
 
The hotel and resort business is a business that has been very strongly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
decline in occupancy rates encourages entrepreneurs to be able to map business opportunities and business strategies 
that are fast and on target. The main objective of this research is to create a customer cluster model for a hotel and 
resort in Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia. The cluster model is used to map business opportunities and determine 
business strategies. The customer cluster model is carried out using the Hierarchical Clustering method. The 
attributes involved in this study include program, type of transportation, type of package, nationality, age, customer 
classification and visit status. The most optimal number of customer clusters is 3 clusters, with a Davies Bouldin 
Index value of 0.262. Based on the customer cluster model, 3 business opportunities are selected : basic service 
compliment with dinner or yoga, basic service compliment with hiking to village or crater, and basic service 
compliment with body treatment. The business strategies that have been mapped are on-line promotion, remarketing, 
regional marketing, incentives, and customer loyalty programs.

1. Introduction 
Javana Spa & Resort is one of the resorts under PT. Sarana Prima Budaya Raga is located on a secluded mountain 
slope, a two and a half hour drive from Jakarta situated in the cool, refreshing Cangkuang mountains, surrounded by 
rainforest and seven waterfalls as well as views of large and elegant bungalows with beautiful Japanese gardens. The 
programs offered by Havana Spa are A Day Visit, Room Only, Camping Ground, Orientation, Javana Gateway, and 
Grand gateway. However, since the past few years until now, the number of customers at Javana Spa has decreased. 
In 2015, the total number of customers who visited was 2,341 people, in 2016 there were 1556 people, in 2017 the 
customers who visited were 2930 people, in 2018 the customers who visited were 2090 people and in 2019 the 
customers who visited were 506 people. The decline is due to the fact that the resort has not been able to determine a 
suitable and targeted marketing strategy, resulting in a bad economy in the company (Sugraheni, 2019). Therefore, 
for business sustainability, the right resources and formulation of business strategies are needed (Kumar & Reinartz, 
2006). One of the most effective marketing strategies is customer segmentation (Hosseini M & Shabani M. 2015). 
Customer segmentation is a process where consumers of a business entity are divided into several groups according 
to their preferences, characteristics and purchasing behavior (Qian J & Gao C, 2011). Diverse customer 
segmentation has different potential benefits for companies (Payne & Holt, 2001). One method for customer 
segmentation is the Hierarchical method. Hierarchical clustering has been widely used for segmentation purposes 
because of its ability to provide visual results (O. Maimon & L. Rokach, 2005).  
 
Several studies on hierarchical methods have been carried out, including MingHsu F, et al., (2012) regarding 
customer segmentation based on transaction data using the Hierarchy concept. The results of his research show that 
the hierarchical method gives better results than other traditional methods. Anika S, et al. (2017) with research to 
determine the types of people who are, or who might be, visiting each mall using the k-means method and

1803","1. The first evaluation is done by setting the number of 3 clusters in the data as much as 6800 and DBI search is 
carried out on the number of 3,4,5 and 6 clusters. The results show that the smallest DBI is in the 3rd cluster 
with a value of 0.262. The smaller the DBI value, the better the cluster evaluation results 
2. The second evaluation conducted an interview with Javana Spa & Resort and the results obtained were as 
desired. 
3. In determining a good business opportunity, we need to pay attention to where the opportunity lies from the 
results of research conducted that the largest group is customers who buy packages per-1 day which in practice 
need to be improved in the service sector, providing promo-pomo interesting, make advertisements in social 
media, and others so that customer interest in the resort increases and can also stay longer. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
Based on the research that has been done, it is found that the Hierarchichal method can be used as an option in 
solving customer clustering problems, namely at Javana Spa & Resort. The results of the analysis were obtained 
using 3 clusters and the number of customers was 6800, namely cluster 0 contains 6272 customers, cluster 1 
contains 348 customers, cluster 2 contains 180 customers. Cluster 0 is the dominant customer who chooses A day 
Way, A day Visit, Camping, Family Program, Meeting, Room Only and Tent Only programs. With a vulnerable 
package of Rp. 450,000 to Rp. 1,100,000. Cluster 1 is the dominant customer who buys the orientation program, 
which is a 1-day stay program with dining and spa facilities with a package of Rp. 1,700,000 to Rp. 2,500,000. 
Cluster 2 is the customer who predominantly buys the Javana Gateway and Javana Gateway packages, namely a 
several-day stay program with dining and treatment facilities and can be freely chosen with a package of Rp. 
1.700.000 - Rp. 3,700,000. Based on the results of the cluster, it can be used as a reference in determining business 
opportunities by improving marketing and service strategies and evaluating other programs so that customers are 
interested in staying longer at the resort in order to compete with existing resorts. The strategy used for C1 will be 
given a compliment, namely light Spa treatment or dinner or yoga, C2 will be given a compliement, namely hiking 
to vilage or crater and C3 will be given a compliment body treatment. Evaluation was carried out using the Davies 
Bouldin Index which obtained a value of 0.262 with 3 clusters, the smaller the DBI value, the better the results of 
the cluster evaluation.

Abstract 
Indonesian National Health Insurance (JKN) which held by Indonesian BPJS health insurance has been 
implemented by January 1st 2014. JKN was held through Social Healthcare Asurance mechanism (Mandatory) by 
law No. 14 in 2004 about National Social Guarantee Systems. The purpose is to cover all Indonesian people in 
Insurance Systems. JKN application is a transformation of BPJS health Insurance administrative digital model 
business that turns into an application that can be used everywhere and everytime. This JKN mobile application has 
been implemented for two years, but it does not effective yet.  This research focus on measuring target of participant 
constraints, also the effectiveness of JKN mobile application target.  According to seven main contraints, there are 
five constraints that impactful on informal sector of the membership BPJS health insurance programme: 1. Where 
the participants receive information; 2. Programme socialization; 3. Dues; 4. Health service facilities and 
infrastructure; 5. Availability of medicine. Also there are two contraints (program implementation; the need of 
joining BPJS health insurance program) considered to have the same meaning with the five constraints above. The 
final decision tree pattern shows the good results, it is proven of 84% of accuracy.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, the double life insurance premium stipulated with the combined status of last survivor and join life 
involving two insurance participants who have a kinship such as husband and wife, brother and sister, for which 
they work in the same institution. In determining the policy to be made by the life insurance party does not require 
two policies to be made, but only has one policy. So by having one policy it is expected that the premium paid by 
life insurance participants to the life insurance company will be smaller than if they had to pay in two policies. 
Determination of the bilingual life insurance premium that participants will pay to the insurer based on the chance of 
death of the two life insurance participants, stating a condition that will remain for at least one surviving member 
and will cease after the death of the last person of its members (all its members die), and is also a condition that lasts 
as long as all members of the combined several people can survive and will cease after one of its members first dies. 
To determine a single premium and an annual premium using the cash value of an early life annuity from dual-use 
life insurance. Meanwhile, the cash value of the initial living annuity was influenced by interest rates and discounted 
vaktor and also affected the combined life chances of the two insurance participants. Furthermore, prospective 
premium reserves are obtained by determining a single premium and an annual premium. In formulating the chances 
of dying insurance participants used the distribution of Gompertz, which in this distribution there are constants used 
to determine life chances and chances of dying.

1. Introduction 
 
The old days led to an inability to earn income and resulted in economic hardship for the workers themselves and 
their families. One of the efforts to anticipate the risks of the old days is to include each worker in a life insurance 
program. Where life insurance is an insurance that provides payment of a certain amount of money for the death of 
the insured to the heir or the person who is entitled to receive it in accordance with the provisions and agreements 
that have been approved by the insured in the life insurance policy. Married couples working at the same agency 
make it possible to take out one insurance program with the same policy to facilitate premium payments and sum-
insured payments (Sukono et al., 2017; Sidi et al., 2018).

year assuming Gompertz with the following cases: 
1. Both participants live insurance

Conclusion 
The last survivor's life insurance coverage is paid to the heir until the last death of the insurance participant.. The 
cash value of annuities for life insurance for the last survivor is influenced by discounted factor and life chances of 
insurance participants. Using Gompertz mortality acceleration, reserves increased until the last death of the 
insurance participant in the case of the last survivor. So for married couples working in the same agency it would be 
better to use last survivor insurance.

Abstract  
 
Natural disasters that occur experience a significant increase every year. Likewise, the risk of natural disasters that 
occurs continues to increase. The increase that occurred was in the form of casualties and losses due to natural 
disasters. Thus, a new alternative policy is needed as a mitigation effort to minimize the risk of disasters that occur. 
In this study, it aims to determine the alternative and efficient natural disaster management insurance scheme. The 
method used in natural disaster mitigation and insurance schemes is the Systematic Literature Review. Based on the 
research results, alternative natural disaster management requires synergy between the government and the 
community. So that it can form a disaster mitigation group that is responsive, active and resilient in implementing 
policies to anticipate natural disasters. Meanwhile, the disaster insurance scheme uses a cross-subsidy system and the 
premium is charged to the local government. Where, provinces with low economic growth while the potential for 
natural disasters are high can be helped and receive subsidies from provinces with high economic growth but low 
potential for natural disasters. So that areas with low economic growth while the potential for natural disasters are 
high, no longer need to be burdened with huge natural disaster insurance premiums. 
 
Keywords: Natural disasters, casualties, losses, mitigation, insurance schemes. 
 
1. Introduction 
Natural disasters are a problem faced by every country in the world. Indonesia is a country that is prone to natural 
disasters. This is because Indonesia is located at the confluence of three continental plates. The three plates are the 
Pacific, Eurasian, and Indo-Australian plates (Pramono, et al., 2020). The meeting of these three plates has plunged 
Indonesia's territory into the Pacific ring of fire which can cause a devastating earthquake and tsunami. Natural 
disasters that occur in Indonesia can be in the form of floods, landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, tornadoes and 
volcanic eruptions (Pratama and Sumitra, 2020). Looking at the events and experiences of natural disasters that have 
occurred, the disaster management that has occurred for several years has been less effective. This is evidenced by 
data on cases of natural disasters that have occurred in Indonesia which continues to increase (BNPB, 2020). The

Abstract  
 
The Pandemic-Covid 19 that begin in early of 2020 has caused economic growth to slow down in many sectors 
which in turn, lead to the increasing of unemployment. The outbreak is reshaping the industry in real-time, thus it 
has been forcing all the industries especially Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to be able to better utilize digital 
platform or e-commerce for their business in order to sustain. Previous study has indicated that SMEs E-Commerce 
Adoption Level before pandemic occurred were in the stage 2 (E-interactivity) and predominantly being influenced 
by Technological Innovation Factors. This study attempts to reconfirm the consistency of result from the previous 
study in a new pandemic situation. Assessing the quantitative data drawn from 60 SMEs in Bogor, this research has 
shown a decline of e-commerce adoption level to be in the stage-1 (E-Window) and largely affected by 
Organizational Factors.  
 
Keywords  
E-Commerce, Entrepreneurship, Management, SMEs and Organizational Behavior 
 
1. Introduction 
On the industrial 4.0 era, many businesses have sprung up and made public more aware for opportunities in starting 
a business, particularly to establish SMEs. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have a strategic role in the 
Indonesian economy because this sector gives impact to the national economic growth, labour’s absorption and 
distribution of development results. Currently SMEs are one way to a sustainable economy, which is one of the 
national developments of 2015-2019. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations or better known as ASEAN, is an 
organization that pays attention to increase economic growth that will make the flow of goods smoother, due to the 
tax barriers that no longer exists (Dwipriyoko et al., 2019). That point makes SMEs are expected to compete in an 
increasingly competitive market and free trade ASEAN region. One of the way to do that, is by using digitization 
business. Of all the digitalization business, E-commerce is one of SMEs increasingly use nowadays.  Previous 
studies of  E-commerce found that this part of digitalization defined as utilize of the internet for various business 
activities to be easier and more practical. Business activities conducted online can include marketing, promotion, 
public relations, transactions, scheduling and delivery of goods as well as still have an innovations of online 
business activities in line with the development of e-commerce technology (Arisandi, 2018) 
The covid-19 pandemic has been began in early 2020. Changing all existing and normal life that have been 
settings in the previous year, this pandemic has an impact on all existing lines. Indonesia announced the pandemic in 
mid-March followed by the PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restrictions) this program makes all activities are carried out 
at home, and outdoor activities are minimized. Subsequently, this outbreak give a big impact in economic all over 
the world, not to mention Indonesians economic downturns. According to BPS data (BPS, 2020) as many as 6 out of 
10 companies are still operating, indicating that approximately 40% of companies are not operating normally. The

1836","pandemic and happened to increase around 34% compared to other product  (Accenture, 2020) Meanwhile, the 
largest percentage of Industry of SMEs in this study which are culinary and fashion, do not include in the priority 
product buying during pandemic. 
Of all the 22% factors contribution, each factor has different level of t-value that reflects the relationship 
between exogenous and endogenous variables evaluated based on the 2-tailed value (should be more or equal to 
1.96).  As highlighted in the Table 10, Organizational Factor has the value of 1.965 and considered as the only factor 
that surpass 1.96. This indicates Organizational Factor gives the positive significant influence into E-Commerce 
Adoption Level. This is in line with the previous research done by Lim (Lim et al., 2018) who found organization 
readiness factors as the highest factor that contribute to e-commerce adoption level among SMEs in Malaysia. The 
component of Organizational Factor that consists of financial resources, ICT awareness and firm size enabled SMEs 
to easily adapt the pandemic situation as they possess sufficient resources to do the technological adoption.  
On the other hand, Owner Characteristic Factor has the least value which account for 0.073, thus this indicate 
the character of owner did not support the level of e-commerce adoption during pandemic. Relate to the SME's 
owner's demographic profile, since the majority of their education is high school, this also influences their reluctant 
to learn new things, especially e-commerce because of its complexity. Furthermore, the majority of SME owners do 
not feel as they are the owner because the business itself is running by a one-man show without employee or at least 
having only less than five employees. Consequently, they do not have a mindset as a leader in solving the problem 
and taking a risk. This, in turn, discloses to the uncertainty component included in owner’s characteristic. The high 
uncertainty avoidance in Hofstede Cultural expressed the degree to which the members of society feel 
uncomfortable with uncertain and ambiguity. The primary issue here is how SMEs owner deals with the fact that 
pandemic covid-19 is uncertain and unknown for unpredictable time span. This study found that majority of SMEs 
owner chose to avoid uncertainty situation in this pandemic by giving up and discontinuing their business or 
preferring to not adapt to the crisis and remain doing the same way (refusal to change). 
 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Studies 
To be concluded, it is inferred that in this pandemic Covid-19, adoption of e-commerce for SMEs in Bogor were 
influenced positively only by Organizational Factor. The adoption level they were induced is in stage 1 as shown in 
Table 7 in which the highest value in this endogenous variable is Q1.3. Stage 1 or called E-Window reflects a 
company use static websites and one-way communication without any interactivity (Alrousan. Mohammad Kasem 
and Jones, 2016) This result shows a significant difference to the previous research done by Lolita et al (2019) who 
revealed the level of e-commerce adoption in SME’s Bogor before pandemic is in stage 2 with the highest factors 
contributed is Technological Innovation. There is a decline in adopting e-commerce before and after pandemic 
Covid-19 from stage 2 into stage 1. In terms of research contribution, the research might serve as a portrait of SMEs 
adoption level towards e-commerce during pandemic Covid-19. SMEs should begin to adapt the current pandemic 
situation by learning to implement new technologies. Other solution might be to change the business model to sell 
the higher demand product. As suggestion for government, free online learning should be provided to facilitate 
SMEs in adapting and adopting e-commerce. Moreover, government can establish a market place specialized for 
SMEs to sell their product along with providing business capital loan with lower-interest. These ways will prepare 
SMEs to compete in this pandemic covid-19 and hereafter.  
The main limitation of this study corresponds to the research area which only focused in Bogor with a very 
limited sample amount, which is only 61 from around 23.706 population. Thus, the sample may be biased because it 
is not sufficiently representing the population. Larger samples are recommended to yield more accurate finding. 
Besides that, further research using qualitative method might be more effective to gain deeper insights from SMEs 
to explore other factors that affect e-commerce adoption level.

Abstract 
 
The physical form of the drug dictionary has many shortcomings, one of which is thick, impractical and it takes a 
long time to search for the drug terms. This is the motivation for the development of a drug dictionary application, 
namely the drug e-dictionary. The drug e-dictionary that was developed in 2019 has not been tested for usability. 
Usability testing is very important for applications that have been developed because it is the key to the success and 
requirements of user acceptance of the application. This study aims to test the usability of the drug e-dictionary. The 
usability testing method used is the Retrospective Think-Aloud Method and the USE Questionnaire. The results of 
the first usability test provide some suggestions in the form of adding an autocomplete feature, query suggestion to 
the search function. Also, other suggestions are in the form of a display interface and page functions on the A-Z 
drug index. After making improvements according to the suggestions, the second usability test is carried out. The 
results of the second usability test showed an increase in the usability value from 75% to 86%. This shows that the 
input from respondents from the results of the first test can improve the quality of the drug e-dictionary application 
so that the application can be accepted by users.

Abstract 
 
Earthquake is an unpredictable disaster. It made a lot of damage and loss. Other than that, Indonesia is surrounded 
by three world tectonic plates which makes it more likely to happen. Therefore, we have to be preventive. One of 
solution that can be applied is to insure our assets to the insurance company as earthquake insurance. However, 
insurance company has to calculate premium amount which has to be paid by the clients. The aim of this research is 
to calculate the amount of premium using estimated loss of previous earthquake. This research uses Bayesian 
method to estimate the loss amount which then used to calculate the premium. The result of this research is premium 
which is calculated using two principles, expected value principle and standard deviation principle. Premium that is 
calculated using expected value principle is lower than standard deviation principle. However, the result is not 
absolute since there is still so many factors that are not included or other premium principles.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is a disaster-prone country. This is because Indonesia is surrounded by three tectonic plates in the world, 
namely the Indo-Australian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Pacific Plate. The Indo-Australian Plate collides with 
the Eurasian Plate off the coast of Sumatra, Java, and Nusa Tenggara. Meanwhile, the Pacific Plate is located in 
northern Papua and North Maluku (Madjid, 2018). Around the location of these plates, there is an accumulation of 
energy that collides to a point where the earth's layers are no longer able to withstand the pile of energy, and 
eventually, this energy will be released in the form of an earthquake (Tejakusuma, 2008; Kalfin et al., 2020; Suyudi 
et al., 2017). 
Earthquakes are natural disasters that are difficult to predict. There were several earthquakes recorded in 
Indonesia that caused huge losses, including the 2004 Aceh earthquake with a magnitude of 9.4 on the Richter 
Scale/Skala Richter (SR), the 2006 Pangandaran earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 SR, and the 2009 West 
Sumatra earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 SR, the 2018 Lombok earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 SR, and the

From Table 3, it can be seen that the losses will be greater if and only if the chance of damage is small. This 
means that the relationship between the chance of damage and loss is inversely proportional. Furthermore, the 
premium value is calculated using the expectation value principle and the standard deviation principle based on the 
losses in Table 3. The premium value is presented in Table 4.

Based on Table 5, it can be seen that the insurance premium value with the expectation principle is smaller 
than the premium value calculated using the standard deviation principle. This makes it easier for the insured party, 
but the insurer needs to review whether the premium value with this expectation principle is also beneficial for his 
party or even the principle of standard deviation is more mutual. Therefore, it is necessary to recalculate the various 
factors so that neither party is disadvantaged. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Based on the assumption, information II on the earthquake loss model is Pareto distribution with the parameter scale 
𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚= 40810 and an unknown shape 𝜃𝜃. The value of the shape parameter 𝜃𝜃 was estimated using the Bayesian 
method and the value of 𝜃𝜃෠= 3.0197 was obtained. The insurance premium in this study is calculated based on the 
estimated loss and chance of damage to the house due to the earthquake. The premium obtained from the principle 
of expected value has a smaller value but it is not necessarily beneficial for both parties. Therefore, it is necessary to 
re-examine the premium which is more effectively used for earthquake insurance by taking into account other 
factors.

Abstract  
 
Covid-19 pandemic has made a major change in economic activities of small enterprises especially for local shoes 
manufacturers in Indonesia. The changing sales mechanism from purchase order to online sales has significantly 
decreased their income. The pattern of online demand is probabilistic in nature. It needs a dynamic model to manage 
inventory level. This research is aimed to build a simulation model in inventory management for local shoes 
manufacturer using Monte Carlo simulation to find an inventory policy that provide lower total cost. simulation.  We 
use spreadsheet to construct the simulation model and observes 20 period of sales demand. We also calculate 
carrying cost, ordering cost, and stock out cost of raw materials, then we run 500 simulations. The objective function 
of simulation process is to minimize total cost of inventory. By changing the order quantity ranging from 20 to 700 
units, the lowest inventory cost is reached when the order quantity is 100 meters when lead time is 1-2 days. The 
inventory cost has a u-shaped curve where the cost is high when the order quantity is below 100 meters and 
increases when the order quantity is above 100 meters. The simulation modelling inventory management provides 
useful tool in analyzing an order policy which minimizes inventory cost when the nature of demand is probabilistic.

1. Introduction  
Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way of business for local shoes manufacturers. Purchase order in large 
quantities are no longer available for due to lockdown in every aspect of activity including retail business sector. 
Sales mechanism of local shoes business has changed to online sales where demand is uncertain. Demand and lead 
time are not known with certainty in real business condition. According to (Taha, 2017), deterministic and constant 
in demand pattern is the least likely to occur in practice. Stochastic model provides effective solution when demand 
is subject to uncertainty (Deyi & Xiaoqian, 2017) and the most used optimization techniques for decision making 
under uncertainty (Soshko, 2011). Simulation is useful when demand and lead time are probabilistic (Render et al, 
2018). Uncertain nature of demand in real business practice requires more complex analytical tool. Inventory is a 
complex problem that it is impossible to use the same mathematical model to fit all situations. Simulation is the 
alternative tool of modelling the situation (Taha, 2017). (Soshko, 2010) mentioned that simulation allows to test the 
effect of varying scenarios to select the best output performance.

1856","6. Conclusion  
Uncertainty in demand is a common nature in business practice. It requires a more complex model in inventory 
model to provide an effective decision making. Spreadsheet simulation model provide a useful information to 
estimate order quantity with minimum total inventory cost. The simulation model suggest that lead time has 
considerable effect on total inventory cost. Longer lead time would cause higher total inventory cost due to higher 
stockout cost. The difference of total minimum cost in terms of lead time is significant.

Abstract 
 
Learning difficulties experienced by students are basically a reflection of their learning efforts. In general, the less 
learning effort you have, the greater the learning difficulties you will experience. Many factors affect learning 
difficulties, including interests, motivation, parental support, parental income levels, and so on. This paper aims to 
analyze the difficulties in learning mathematics among students in Bandung. Factors that are thought to influence 
mathematics learning difficulties include interest, motivation, parental support, parents' income levels, and the 
number of dependent children of the parents. The population in this study is students from various universities in the 
city of Bandung. Data were collected by random sampling techniques, using a questionnaire to 100 respondents. The 
data analysis technique used descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis. The results of 
inferential statistical analysis show that interest (X1), learning motivation (X2), parental support (X3), parents' 
income level (X4), and the number of dependent children (X5) together have an effect on mathematics learning 
difficulties. student (Y) in the city of Bandung, which is indicated by the F-count value of 11.275 is greater than the 
F-statistic value of 2.30. The pattern of influence between these six variables is expressed by the multiple regression 
equation.

1. Introduction 
Mathematics is the study of quantity, structure, space and change. Mathematicians assemble and use various 
patterns, then use them to formulate new conjectures, and construct truth through a method of rigorous deduction 
derived from axioms and corresponding definitions (Frieder et al., 2014; Juan et al., 2018). There is a debate 
whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points already exist in the universe, or have they been 
discovered and created by humans. Through the use of logical reasoning and abstraction, mathematics develops 
from counting, calculating, measuring, and systematically examining the shapes and movements of physical objects 
(Knifong et al., 1976; Ken, 1980). Practical mathematics is manifested in human activities since written records 
exist. Rigorous mathematical arguments first appear in Greek mathematics, especially in the work of Euclid. The 
importance of learning mathematics cannot be separated from its role in various aspects of life. In addition, by 
studying mathematics, a person is accustomed to thinking systematically, scientifically, using logic, critically, and 
can increase his or her creativity (Jenny et al., 2018; McLaren, 2015). Research shows that there are obstacles to

 is rejected, which means that ""the simultaneous estimator of the coefficient parameter of the 
multiple linear regression model is significant"". 
Next is the residual normality assumption test, intended to ensure that the residuals follow a normal 
distribution. Testing is done by referring to equations (14) and (15). Based on the test results using SPSS version 
17.0 software, it shows that the residual ε ~N(0.00003, 5.0624). 
 
The next step is to measure the strength of the correlation between the predictor variables and the response 
variables. This measurement can be done based on the magnitude of the 
2
R
 statistical value, which can be 
calculated using equation (16). In this study, the linear regression equation estimator resulted from

), and the number of dependents of children from parents (

correlations very strong with the response variable Y . It also means that the predictor variables are 0.8987691 
which can explain the response variable, and 0.1012309 is explained by other variables. Based on the results of the 
estimation analysis presented in Table 1 and referring to equation (6), the multiple linear regression model has the

Kesimpulan 
This paper has identified the factors that affect the learning difficulty of students in the city of Bandung. Based on 
the data and research findings on the factors that cause learning difficulties experienced by students in constructivist 
learning mathematics courses in the city of Bandung, it can be concluded that the factors include: student interest 
(
1
X ), student motivation (
2
X
), parental support (
3
X ), The level of parents' income (
4
X
), and the number of 
dependents of the parents (

This effect can also be explained by a very strong correlation with the Y  response variable, namely 0.8987691, and 
0.1012309 explained by other unknown variables..

Abstract 
 
Stocks as an investment product in the capital market have risks. Therefore, investors must consider the return 
(yield) and the risk of an investment product. This research uses one of the methods of the Extreme Value Theory 
(EVT), namely Peaks Over Threshold (POT) with the aim of estimating the value of risk in the General Insurance 
company for the period 2016-2020. One method that can be used to measure the level of risk in stocks is the 
calculation of Value. at Risk (VaR). There are several calculation phases in this research, namely, the first is by 
calculating the return value based on the daily closing stock price of each company then doing descriptive statistical 
analysis and QQ-Plot to identify the characteristics of the stock return data. Next, determine the threshold value to 
obtain extreme data and perform data suitability tests with Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). Then, estimate 
the parameters using the maximum likelihood method to calculate the VaR value. Based on the research results, the 
smallest VaR value with a 99% confidence level is in the range of 4.94% to 5.70%.

1. Introduction 
Investment is an effort to place a number of funds at present in the hope of obtaining future benefits. Stock is one of 
the investment products that many investors choose, because it is able to provide an attractive rate of return. 
However, as an investment product in the capital market, of course there is a risk, which must be considered by 
investors between the return (yield) and the risk of several investment products available in the capital market 
(Bermudez et al, 2010). How many things to consider in investing include (1) the expected rate of return, (2) the 
level of risk given (rate of risk), and (3) the availability of funds to be invested (Coles, 2001). Thus, estimating the 
risks that will be faced is necessary so that readiness arises in facing risks. To measure the level of risk in financial 
markets, the Value at Risk (VaR) method can be used, which is part of risk management. Investors can use the VaR 
value as a measure to determine how much the risk target is. Currently, the application of the VaR method is widely 
applied and is considered a standard method of measuring risk. VaR can be defined as the estimated maximum loss 
that will be obtained during a certain period of time under normal market conditions at a certain level of confidence 
(Jorion, 2001; Sukono et al., 2018).  
In risk management, incorrect assumptions about the distribution of security returns are often made. For example, 
practitioners often assume that financial returns are normally distributed, even though this assumption is very 
doubtful because most financial returns have a heavy tail compared to normal tail, which is the tendency for 
indications of extreme events compared to normal distribution modeling (Omer et. al, 2011).  
One of the risk measurement methods that can detect the existence of extreme values that often appear in stock 
return data, namely VaR with the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) approach. EVT pays attention to information on

The result of VaR calculation illustrates the estimated loss value of each company return at each level of confidence. 
The VaR value at the PRU company, for example, is 0.05712269755 means that with a confidence level of 99%, the 
maximum possible loss in the next 1 day is 5.71% of the current asset. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Based on the results of the discussion in the previous chapter, it can be concluded that, seen from the characteristics 
of the return data based on the amount of skewness which is negative and kurtosis that exceeds the normal 
distribution, it indicates that the return data is heavy-tailed, that is, there is an extreme value so that the Extreme 
Value Theory method can be used to VaR calculation. Estimating the risk value using the EVT method by 
identifying the extreme value based on the Peak Over Threshold, the smallest VaR-GPD value is in the AXA 
company at 4.94% while PRU is 5.71% of current assets with a 99% confidence level.

Abstract 
 
The Adomian decomposition method is an iterative method that can be used to solve integral, differential, and 
integrodifferential equations. The differential equations that can be solved by this method can be of integer or 
fractional order, ordinary or partial, with initial or boundary value problems, with variable or constant coefficients, 
linear or nonlinear, homogeneous or nonhomogeneous. This method divides the equation into two forms, namely 
linear and nonlinear, so that it can solve equations without linearization, discretization, perturbation, or other 
restrictive assumptions. The basic concept of this method assumes that the solution can be decomposed into an 
infinite series. In particular, this method decomposes the nonlinear form (if any) of the equation with the Adomian 
polynomial series. This decomposition method can be combined with various integral transform, such as Laplace, 
Sumudu, Elzaki, and Mohand. The main idea of this technique assumes that the solution can be decomposed into an 
infinite series, then applies the integral transform to the differential equation. The main advantage of this technique 
is that the solution can be expressed as an infinite series that converges rapidly to the exact solution. This paper aims 
to combine the Adomian decomposition method with the new integral transform introduced by Kashuri and Fundo 
(2013). A scheme for solving fractional ordinary differential equations using the combined method is presented in 
this paper. 
 
Keywords 
Adomian decomposition method, new integral transform, fractional ordinary differential equation. 
 
1. Introduction 
The Adomian decomposition method was first introduced by George Adomian to solve a system of stochastic 
equations (Adomian, 1980). This method can be an effective procedure to obtain analytical solutions without 
linearization or weak nonlinear assumptions, perturbation, discretization, or restrictive assumptions in stochastic 
cases (Adomian, 1988). The Adomian decomposition method can be used to solve integral, differential, and integral-
differential equations. Differential equations that can be solved by this decomposition method can be of integer or 
fractional order, ordinary or partial, with initial or boundary value problems, with variable or constant coefficients, 
linear or nonlinear, homogeneous or nonhomogeneous. This decomposition method is also able to solve algebraic 
equations, delay differential equations, and equation systems (Duan et al., 2012; Al-awawdah, 2016; Sumiati et al., 
2019). 
 
The basic concept of this method assumes that the solution is decomposed into an infinite series, the nonlinear form 
is decomposed into Adomian polynomials, and an iterative algorithm is constructed to recursively determine the

The Kashuri-Fundo decomposition method is a combination of the Adomian decomposition method and the 
Kashuri-Fundo integral transform. This paper presents a scheme for solving fractional ordinary differential 
equations using the Kashuri-Fundo decomposition method.

Abstract 
The money supply in Indonesia is a problem in the long-term economy and is influenced by many factors. This 
research was conducted with the aim of analyzing the effect of inflation, interest rates, and foreign exchange 
reserves on the money supply in Indonesia. This research uses multiple linear regression analysis method, and 
parameter estimation is done by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. The analysis was carried out using 
secondary data, in the form of time series data from the Indonesian money supply, inflation rates, interest rates, and 
foreign exchange reserves. The data is obtained from Bank Indonesia (BI), the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) 
and other relevant sources. The results showed that the foreign exchange reserve, interest rate, and exchange rate 
variables simultaneously had a positive and significant effect on the money supply with probability values of 0.0048 
and 0.0000. Meanwhile, the inflation rate variable does not have a significant effect on the money supply in 
Indonesia with a probability value of 0.0645.

1. Introduction 
In general, the money supply is considered to be directly determinable by the monetary authority without 
questioning the relationship with core money, which consists of currency plus reserves held by commercial banks. 
This behavior is based on the analysis of determining the money supply mechanically, where the money supply is 
linked to the core money via a multiplier. The amount of the multiplier is determined by banking reserves and the 
ratio between currency and demand deposits (Januaviani et al., 2019; 2020). The circulation of money in society can 
be influenced by several factors, including (1) high demand for money causes the flow of money to society to flow 
rapidly; (2) if the economy urgently needs more money in circulation to carry out trade transactions, the Central 
Bank will increase the amount of money circulating in the community by providing loans or credits; (3) government 
policies that regulate the rate of growth and circulation of money in a country. The main macroeconomic variables 
that are regulated by the monetary policy are inflation and unemployment (Shirvani & Bayram, 2013). The methods

This study is intended to examine the influence of the foreign exchange reserves (𝑋𝑋1), Bank Indonesia certificate 
interest rates (𝑋𝑋2), inflation (𝑋𝑋3), and exchange rates (𝑋𝑋4), which have a very strong correlation with the money 
supply response variable (𝑌𝑌), that occurred in Indonesia in the period 1999 to 2019, using multiple linear regression 
models, and parameter estimation was carried out using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. Based on the 
results of the data analysis that has been carried out, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, the foreign 
exchange reserves (𝑋𝑋1) has a positive and significant effect on the money supply in Indonesia with a coefficient 
value of 25.534012, which means that if GDP increases by 1 rupiah, the money supply increases by 25.534012 
rupiahs. Second, the interest rate (𝑋𝑋2) by Bank Indonesia Certificates/Sertifikat Bank Indonesia (SBI) has a negative 
and significant effect on the money supply in Indonesia. The SBI elasticity coefficient of -8567.7971 shows that if 
the SBI is increased by 1%, the money supply will decrease by -8567.7971 rupiah. Third, the foreign exchange rate 
(𝑋𝑋4) has a positive impact on the money supply in Indonesia. The value of the foreign exchange rate (𝑋𝑋4) elasticity 
coefficient is 107.96988, which means that if the rupiah exchange rate increases it will increase the circulating 
amount of 107.96988 rupiahs.

Abstract 
 
The era of data disruption and the Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 provides an increasingly strong challenge for the 
government to prepare and optimize all its resources so that they are able to compete. Likewise, local governments 
are aggressively making real efforts to meet the challenges of IR 4.0. One of the central government policies that 
continues to be passed down to regional governments is the policy regarding the development of on line one-stop 
services (on line one-stop government), which are integrated through an open government format. Local 
governments of Bogor City and Bogor District are two of the local governments that have implemented on line one-
stop government and open government. The main objective of this research is to conduct a comparative study on the 
implementation of on line one-stop government and open government. The method used is referring to open 
government maturity model (OGMM), and the case study is in the City and District of Bogor, West Java Province, 
Indonesia. The five basic principles of one-stop on line government have been implemented, although they have not 
yet fully succeeded in providing optimal services for the community. The basic principles referred to include 
downsizing, managerial, decentralization, debureaucratization and privatization processes. Bogor City already has a 
one-stop on line service, and the document transaction process until the application status has been well managed. 
Bogor District has completed the one-stop on line service with a video tutorial process, but document transactions 
are still done manually. The development of continuous studies to increase the value of data through the application 
of the Big Data concept to the open government system of Bogor City and District is very potential to be carried out.

1. Introduction 
 
The open government system has been initiated by many countries since fifteen years ago. Developed 
countries such as America, Japan, China implement an open government system in accordance with the culture of 
each country. However, in principle, the role of information and communication technology is very important in the 
development of an open government system. The open government system in each country has different 
characteristics, but all have the same vision, namely to transform government and community relations, through 
participatory and collaborative and managerial paradigms and approaches that are optimal (Veith & Huntgeburth, 
2014). 
 
The era of data disruption and RI 4.0 has further strengthened governments in various countries to 
implement an open government system. No exception to Indonesia, which has carried out the process of 
implementing an open government system, both at the central and regional governments. The focus of this study is 
on the City and District governments. Bogor, through the one-stop on line service that both of them have. This study 
was conducted through a review of the five basic principles of one-stop on-line services which include downsizing, 
managerial, decentralization, debureaucratization and privatization, which are elaborated through the concepts of: 1) 
life-event metaphor; 2) ethical regulation of society in interacting with the government; 3) systems or media that can 
be used by the public to access available government data or information, participate or collaborate; and 4) 
implementation of a contest, social network, or social vote in the open government process. The purpose of this

once the final choice, because the government has other, more substantive considerations. However, a social vote 
pattern like this is able to encourage citizens to participate and collaboratively provide their knowledge to be 
considered for certain policies. In the Bogor City and District Social Vote practice has never been done. However, 
the more open and transparent the government is, and even inviting citizens to proactively participate and 
collaborate, then the development of knowledge that is managed optimally, especially being able to integrate the 
concepts of Big Data and Data Science, will produce more targeted policy recommendations in accordance with the 
expectations of citizens and stakeholders. One of the social vote activities has been carried out in Indonesia by 
choosing the name of a certain street. The media used is a variety of social media, and this process is only seen as 
decision support. Absolute decisions are not only with the leaders, but in essence decisions are made based on the 
identification and analysis of comprehensive problems, by promoting participatory and collaborative principles. The 
ubiquitous engagement activity on open government can actually be done by optimizing the telematics SMEs in the 
Bogor area (Tosida et al. 2015; Tosida et al. 2017). Indonesia has been strengthened with human resources in the 
field of telematics produced from SMK graduates (Tosida et al. 2019). This can be optimized by local governments 
to work together and collaborate in building sustainable ubiquitous engagement activities using local human 
resources who are competent in telematics (Tosida et al. 2020).

Conclusion 
 
The implementation of an open government system and one-stop on line service system is one of the results of 
the existence and strength of the influence of the era of data disruption and the challenges of RI 4.0. Bogor City and 
District have implemented open government and one-stop on line services. The basic principles of the successful 
implementation of an open government system and one-stop online service have become the foundation for its 
development. Proactive encouragement of citizens through various media and systems that have been facilitated by 
the City and District Governments. Bogor has been able to improve the function and quality of the system. The one-
stop on line service system in Bogor Regency has been given a very popular name, namely OPTIMIS, equipped 
with a video tutorial system. This condition has increased the optimization of the system. OPTIMIS which is 
equipped with various social media to support activities and even online mass media also strengthens the foundation 
of the system. SiBadra and Laras are a form of the seriousness of the City and District Government of Bogor in 
realizing open government. The system built is managed in such a way as to become a personal system according to 
the perspective of the citizens. Through this system, the life-event metaphor becomes the strength of an open 
government. Strengthening the regulation of one-stop on line services, enabling this activity to accumulate 
knowledge based on participation and collaboration. Contests, social networks and social vote activities are one 
solution to various problems.

Abstract 
 
Covid-19 is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is a type of coronavirus. Since its appearance at 
the end of 2019, until 2 August 2020, there have been more than 17.7 million infected people worldwide. During 
that time, various studies appeared to study the Covid-19 pandemic. One of them was research on the 
development of the number of Covid-19 cases. One of the many datasets used to study the development of 
Covid-19 cases is data from the ""COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and 
Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University"". The purpose of this study is to analyze the quality of the data 
and detect errors that occur in the data so that researchers who will use it know the quality of the data before 
using them. This study uses a statistical quality control approach. The methods used in this study are acceptance 
sampling and control charts. 30% of the data will be issued using a control chart and investigated for any 
possible errors. After that, the data is corrected according to the error that occurred. This process is repeated until 
there are no more errors in the data. After several iterations, we found errors in the Covid-19 data in this study. 
The errors found are data input errors, decreasing value, confirm data is less than recover, confirm data is less 
than death, zero confirm on the first date, not zero recovers on the first date, and not zero death on the first date. 
It is recommended for those who will use the data from this source to check and correct them first before using 
them.

1. Introduction 
Covid-19 is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is a type of coronavirus. Since its appearance 
on December 17 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, until August 2, 2020, there have been more than 17.7 
million people in the world who have been infected, with a death toll of more than 682,000. This disease is 
spread in 188 countries in the world, making it a world pandemic (Wikipedia, 2020) . Indonesia is one of the 
countries currently being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 was confirmed to have appeared for the first 
time in Indonesia on March 2, 2020. At that time there were two people who were infected with Covid-19 due to

after leaving Indonesia and arriving in Malaysia (J.Akbar, 2020). 
 
Since the beginning of the emergence of the development of the number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, 
it has continued to increase, until August 1, 2020, there have been 109,936 people infected by COVID-19

Abstract 
Many researches about the power of the hypothesis testing (one-side test) on parameter shape of 
some distributions have been studied by a lot of authors, such as Pratikno et al. (2017, 2019, 2020) 
and Pratikno (2012). Here, some of them (the powers) are used with non-sample prior information 
(NSPI) to improve the parameter estimation of the population. In this research, we then studied 
the power of hypothesis testing on one-side test of the parameter shape on of Binomial (discrete) 
and Gamma (continuous) distributions. To do this, we first derived the rejection area using 
uniformly most powerful test (UMPT) to find the formula of the Power. The R-code is then used 
to figure and graphically analysis of the graphs. The result showed that the curves are depended 
on the parameter shape, sample size (small n), and 
0
κ .

1. Introduction 
In the hypothesis testing, we have a probability error type I ( )
α , a probability error type II( )
β  and a power.  
Later, power has significantly contributed to draw the improving population parameter. The power is then defined 
as a probability to reject

(Wackerly, et al., 2008). We then noted that one of the statistical techniques to investigate the population inference, 
namely power and size. Here, we noted that the power and size now begin to be used to conclude the population 
inference, especially in parameter testing. Following Wackerly, et al. (2008) and Casella and Berger (2002), we the 
got the more detail of the definition of the power and size, that are, power is the probability to reject H0 under H1 
and the size is the probability to reject H0 under H0.  
Many authors already studied the improving inference population using power and size such as Pratikno et al. 
(2017, 2019, 2020), Pratikno (2012), Khan and Pratikno (2013), Khan (2003), Khan and Saleh (1995), Khan and 
Hoque (2003), Saleh (2006), Yunus (2010), and Yunus and Khan (2007). Here, Pratikno [2012], Khan and Pratikno 
[2013] and Khan [2003] studied about a testing intercept using non-sample prior information (NSPI). Moreover, 
Pratikno [2012] and Khan et al. [2016] used the power ans size to compute the cdf of the bivariate noncentral F 
(BNCF) distribution of the pre-test test (PTT) with NSPI in some regression models. The computational of the 
probability integral of the probability distribution function (pdf) and cdf of the BNCF distribution are very 
complicated and hard, so the R code is used.  
In the context of the power on the distribution, Pratikno et al. (2017, 2019, 2020), are already presented the 
formula and value of the power on discrete and continuous distributions. Here, we then focused to analysis

From Figure 2 (a) and (b), we see that all the curves are influenced by n and 
0
κ . The highest curve is occurred 
on large n and small 
0
κ (see both Figure 2). we also noted that the curves will be move to the right (more skew to 
the right) for large  
0
κ , and the lower curve is occurred when they have small n.   Generally, all the curve tends to 
be one faster when the parameter shape is small, and they will go to be one on short period of the parameter shape. 
Here, we note that the 1st graph has short period of the parameter shape between 0 to 0.2, but the 2nd graph is around 
0 to 0.4. It is clear that they tend to be smooth (skew to the right) when n and 
0
κ  are increase. We also noted that 
they are faster to one for small n and 
0
κ . Here, we also note that both of the graphs (a) and (b) will be maximum 
on one, and the minimum is zero in small parameter shape. Following the previous research of such as Pratikno 
(2012), Khan and Pratikno (2013), Khan  (2003), Khan and Saleh (1995), we must to choose the maximum power 
(one) as an indicator testing.

Conclusion 
The research studied power and size on Binomial (discrete) and Gamma (continuous) distribution. The rejection 
area is used to find the formula of the power, and the R-code  is then used to figure and graphically analysis. The 
result showed that the influencing factor of the curves of the power are parameters shape and sample size (n) , and 
we also note that all the curve tend to be  more faster  to one for small n and

Abstract 
 
In early 2020, the world was shocked by the spread of new type of coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2), which caused 
respiratory illness called Covid-19. WHO set that Covid-19 is a global pandemic on 11th of March 2020. In 
Indonesia, first positive case of Covid-19 confirmed by the President, Joko Widodo, on 2nd of March 2020. Until 
18th of May 2020, Indonesia had reported 18.010 positive case of Covid-19 with the number of deaths reached 
12.495 peoples. In order to increase the effectivity and efficientcy of handling the Covid-19 pandemic in 
Indonesia, it takes a forecasting model that can predict the number of positive cases weekly accurately. To get an 
accurate forecasting model, it requires sufficient data fitting. The purposes of this  research is to identifying 
which countries that had similar positive case data trend with Indonesia using Tangent Control Chart (t-chart). 
Tangent value can be obtained from the curve of these positive case data trend that can be used as a variable 
which can be monitored using a control chart. So, the t-chart hopefully can be a new innovation to detect a small 
shift from a set of historical data if reviewed from the data trend. The result of analysis using Individual Moving 
Range Chart (I-MR Chart) and t-chart to 183 countries that affected by Covid-19 pandemic, there are 71 
countries that have a positive case data trend similarity with Indonesia. Positive cases data set from 72 countries 
including Indonesia can be used as a data set to perform forecasting model data fitting for predicting positive 
cases of Covid-19. The result of this research can be conveyed to the government to make policy about Covid-19 
pandemic, also for indonesian citizens to increase awareness of the Covid-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction 
In early 2020, the world was shocked by the spread new kind of Corona Virus (Sars-Cov-2) that caused the 
disease in respiratory called Covid-19. Based on the data from World Health Organization (WHO), first case of 
Sars-Cov-2 came from Wuhan, China. This virus are easily moved, so the virus can spread to two hundred 
countries in the world. WHO finally sets that Covid-19 is a global pandemic in 11th of march, 2020 (Cabinet 
Secretariat, 2020). 
In Indonesia itself, the first case of Covid-19 confirmed by the President, Joko Widodo, in 2nd of March, 
2020. Until the 18th of May, 2020, 18.010 in positive cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Indonesia, with a 
total death of 12.495 people (Beritasatu, 2020).  
To cut the chain of spreading Covid-19, The central government instructs the existence of a policy of 
physical distancing and Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar (Large-Scale Social Restrictions). The policy to 
reduce human contact is carried out because it has been confirmed that Covid-19 are spread through respiratory 
droplets released by someone suffering from the disease. However, it should also be noted that there are cases 
where people with Covid-19 have no symptoms at all (Beritasatu, 2020).

Abstract 
 
This article discusses the characteristics of  alpha-cut on fuzzy graph. Alpha-cut on fuzzy graph was introduced by 
Munoz (2005) for vertex coloring on fuzzy graph with crips vertices. It was continued by Arindam Dey, et all (2013) 
for the fuzzy set of vertices and edges. Alpha-cut on fuzzy graph is crips graphs Gα that are induced from fuzzy 
graph by removing all vertex and edges in fuzzy graphs that have a degree of membership less than α, α∈[0,1]. 
Therefore, the caracteristics of alpha-cut on  fuzzy graph  is related to the crips graph produced. Furthermorer alpha 
cut on fuzzy graph will produce many ways of scheduling. 
 
Key words:  
Alpha-cut, fuzzy graph, degree of membership, crips graph, scheduling 
 
1. Introduction 
Fuzzy graphs were introduced by Azriel Rosenfeld in his book entitled Fuzzy Graph (1975). The theoretical concept 
of fuzzy graph  is based on fuzzy logic in fuzzy sets introduced by Zadeh L. A. (1965). Since the introduction of 
fuzzy graphs, many studies in classical graphs have been generalized into fuzzy graphs. One of the generalized 
studies is the vertex coloring. The problem of vertex coloring on a graph is a problem of  finding the smallest integer 
k ∈ N, so two adjacent vertices have different labels. This smallest number is called as chromatic number. Vertex 
coloring on fuzzy graphs was introduced by Munoz, S., et al (2005). 
 
One of the vertex  coloring concepts on fuzzy graphs introduced by Munoz, S., et al. (2005) is the use of alpha-cut 
on fuzzy graphs based on the definition of aplha-cut on fuzzy sets. The fuzzy graph used in the research of Munoz, 
S., et al. (2005) is a fuzzy graph with a set of crips vertex. Furthermore, Dey, A., et al. (2013) developed a definition 
of alpha-cut on fuzzy graphs for a fuzzy  set of vertex and edge. This article discusses some of the α-cut 
characteristics in fuzzy graphs using definition  from Dey, A., et al (2013) and it is applied on scheduling system. 
 
2. Definitions 
Definition 1. Let V be non empty and finite set. A fuzzy graph GF is a pair of functions (σ, µ) with σ is the fuzzy set 
on V and µ is a symmetric fuzzy relation on σ, in such a way that: 
i.  σ: V → [0, 1]  
ii. µ : V × V → [0,1]  that fulfil

Furthermore, σ it is called the set of fuzzy vertices and µ is called the set of fuzzy edges. A fuzzy graph with a set of 
fuzzy vertices and a set of fuzzy edges is then denoted by GF = (σ, µ).  The notation σ(vi) on a fuzzy graph states the

In Table 3, it can be seen that 58 subjects are divided into 16 groups. Each group is a set of subjects whose lectures 
can be held simultaneously. 
 
5. Conclusion 
α-cut on the fuzzy graph GF = (σ, µ) is the set family of crips graphs Gα = (Vα, Eα). Vertex coloring on a fuzzy graph 
using α-cut can be used to design a fuzzy scheduling system. Vertex coloring algorithm on a fuzzy graph using α-cut 
produces a fuzzy chromatic number that represents the set of several pairs of the number of time intervals in 
scheduling with the value α.

Abstract 
 
The Quality Control (QC) Department of PT. Mitsubishi Krama Yudha Motors and 
Manufacturing (PT. MKM) is responsible for producing products which prioritizes safety, 
function, and government regulations. The QC Department establishes the quality 
characteristics of each components and specifications in the early stage of the production 
process. A stable process and capable of meeting specifications can enhance the quality and 
business development. The process improvement methodologies, like six-sigma, etc., can 
improve the capability of the process. When the process is highly capable with minimum 
variability, sometimes it may not sense to monitor the process using traditional control charts, 
it is unable to detect the non-conforming product. Therefore, modified control chart is needed 
and allow the process mean to vary over a small interval provided the fraction non-
conforming is within a pre-specified value. This study uses the method of adding data period 
to avoid violating the normality distribution assumption. The result shows there are 73 of the 
240 plotted point is outside the modified control limits.

1. Introduction 
PT. Mitsubishi Krama Yudha Motors and Manufacturing (MKM) is one of the companies that engaged in the 
field of manufacturing automotive that produce vehicle components materials. PT. MKM has a vision into a 
company that can survive in a competitive global, manage factories that safe to carry out control QCD (quality, 
cost, delivery), as well as be responsible towards the environment and placing priority primary to gain the trust 
of customers. 
Quality Control (QC) Department of PT. MKM is responsible for producing products in accordance with 
the company's mission, that’s are prioritizing safety, function and government regulations. QC department 
should define the quality characteristics of each component of the vehicle, as well as the specifications on the

Abstract 
This Paper aims to have a comprehensive discussion on identity-based cryptography and aims to have a detail 
explanation on its technical aspect. Moreover, it discusses on how IBC helped in securing the confidentiality and 
authenticity of messages in information technology specifically in military services through the mobile ad hoc network 
(MANET). The paper further talks on the challenges encountered in the utilization of identity-based cryptography in 
the field of telecommunications and information technology and on the development of new techniques that can 
strengthen the security and protection of the messaging system in the area of wireless communication. 
Keywords: ad hoc network, identity-based cryptography, information technology 
 
1. Introduction 
The progressive era of computer systems and telecommunications have call for the pervasive development of 
technology that prioritizes the security, confidentiality and authenticity of information. Hence, the identity-based 
cryptography has been invented and is utilized in the world of telecommunication and information technology. 
Identity-based cryptography is a kind of public-key computerized decoding among openly known string which may 
represent an individual or an organization. The public string utilized may include an electronic mail address, domain 
name or IP address. IBC proficiently manages the keying material and supply an easy way of issuing a pair of key 
applicable to the user ‘s key information.  
 
This technology had been introduced in 1984 by Adi Shamir which was purposively used for the verification of digital 
signatures with the use of public information like the user’s identifiers. Shamir’s identity-based cryptography during 
that time mainly utilized user distinctive features like e-mail address and phone numbers unlike today’s system which 
requires digital certificates for  
 
encryption and authenticity verification Balfe et al (2014). That system is much more user-friendly and provides easier 
access to cryptographers and unprepared users especially that most messages are encrypted for users before it is 
registered and is generated in any computer systems.  
 
Uncomplicated as it was, the IBC of Shamir had not won the interest of the public despite its determination of utilizing 
the existing RSA function for the identity-based encryption scheme. It was only in 2001 when the research and 
development of information technology world focused on identity-based cryptography A. M. Qadir et al (2019).

the network; and d) the possibility of ACM transactions on computational logic.  
 
One great challenge experienced by users of MANET and IBC is the longer time it requires for the processing and 
submission of the public key as well as the encryption signature and identity to the Certificate Authority. Youngblood 
(6) cited also that the process of exchanging and verification of keys and signatures are both time consuming and have 
the higher possibility of having errors especially for those who are not so familiar of how the ad hoc and identity-
based cryptography work. Moreover, Sagheer & Taher (199) Sagheer et al (2014) cited some other limitations and 
challenges encountered in the administration of IBC in ad hoc communications such as lack of preparation, limited 
interoperability, lack of technical competence in the field of communication and in having limitations in the utilization 
of the devices. 
 
Another major predicament experienced in public-key based security system is that there is the need for every public 
key of the users to be available for other users in order to verify its legitimacy. This is a great problem in mobile ad 
hoc network system especially that there are no centralized services and there is no presence of possible network 
partitions (Youngblood, 5). Another issue that must be resolved in the IBC utilization of MANET is the trust 
distribution that occurs during the sharing of the keys and secret codes among node users. A great deal of trust or 
secret for the management of the keys should be observed in distributing the keys internationally or regionally. 
Moreover, the cooperation distribution can also be a cause of inefficiency and susceptibility for the security attacks 
among ad hoc network systems Yu et al (2019). 
 
Aside from securing the safety and confidentiality of the messages through the mobile ad-hoc network, information 
technology experts have also studied on how they could utilize the routing protocol in detecting misbehaving routers. 
They have even utilized mobile agent-based mechanism in detecting intruders. There are even new proposals for 
determining security plan attacks for the ad-hoc networks. Several technician and specialist are working on the success 
of these techniques which can eventually uphold the security and authenticity of the information among MANETS 
especially in the field of military services M. Sharma et al (2019).  
 
The security attacks have been observed to be rampant in the field of information technology in these modern days 
despite the extensive use of identity-based cryptography. These security aggressions have been found out to cause 
trouble and can compromise the validity and confidentiality of the information and messages send through the ad hoc 
network system. Further, information terrorism may alter, release or deny data.  Hence, it is the goal of the experts to 
secure the data. In strengthening the data safety, a security protocol must be established, and this must uphold the 
safety attributes of data such as privacy, accessibility, reliability, legitimacy and no repudiation Balfe et al (2014). 
In order to prevent the case of hacking and intercepting messages, a new scheme that surely preserves the 
communication security is being administered (Youngblood, 6). This is done by having all network operations in trust 
phase among all nodes in a secure environment. During its implementation, every communication device in the ad 
hoc network identifies the sensing node of its neighboring devices and provides them with its public keys. This is 
actually the public key sharing process to the neighboring nodes. When public key transfers are done, each node is 
given certificates of authenticity in an encrypted form. This makes the node secured and free from intruders and 
hackers.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This paper comprehensively tackles the identity-based cryptography and how it is utilized in securing the mobile ad 
hoc networks in the information technology. Though the IBC had proven to be an efficient mechanism in securing 
and keeping safe of confidential information, still it has its limitations that must be addressed properly in order to 
ensure efficiency and proficiency of its functions.  
 
The paper further cited some of the related works and advancement in the area of wireless communication that 
promotes more secured and protected transmission of messages. These new schemes can be utilized as bases for 
administering programs and security plans in the promulgation of confidentiality, availability and authenticity of 
messages.

Abstract  
 
This paper presents simulations to model the performance of two negative pressure, airborne infectious isolation rooms 
(AIIRs). AIIRs are a requirement for the medical management of COVID and other infectious diseases mobilization of 
functional AIIRs have therefore become a health infrastructure priority over the last year. A standard negative pressure 
room with a single fan for extraction, ceiling level supply air and extraction diffusers is compared to a dual extraction 
fan system with variable air control linked to pressure sensors via an IoT controller. Computational Fluid Dynamics 
(CFD) is used to simulate the ventilation performance of both configurations. These results are then compared to results 
from experimental studies on live isolation rooms monitored and controlled via IoT devices. The results indicate that the 
dual extraction configuration with IoT control is more energy efficient and effective at maintaining the required 
negative pressure parameters.

Introduction: 
AIIRs are used to accommodate Infectious patients within a health care facility. AIIRs are designed and constructed with 
the intension of keeping Heath care workers, safe from pathogens and isolating the patient from the rest of the hospital 
community.  An Isolation patient is usually placed in a single bed ward with dedicated facilities. This room is maintained 
under negative pressure to prevent the egress of pathogens into other areas via the airborne route. The alarming spread 
of the covid 19 virus during the early months of 2020 puts hospital infrastructure under tremendous pressure to provide 
safe facilities for health care workers and adequate facilities to accommodate and treat infected patients. Prior to covid 
19 infectious diseases like tuberculosis, MERS as well as SARS prompted innovative responses to construction and 
design of airborne infectious isolation rooms. In a study conducted by Jacob S et al (2019)a number of features are 
identified to effectively isolate a patient under negative pressure. Gammaitoni and Nucci, produced a model of the TB 
infection rate this model illustrated the requirement for an effective ventilation strategy and high ventilation rate for 
infectious isolation rooms. Ventilation guidelines for AIIRs describe the ventilation rates and strategies for ideal isolation 
rooms. The reality is however that many isolation rooms are built as retrofits and design challenges exist in achieving 
the required ventilation rates and required ventilation strategies. At the onset of COVID many governments embarked 
on construction of field hospitals to meet the demand for patients requiring isolation from the general population. COVID 
19 patients were regarded as highly infective and in need of isolation facilities separated from the general hospital 
population. To manage Cost effective solutions with minimal installation times are required to ensure that health facilities 
can meet the needs of patients. In a study conducted by Jacob et al the flow pattern of the inlet an exhaust of an isolation 
room was simulated at various patient positions.  
 
Chow et al developed laser light sheet imaging and analyzing technique (LST) this technique was used to examine airflow 
environments in critical applications. 
Yik et al, 2003 performed simulations on typical isolation layouts. These simulations showed that a net air change rate 
and exhaust flow rate for negative pressure isolation rooms should be at -2,7 air changes and an exhaust flow rate of 12.4 
Air changes. The differential pressure between the room and the lobby should be negative 1.5 Pa. It is also recommended 
that heed should be given to poor construction quality and air leakage.

This simulation evaluated the performance of an airborne infectious isolation rooms using CFD and experimental verification. 
The two scenarios tested a typical constant volume negative pressure isolation room and a dual extraction fan system with 
IOT control and monitoring. Both configurations were tested using numerical methods and then experimentally verified. 
Previous studies have analyzed the locations of the supply and exhaust positions as well as the impact of door motion. This 
study addressed a solution to the impact of door motion. The research has shown that the addition of an additional fan and 
the IOT controller improves the performance of the  AIIR by reducing the spread of the contaminants into adjacent areas and 
eliminated the additional energy consumption and operational effect of an oversized system to compensate for air leakage 
and pressure loss due to door motion.

Abstract 
The operational system is an important thing that needs an organization in large scale industries to small scale like a 
restaurant. It can lead to positive things such as good service quality, standardized food quality, a well-recorded flow 
of food purchases, and other aspects, leading to a high profitability level. In the culinary industry, such as 
restaurants, enhancing the operational system’s quality in industrial 4.0 is always accompanied by a computer-based 
system. There have been many studies on computer-based operational procedures in the culinary industry. Still, 
most of these studies only focus on one and two areas, such as food supply, dining room service, or table ordering, 
so that it is not well integrated. The study we conducted combines the dining room’s service process, making food in 
the kitchen, and the cashier’s payment process becomes an integrated system and is interconnected seamless. An 
integrated approach will facilitate the restaurant in communication, accurate data management, and speed in the 
service process. All processes are computerized and integrated to speed up the current job. The customer assessment 
can be seen in a service rating when making payments, which shows that their satisfaction in restaurant operating 
standards is close to 90% of customers. Systematically, a test is also carried out, which states that the system being 
built can synchronize data between the processes carried out and make the process well organized and fast. Finally, 
our study also suggests that further studies should be carried out by developing this system to be used in multi-
branch restaurants and using cloud-based technology to reach restaurants with minimal funds to invest in 
information technology.

Introduction 
The operational system is a series of activities carried out to produce goods or services. The system is an 
important part needed in an organization, both in large and small scale industries. There are currently many 
industries in the culinary field and are very diverse in food or service. The role of creativity in the culinary industry 
has played a vital role in culinary change and evolution (Lin and Baum 2016). The invention in service generally 
presents a challenge because of the multitude of the action itself’s intangible nature. In an operational restaurant 
system, serving customers’ speed is one of the top priorities in a restaurant (Susanto et al. 2020). When the 
restaurant is crowded with customers, waiters must work quickly to serve customer orders and deliver orders. An 
excellent operational system for customers in restaurants is an efficient service and makes it easier for customers to 
place food orders (Espino 2017). Service quality plays an essential role in making customers happy and forcing 
them to revisit the restaurant, which in the end will increase customer satisfaction index (Aftab et al. 2016). 
Computer-based operational systems will undoubtedly be different from the conventional ones usually 
carried out by a restaurant. The service provided by restaurant employees is more elongate than using a computer-
based operational system. The resources needed when using manual services will be more than those that are 
computer-based. Here are many advantages that can be obtained from using computer-based operating systems, 
including increasing restaurant income (Gavrilova 2017) and minimizing cashier fraud (Documents 2018). The 
benefits obtained from a computer-based operating system are not only for restaurants, but these benefits can also be 
felt by customers, including the speed in serving food (Khan, Hussain, and Yaqoob 2013).

1956","From the table above, each user provides an important note. Restaurant managers like the data visualization 
created, but out of the 8 test scenarios, only 7 passed the test because one function still lacked. When printing reports 
in excel format, there should be a pdf. The waiter finds it easier to do his job and can see the stock is running out. 
Before the system, to find out the menu stock is out, the waiter must first ask the kitchen, but out of 18 test 
scenarios, 15 passed the test because the function in the menu search function if the menu is empty still displays all 
menu. The function of recording when input table numbers can yet be inputted all table numbers even though the 
table has been ordered. It is easier for kitchen staff to see the list of incoming orders. Out of the 10 test scenarios, 8 
passed the test because the notification function did not make a sound. The function of managing the status of food 
availability has no button back to the previous page. The cashier does not need to enter order data, and this reduces 
the queue of payments.

Rate Customer 
We create a small survey to determine the satisfaction of service to customers. A satisfaction score is carried 
out using four aspects of assessment: (1) The service provided is in the dining room, (2) Information displayed on 
the dashboard, (3) Service at payment; and (4) Speed in service. The results of the customer assessment can be seen 
in Table 9.

The table above shows that 27 people rated service at the restaurant after using a computer-based integrated 
operational system. In evaluating the dining room service, the 27 people gave a rate of 3-5 from a maximum rate of 
5. The rate result was considered large because it reached 84.4%. The evaluation aspect of the customer’s 
information on the dashboard produces the highest rate among the other aspect rates. The 27 people give a rate of 4-
5 from a maximum rate of 5 with a rate of 90.4%. The aspect of service assessment when making payments 
produces 82.2%, the same as before, the customer’s rate is 3-5 from the maximum rate of 5, but here the one giving 
rate 3 is more than the one giving rate 4. Our last assessment produces an 85.4% satisfaction rate. All aspects that 
are assessed get a rate above 80% so that, on average, the rate obtained is 85.6%. With the average rate accepted, 
customers can experience good service, get exact information, and speed in service.  
 4.  
Conclusions 
This study can conclude that the system helps in the existing operational processes at the restaurant. This 
system can increase the customer satisfaction index for restaurant services. Also, it can help restaurant managers to 
fix inaccurate data management. Finally, our study also suggests that further studies should be carried out by 
developing this system to be used in multi-branch restaurants and using cloud-based technology to reach restaurants 
with minimal funds to invest in information technology.

Abstract 
 
One of the things that can support the quality of service in a restaurant is the ordering process. The process of ordering 
places and food that is done manually is undoubtedly vulnerable to instability in a restaurant’s quality of service. 
Unfortunately, this is still widely used in restaurants, especially local restaurants, due to the minimal technology 
investment they can afford. Cloud technology is the answer to this problem. Technology Cloud has been widely used, 
such as in financial systems, marketing systems, and clinical reservation systems, all of which target small companies 
so that they can implement the technology at a minimal cost. This study developed a service landscape architecture 
for an online ordering system based on cloud technology that allows small restaurants to implement an online order 
system for their respective businesses. After the analysis process, we get one business process, four business domains, 
12 business functions, and 40 business service functions. Researchers are very confident that this service will become 
a reference in creating a cloud-based platform for food ordering systems at many local restaurants.

1. Introduction 
One of the things that can support the quality of service in a restaurant is the ordering process. However, the 
leading cause of the progress of an industry/organization/restaurant is customer loyalty. People’s desire to get food 
and beverage variants (Abdullah 2017) is a motivating factor for purchasing food. Also, there are factors of price and 
taste (Rahman 2018) (Tjandra et al. 2014). The cuisine is also the reason why people buy food. Because of these 
factors, the culinary business is growing. However, there are many operational problems in the culinary world, one of 
which is redundant data, which results in queues during ordering (Inayati, Hidayatulloh, and Kamisutara 2015) 
(Muhamad Firdaus 2011). Therefore, a system that is capable of handling uncontrolled lines is needed. However, 
using the system will increase the investment cost of software maintenance, which is relatively high. 
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) technology is a software system structure that allows different applications 
to interact with each other, providing the benefits of increasing integration and flexibility, eliminating data 
redundancy, and developing (Asmara, Nur Hasim, and Utama 2020). And the cloud technology that enables this 
system to be used by many restaurants with scalability, performance, security, availability, system monitoring 
requirements reduces software maintenance costs. 
The implementation of this technology is called software as a service (SaaS). SaaS is a cloud computing service 
provider that provides applications in the cloud infrastructure and is ready for consumers’ use. Users can access the 
system with an internet connection (Rahardian, Linawati, and Sudarma 2018) (Tongkaw 2013). 
Software as a service has been; used in various areas such as health(Jatmika, Afwani, and Agitha 2019),(Jamil, 
Khairan, and Fuad 2015) (Bakri 2020), education (Saputra et al. 2018) (Aryotejo et al. 2018), services(Sulaiman and 
Widarma 2017) (Suryawan and Andika 2018) (Subagyo et al. 2013), and provide comprehensive benefits(Rahardian 
et al. 2018). This study implements the existing technology in software as a service, especially in the ordering system. 
This implementation will provide the benefit of minimizing existing queues by using IT technology but without a 
large investment.

This research process was carried out for three months from January 2020 to March 2020, resulting in a service 
landscape consisting of one business area, four business domains, 12 business capabilities, 40 service functions. This 
condition will become the foundation for entrepreneurs in the culinary field to choose their services within an online 
ordering system with integration, equipped with a cloud-based platform architecture with software as a Service service. 
This landscape service can use in various restaurants through government or private initiatives. Some service area 
details still need to be provided, such as database schema and API management schema. Furthermore, researchers also 
expect a transformation that supports customer motivation to place orders online.

Abstract 
Dropshipping is an order fulfillment method that does not need a business to keep products in stock. Dropshipping is 
mostly done in the fashion industry, ready-to-eat food, handicrafts, and so on. Dropshipping makes it easy for beginner 
entrepreneurs to start their business activities without having inventory costs first. The hallmark of drop shipping is 
running its activities online, so the logical consequence is that a well-computerized system is needed. Many previous 
studies have discussed this dropshipping system. Still, most of them limit their case studies to specific products in 
certain areas and do not handle dropshipping business promotion technology. This research produces a mobile-based 
dropshipping system that can be used freely and integrated with other social media platforms to expand the drop 
shipping brand name's promotional reach. An evaluation of the dropshipping system built showed that integration with 
other social media platforms increased the total sales figures of the dropshipping businesses studied, with an average 
of nearly 20% of evaluations carried out over one month. The application of blockchain technology to this system is 
one of the next leading suggestions for improving existing transactions' security.

1. Introduction 
Dropshipping is a useful instrument used to process online orders for retailers (Li, Zhang, & Liu, 2019). The 
agency can save holding, processing, and obsolescence costs for the retailer (Li, Zhang, & Liu, 2019). Although they 
may have their warehouses and distribution centers, many online retailers also benefit from drop-shipping because the 
instrument allows them to expand their product lines considerably without increasing inventory or warehouse costs 
(Li, Zhang, & Liu, 2019). With the development of e-commerce, financial constraints are the main problem for online 
retailers, and limited working capital often constrains online retailers' procurement decisions.  As a new order 
fulfillment method, dropshipping benefits the whole supply chain due to risk-pooling effects when a wholesaler 
supplies multiple retailers (Zeng, Gong, & Xu, 2019). The dropship system, which the perpetrator is often called a 
drop shipper, is an online buying and selling system where running an online business with this system does not 
require capital because running this system does not provide a stock of goods (Deddy Prihadi, 2018). Unlike resellers, 
drop shippers only sell information on these products without buying goods like a reseller. Dropshipping is mostly 
done in the fashion industry, ready-to-eat food, crafts, books, office equipment, and so on. One of the most prominent 
advantages of a drop ship is the lack of capital or even not spending money at all. Still, because the dropship does not 
buy the goods first, the drop shipper does not control the goods, which causes dependence on suppliers. Overriding 
the shortcomings of the dropship is a way to market products with minimal capital (Triyanto, 2017). Online marketing 
is an alternative to expand market share so that the sales process does not only occur in a specific place and time. 
Many large and small companies have used a website-based or mobile sales system. They are utilizing technology to 
expand product marketing.

1974","We also summarized the 30-day sales data on the previous dropship system. Furthermore, we compared them 
with the sales data on the dropship system that has been integrated on social media so that the sales increase will be 
seen in the system that has been built. The previous system had total sales of 90 transactions over the last 30 days. 
After 30 days of implementation, total sales for all categories were 113 transactions in an integrated system. The sales 
figure on a system integrated with social media increased by 20% in 30 days, which means that this dropship system 
can increase sales figures by integrating with the Facebook social media. The visualization can be seen in Figure 3 
below. 
 
Figure 3. Comparison of Sales Integrated System with Social Media and Non-Integrated System 
With the increasing number of sales transactions, sales turnover will also increase, were before using an 
integrated system, sales turnover within 30 days reached Rp. 1.350,000, after implementing an integrated approach, 
the turnover obtained reached Rp. 1.620,000 in the same period. The reason for this increase is the expansion of the 
marketing area. The integrated system is not limited to the dropship system. Using a Facebook page as a promotional 
medium allows potential new customers from Facebook users. 
4. Conclusion 
This study evaluates the system for 30 days. Before the integrated system, the sales turnover is Rp.13,500,000. 
After using the integrated system, social media, Facebook, the turnover achieved in the same period, Rp.16,200,000. 
From the results of the evaluation, there was an increase in sales turnover by 20%. The increase occurred because the 
platform users themselves could only see product promotions in the previous system. After incorporating on the 
Facebook social media, the upgrades carried out can be seen by more people. 
Based on the research conducted, the drop shipper system integrated with social media can increase sales figures 
by creating posts on dropship online stores. Those are directly connected to Facebook social media so that users on 
the dropship system alone can see the latest posts. This research hopes that the integrated system can expand the 
product marketing area compared to the market planned to increase sales figures. The application of blockchain 
technology to this system is one of the next leading suggestions for improving existing transactions' security.

Abstract 
The rapid development of technology in industrial revolution 4.0 made the business competition even 
tighter, especially for primary needs, one of which is the local industry is engaged in fashion. Many fashion 
industries use eCommerce (EC) but have not increased their sales because the primary key to sales is useful 
marketing techniques. Many scientists who research one EC development with SEO but only pay attention to 
rankings do not increase sales. In this study, we implement the SEO method with indexing, crawling, and meta tags 
techniques collaborated with the user interface using the silo structure technique and spoke and hub structure. The 
purpose of doing so is to make customers feel more comfortable browsing the EC web. This research investigates 
the possibility of applying those techniques to the sales in a 6-month mini longitudinal study. We found out that this 
combination has increased the EC monthly income by 4 to 10% each month. It can be concluded that the SEO 
method will be more optimal in collaboration with other techniques such as the silo structure technique and spoke 
and hub structure. Suggestions for further research are collaborating SEO with other social media integration 
methods and location-based services to benefit an EC establishment.

1983","4. Conclusion 
This study, which was carried out for six months, resulted in a relatively good increase in visits, unique visits, 
and scores, even though sprints five and seven experienced a decrease in the number of visits because we 
experimented with the meta keys and descriptions to not correlate to one another. The more SEO techniques used, 
the higher the SEO score obtained, and the more meta keys and definitions used, the more visits that will visit with 
the terms meta key and description made must have a relationship with each other. HCI improvement can convert 
visits to unique visits because, in every sprint, there are always the same visitors returning to the website, and the 
most massive increase in visits occurred on the 8th sprint in August 2020. This increase in visits can occur because 
We have implemented several SEO techniques such as indexing, crawling, and meta tags to optimize crawling. We 
create a file called robots.txt; this file is designed to control or control user agents as google bot in crawling web 
pages. Although the case study was carried out at a clothing shop, this technique can be applied to other cases. For 
example, we can apply this technique to the tourism sector using E-Tourism as a medium to support programs that 
have been determined by the government to attract more tourists. 
HCI is imperative as it plays a significant role in helping the applications we make to stand out more and make 
users feel comfortable and create impressions for users who use them. In this longitudinal study, We have also 
improved the existing HCI by promoting the usability principle. Good HCI has the criteria for user-friendly and high 
usability(Haryoko 2012). User friendly is the ability that software or application programs have that are easy to 
operate and have many other skills to feel at home in managing the program, even for a novice user. At the same 
time, usability is the system’s ability to meet user needs (Handiwidjojo and Ernawati 2016). From the results 
observed by We, it can be concluded that the Steigen store system that has been improved by SEO and HCI can help 
increase the score and ranking of the previously created web. Finally, there is an increase in the number of customer 
loyalty. The increase in customers can be seen from the number of unique visits on each sprint.

Abstract 
Many traveling arrangements can be made online at this time, such as lodging, transportation, and choosing tourist 
attractions. Studies on online tourism systems discuss a lot about booking service systems at hotel reservations, 
transportation reservations, or booking tour tickets. However, most of these studies were carried out only on individual 
processes and were not integrated. This study built a web service for travel package booking that allows travelers to 
book transportation, hotels, and travel tickets in one transaction. The use of API technology combines parameters 
from ordering a travel package, then carrying out a comprehensive calculation. In the end, travelers will get many 
options to combine their travel packages automatically. In this study, the validity of the API was tested. Testing the 
API built resulted in an average time of 2946 ms from 50 trials of API calls by ten different users accessing the system 
simultaneously. We suggest adding API connections with providers of travel location review information so that more 
details will be available in one particular place.

INTRODUCTION 
Web services are software systems designed to support machine-to-machine interactions that operated over a 
network (Chen et al. 2017). The web service has an interface described in a machine-processable format (Paik et al. 
2017). In this modern era, web services have been used in various fields such as e-commerce (Sohaib and Kang 2017), 
online payment (Listyani et al. 2016), and data provider (Perwira and Santosa 2017). Web service is a system built to 
manage data or perform an operation based on the requests. Then the client retrieves the result of the process (Jianxiao 
Liu et al. 2016). We can find this thing in the microservices concept. The advantage of using a web service is that 
application developers do not need to create a difficult function to perform if there is already a web service that can 
do similar work. For example, when a group of developers wants to do a payment module for an application they are 
developing, they can take advantage of a web service that can handle payment transactions such as Midtrans. There 
are two types of web services that are widely used, namely, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST 
(Representational State Transfer) (Rafalimanana et al. 2020). SOAP is an XML based protocol, while REST is an 
architectural based protocol. Also, the SOAP protocol is HTTP and SMTP, and FTP, while REST is HTTP. So far, 
web services are widely used as a backend in microservice systems. It provides the advantages of good system 
modularity, easy maintenance, and good scalability. Thus, web services are used as a system capable of handling 
specific tasks based on client requests so that the software on the client can have a good performance. 
One web service that is widely used is Rest-API (Hu et al. 2017). The Rest-API is very popular because it is 
easy to use, easy to understand, and has better performance (Neumann et al. 2018). Apart from that, the Rest-API also 
allows sending data using a lightweight data format such as JSON (Barbaglia et al. 2016), which allows for easier 
parsing (Jian Liu et al. 2019). The Rest-API uses the HTTP methodology defined by the RFC 2616 protocol, like: 
GET to retrieve resources; PUT to modify resources; POST to create a new resource; and DELETE to delete resources 
(Putra and Putera 2019). To run the Rest-API, the client needs to run a URL that points to a designated method. This 
process is known as a request. Then, the client will receive data. This data is known as a response. One example of its 
use is a weather application that gets data about the weather from a web service via an API.

1996","4. CONCLUSION 
This study aims to complete the integration between hotel booking transactions, transportation bookings, and 
tour ticket bookings, which previously we had to do one by one. Therefore they become integrated so that transactions 
can be made simultaneously as one transaction. We have presented an approach to integrating hotel booking, 
transportation booking, and tour ticket booking using web service technology with REST architecture. Web service 
provides services that can be used by clients based on their needs. It offers an opportunity for the use of web services 
as a tool for integration. By using RESTful web service technology, web services can be accessed easily by clients 
with different platforms to perform certain operations. The solution to this problem is implemented in the user software 
using Rest-API technology. The use of Rest-API technology provides convenience in terms of scalability and 
reusability in software development. 
We tested the validity of the built API. Testing is done by testing API calls. The API call testing conducted 
found that the average time was 2946 ms from 50 trial calls by ten different users accessing the system simultaneously. 
This study created a web service that integrates hotel booking, transportation booking, and tour ticket booking. 
This study answers the gap from previous research. We hope that this study contributes to a more in-depth analysis of 
the REST web service's scalability attributes. For further investigation, we recommend adding API connections with 
the providers of travel location review information so that more details will be available in one particular place.

Abstract 
 
An effective supervisory function must allocate workload efficiently and optimize limited work hours with respect to 
a variety of operational requirements. These requirements often vary and entails a fast and dynamic model to be 
considered effective. Work allocation has typically been accomplished either through manual planning with 
considerations or constraints of very limited complexity, or by deterministic methods; requiring inordinate amounts 
of work hours which are typically incapable of adapting to changes in the environment. The methods and models 
presented here utilize forecasting techniques, analytic hierarchy process, and genetic algorithm (as search heuristic) 
to find a good sufficient allocation solution that can be performed quickly in rapidly changing process environment. 
Improvements introduced in this paper is projected to save 84 hours’ worth of work per month.

1. Introduction 
The finance sector is one of the most heavily regulated industries for the past decades. The instability in the 
financial system can have significant impact to the economy (McLaughlin, et al., 2017). Several sales 
malpractice and scandals prompted a number of legislative actions to mitigate such activities and protect 
consumers from unfair practices (Federal Trade Commission). One of the organizations leading this fight 
is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an independent, nongovernmental organization 
that writes and enforces the rules governing registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. 
Once such rule is the FINRA Rule 3110 that requires firms to establish, maintain and enforce a system to 
supervise their activities and the activities of their associated persons that is reasonably designed to achieve 
compliance with federal securities laws and regulations, as well as FINRA rules (FINRA Rules and 
Guidance). 
 
Internet Presence Monitoring, among other communications and trading activity surveillance, is a 
supervisory measure adopted by some financial institutions to specifically determine if published content 
and other information posted on the internet pertaining to the practice or registered associate conform to 
company policies and guidelines. This was designed to prevent violations that may result to regulatory 
fines and penalties. Enforcement of these rules and regulations usually require a dedicated surveillance and 
control team because it takes time and effort to adapt business practices that follow these new rules and 
regulations correctly. 
 
A key challenge for these surveillance and control teams is a combination of work prioritization and 
allocation given a multitude of constraints surrounding the process. The decision-making gets even more 
complex and dynamic as different parameters change over time. These conditions require planners to 
account for:

2007","4. Discussion 
The current allocation process used prior to this study used a naive associate count as basis to determine unit of work. 
This method does not consider varying degrees of online presence, i.e. number of search hits and URLs related to 
each associate. In addition, each URL had varying amounts of complexity and review time. These were addressed by 
the standardization process that led to identifying 10 URL classifications with corresponding Average Review Per 
Classification (ARPC).  
 
Apart from standardization, URL status changes in between review cycles were also considered and adjustments were 
made to ARPC in the form of probabilities. The resulting adjustments set the standard unit of work. Said status changes 
were initially thought to significantly impact the allocation since a status change from active status to non-active status 
would render average review time from initial ARPC to zero and vice versa.  However, after posterior probabilities 
were computed across all possible status changes and URL classification, only 12% had probabilities greater than 1% 
that are worth considering when making adjustments. The amount of data and effort required to put together these 
numbers is significant, so is suggested to further analysis is needed to determine if the probability adjustment provides 
enough value to the overall allocation process. 
 
To compliment standard unit of work, AHP was used to model “fitness” of an analyst to review a particular URL to 
capture possible efficiency and accuracy gains. The final weights reflected survey respondents’ estimates and were 
used to determine fitness ranking. The decision to aggregate ranking was used due to the convenience in computing 
and lessen complexity in the model. There were considerations to scale the ranking based from the raw scores, however 
it was decided not explore this further to simplify the process. Furthermore, since this was added as a component in 
the objective function, it proportionately added to the GA model runtime. The effectiveness of fitness ranking will be 
measured in the following months and will be basis if it can remain in the model or if adjustments are needed. 
 
The resulting allocation generated by the Genetic algorithm (GA) gained significant improvement as measured in the 
variance between target and actual allocations that took into account all preceding variables, i.e. SUW and FR. First, 
allocation from region level had a 220% improvement from 55 down to 25-unit variance compared to previous 
process. Second, monthly allocation from practice level even had a more significant improvement at 443% from 1,337 
down to 302-unit variance. Finally, a 9-hour direct efficiency gain per month was achieved since it would now only 
require 2 hours to complete the process compared to 11 hours previously. In addition, an estimated indirect efficiency 
gains of 75 hours per month due to the efficiencies resulting from low variance between allocations.  Improvements 
coming from probability adjustment and fitness ranking has yet to be measured but will be tracked to further enhance 
model. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the methodology introduced in the study led to significant improvements in the allocation process and 
is being considered as a framework to approach other processes.  Several analytical tools and techniques were used 
to solve a number of pain points in the allocation process. The following summarizes these and corresponding pain 
points it was able to solve: 
 
• 
Standardization dealt with inaccurate measurement of work; 
• 
Posterior probability dealt with predicting possible changes that could impact work; 
• 
Analytic Hierarchy Process dealt with leveraging existing capacity to increase efficiency and accuracy; 
• 
Net Capacity dealt with estimating how much can be done; and 
• 
Genetic Algorithm (a search heuristic) dealt with automating the process of finding the right 
combination of work and/or allocation variables. 
Other analytical tools may be applied in lieu of any of the tools or techniques listed above to accomplish the same 
goal.

Abstract 
 
This study utilized a Linear Programming (LP) model for the assignment of internal audit staff to different audit 
projects with varying complexities and skill level requirements. Numerous auditor allocation studies proposed models 
that minimized the cost, however, since the internal audit function is not a revenue-generating function, the efficiency 
ratings of each audit staff were used and converted these into regrets ratings which were later on used as factors in 
solving this allocation problem. The Lingo 18.0 software was used to determine the proper allocation of audit staff 
that will maximize the audit efficiency for a mid-sized internal audit department. The results of this study were 
presented to the Director of the internal audit department who plans to use this model to get further insights on whether 
the model will be beneficial in optimizing the audit staff allocation as well as improve the overall quality and efficiency 
of the internal audit function as compared to the current traditional manual allocation process.

1. Introduction 
Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value to and improve 
an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined 
approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes (ISPPIA, 
2017). With the recent advancement in technology, business operations have become more complex, regulations have 
become more rigorous and new risks have emerged. Because of these, coupled by the increasing professionalism of 
the internal audit profession, internal auditors are now under pressure to raise the bar of their audit quality. One of the 
keys to address this issue is the proper allocation of internal audit skills.   
 
The planning stage of internal audit is quite a complex process, hence, this is often handled by the more senior 
members of the internal audit team. This process predetermines the what, how, where, when and by whom the audit 
will be carried out to achieve its goals. In other words, audit planning is an anticipatory function that will ensure timely 
completion of tasks, with the least audit risk, cheapest cost and maximum possible quality and efficiency (Usul & 
Ünal, 2009). In order to do this, internal auditors must determine the appropriate and sufficient level resources to 
achieve the engagement objectives based on evaluation of the nature and complexity of each assignments, time 
constraints and available resources. Appropriate refers to the mix of knowledge, skills, and other competencies needed 
to perform the assignments. Sufficient refers to the quantity of resources needed to accomplish the assignments with 
independence, objectivity and due professional care. Resources are deployed effectively when they are used in a way 
that optimizes the achievement of the approved audit plan (Uyar & Yelgen, 2015) 
 
The allocation of internal audit resources is one of the critical parts that support the audit planning stage. Internal 
auditors spent a great deal of time and effort in this area. After all, improper allocation of resources, can lead to wastage 
of energy and manpower. If a wrong audit staff is allocated to an audit project, he/she can not only bring down the 
productivity but can also prolong the output time and affect the quality of the output. Therefore, it is extremely 
important to allocate the right audit staff to the right audit projects (Das, Verma & Gupta, 2017). Some of the criteria 
used to allocate internal audit staff include but not limited to the following: (i) available hours of each audit staff; (ii) 
estimated hours to complete each audit projects; (iii) complexity and level of risks involved in each audit area; (iv)

2016","4. Discussion 
The findings from this study suggest that an optimal solution in allocating internal audit staff that would maximize 
the audit quality of the internal audit function can be obtained and that efficiency can be achieved by using 
mathematical methods such as LP, in the allocation of internal audit staff. The results are consistent with the approach 
done by Das et al (2017) where they converted each professors’ efficiency ratings into a regret matrix and used this 
as a factor in allocating the professors to different courses with the objective of maximizing the educational quality of 
the department. 
 
In the case of assigning two or more staff to an audit project, this is considered acceptable because in reality, bigger 
audit projects can have two or more audit staff. According to Ulyar and Yelgen (2015), for a small scale auditing 
activity, a single auditor can conduct the whole audit activity. For audit activities in medium or large-scale, a larger 
teamwork is necessary for an efficient audit. However, careful consideration should be made to assess whether the 
audit staff will be able to contribute effectively particularly if the number of hours allocated is considered very low. 
As a suggestion, the internal audit management can consider allocating these hours to the other internal audit staff 
assigned in the same project (the staff will be required to render overtime work to cover for the additional hours) or 
consider the possibility of reducing the estimated hours required to complete the audit project. This assessment can 
also provide internal audit management a better insight as to whether the internal audit organization has adequate 
manpower resources for it to be able to deliver the expected audit outputs. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The allocation of internal audit resources continues to be a complex and critical process in achieving audit quality and 
efficiency. With the recent advancement in technology, new risks started to emerge which caused more complexities 
in business operations and regulatory requirements. As such, internal auditors are now under pressure to raise the bar 
of their audit quality to cope up with the fast face of this technological revolution. 
 
In this study, an LP model was used to obtain an optimal solution in allocating internal audit staff that would maximize 
the audit quality of the internal audit function. In addition, this new method significantly improved the time spent in 
the allocation of the internal audit resources, a process that normally takes hours if not days to complete using the 
traditional manual allocation process. The results of this study can be used to further assist internal audit management 
to assess whether the organization has sufficient manpower to deliver expected audit output, determine proper audit 
staff workload and the right mix of projects that would support the growth and development of each audit staff. Further, 
the efficiencies obtained from using this model can be used to other activities that could further add value to the 
company or organization as a whole. 
 
The results of this study were presented to the Director of the internal audit department who agreed to consider the 
use the mathematical methods in their next audit planning activity. The model allocation results will be observed 
further to see whether it will help in optimizing the audit staff allocation problem as well as improve the overall quality 
and efficiency of the internal audit function.

Abstract 
 
 
This paper presents an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) using Expert Choice software to simplify the decision 
making process of customers in choosing condominium units. With this, the researcher selects pair wise method in 
the design of the questionnaires. The questionnaires were sent to participants through online messaging applications. 
Middle-class residential buildings are rapidly emerging on metropolitan areas in the Philippines. Developers have 
been trying to construct these residential buildings according to the customer’s preferences. However, because of 
internal and external factors, preferences are inevitably changing and oftentimes unpredictable. Consequently, 
developers need to know the factors that could influence the preferences of potential property buyers.  Descriptive-
casual type of research was used in gathering the data derived from survey questionnaires which was distributed to 20 
prospective property customers/buyers (based in NCR and Region IV-A, Philippines). The technique used in this 
paper is analytic hierarchy process. Results from this study indicates that customers tend to choose the properties 
which are 1) close to public facilities and 2) accessible to public transportation. Additional factors such as price, 
property space and security capabilities can also influence the customer’s decision-making process.

1. Introduction 
The start of recovery of the world from the global financial crisis marks the recovery of all of its industries and sectors. 
The real estate industry is not exempted from such recovery. However, with the fear of another economic bubble burst, 
buyers are facing the reality that buying a property or residential estate must be wise and painstaking, because real 
estate purchase is a complex decision-making process requiring buyers to pass through a number of steps (Levy, 
Murphy & Lee, 2008).  
 
Condominium markets are becoming known in the world today. In an Asian perspective focusing in Malaysia, 
condominium units in prime locations are most expensive followed by those in secondary and other outskirt city areas. 
The target buyers in such areas are mainly expatriates and those earning very high income. Their demand forms a 
high-end market as compared to that which is affordable by the local people. However, in many ways, the preferences 
given to condominium properties are similar for all categories of buyers (Iman, Karamudin & Seah, 2008). Such that 
real estate is a costly product, a buyer will consider a number of factors when purchasing a residential property 
(Ratchatakulpat, et. al., 2009). These facts thus prodded the researcher to study clients' preferences of residential 
properties in the case of condominium properties in urban city of the Philippines using conjoint analysis as a marketing 
research.  
 
The Philippines is experiencing a boom in the real estate market. The growth movers of the industry are funds sent 
home by Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) and the robust Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry. The real

Female slightly over top male, with age ranging from 25 to 45 years old. The location of the condominium properties 
is the most important attribute, while the type and size of the condominium is the least important. Furthermore, despite 
the fact that Ayala dominated among the other alternative goals, it’s the availability of DMCI properties in most of 
the prime areas in the Philippines that brought them to the second preferred developer. At the same time, Ayala has 
an advantage in terms of Security and Type over DMCI.  
 
As for the best individual utility model of condominium property, clients preferred a condominium costing between 
1.5 to 3 million, near their workplace, secured with a both 24-hour security services and CCTV surveillance, with two 
bedrooms, and is built by a well-known developer in the Philippines.  
 
This study will provide insight and support to any consumers who are planning to invest in a condominium property 
in the future. The public may also use the study as a lead in generating their own preferences and options in using the 
Expert Choice system. Furthermore, the study may serve as a reference on how the business enterprises will transcend 
its marketing power capability by the use of analytics.

Abstract 
 
Internet Service Providers (ISP) provide high speed internet service and their revenue depends on the data rates that 
they charge to their customers. ISPs are faced with the challenge of meeting the growing demand of data services 
usage, using limited resources to maximize revenue, and providing services at reasonable prices. This paper aims to 
develop linear programming models which will (a) maximize sales and (b) allocate manpower given the limited 
resources. This paper also utilizes the analytic hierarchy process to help sales personnel rank priority industry selling 
area to maximize the useful life of network equipment. The sales maximization model has returned the optimal values 
of the number of ports to be sold and the optimal amount of sales discount for the six industry selling areas for the 
achievement of the PhP107,300,000.00 sales target of the ISP. Likewise, the manpower allocation model has helped 
determine the annual sales quota per sales agent which is from PhP2,100,000.00 – PhP4,700,000.00. Lastly, a 
prioritization of the selling areas is also devised using the AHP model formulated which showed that Business Services 
sales area has to be prioritized in selling. The results showed that while calculating the optimal number and selling 
price of products to be sold is relevant in revenue optimization, assigning it to the available manpower makes it more 
profitable to the company.

1. Introduction 
Over the years, the demand for high speed data services in businesses has increased and is expected to increase 
(Mehmood, Udell, & Cioffi, 2015) and become more prevalent in the coming years. This demand by companies for 
fast and reliable internet connectivity solution is for the support and continuity of their business needs. In 
manufacturing companies, for example, steadfast internet connectivity is a requisite in communicating with 
their suppliers and contractors. In the retail industry, dependable internet is essential for their operations and 
inventory management. The healthcare sector, financial services, food and hospitality and other industries also 
require stable and fast internet connectivity in exchanging large files, in handling payments, timekeeping 
system, marketing, and other operations relevant to the business. Among the challenges faced by Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs) are providing the aforementioned services at reasonable prices, meeting the growing demand of data 
services usage, and maximizing limited resources to maximize revenue. 
 
With the increased competition and growing market in the ISP sector, a more strategic sales planning is indispensable 
to survive the industry. In the ISP industry, however, selling capacity is bounded by the number of ports supported by 
an ISP infrastructure. The maximum number of ports and its allocated bandwidth determines the maximum network 
capacity an ISP can offer. In any case, the pricing of services is a function of the bandwidth allocation based on the 
needs of various client industries. The maximum capacity to sell of an ISP, therefore, puts a cap on the maximum 
revenue an ISP can generate. The concept of maximum revenue is expounded in (Mehmood, Udell & Cioffi, 2015) as 
revenue capacity, which is introduced as a useful and meaningful metric for revenue optimization. Revenue capacity, 
as further defined in the paper, gives an upper bound on the monetary worth of a communication link given a price 
function.

4. Conclusion 
This paper aims to develop a model which will maximize sales given the limited network selling capacity and limited 
manpower while meeting the sales target of the company and of each sales personnel, based on the sales quotas for 
the different industry selling areas, using the linear programming model. This paper also utilized the analytic hierarchy 
process to help sales personnel identify priority industry selling area to maximize the useful life of network equipment. 
 
This study has determined the optimal values of various decision variables of a revenue maximization model and put 
it to use in the optimal allocation of a manpower allocation model. This highlights the importance of manpower in the 
achievement of sales targets as enablers and implementers of sales activities. It showed that while calculating the 
optimal number and selling price of products to be sold is relevant, assigning it to the available manpower makes it 
meaningful. It aligned the achievement of individual sales quotas of the agents and of the general sales objective of 
the company while satisfying all the identified constraints. Given the allocation of manpower per selling area; a 
relevant sales quota per sales agent were arrived at. This quota per sales agent has enabled a more defined quota 
instead of merely having quota per selling industry. Furthermore, the prioritization schedule devised using AHP will 
help the manpower to allot their time in focusing on selling first products in the priority industry selling areas. This 
will enable the sales agents to reach their quotas, as well as contribute in maximizing the useful life of the company’s 
network equipment.

Abstract 
 
This study utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in the selection of an optimal niche or category of videos 
for maximizing view count. Main income from videos are derived from RPM, which is a set amount per a thousand 
views. A set of criteria was determined from attributes of the dataset that logically contributes to either the videos’ 
SEO or in trend/popularity. The criteria in question was also determined by commonalities in a vast amount of video 
content platforms, which focuses more on the essential attributes of a video. In order to perform pairwise comparison, 
weights were derived from coefficients generated from using Linear Regression. Upon creation of the model, we 
identify the categories that have the most potential for garnering views. Based on results, the study may be performed 
in another time frame to reflect the major shifts in public interest over time. Thus, importance to its repeatability and 
degree of usability against datasets from different platforms is emphasized. 
 
Keywords  
Analytical Hierarchy Process, Regression Analysis, Video Content Creation 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In contemporary society, social media is changing the way people create, share, and consume information (Mangold 
& Faulds, 2009). These social media platforms are being driven by content created by, and for, the users of the 
platform. These types of content are denoted as User Generated Content (UGC). Being a content producer on these 
platforms is becoming to be a more viable way to earn income in the creative space. The content production through 
social media allow users to fulfill their information, entertainment, and mood management needs, while its generation 
(or sharing) allows for self-expression and self-actualization (Shao, 2009). The exponential growth of social media in 
contemporary society makes them necessary tools for communication, content creation, sharing, and business growth 
(Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). 
 
With more and more creators present on a platform, competition can be detrimental to success since viewership share 
is diluted to more participants. One other factor is the introduction of content from traditional media companies, 
usually in the form of video clips of shows broadcasted on television networks and cable networks. These types of 
content are called non-user generated content.  
 
For traditional media companies interested in entering the internet media market, one would have to use one of the 
many video sharing platforms. They have the capacity and capability to produce content on any topic or category. 
However, not all content posted on video platforms such as YouTube gets the desired attention and only a fraction 
can reach a large audience, particularly the videos posted by social media marketers expecting millions of views 
(Khan, Gohar & Vong, Sokha 2014). Companies want to identify these categories with the most potential for high 
amount of views on the platform, thereby maximizing profit, while considering parameters affecting quality and 
timeliness of video production and publishing.

2047","3.4. AHP Weight Calculation 
The data in Table 5 shows the calculated weights for the top 5 categories, with weights against each criterion, with 
the final column as the final composite weight. As the previous section observed the weights regarding views, this 
section will discuss observations made to the distribution of the weights for each category.  
 
Table 5. Top Categories from the Utilized Methodology 
 
 
 
 
We can see that the top 2 categories focused on video/production quality. However, the 2nd top category’s composite 
weight (cat42) holds close to the top category even though it has significantly lower weight on the length criteria. This 
may prove to show that video length does not entirely matter if the video production quality is high. 
 
The 3rd category (cat5) might describe average-length videos but with a lower video quality. Its composite weight is 
being raised by higher quality or number of tags, as well as its user rating, which has the highest weight of the top 3 
categories. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The utilization of Linear Regression for estimating weights in AHP proved to be a good approach for processing data 
generated from high-traffic, social media platforms. It can remove biases that can come from small sample sizes such 
as surveys directed to a handful of executives. The more data-driven research becomes, it is inherently more reliable, 
and can be easily implemented in other industries or subject matter. 
 
The independent variables in the study were chosen with the importance of being able to apply the methodology across 
different video platforms, as well as be easy to repeat in periodic time frames. This is to easily capture shifts in trends, 
changes in categorization, as well as changes in how videos are measured.  
 
From this study, we have found out, for the dataset used, video length does not matter as much to view count. Also, 
we have found out that while some attributes have weights consistent across most categories, like search engine 
optimization related attributes (title, tags), some categories value other attributes more than that of other categories. 
This can be useful to media companies, or other individuals who peruse the methods in this study, to selectively control 
how a production should be made for the categories they have selected. 
 
 It can also be noted that the study did not select a singular category. Instead, the study presents the top categories by 
its composite weight.  This is to further express that different categories have characteristics that may be better or 
worse than that of its peers, composite weights being relatively equal. This would mean that the individuals who may 
use this model can have more control on what the final decision of selecting a category according to their priority over 
certain video attributes.

Abstract 
 
Manufacturing is the processing of raw materials to finished products. Originally, these products were processed 
manually until Industrial Revolution has allowed these products to be produced by machines. Most of the 
manufacturing lines in the industries use the combination of manual processing and machine processing. This is 
referred to as semi-automated production line. Thus, there are two factors affecting the productivity of this production 
line- manpower and machine efficiency. During the Covid-19 pandemic, skeletal workforce was strictly implemented 
in almost every sector across the globe. Reassignment of manpower allocation has therefore been a problem of the 
management. This paper focuses on manpower allocation of a Bumping Area of a Semiconductor Company in the 
Philippines. Factors affecting manpower allocation such as maximum machine capacity, minimum output requirement 
and number of qualified production specialist were studied and taken into consideration. Using Linear Programming, 
optimal number of manpower was determined and the target output of 64,000 unit moves daily was achieved. 
However, this can be further improved by utilizing the excess production specialist through cross-training them in 
different module. Machine capacity can also be maximized by hiring more production specialist to operate on them.

1. Introduction 
Manufacturing is the mass processing, fabrication or production of components and finished products from raw 
materials (Kenton, 2020). This includes all foods, chemicals, textiles, metals, lumbers, woods, pulps, etc (Working 
Draft Framework, 1996). Through the years, manufacturing production lines have evolved from manual production 
line to semi-automated production lines to fully automated production lines. Manual production has products produced 
by hands. Introduction of machines are seen on semi-automated production lines. Here, the raw materials are loaded 
in a machine then the finished product is unloaded from the machine. However, there are still some processes which 
require human intervention. Thus, there are two factors affecting the productivity of a semi-automated production line. 
These are machine efficiency and manpower (Kurata, Matias, & Grepo, 2015). Unlike in a fully automated production 
line wherein all processes are done by machines, the role of human has fully changed from sensorimotor tasks to 
predominantly monitoring tasks, being responsible only for decision making and malfunction interventions (Butzler, 
Kuz, Petruck, Faber, & Schlick, 2015) 
 
Production output of a manufacturing line is directly related to the workers’ performance making human workforce 
as one of the most important assets of a company (Egilmez, Erenay, & Suer, 2014).  Effective manpower allocation 
has therefore been a critical management problem. During the planning period, these people are determined by their 
experiences that will be a factor in their delegation the proper levels and positions. Allocation of manpower may be 
determined by the number of processes a manufacturing line has, available space, span of control, worker skills and 
availability of machines (stochastic, 41).

2055","Figure 2. Number of Production Specialist Allocated and Minimum Output Requirement vs Machine Capacity 
 
To visualize the results better, Figure 2 is a combination chart showing the correlation between production 
specialists allocated per module, qualified production specialist per module, minimum output requirement per 
module and the machine capacity per module. Bar graph in blue color shows the number of production specialist 
allocated to each module, bar graph in green color shows number of production specialist qualified in each module, 
line graph in yellow color shows the minimum output needed per module and the line graph in pink color shows 
the machine capacity for each module.  From the figure, it can be seen that the number of production specialist 
allocated is directly proportional to the machine capacity; however, in module 3, since number of production 
specialist available is only seven, production specialist allocated is one. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, allocation of production specialist per module is dependent on the machine capacity however; it is 
also limited by the number of production specialist qualified in every module. There is no direct relationship 
between the number of allocated production specialist per module and minimum output requirement per module. 
 
In this model, goal of allocating at least one production specialist per module was achieved. The target of 64,000 
moves per day was doubled into 129,092 moves while machine capacity and minimum output requirement per 
module were satisfied. However, this can be further improved by maximizing the utilization of machine capacity. 
This will result to greater output of the production line. It is suggested to hire more production specialists and to 
cross train them across the modules.

Abstract 
 
In today’s tough competition, every company in the service sector tries hard to satisfy their customer.  In the Insurance 
sector, various new private companies have entered in industry by doing the merger with foreign companies. Day by 
day they are offering new services with the basic plan to attract the new customers & for retaining the present 
customers.  In this research paper, we tried to understand the consumer behavior in the Insurance sector.  The main 
objective of this paper is to utilize the analytical hierarchy process to select the factors to consider when buying a life 
insurance policy based on different age brackets and gender orientation.  Data was collected with the help of structured   
questionnaires   from   48   clients   of   Lazurite   Keystone.   Researchers   used   pairwise, percentage, frequency & 
Cross tabulation methods have been used for analysis.  The proposed model can help the firm in selecting the efficient 
products. AHP is a multicriteria decision making tool that takes into account both qualitative and quantitative criteria.

1. Introduction 
In the modern industrialized era, human life and property are inevitably exposed to different kinds and varying degrees 
of risks and uncertainties. Human   beings, to   protect   themselves and their   property   from   total disaster, resort   
intelligently   to protection coverage extended by the insurance companies which act as a trustee to the amount 
collected through premiums and provide certainty in the place of uncertainty. A very prominent step taken by human 
beings to mitigate the eventualities of life is investment in insurance companies which act as protectors of future 
ambitions and aspirations of the people.  Insurance is a co-operative device which safeguards financially both 
longevity of human life or premature mishaps when man, out of genuine concern for his dependents, insures his life 
taking into account the various unforeseeable risk factors that are prevalent everywhere.    The    maturity    amount 
takes   care   of not only the   dependents   of the insured, but   also of self, when   he is   neglected or   forsaken by   
his family members.   Middle income   groups   certainly   resort to insurance companies for their future financial 
needs and commitments. The salaried group depends upon insurance for saving for the future as well as for tax saving 
purposes. 
 
Developing countries are not only consumers but also suppliers of insurance services. In a domestic market, the supply 
of insurance generally consists of services provided by national companies, with local and foreign capital, as well as 
by foreign companies and agencies or branches. Browne and Kim (1993) suggest that a number of variables may 
explain international differences in life insurance demand. They also suggest that a number of factors affect the supply 
of life insurance, although their study considers only the demand side. 
 
It is often argued that the development of financial institutions may have a significant impact on both the productivity 
of the economy and the volume of savings. Indeed, so important is insurance in the trade and development and matrix 
that, at its first session in 1964, the United Nations Conference on the Trade and Development (UNCTAD) (1964) 
formerly acknowledged that ""a sound national insurance and reinsurance market is essential characteristic of economic 
growth"" (p. 55).

and sub-criteria. The table shows us the general selected products considering the age bracket and gender orientation. 
Also, researchers expected to see the low selection of PIA and PRU M based on the respondent ideas and opinion. It 
was also found that clients are focused on affordable life insurance with more product features. These findings will 
help the lazurite keystone life insurance agency to give more importance to the criteria and sub-criteria for proper 
selection of products. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This research study is aimed at assessing the important criteria and sub criteria for selection of insurance 
policy/products, using AHP Method. The model is specifically designed to identify the important criteria in choosing 
products to evaluate the client's preference when buying life insurance. This model is tested on 5 products which are 
offered of lazurite keystone life insurance, where data collection begins; through existing clients survey by considering 
their age bracket and gender orientation, the information needed to begin developing the proposed model is obtained, 
and the most important criteria and sub criteria for the problem assessment process have been identified. 
 
The hierarchical structure is provided with the participation of decision makers, followed by the comparison 
corresponding to criteria and sub criteria. Furthermore, the consistency of paired matrix results has been confirmed. 
In each criteria and sub-criteria, priority/ selection analysis is used to obtain relative importance of the comparison 
matrix. Therefore, to determine the objective function according to ranking alternatives and relative priorities, the 
proposed model was tested in all products to assess the client's preference when buying life insurance policy/products. 
By using the equation in the previous discussion, which represents the objective function, the general goal of this 
to select the life insurance policy is achieved. 
 
After developing the AHP Model, the predetermined objectives have also been achieved. Due to this limitation, it was 
important to know the use of case study, as the model should not be used generally for situations and other outside 
segments that are used. In addition, it is difficult to collect all interview participants together at the same time; because 
it is a structured group interview, there are many cases where participants cannot be involved simultaneously. Another 
limitation is the need for all research participants involved in the process to commit to it. As a contribution, this 
study highlights the adoption of multi-criteria methodologies used to identify the performance score, ranking and to 
normalize alternatives.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to use available company data on annual sales from after sales service subscriptions in countries 
within the Asia Pacific region. It is also aimed to identify optimal solution in maximizing the annual sales through 
service tiers introduction using the Linear Programming approach. To realize the optimal solution, this study intends 
to utilize Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in prioritizing the different alternatives for after sales pursuit strategy 
implementation per country. The set of criteria was determined using the predictive analytics approach. It was 
concluded that the annual sales per country in the Asia Pacific region is largely influenced by the number of customer 
subscriptions. The result of this study is applicable to the proposal being made to meet the company goal of increasing 
service adoption through service tiers introduction to increase the annual sales of at least 15% in Asia Pacific. Since 
the number of customer subscription has a positive effect on increasing annual sales, the outcome of the AHP-based 
after sales pursuit strategy implementation may be used by the company as a customized approach in capturing the 
targeted sales per country.

1. Introduction 
The business sector of After Sales Service is known for its special characteristics such as economic dependency, high 
margins, growth and innovation potential, long service cycles as well as intensive and long-term customer contact 
(Dombrowski & Malorny, 2017).  Likewise, a volatile and therefore poorly predictable demand concerning the offered 
services, a high degree of individuality and non-standardized customer orders are among the biggest challenges in the 
After Sales Service (Dombrowski, Engel & Schulze, 2011) . The After Sales Service of producing companies must face 
these challenges and customer's requirements (e.g. prevention of the downtimes). Moreover, short reaction times are 
demanded at the highest quality requirements of Customer Service and Spare parts delivery (Bruhn et al., 2013). 
 
The after sales services complement the products bought from the company with a long-term vision of taking care of 
the customers’ prized assets with a potential of ten to twenty years servicing period. The after sales services can be 
categorized into Spare Parts service, Customer Service, and Accessories Business (Dombrowski & Engel, 2013). The 
Spare Parts Service covers the areas of demand forecasting, spare part production, spare part distribution and spare 
parts management. The areas of maintenance, repair, overhaul, trainings, instructions and installation are parts of the 
Customer Service (Dombrowski, Engel & Schulze, 2011). The Accessories Business focuses on the areas of merchandise, 
equipment and individualization of products. Within the scope of this paper, the focus is on the overall after-sales 
service sector (Misra, 2010). 
 
Seeing the huge potential in the after-sales service sector, a number of producing companies explored various means to capture this 
business opportunity through profit maximization. And one of the approaches used to prove that it is feasible to achieve profit 
maximization is by using Linear Programming. Linear programming, or linear optimization, is a mathematical method to

and effective collaboration. Furthermore, it allows them to address specific service-related concerns. While India and 
Taiwan it’s their 3rd rank approach. Company Exchange is their 2nd priority as it allows them to be exposed to the 
various products of the other sectors of the industry that may support their other needs which is typical to specialized 
industries while it’s the 3rd approach for China, Australia and South Korea. Road Shows and Customer Training is 
the 4th and 5th ranked approach and it is consistent across countries. It shows that these rapidly growing countries 
prefer service product experience and personal touchpoints, rather than product training and brand awareness as 
offered by customer trainings and road shows. This preference has been observed as well by the domain experts 
working with the different country sales partners. Road Shows and Customer Training are value add on but not 
required or important.  
 
It shows that applying this Decision Analysis AHP model provides better insight to the Marketing and Development 
group. At present the process is to sort the largest number of equipment and the lowest health score to minimize the 
effort in pursuit strategies, however they are missing other factors that drives the customer to purchase support 
services. It’s critical they look at the whole picture and other factors that affects the customer’s decision. 
 
With the results, it is evident that utilizing mathematical modelling serves to better evaluate and improve decision 
making. It provides critical inputs to their strategies in achieving their goals with certainty. Mathematical decision 
helps to rationalize the sifting of information and the balancing of alternatives inherent in any decision with its 
efficiency and accuracy. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study proved that in order to meet the company’s annual sales target of at least 10% increase per country and 
15% increase in the Asia Pacific region, service tiers can be introduced by maximizing the annual total sales using 
Linear Programming. Utilizing AHP also proved that the approach in implementing pursuit strategies should not 
be treated equally and ranking can be customized per country based on the given criteria. 
 
The Linear Programming and Analytical Hierarchy Process models generated from this study can be implemented 
and monitored for adoption effectiveness. And after some time, use these models for the other world areas and product 
lines in the company. For future optimization studies, it is recommended to incorporate external factors and customer 
feedback to improve the models. 
 
LP and AHP should become an essential analysis and decision-making tools in a company. Model-based decision is 
important for its accuracy and objectivity. Qualitative decisions like subjective estimation, intuition, and trial and error 
are commonly used by companies. It is an eye-opening concern that such decision-making approach is not widely 
used, thus, policy makers in the companies should start to shift to model-based decision-making styles (Maurya et al., 
2016).

Abstract 
 
Credit cards is one of the most convenient tools when purchasing goods and services. Banks offer these cards to 
qualified individuals and gain profit by charging interest rates and fees. Profit and loss may occur depending on the 
changes in status of the card. To understand the behavior of credit card status changes and predict future probabilities, 
this study utilized Markov Analysis approach by gathering 6 months of information with 511,658 observations. The 
transition of the card status can either positively or negatively impact the business. Markov Analysis proved to be 
useful in understanding the behavior of people and systems. It provides probabilistic information about a current 
situation that can guide the decision makers in choosing the most valuable recommendation.  In this study there is a 
high percentage of normal/active, delinquency and blocked cards which means an increase in the business revenue.  
Fraudulent and cancelled blocked cards projected a lower value and should maintain in that way because it may affect 
not just business earnings but its reputation as well. The analysis presented provides useful information to improve 
process performance that is current implemented in the business operations. Generally, the model can help the 
financial institution in terms of profitability, customer relationships and risk reduction.

 1. Introduction 
An industry responsible for handling cash, credit and other financial transactions are banks. Aside from the fact that 
banks offer a safe place to store people’s money, they also provide different kinds of financial services such as wealth 
management, currency exchange and safe deposit boxes (Amadeo, 2020). Depending on the financial services the 
bank is offering, banks can be categorized as Retail Bank, Commercial/Corporate Bank, and Investment Bank. Short-
term cash or the money you deposited at the bank is used to loan to others for long-term debt such as car loans, credit 
cards, mortgages, and other debt vehicles resulting to creation of liquidity in the market which also creates money and 
keeps the supply going (Barone, 2020). 
 
The measure of a person’s capacity to pay back her dues on time are called Credit. A line of credit is the indicated 
amount allowed to utilize by spending monthly and get replenished by payments, and to access line of credit is through 
credit cards. Credit cards are type of payments where instead of using the account holder’s deposited money, funds 
are coming from line of credit (www.bankrate.com). 
 
There are already different types of credit cards available. Most of the financial institutions in the Philippines have at 
least one type of card they offer to their clients. All offers vary with rates, fees, benefits, and terms and conditions. 
However, many Filipinos see credit cards as a financial tool that can financially incapacitate people in the long run. If 
you know how to manage your spending, this is not actually something to be wary of as credit cards are very beneficial 
to an individual especially in times of need. If used frequently, credit cards can also come with some benefits (Credit 
Card Guide, 2019).  
 
A study of preferred payment methods conducted in 2019, 11.3% of 1,760 of respondents claimed they prefer to pay 
with their credit cards (Sanchez, 2019). Financial institutions earn profit from individuals by charging basic interest 
rates and fees when users fail to pay off their credit at the end of the month. This could also include annual fees and 
late fees which also contributes to their profit. Credit card interest rates in the Philippines are currently among the

2092","On the other hand, delinquent status that transitions to pending for reactivation gets the lowest score with just .01 %. 
It shows that the company have a very low recovery rate of blocked cards status that are being reinstated. The company 
needs to review the current policy and implement a strategy that can motivate their customers to continue their business 
with the bank rather than completely closing their accounts.  
 
The card transactions that moved to fraudulent status should have high importance and its number should be only 
minimal as it will have a huge impact on any financial institution’s reputation. The security of the customer and its 
relationship with the bank anchors on it. The results show a low value the status that moved on this state. This should 
be closely monitored, and any volume observed must be subjected to a high alert investigation and rules could be 
implemented to prevent further harm in company’s reputation and customer experience.  
 
Pending credit cards for activation are pending opportunities for banks to earn profit.  The researchers’ observation 
displays a lot of credit cards have not been activated yet. Gathering customer feedback is highly encouraged to further 
assess as to why many credit cards remain at this state. It could be an issue in delivery of the card, poor customer 
service or better terms and conditions have been offered by a competitor. The company can then use the gathered 
feedback to strategize on how to reduce the credit cards pending for activation. 
 
Closing of credit card accounts is the last thing any bank would want to happen. As observed, the rate of customers 
getting their accounts closed are getting higher as time passes. This could pose a threat to company’s profitability, 
reputation and stability. 
 
The model created will enable the bank to track their current performance based on the transition rates of their credit 
cards. Depending on which state requires attending to, the company may implement new policies and procedures, 
innovative decision-making and even gathering of information could be essential to company’s increased profitability, 
better customer satisfaction and maintain company’s best reputation. 
 
5. Conclusion 
To observe the behavior of the credit card status changes and identify which status has the highest probability of 
change, Markov Analysis approach was used for the business to determine the effect of each status changes. Analyzing 
the credit card statuses and identifying which status has the highest and lowest probability of change, the business can 
strategize on how to minimize future negative impact of these cards and maintain and maximize the positive output 
the business is doing. 
 
Depending on where the credit card status transitions to, it is observed that these transitions can either positively or 
negatively impact the business. Having the initial state values of the card to predict the future outcomes, gives the 
company an edge on how to act according to which transition poses a threat to the business.  This paper has described 
how the information can be used to predict future probabilities and take strategic measures to further improve the 
business. 
 
The researchers recommend utilizing Markov Analysis for businesses who wants to understand the behavior of their 
systems. Systems such as credit card status changes, movements of people, customer brand switching, inventories etc. 
It is important to note that having the initial state values first is essential for the prediction of future probabilities. Deep 
analysis must be done to fully understand on how and why the changes are happening. This approach would be useful 
to identify the risk and opportunities and improve the business’ current position.

Abstract 
 
Prioritization of export sectors enables export promotion agencies to allocate scarce resources to sectors and activities 
that need it most. This paper utilized Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the priority export sectors for 
the Philippines based on the following criteria: (i) export value added; (ii) export competitiveness; (iii) export demand; 
and (iv) supply capacity. To provide a more granular analysis, sub-criteria were also identified as follows: labor value 
added, domestic value added, and stable export revenue are used as sub-criteria for export value added; comparative 
advantage and market concentration for export competitiveness; growth of world imports, distance to importing 
countries, and tariff rate for export demand; and growth of Philippine exports per sector, logistics cost, and gross value 
added of each sector for supply capacity. Individual weights of each criteria and sub-criteria were computed and 
applied to relevant trade and export statistics to determine the priority ranking of each sector. Consistent with historical 
data, the result shows that the most important export sectors for the Philippines are machinery and electrical, 
agricultural, and food products.

1. Introduction 
The contribution of exports to economic growth has been extensively studied in economic literature (Emery, 1967; 
Michaely, 1977; Heller and Porter, 1978; Tyler, 1981; Kavoussi, 1984; Ram, 1985). The main argument is that exports 
help stimulate and concentrate investments in the more efficient sectors of the economy, thus raising productivity. 
Producing for the international market also creates economies of scale which drives down cost and increases 
efficiency. Exports also facilitates increased flow of technology, market innovations, as well as managerial skills. 
Given its important role to economic development, many countries have formulated export development plans to 
improve their export performance and assess their export potential. 
 
Several methodologies have been developed to guide countries assess their export potential. Cuyvers et al (2012) 
developed the decision support model which analyzes the macroeconomic conditions of potential target markets and 
then, using a filtering approach, systematically screens possible product-market combinations until a shortlist of the 
most promising and realistic opportunities remain. The International Trade Center (ITC) also developed an export 
assessment methodology that determines the country’s products or sectors with export potential in existing or new 
markets based on an assessment of the supply capacities and product space of the exporting country, demand 
conditions in the target market and market access conditions in the target market (Decreux and Spies, 2016).  
 
Hausmann and Klinger (2007), Hausmann et al (2007), and Hidalgo et al (2007) also developed the product space 
framework which asserts that countries will find it easier to diversify into new products that are related to products 
that it already exports. The framework assumes that these new products require a set of capabilities similar to those 
that the country already possesses. Lall et al (2006) also introduced the concept of export sophistication – a 
combination of factors that include technology, ease of product fragmentation, natural resource availability, and 
marketing – to examine trade patterns and analyze export performance of individual economies. 
 
In the Philippines, Dacuycuy (2012) utilized the concept of product space developed by Hidalgo et al (2007) and the 
index of product level sophistication to analyze the performance of the country’s export basket. In a follow up study,

2099","The chemicals sector includes basic chemicals (e.g., resins, organic, inorganic, alcohols), chemical products (e.g., 
pharmaceutical, cosmetics, paints, fertilizers), plastic products (e.g., plastic articles, pipes and tubing, films, sheets), 
and rubber products (e.g., tires, industrial products, re-threading). Exports in this sector has dropped in recent years 
due to tightened regulation of controlled chemicals but the demand is still strong considering that chemicals is one of 
the largest tradable products in the world. Shift in consumer preferences for natural and environment-friendly products, 
particularly on health and wellness, is also seen to contribute to the better prospect in this sector. Moving up the value 
chain in these sectors would require investments in manufacturing process enhancement, new product development, 
materials and supplier assurance, as well as talent development and innovation. 
 
The metals and minerals sectors are also one of the most important sectors of the Philippines considering that the 
country is gifted with vast amounts of mineral resources, both metallic and non-metallic such as gold, nickel, iron, 
copper, limestone, and marble. Among the metallic minerals, the largest reserve that the country has is copper, which 
is estimated at 4 billion metric tons, making the Philippines the fourth largest country in the world in terms of copper 
reserves (DTI-BOI, 2017). The country is also a major exporter of nickel. There is high demand for metals and 
minerals products since they are inputs to other industries such as electronics and automotive parts manufacturing. 
Presently, however, majority of Philippine metals and minerals exports are raw materials. To generate more export 
revenue, the sector needs to move up to higher value products, which entails huge investment in facilities and research 
and development. 
 
The textiles and clothing or garment sector used to be a USD3 billion industry and one of the top performing export 
sectors of the country in the 1990s. The sector benefited from quota allocations for textiles and garments exported by 
developing countries such as the Philippines to developed countries. However, in 1995, the quota allocation was 
discontinued and, as a result, garments and textiles enterprises in the Philippines which relied on quotas underwent 
difficulties leading to closure of factories and downsizing. Since then, the sector has experienced a steady and 
continuous decline. Now, with the help of various government agencies, the sector is developing a roadmap to revive 
the country’s textiles and garments industry. Among the strategies outlined is the provision of capital and land to 
increase clothing and textile production across the country, procurement of new equipment, as well as provision of 
fiscal incentives. Investing in research and development and marketing as well as strengthening the supply chains are 
also considered. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper proposes a new methodology for prioritizing export sectors using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Four 
main criteria were identified, namely: export value added, export competitiveness, export demand, and supply 
capacity. To provide a deeper evaluation of the different sectors, different sub-criteria were also determined. Export 
value added was further decomposed into labor value added, domestic value added, and export revenue. Export 
competitiveness was further elaborated using Revealed Comparative Advantage and market concentration indicators. 
Export demand was modeled based on the average growth rate of world demand for each export sector, the average 
distance of importing countries, and tariff rate as proxy for market access conditions. Finally, supply capacity was 
determined using the average growth of Philippine exports for each sector, the logistics cost, and the productive 
capacity which used the gross value added of each sector as proxy indicator. 
 
Applying the weights of the criteria mentioned on relevant trade data obtained from various sources, performance 
scores were computed and were used as the basis for ranking the export sectors, as follows: (1) Machinery and 
Electronics; (2) Agriculture; (3) Food Products; (4) Footwear; (5) Fuels; (6) Chemicals, Plastics, and Rubber; (7) 
Metals and Minerals; (8) Transportation Equipment; and (9) Textiles and Clothing.  
 
Prioritization of these export sectors can be an important input to export planning and promotion. Given the 
government’s limited resources for export development, a prior analysis of which sectors to focus on will help ensure 
that resources are invested efficiently and effectively, for instance, in the selection of matching and market missions. 
Moreover, looking at the results and ranking for each criterion (and its sub-criteria) would also inform policy makers 
about the more specific challenges facing each sector and with further analysis would be able to formulate strategies 
to address those challenges.

Abstract  
 
This research attempts to understand the underlying factors influencing the success of engineering education. In doing 
so, it analyzes the available data regarding the non-mandatory positioning test, which was introduced at the Belgian 
universities for engineering programs in summer 2013. Predictive model learning algorithms are used to make 
prediction for unseen data. In this research Naïve Bayes based algorithm is used to predict the contributing factors for 
the success in engineering education. The result shows that the prior academic achievement (choosing option of higher 
hours in mathematics, percentage of marks in mathematics in high school) of the students influences the score of the 
test. It also shows that the score of the test along with prior mathematical experience is a good predictor for the success 
and failure of students in engineering education. Moreover, the research finds that the test score has a high predictive 
power for the result of engineering study especially for the students who are more likely to do badly. On the other 
hand, the results indicate that gender is not an obstacle in study success in engineering education. This study finds that 
the girls who do conduct higher hours of mathematics in their high school and go for the engineering study do equally 
well as boys.

1. Introduction  
 
The technological advancement in the wave of Fourth Industrial Revolution is creating opportunities of a wide range 
of entirely new jobs and reducing the number of workers required for certain work tasks (CNES 2018). Therefore, 
engineering practice, research, and education are of great importance to cope with future challenges regarding 
economy, environment, energy, health, and security (Duderstadt 2010). In EU countries engineering employment is 
projected to grow by 15 per cent over the period from 2018 to 2030.  Around 4.3 million job openings will need to be 
filled in this time period. This trend is expected to be sustained in the following years (Skills Panorama 2019 update).  
However, the number of engineers needed is not enough to meet the demand. Still there is deficit in the supply side in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce (Skills Panorama 2016). Low retention rate 
in this discipline of study is an international concern for a long time (Steenkamp et al. 2017). Moreover, though this 
education field is vital in national economies, the gender gap between men and women in this field is globally apparent 
(UNESCO 2017). High dropout in engineering study, less interest in science courses in high school, and negative 
perception about STEM education and career especially among the women are considered as shortage of workforce 
in this field (EU Skills Panorama Analytical Highlight 2012, Hill et al. 2010). Therefore, in order to improve the 
retention and graduate rate and to encourage more female participations, it is important to determine the contributing 
factors that influence the academic success in engineering education (Hall et al. 2011). 
In order to predict the success factor of engineering education, the research analyses the data regarding positioning 
test for engineering education in Belgian Universities. As presented in Vanderoost et al. (2014), for more than hundred 
years admission to engineering studies at the universities of Belgium was based on an entrance exam. This multi-topic 
exam was used to judge the high school mathematical skill required for engineering problem solving. However, despite 
academic opposition, this exam was abolished by the government in 2004. Onwards 2004, anyone who has a high 
school degree is eligible to study engineering without any subject specific requirements. A basic course on 
mathematics is introduced in the first semester in order to maintain the required level of math skill. Researches show

2111","group of students with no non tolerable fail) and bad (the group of students with one non tolerable fail) of first year 
bachelor study based on their past academic information, gender, and positioning test score.  
On the other hand, the overall accuracy decreases to 56% while predicting the study progress without the positioning 
test score. As the goal of the model is to predict the students who have less chance of doing well in engineering, the 
accuracy of class C is more important than that of class A. In comparing with the classwise accuracy of the two 
classifiers, it is seen that the model without the positioning test score predicts the students who will more likely have 
difficulty in their engineering education (TP rate of group C) as good as that of classifier with all attributes. However, 
wrong prediction of students who actually do not face difficulty (FP rate of group C) are more than the classifier with 
all attributes. Therefore, better balance of TP rate and FP rate is observed in the first classifier for group C (ROC area 
0.8) than that of the second classifier (ROC area 0.75) (Figure 3). 
 
6. Conclusion 
  
The research provides the implementation of predictive learning algorithms in order to search for the engineering 
study success indicators. This implementation is achieved by Naïve Bayes based classifier. The first classifier is built 
to predict the test score based on the prior academic achievement and gender. The result shows that the classifier can 
predict both pass and fail of positioning test equally well. However, the contribution of gender is observed very low. 
Even without considering gender, the classifier provides similar accuracy in predicting pass and fail of the positioning 
test score. Therefore, the prior academic achievement, not the gender of the students influences the score of the 
positioning test score. 
The second classifier is constructed to predict the first year result of bachelor based on the test score and prior academic 
achievement. For realizing the predictive power of the test score, similar classifier is also built without using this 
score. The comparison of both classifiers shows that the overall accuracy of the classifier is lower when they are 
trained without using the test score. Moreover, the accuracy of predicting students who have worst result (class C) is 
higher in case of with test score than without score. Therefore, the test score along with prior academic achievement 
is well predictor for the academic success of engineering. Moreover, this test score is better predictor for the students 
who are more likely to do poorly. 
However in all the above cases there might be other factors that can influence the academic result (e.g. effort, 
motivation, study strategy, job demand, socio economic status, culture etc.) in addition with the score of the 
positioning test, mathematical experience, gender, and first year bachelor result. The classifiers are built based on the 
attributes that mainly contain the information about academic results. So in order to further improve the accuracy of 
the classifiers, attributes related to study strategy and technique can also be used.

Abstract  
 
Gubeng Station is part of the 52 stations managed by the PT KAI Daop 8 Surabaya working area. There 
were 978,346 train passengers as of January 2019. This amount is the highest number of train passengers 
for 3 years recorded at Gubeng station. Passengers who need infrastructure have very diverse needs. This 
is a problem in itself for the hut station management. This study aims to determine the need for 
infrastructure according to gender perceptions. The method used is through a survey and analysis using 
importance performance analysis (IPA). The conclusion is that the satisfaction and importance of existing 
facilities at Gubeng station according to the perceptions of train users, a satisfaction score of 2.48 is 
obtained which means that it is still not getting the maximum service and the average value of importance 
is 4.57 which means that the existing facilities are currently at Gubeng station indeed needed by train 
passengers.

Abstract  
 
The recent radical digitalization of our societies through internet and the use of computer systems, gave rise to new 
cyber-crimes or cyber-security threats. Cyber security has thus became a general concern for all, citizens, 
professionals, politicians, and, more generally, all decision makers. The Cyber Security Bill was introduced to 
criminalize offences against computers and network related crime; to consolidate the criminal law on computer 
crime and network crime; to provide for investigation and collection of evidence for computer and network related 
crime; to provide for the admission of electronic evidence for such offences and to provide for matters connected 
with or incidental to the foregoing. With the Cyber Crime and Cyber Security Bill on the cusp of being promulgated, 
prosecuting Cyber Criminals in Zimbabwe finally became effective. The focus of this paper is to discuss issues 
around the introduction of the Cyber Crime and Cyber Security Bill in Zimbabwe and the likely impact it will have 
on the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. This is achieved through the analysis of global cybercrime and 
cyber security legislation trends; factors influencing the success of the bill in the investigation and prosecution of 
cybercrime in  Zimbabwe as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the Bill in question.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The recent past has witnessed the world becoming more progressively connected coupled with 
expeditious technological transformations. This phenomenon has set an environment which 
promotes expansive and diversified ways for cyber criminals to launch cyber assaults. As a 
result, many expansive and complex attacks have been unleashed into the cyber world such as 
the ransomware WannaCry assault of May 2017 (Sherr, 2017) which crippled many computer 
systems, cyber terrorism, unlawful acquisition, interception and access of data, cyber bullying 
and harassment, transmission of data messages inciting violence and damage of property, cyber-
fraud and extortion, and so on, thereby bringing the reality of cybercrime and cyber security to 
the world. This reinforced the need for national driven strategies aimed at regulating the 
cyberspace so as to identify and proactively contain the attacks of this magnitude through 
intercontinental strategies and partnerships. This can be achieved through the process of enacting 
laws that are related to cybercrime and cyber security (Sabillon, et al., 2016), improve cyber 
governance, and invest in computer security and cooperation among nations. Lastly, conclusion 
will be drawn.

2123","Furthermore, the bill instils the sense of responsibility with regards to data protection and disclosure of breaches. 
The bill ensures that negligence is eliminated on the account of institutions who generate, store and transmit private 
data of individuals and organisations by exercising due diligence in all aspects of cyber security as failure attracts 
stiff penalties.  This ensures that cyber security levels are improved to match global standards hence increased 
privacy protection and the ability to receive restitution when the need arises (Hogan Lovells, 2017). 
 
3.2 Drawbacks of Cybercrime and Cyber Security Bill 
One of the major concerns raised about the misgivings of this bill is invasion of privacy. It is feared that the bill will 
give the government excessive power as it can be able to control the freedom of speech and as well as the 
independence of the cyberspace. This entails that the government will be able to access information about anyone 
and there by controlling the activities of the cyberspace including those that are not criminal (ParlyReportSA, 2017).  
 
In addition, enactment of cyber laws will not guarantee behavioural change. This can be evidenced by traffic laws in 
which offenders are always there even if the laws are in place. It can be noted that in most of the cases people who 
commit offenses are repeat offenders. Furthermore, the majority of the victims of cyber assaults are reluctant to 
report the incidences in order to protect their image in the eyes of their stakeholders as well as the perception that the 
cost of the investigation is greater than the loss incurred. This notion will hamper the effective investigation and 
prosecution of cybercrime (Solomon, et al., 2011). 
 
3.3 Factors Influencing the Success of the Bill in the Investigation of Cybercrime in South Africa 
According to (Pillay, 2017) the bill provides for the establishment of central points in every sector of the economy 
with the mandate of informing of any cybercrime occurrences. In this regard, the bill also creates other structures 
such as the Cyber Response Committee which are mandated to promote and enforce cyber security in South Africa 
(Canny & Pillay, 2017). 
 
In addition, the bill empowers the state security agents which include the police to be able to enforce, investigate and 
prosecute cybercrimes. This is as a result of the requirement of organisations such as financial institutions, 
telecommunication service providers and banks to co-operate with these state agents in providing information and 
assistance required in prosecution and investigation (Hofmeyr, 2017). 
 
4. CONCLUSION  
It is the obligation of the government to ensure that its citizenry is secured in all aspects of 
security. One way of guaranteeing this is by proclaiming laws. The proclamation of legislation 
with regards to cyber security indicates the significance of putting into place extensive governing 
frame of reference. This has a positive impact of contributing to the contraction of security 
occurrences. It also improves and institutes an acceptable cyber security culture. In spite of all 
these dividends that such enactments may convey to the security of digital resources, the real 
world scenario is that there is the existence of a number of conflicts, positions and contradictions 
implying that the process of implementing these enactments is a mammoth task. 
 
In this regard, the Cyber Crime and Cyber Security Bill being promulgated for the Republic of 
Zimbabwe will go a long way in supporting the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime as 
this sets a legal framework on which the cyber space can be regulated. It lays the foundation on 
what is expected of those who harbor sensitive digital data of individuals and business 
organizations thereby contributing towards increased cyber security. It also empowers the agents 
of the government concerned with investigations, monitoring and prosecution of cybercrime to 
carry out their duties effectively within the confines of the law and hence the reduction in 
cybercrime instances.  
 
In addition, the bill allows for the creation of alliances with other nations as this helps in tackling 
cases where the perpetrator is not within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Zimbabwe laws. This

Abstract   
 
These days, financial institutions such as banks are highly exposed to different cyberattacks and their 
electronic payment system is among the targets of the attack. This study is aimed at assessing the 
information security management practice with focus on electronic banking system in selected financial 
institutions in Ethiopia using international information security standard as a benchmark in order to 
identify the gaps and recommend the best security practices to help the financial institutions meet the 
required security compliance. Two financial sectors were purposively selected.  All the IT staff in the IT 
departments of the two institutions were included in this study. Quantitative data was collected using 
PCI-DSS security standard questionnaire. In addition to the questionnaire, observation and document 
analysis was made. The result shows that most of the essential security management activities in the 
financial sectors do not comply to meet the international security standard. Similarly, the level of most of 
the indispensable security requirement that should be in place is found below the acceptable level. 
The study also revealed the major security factors that prohibit the financial sectors from the PCI-DSS 
security standard compliance. Thus, recommendations for practice are forwarded to support the 
financial sectors’ effort to withstand and mitigate cyberattacks.

1. Introduction 
 
In the current competitive business environment, Information is the most valuable and fundamental asset in any 
organization. Therefore, protecting the security of information is very important and becoming a top priority for 
many organizations (Heru et al 2011). To protect this valuable asset, information, there should be a proper 
information security practice and management that keep information from a wide range of internal and external 
threats and preserve its value to the organizations. As Shi-Ming et al (2006) noted, if organizations follow the 
guidelines and standards to set up their security policy, they could own a tighter and more complete IT environment. 
Organization could also safeguard their business value and benefit from IT if there is a well-developed information 
security management. In addition to this, businesses also need to implement rules and controls around the protection

Abstract 
 
Manufacturing of sound-absorbing panels typically uses synthetic materials such as fiberglass and wool fibers. In this 
paper, biomass as acoustic absorbing materials were considered as an alternative to synthetic materials because it can 
provide a more economical perspective to the supply of sound-absorbing materials. In this study, three (3) fibrous 
materials were used as the main component of the sound-absorbing panels. These materials include coconut (cocos 
nucifera), corn (zea mays), and banana (musa balbisiana). Moreover, this paper aims to manufacture sound-absorbing 
panels made from local biomass materials and determine its characteristic potential as acoustic sound absorbers using 
a custom-made impedance tube. To test the potential of the biomass materials as sound absorbers, its individual sound-
absorbing coefficients were measured. In the impedance tube results, the data obtained from the biomass materials 
were compared to the data obtained from the conventional material. All the panels made from biomass materials were 
able to absorb sound significantly and level the characteristic qualities of sound absorbers made from conventional 
materials. Therefore, improving the design of the impedance tube and fabrication of panels can increase the sound 
absorption coefficient of the manufactured materials.

1. Introduction 
This study involves the design and development of sound-absorbing panels made from the biomass materials. The 
study focuses on the capabilities of biomass materials as sustainable acoustic sound absorbers. This paper is an 
investigation of the potential of biomass materials as a major component in the manufacturing of sound-absorbing 
panels. It is based on the foundation of acoustic absorption. The usual materials that are used in the market are 
fiberglass and wool fibers. In this paper, the properties that affect the potential of biomass materials as sound absorbers 
are explored. Biomass materials are organic materials that originate from living organisms. Mostly, the potential of 
biomass material as a sound absorber is dependent on its fibers (Bastos et al., 2012). In the manufacturing of the 
panels, three fibrous materials will be used as the main component of the sound-absorbing panel. Potential fibrous 
materials include coconut (cocos nucifera), corn (zea mays), and banana (musa balbisiana). 
 
The study has a wide range of applications. Sound absorbing panels are usually used for sound reductions or 
soundproofing in rooms. The measure of how much a sound-absorbing panel can absorb is called the sound-absorbing 
coefficient. To test the potential of the biomass materials, their individual sound absorbing coefficient will be 
measured. The measurement will be done using an impedance tube. An impedance tube is a standardized testing device 
that measures the sound-absorbing coefficient of a material. The device tests wave at normal incidence. A comparison

2140","For the experimental result, the absorption coefficient of the Rockwool insulation panel was high and close to the 
value of 1 as expected. For the panels made from biomass materials, the results show an excellent experimental setup 
with a good result when compared to the result of conventional material, which is the ideal case. Since a good sound 
absorbent material should have a high absorption coefficient value, the manufactured biomass panels can be 
considered as a good sound-absorbing material. The researchers can say that the results from the custom-made 
impedance tube using biomass materials as sound-absorbing panels agree well with those obtained from the panels 
made from Rockwool fibers. 
 
Additionally, the researchers were able to determine the properties that affect the potential of biomass materials as 
sound-absorbing panels. They have determined that frequency has a significant relationship to the sound absorption 
coefficients of the biomass materials. The conclusion was based on the interpretation of the solution that resulted from 
the computation of the formula that was used. In the computation using Pearson’s r formula for the sound absorption 
coefficient of coconut panel and frequency, the result of the r is 0.962110336. According to the study, the closer the 
result is to +1, the higher and stronger the relationship is between the two variables. The variables that were used in 
the computation were the frequency (variable x) and the sound absorption coefficients of the coconut panel (variable 
y). 
 
In the computation using Pearson's r formula for the sound absorption coefficient of the banana panel and frequency, 
the result of the r is 0.961053991. The variables that were used in the computation was the frequency (variable x) and 
the sound absorption coefficients of the coconut panel (variable y). Lastly, in the computation using the Pearson’s r 
formula for the sound absorption coefficient of corn panel and frequency, the result of the r is 0.952284335. The 
variables that were used in the computation was the frequency (variable x) and the sound absorption coefficients of 
the corn panel (variable y). 
 
It can be concluded that there is a very high positive relationship between the two variables: frequency and the sound 
absorption coefficients of the biomass materials. All the results fell into the 0.70 or higher range which is equivalent 
to a very high positive interpretation. This could mean that the relationship between the two variables is very 
significant. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The researchers have manufactured sound-absorbing panels made from biomass materials. They have utilized three 
fibers and produced coconut husk fiber panel, corn husk fiber panel, and banana trunk fiber panel. The panels were 
made up of 1 kg of each fiber with a surface area of 0.3 m2, and a binding agent for the panel to stick together. 
Moreover, the panels were made up mostly of the fibers to ensure that no other factors will affect the performance of 
the acoustic panels. Based on the experiment, the sound-absorbing panels made from local biomass materials had 
significant performances in terms of its sound-absorbing properties. The manufactured panels were able to absorb 
sound and acquire necessary acoustical characteristics based on the application of the absorption coefficient. But 
compared to the measured sound absorption coefficient of the conventional material, the biomass materials were not 
able to surpass the characteristic qualities of sound absorbers made from conventional materials. Although the biomass 
materials do not surpass that of the conventional materials, this study is still useful considering that it can lessen the 
use of materials that cause pollution to the environment as well as materials that take large amounts of energy to 
process. 
 
Similarly, a custom-made impedance tube was assembled using ASTM and ISO standards as references. One of the 
objectives of this study is to manufacture sound-absorbing panels made from biomass materials using a custom testing 
procedure that will demonstrate the measurement of sound absorption and compare the result to conventional 
materials. The assembled impedance tube includes a full range loudspeaker, PVC pipe, signal source, test sample, an 
omnidirectional microphone, and other essential elements to conduct the absorption experiment effectively. To acquire 
the necessary data from the experiment, the researchers have used a laptop and mobile phone for digital frequency 
analysis. The overall performance of the two-microphone method is good except that the researchers had trouble 
finding an accurate result for measuring the absorbed sound level of the materials. 
 
In addition, the testing for the sound absorption coefficient was done using the two-microphone method. A thick layer 
of the Rockwool insulation panel was used and considered to absorb a large amount of sound. For the panels made 
from biomass materials, different layers of thicknesses were manufactured since the fiber materials have different 
volume and density. The volume of the coconut husk fibers is much larger than the volume of an equal mass of banana

2146","trunk fibers or corn husk fibers. This means that the coconut panel is less dense than that of banana and corn panels. 
As defined in the paper, a material is said to be very sound absorbing if it has a high absorption coefficient. The sound 
absorption coefficient, a dimensionless number that ranges from zero equal to one, is the amount of sound energy 
being absorbed or reflected by the material. Hence, assuming a material has a value close to 1, then it is considered a 
highly sound-absorbing material. 
 
To aid future researchers in further developing this study, it is recommended that in creating the panels, they should 
divide the raw materials into portions that would make the adhesive spread more evenly throughout. They should also 
make sure that the raw materials used are mixed properly with the adhesive or else it may result in the final product 
to shed, hence, making the surface rough. It is also strongly suggested that the raw materials be cut into small pieces 
so that the adhesive will, again, easily spread. 
 
In constructing the impedance tube, the researchers recommend that the microphones to be used must be identical to 
avoid any errors in receiving the vibrations. It should be noted that making use of an omnidirectional microphone is a 
great investment. It receives sound from all sides; thus, it will be clearer compared to the straight type of microphone 
which is commonly used in videokes. Moreover, with regards to the speakers, purchasing a full range type is highly 
recommended. This is so that frequency it can produce will have a wide span, about 100 Hz to 3, 000 Hz. Lastly, the 
researchers should experiment with quiet locations so that the surrounding sounds will not affect the results of the test. 
 
It is recommended that before working on the actual testing procedure for the determination of sound absorption 
coefficients of the test samples, the impedance tube setup must be tested first to know if the tube produces an accurate 
or in any case an acceptable result. To check if the setup works correctly, the conventional material or Rockwool 
insulation panel must be tested first since the said material is considered as a highly absorptive material.

Abstract  
 
The Philippines still has struggled in energy distribution throughout the country that nearly 35% of Filipino households 
still make use of charcoal as their fuel for cooking especially in rural areas. Using the traditional way of cooking leads 
to some serious health problems as charcoal is not burned efficiently leading to produce harmful contaminants that 
affect the indoor air quality (IAQ). This is the reason why Chen et al. (2015) made a study about designing and 
fabricating three improved charcoal-fueled stoves that were efficient and produce lesser harmful contaminants than 
the traditional stove. These stoves have undergone testing to check their efficiency and performance by using the water 
boiling test (WBT) provided by the Global Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves. For this reason, it became the research 
interest of the authors to design and fabricate a fan-powered stove and compare its IAQ exposure and performance to 
the charcoal-fueled stove developed by Chen et al. Major contaminants which are carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon 
monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM), were recorded in the IAQ assessment, while other IAQ criteria, which 
are temperature, relative humidity, fuel consumption, firepower and thermal efficiency were also measured and 
evaluated in the study. Based on the results of the water boiling test, the fan-powered stove developed by the 
researchers was much better than the charcoal-fueled stove in terms of performance except on the firepower. 
Furthermore, the fan-powered stove was efficient enough to lower the parameters within standards except for the 
Particulate Matter (PM).

1. Introduction 
According to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, about three billion people around the world use wood-fired 
cookstoves to cook their meals because of its low-cost biomass fuels, such as wood or charcoal. However, these 
common cook stoves are not properly designed and regulated to limit the emission of air pollutants which can affect 
the indoor air quality (IAQ) in household areas leading to indoor air pollution. Around 25% of black carbon emission 
in global output comes from traditional cookstoves which is a major factor contributing to indoor air pollution and 
climate change (Bond et al. 2007; Bond et al. 2004). These are all produced by inefficient cookstoves with poor 
combustion of its biomass fuel. Indoor air pollution is produced by biomass fuel such as charcoal which can cause 
several pulmonary sicknesses (Fullerton et al. 2008). According to the World Health Organization, exposures to this 
indoor air pollution lead to an estimated 4.3 million people dying every year. This study is part of a series of studies 
aimed at replicating the methodology used in the previous studies, but with more trials per cookstove.

4. Conclusion 
The water boiling test results of the fan powered cook stove were much higher than the study of Chen et al. (2015) 
due to better design and fabrication of the stove. In terms of stove performance, the charcoal-fueled cookstove had 
less time to boil, lower specific fuel consumption, higher thermal efficiency, high turn-down ratio but lower firepower 
compared to the results of the previous study. Based on the results of the IAQ assessment, it can be concluded that 
improving the design of the cookstove can lower the contaminants emitted. However, stove design improvement alone 
is not enough to lower the contaminants within standards. It was observed that cooking using charcoal-fueled 
cookstoves slightly affected the temperature and relative humidity at the breathing zone. However, the results obtained 
for the indoor temperature and relative humidity were not within standards which may be due to the heat from cooking.

Abstract 
 
This study focuses on the design, fabrication, and installation of a pico-hydro system in a rural community down South 
of Oriental Mindoro. The researchers were inspired by the fact that there are still many Filipinos that are deprived of 
having electricity, these were the people from remotes areas. Pico-Hydro system is not new to us anymore, but it can 
give help and provide free electricity to others if there is an abundant source of water in the area and available head 
good enough to produce electricity. The Department of Energy (DOE) manual was used as a reference for selecting 
the place for the study and for the methods in measuring the important parameters in the construction of the system. 
Major parts of the Pico-hydro were fabricated using the available materials from Calapan and Victoria, Oriental 
Mindoro. The researchers were able to produce a maximum output power of 211.5W with a water flow rate of 74.39 
L/s and an effective head of 2 meters. The produced output was lower than what the researchers had expected but is 
enough for the consumption of a small community.

1. Introduction 
The hydroelectric power is widely available in the world; it only varies with the design that suits a specific place or 
location. For this project, the researchers decided to use a crossflow type of turbine due to the low head and the water 
flow rate available in the community of Sitio Palayang Bayan. The minimum electricity demand in each house was 
also considered for the design of the Pico hydro system. 
 
The main objective of this study is to design, fabricate, and install a Pico Hydro System as an alternative power source 
for the small indigenous community living at Sitio Palayang Bayan, Brgy. Villa Cerveza, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. 
 
The Department of Energy (DOE) utilization management manuals and guidelines for micro-hydropower 
development in rural electrification were used as a reference in this study because they contain important information 
that can help the researchers in building the pico-hydro system. There are three main project cycles when developing 
a mini-hydropower these are planning stage, implementation stage, and operation stage. The first stage is project 
planning in here the selection of potential sites, site reconnaissance, and planning of potential sites must be done. In 
order to properly choose a site, the topographical map of the site and local information must be acquired. The most 
important is that the plant site must be near the load center and water source. The site must have a potential head that

These trials were done without using a dummy load. This is to monitor the rpm and the voltage that the system 
produces as we increase the load or the power usage during the testing. The power output is shown in Table 4.

These trials were done with the use of a 2SM type of battery as a dummy load. Its main function in the set-up is to 
store energy when the consumption is minimal and to avoid excessive rpm in the generator. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The pico-hydroelectric system was built in order to serve as a source of electricity for a small community in Sitio 
Palayang Bayan, Barangay Villa Cerveza Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. The design and fabrication of the system 
followed the parameters attained in the site which were 2.2-meter head and 74.3954 L/s water flow rate. Material that 
was needed to build the system was bought from the city not in Manila in order to lessen the expenses and avoid 
damages while transporting. The system was designed to generate power using a 3kVA generator. The maximum 
output that the system could generate is 211.5 watts while having a load of 23 watts and the generator is at 1930 rpm. 
 
In order to distribute the generated power, 10 makeshift electrical post and 300-meter-long electrical wires with a 
diameter of 1.25 sq.mm, and having a 12A rating was used. There is a circuit breaker to serve as a safety device in 
case of an emergency. 
 
A 2SM type of battery was used as a continuous power bank and energy reservoir in order to store the excess power 
generated when the electrical consumption was at a minimum. This is also to prevent the generator to have excessive 
rpm. The power bank is composed of a used battery charger, battery, and 300W inverter. The test result shows that 
the circuit containing the battery and the connected load was able to regulate the rpm but causing the power output to 
drop to 187 watts. The said output was observed to be enough for all the connected households since all they need 
was a light source during the night.

Abstract 
 
Carabao milk is particlarly known for having short shelf life if not refrigerated immediately after collection. The 
farmers in the vicinity of the Philippine Carabao Center address this problem by using ice and water to keep the freshly 
harvested milk refrigerated. This project was devised to find another way to travel the freshly harvested milk. To be 
able to refrigerate the container, thermoelectric coolers were used. These devices are compact and small in size but 
are capable of cooling reaching temperatures of up to below freezing temperatures. It develops a temperature 
difference as electricity passes through it, one side is cold, and the other is hot. The heat given off on the hot side 
needs to be rejected to be able to further decrease the temperature on the cold side. In this study, the researchers 
fabricated a container that was used as a cooling container for carabao milk. The main material used in the container 
was stainless-steel 304, and for the thermoelectric cooler, the researchers used a thermoelectric cooler that was 
available in the market with a power rating of 12V and 6A. For the heatsink and fan assembly, a thermal paste was 
used to integrate the thermoelectric cooler to the assembly to increase the heat transfer between the cold side and the 
container as well as the hot side and the heatsink. The cooling system was powered by two lead-acid battery and the 
battery was charged using a solar panel. The study was successful in preserving the quality of the carabao milk-based 
on Physico-chemical analysis done by Philippine Carabao Center (PCCP), however, it did not reach the desired 
temperature which was 4℃ due to several factors namely; fabrication of the flat side, battery power rating, insufficient 
number of the thermoelectric module used, and heat loss in the system.

1. Introduction 
Nutritionally, milk can be considered as a complete food. It has better nutritional benefits over cow’s milk because it 
is higher in calcium and energy but lower in cholesterol. Currently, the Philippines heavily imports almost 98% of 
milk and other dairy products available from other countries. The Philippines spend millions annually in buying milk 
from other countries, placing milk as the 4th highest agricultural import of the country. Out of 5 million kilograms of 
milk produced in the Philippines, 63% came from cows, 36% came from carabaos, and 1% of it came from goats 
(Marci & Tingcungco, 2016). 
 
Compared to cow’s milk, carabao’s milk is recorded to have 58% more calcium, 40% more protein, and 43% less 
cholesterol. There are now provinces and towns in the country which are into carabao (buffalo) raising. Some farmers 
are into this industry to maximize their profit from each carabao they own by producing a regular supply of carabao 
milk to milk stations in their region. One of the well-known provinces to have ample numbers of carabao is the

4. Conclusion 
This study was done to explore the range of thermoelectric technology applications. It was utilized as a cooling device 
for milk containers which deviates from conventional vapor-compression systems that require refrigerant in heat 
transfer. This study on thermoelectric cooler will help future researchers to assess its capacity and ability to reject 
heat. The main purpose of this study was to provide an alternative way of preserving the quality of carabao milk 
harvested by farmers. At present, they usually use large ice chests filled with a mixture of water and ice to lower its 
temperature until it arrives at the receiving facility. The receiving facility utilizes communal freezers to drastically 
reduce the milk temperature up to its safe storage limit. This prototype was a viable option for the farmers since it 
offers higher cooling capacity and lightweight characteristics compared to the ice chests they use in the transportation 
of milk from one place to another. 
 
This study has three objectives. The researchers were not able to meet the first objective which was to maintain the 
temperature of the milk for 2℃-4℃. This was mainly due to the existence of a thermal bridge in the system, time 
constraints of each test, and thermal contact of the thermoelectric module. The produced graph of cooling was a 
representation of an exponential function that estimates a total time of 7 hours before 4C can be attained. The second 
objective was met based on the physicochemical analysis from PCC which confirms that milk cooled using the 
portable container did not spoil after 2 hours of testing under actual environmental conditions. The last objective was 
to charge the battery using a solar panel. The researchers decided to use a 50W solar panel which could fully charge 
each battery for six hours. Based on the data given by PCC, it would take no more than one-hour travel time to reach 
the manufacturing plant even from the farthest cooperative. This enables farmers to charge the battery early right after 
its use to compensate for its long charging time. 
 
The fabrication process of the container is still not ideal for milk storage since cornered surfaces although not at 90-
degree angles still exist. The fabricated container contains corners with two surfaces having more than 90-degree 
intersection angles. This is due to part by part fabrication and lack of equipment utilized in fabricating the design. The 
flat side part of the container was also fabricated manually which leads to an unsmooth surface finish. A 
recommendation for improving the fabrication process of the container is to have it machined to have a smooth surface 
finish. The consequence however is the additional cost of fabrication. 
 
Lead-acid batteries used in the container are heavier than other types of batteries present in the market. It is used most 
of its flexibility in having huge power capacity that is not currently present in lighter batteries like lithium-ion. Future 
researchers are advised to consider using lighter batteries if improved power source that is available in the market. In 
addition, a higher battery rating is also highly recommended if the future researchers decided to increase the number 
of thermoelectric coolers to improve the cooling capacity.

Abstract 
 
Ventilation is considered as one of the engineering controls to remove or control contaminants released in indoor work 
environments. It is one of the preferred ways to control human exposure to air contaminants. It is commonly used to 
remove contaminants such as fumes, dust, and vapors; and to provide a healthy and safe environment. Industrial 
systems are designed to move out and bring in a specific amount of air at a specific speed, which results in the removal 
of undesirable contaminants. While all ventilation systems follow the same basic principles, each system is designed 
specifically to match the type of work and the rate of contaminant release in that area (CCOHS, 2020). One of the 
types of the industrial ventilation system is a tunnel ventilation system. Tunnel Ventilation System (TVS) is an 
essential part of maintaining a safe environment inside the tunnel during congestion and emergency operation. During 
the congestion scenario, TVS will operate to maintain the design temperature inside the tunnel. During the fire mode 
scenario, TVS will automatically operate via push-pull ventilation to control smoke direction away from the people 
to provide a safe escape pathway. It was also validated from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis that the 
result of subway environmental simulation (SES) airflow capacity for congestion and fire mode scenarios are sufficient 
throughout the tunnel. CFD analysis using Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS). FDS is the software used for analyzing 
smoke behavior in terms of airflow, temperature, relative humidity, velocity, and soot visibility. As part of the 
simulation result, the researchers were able to see the results on every part of the tunnel. One of the major advantages 
of CFD simulation is that the researchers can do trial and error on every possible scenario and location of the fire heat 
load to best analyze the situation in the worst-case scenario. Time is also an essential factor during fire mode, and the 
CFD simulation can be used as a basis for the emergency response team for a proper fire escape plan.

1. Introduction 
According to OSHA, indoor air quality has become an important health and safety concern. IAQ problems result from 
interactions between building materials and furnishing, activities within the building, climate, and building occupants. 
IAQ problems may arise from one or more of the following causes such as inadequate temperature, humidity, poor air 
circulation, ventilation system issues, indoor air contaminants, and insufficient outdoor air intake. Occupants of 
buildings with poor IAQ report a wide range of health problems which often include Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), 
Building-Related Illness (BRI), and Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS) (CCOHS, 2012).  
 
Given these conditions, it became the research interest of the authors to design a tunnel ventilation system for the 
underground metro rail station using a CFD simulation software, which is required to achieve a safe and clean

4.4. Emergency Operation Analysis via Pyrosim 
The emergency operations analysis is considered the result of the SES analysis. Based on the simulation in Figure 7, 
by using 1 x 70 m3/s TVF as supply fan at Station East end (Fan Room 02-02) and 2 x 70 m3/s TVF as exhaust fan at 
Station West end (Fan Room 03-01), it shows the fan operation mode and simulated underground tunnel achieved a 
velocity of up to 9 m/s. Results from this software are higher as it has a more accurate and specific location to get the 
air velocity. From the Pyrosim simulation result, it shows that at the front side of the train on fire the achieved airflow 
velocity is at 2.7 m/s during TVF emergency operation. This airflow velocity is greater than the critical velocity 
initially calculated on the SES which is 2.34 m/s. This interprets that during the start of the fire, and the smoke develops 
inside the tunnel, there will be no smoke backlayering going back to the station. As the achieved result, the proposed 
escape route will be against the supply airflow where the passenger will exit to the Station. For the full load operation 
of the TVF, the achieved velocity ranges from 7 to 9 m/s. This higher value of velocity is caused by the area of the 
tunnel became smaller on the part where the train is located.

5. Conclusion 
From the SES result during congestion scenarios, the Push-Pull ventilation operational strategy shows the effectivity 
of maintaining the tunnel temperature at 37.36 deg. C below as indicated on the design criteria of 45 deg. C. With 
direct airflow towards the incident train within the tunnel, with one (1) TVF unit is for supply air from Station east 
end and one (1) TVF unit for exhaust air from Station west end. These results are verified via Pyrosim CFD analysis, 
using the airflow capacity of the TVF developed on the SES result, the tunnel temperature has the result of 36.7 °C to 
37.4 °C. With the temperature of the tunnel not exceeding the design criteria, the push-pull ventilation strategy is the 
proper way of ventilation for the underground tunnel.

2181","From the SES result during emergency scenarios, smokes from the fire train is effectively directed towards the station 
platform farthest from the fire to give way for the passengers to escape free of smoke on the opposite side where the 
platform is nearest. As a requirement to prevent smoke back layering the annular velocity result of 2.42 m/s is greater 
than the critical velocity of 2.34 m/s. One (1) TVF unit is for supply air from Station east end and two (2) TVF unit 
for exhaust air from Station west end. 
 
It is highly recommended to perform a CFD analysis verification for this kind in the application as this can simulate 
the possible condition more accurately than the SES one-line diagram results. CFD can give you the condition on 
every part of the simulated scenario, and visually by color map, it can be analyzed more easily. SES had a limited 
output result that of one-dimensional means you can only see the result at a specific area or location on the tunnel, 
disparate to CFD analysis, results are given for the whole area of the simulation and the researchers can have more 
understanding of the scenario as it can show the full picture of the simulation.

Abstract  
 
This study focuses on the design and development of a molding machine that can be used in the process of making 
edible gum paste petals for export-quality cake decorations of a certain company situated in the Philippines. During 
the period of the study, the company employs manual labor in their production process. The processes of making these 
cake decorations (rose gum paste) include kneading/sheeting of sugar gum paste followed by manual cutting of petals 
or herbs, then manual thinning, and forming the cut petal tips, and finally, manual joining or sticking of petals to form 
a rose decoration. The researchers were able to develop a molding machine with the application of Computer-Aided 
Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and pneumatics technology to speed up the company's cutting, 
thinning, and forming processes of rose gum paste. Sheets of gum paste were used to evaluate the performance of the 
molding machine.

1. Introduction 
Rose petals decorations for cakes are produced manually with the use of the machine during the kneading process of 
sugar gum paste. Sugar gum paste or gum paste is a blend of shortening, protein, powdered confectioner's sugar 
(sucrose), protein, shortening, gum, and water (Phillips, 2008). It is widely used for cake decorations, artificial flower 
arrangements, and historical reformation (Mason, 2004). This study is about the design of a machine used to form a 
rose petal made from sugar gum paste. Principles of pneumatics and compression molding and computer-aided design 
technique were applied. Different machines and tools are already available in the market that are being used in the 
food manufacturing industry making food products of complex shapes. A Circuit Cake Machine was developed by 
Provo Craft, a US company familiar with performing or cutting of different products. In 2007, Provo Craft started the 
initial research and development of the Circuit Cake machine. This machine is capable of cutting the different shapes 
of kneaded gum paste for cake decorations and is limited to cutting of 2- Dimensional (2D) gum paste only. This 
foodstuff crafting machine was patented in 2011. The Three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing 
(AM) technology is driving major innovations in food manufacturing due to its capability to produce 3D objects with 
complicated geometry. One of the 3D printing techniques today is the ""soft-material extrusion"" which is used to print 
cake frosting (Godoi, Prakash and Bhandari, 2016). In line with the forming of 3D objects, three-dimensional molding 
is also one of the techniques being used today in forming three-dimensional objects such as in the molding of plastics 
and in the molding of furniture parts with unusual shapes (warped). This technique was applied to form a rose petal 
made of gum paste. Mechanization is one of the techniques applied to the industry to improve the production process 
since it can save money, time, and reduce drudgery. Therefore, in line with the process mentioned, the researchers aim 
to speed up the process of cutting, thinning, and forming of rose petals by designing and developing a machine that 
cuts and forms the rose petal gum paste. With this, the main objective of this study to speed up the company’s cutting,

5. Conclusion 
The researchers were able to develop a molding machine for petal shape gum paste with the use of CAD/CAM and 
Fluidsim software. The molding machine was fabricated based on the final design and its components were selected 
based on design calculation, availability, and costs. Also, the trial shows that the molding machine was able to meet 
the desire functions to produce 3D molded gum paste of rose petal in shape. Manual cutting of the existing process 
was eliminated and the process was improved, but the operator risk of being lacerated was eliminated also. Since the 
production capacity can be increased by 58.72% or 4,397 roses/month, therefore, the company’s cutting, thinning, and 
forming processes for rose gum paste can be improved with the use of the molding machine. With a monthly net 
income difference of Php 9,469.43, the investment can be recovered based on a payback period of 6 months, therefore, 
the project is feasible and good to invest in.

Abstract 
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are recently preferred for the implementations of low-energy consumption 
illumination systems because of their non-thermal light production effect. Solar rechargeable batteries can 
be used to power Light emitting diodes lights (LED-lights), but their costs increase with their charge storage 
capacity. Electric lights are often required to operate for a period that do not exceed 24 hours and are only 
mainly necessary to operate whenever there is a nearby person. In this study, a microcontroller that is 
interfaced with the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a Passive Infra-Red sensor (PIR) will detect the 
presence of moving bodies and darkness to switch on LED lights for a predetermined period. The 
microcontroller code and hardware has been designed to optimize energy consumption by enabling low 
microcontroller clocking frequency and sleep mode features. A Data Acquisition System (DAS) has been 
used to assist with the evaluation of a solar site in question. The use of LDR, PIR, a DAS, low clocking 
frequencies and sleep mode feature of the microcontroller has made it feasible to use less capacity solar 
rechargeable battery for the supply of LED lighting system over longer periods.

Introduction 
The world is showing a gradual shift towards the use of renewable energy. Amongst some of the factors in 
considerations is the environmental friendliness of solar energy as described in [1]. Photovoltaic energy is 
one of the easily acquirable energy [2] but its stability relies on both short term weather conditions as well as 
long term climatic conditions [3]. DAS systems were used in [4]and  [5] to study the long term climate 
changes and short term weather conditions.  Accurate meteorological data is a fundamental requirement for 
the design of  photovoltaic systems [6]. Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems can be used as a primary electrical 
energy source when configured to work as stand-alone [7], back-up systems in hybrid mode and to 
supplement commercial energy supply for the grid connected systems [8]. In all applications that have been 
just mentioned, PV energy will provide cheaper and cleaner electricity.

Literature Review 
 
2.1 
Energy saving Light Emitting Diodes lights 
 
LED- lights have gained applications that range from usage in small buildings to outdoors [9]. They tend to 
consume less power when compared to their thermal based counterpart. This research explored various 
techniques to enhance the operational duration of LED lights that are battery powered. 
  
 
2.2 
Battery powered illumination systems 
 
LED lights are suitable to be powered from low voltage DC power sources [10], however commercially 
electricity is supplied as AC voltage above 100 V. In order to power LED lights with commercial electricity 
supply, the voltage supply is lowered to the required amount by an electronic circuitry which is integrated to 
the light bulb as illustrated in Figure 1. An exclusion of this voltage lowering circuitry may enable batteries 
to directly power these types of LED lights.

Conclusions 
From the results that were obtained in this study, it is clear that the operational time of a battery used to power LED lights 
was optimized by: 
• 
A careful study of the location’s solar insulation profile. 
• 
Incorporating PIR and Day- night switches to detect the necessity to switch on lights 
• 
a use of microcontroller to control the LED lights switching activities. 
• 
Lowering the clock frequency of the microcontroller whilst utilizing sleep feature. 
Considering all this factors will benefit the designers to use smallest and cheapest battery for their illumination tasks.

Abstract 
 
Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) have already been used to acquire signals that range from medical, renewable energy, audio, 
etc. Photovoltaic PV) produced energy signals regularly vary with the amount of received solar irradiance and environmental 
factors such as the solar panel temperatures. Users with the interest of knowing the degree of PV output energy variations 
often use online solar maps and climatic records to build and evaluate solar profiles. This research proposes to take advantage 
of the dropping prices and high performance of microcontrollers to build aa DAS that will be used to monitor and logs PV 
produced power together with surrounding temperature values. The microcontroller circuit is interfaced to a voltage /current 
detector, temperature sensor and an optional battery detection circuit. The logging aspect will also enable solar profiling of 
received solar irradiance and PV panel temperatures, which will then reduce the reliance upon solar maps and climatic data 
that are not always free. By using a DAS, users will be able to monitor and build their custom solar profiles based on received 
solar irradiance together with temperature information. The stored records or live information will be useful in the maintenance 
or upgrades of Photovoltaic energy systems.

1. Introduction 
 
The ever changing climatic condition is a reality [1]. Since performances of all forms of photovoltaic system is influenced by 
weather conditions, it is now becoming necessary to closely monitor and record their performance in order to take informed 
short term or long term corrective measures. In some instances, where hybrid systems are used; good knowledge about solar 
resources will enable proper management of available power sources. e.g. the system may be switched to diesel whenever the 
cloudy weather persists. The use of photovoltaic energy has gained momentum over the past 10 years [2]. This rise is caused 
by increased electricity cost and a need to save the ozone layer [3]. South Africans are experiencing several scheduled 
blackouts since 2014; thanks to ageing power stations, electricity theft and equipment vandalism. As a solutions to these 
blackouts called Load shedding; stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems may be used to provide backup electricity supply as 
explained in [4]. In order for standalone systems design to succeed, solar profile of various regions will have to be created 
using techniques that may be similar to those discussed by [5]. Battery bank operational time has serious impact onto the 
performance of Stand-alone PV systems. Poorly designed systems will result to small or oversized battery-bank.  In a case of 
small battery-banks that are not monitored, the system will over-discharge the batteries to cause a costly damage.

Literature review 
 
2.1 
Solar energy profiling 
 
Solar site survey refers to the process of evaluating the site that will be hosting PV system for its ability to produce adequate 
solar insolation required for the production of desired output power within the available financial budget [6]. The output of 
this survey is a solar energy profile. In [7] and [8] solar energy profile has been built by using small PV panels together with 
a Data Acquisition System (DAS). Solar irradiance records that were obtained over a certain time period are stored and 
thereafter compared to the prevailing load requirement. With this strategy, the solar energy is expected to be equal or more 
than what the load demands.

Real-time solar power and roof temperatures were successfully acquired by microcontroller based DAS, which was interfaced 
to appropriate sensors as described. By using proper formulas, it will be therefore possible to record accurate values that will 
be thereafter used to profile the performance of a photovoltaic system. Having profile may remove the necessity of solar maps 
for the design of future solar system within the same location. A simple 12-volt battery detection may also be implemented 
by using LM7809 fixed voltage regulator.

Abstract   
 
The importance of protecting information in banks and mitigating security breach is becoming more 
important than ever. Human factors represent essential issues in information systems security in 
organizations, since human factors determine the behavior of employees toward information systems 
security. Extant literature revealed that the human factor aspect is one of the emerging research areas in 
information security. Thus, this research tries to explore information systems security countermeasures that 
are used to reduce internal threat and how employees perceive them and create a human factors model to 
address human factor gaps in information systems security in commercial banks in Ethiopia. Accordingly, 
a conceptual human factor model is developed from literature. A qualitative case study research design is 
employed to validate the proposed conceptual framework in selected banks in Ethiopia. Purposive sampling 
is employed to select the sampled banks. The samples are selected based on eligibility criteria that the 
respondents should have experience and expertise in information systems security and the banking 
activities. The research contributes to the current knowledge of information security by demonstrating the 
importance and critical role of human factors in the development of an information systems security model. 
The main contribution would be the advancement of the theoretical and practical basis for information 
systems security in proposing a model framework for developing, assessing and modeling a human factor 
model. Furthermore, it improves the understanding of risks in the security incident stages in relation to 
human factors.

1. Introduction 
 
Human factors represent essential issue in information systems security in organizations, since human factors 
determine the behavior of employees toward information systems security. The only application of information 
systems security technologies could not always result in the improved information systems security as security is 
largely associated with people. The interaction between human and information systems have always opened the 
chance for many security risks (Alhogail et al. 2015; Naidoo, 2020). To improve the security of information assets, an

privately owned computers, notebooks and smart phones that were connected to the bank network. 
 
With regard to training, the banks under investigation have included in their policy that IT department is responsible 
to develop and provide training to business users with the skills they need to correctly use business applications, 
computer equipment, portable storage media, networking technologies and mobile devices in a secure way. The banks 
procedure also states that failure to comply with the policies and procedures of the information systems security of 
the banks may result in an employee to face administrative action ranging from counseling to removal from the bank 
as well as any criminal penalties or financial liabilities depending on the severity of of the misuse. But, practically 
there was no time for the banks under investigation this had occurred. However, the findings of the study suggested 
two concepts of information systems security in banks. These are: firstly, the current culture of the employees in banks 
does not promote information systems security. Secondly, the awareness of the employees towards information 
systems security is poor due to lack or adequate information systems training and skill. From the findings of the study 
there is a relationship among the first concept, the second concept and information systems security. Accordingly, 
information systems security involves training employees and enhancing their knowledge and skill and promote a 
culture that help secure information systems security. This in turn help achieve the business goals and objectives. 
 
 
6. Conclusion and Way Forward   
 
The main reason of writing the literature review is to present theoretical basis as an input for the research. This chapter 
consists of two main parts. The first part is a theoretical literature and the second part is literature about related work. 
It is assumed that 50 - 70 % of overall information systems security incidents in organizations result from the 
employees’ misuse that is ranging from naïve mistakes to an intentional harm (Siponen & Vance 2010). Therefore, 
improving the information systems security needs both investments in the technical, social and organizational 
resources (Bulgurcu et al. 2010). Therefore, recent studies need to be shifted the focus to organizational, 
environmental, and individual factors that influence employees’ behavior, as they are regarded as the weakest link in 
information systems security (Siponen 2010, Bulgurcu et al. 2010). The prior researchers have found that increasing 
employees’ information systems awareness has a strong positive effect on their information systems policy compliant 
behavior (Bulgurcu et al. 2010).  
 
This research is, therefore, designed to investigate the literature relating mainly to policy, culture and training to 
information systems security. There is a need to address issues relating to policy, culture and training in order to design 
information systems security model for commercial banks in Ethiopia. The reviewed literature includes some very 
recent studies conducted in 2019 and some studies conducted in not more than ten years. From the literature, it is 
found that the relationship between policy, culture and awareness to information systems security has been examined 
and investigated by different scholars in different contexts. Furthermore, this relationship is articulated in a model 
created by the researchers (Figure 1).   
 
The research contributes to the current knowledge of information security by demonstrating the importance and critical 
role of human factors in the development of an information systems security model. The main contribution would be 
the advancement of the theoretical and practical basis for information systems security in proposing a model 
framework for developing, assessing and modeling a human factor model. Furthermore, it improves the understanding 
of risks in the security incident stages in relation to human factors. The research examines the role of human factors 
in information systems security processes. The findings emphasize the importance of human factors in today’s 
information security context and provide guidance on addressing the risk to and return on security investments. This 
could perhaps serve to improve the commercial banks performance, competitiveness and effectiveness of their security 
policies and guidelines.  
 
This research can also benefit the government and National Bank of Ethiopia in their effort and mission to make policy 
for commercial banks since they are policy makers and regulatory agents to maintain healthy economy. Furthermore, 
managers or decision makers in banks can be benefited from the outcome of this research by understanding the 
employees’ behaviour that can affect information systems security to improve data security. Also practitioners can 
use the knowledge developed in this research for training and education.

Abstract 
All higher education establishments, from small colleges to large campus institutions, are involved in some complex 
processes to deliver effective teaching and learning. It is usually plain to see that there is room for improvement for 
the methods used. The issue now becomes, how do they tackle the problems and what do they tackle first? The 
implementation of new systems then becomes imperative since it’s usually a drive for considering how to carry out 
the business process. This research paper aim to go further in mapping and modelling of Business Process University 
in Indonesia level 0 to level 1. Using SIPOC we go one level on 3 (three) core processes namely the process of 
Teaching and Learning, Research and Community Service, 4 (four) directing processes namely Strategic Planning, 
Quality Management & Quality Assurance, Performance Management and KPI as well as Organizational and Business 
Development and 5 (five) supporting processes namely HR management, ICT Management, General Affair 
Management, Financial and Accounting Management and Marketing and the Public Relationship Management. By 
utilizing Excellence indicators from the Malcolm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence (MBCfPE), we 
manage to map and model 14 (fourteen) processes of level 1 in a simple but inclusive form. Further study still needed 
to map and model the process to level 2 and or Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that will be ready to connect to 
dashboard performance management system.

Abstract   
 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) packages have transformed the way organizations go about the 
process of providing Information Systems. Existing literature has suggested that there are different critical 
success factors that contribute to success of ERP implementation. However, the factors more peculiar to 
the public and private organizations are not well identified. The main goal of this research is to identify 
those critical success factors of ERP implementation that mainly work for private and those for public 
organizations in Ethiopian context. Understanding this can help in successful implementation of ERP 
systems in those two organizational contexts. A descriptive survey design is employed to identify the 
more critical factors that affect ERP implementation in private and public organizations. To identify the 
critical factors that affect ERP implementation in both organizations, Pareto approach was applied. 
Purposive sampling technique was used to collect the data in both cases. The findings show that 
availability and facilitation of IT infrastructure, teamwork composition, top management support and 
commitment are crucial issues that were identified in both cases. However, business process 
reengineering and software configuration, training and support for users, end user involvement, and 
existence of communication plan, consultant selection and relationship are identified as crucial factors 
that were found in private organization. On the other hand, budgetary constraints, financial plan, 
implementation strategy and time frame, customization/localization of software according to environment 
are identified as the top critical factors that found in public organization. Based on key findings, 
recommendations are forwarded for practice in order to enhance their ERP implementation.

Abstract  
 
The climate in a hospital’s operating theatre in terms of temperature, air flow and humidity affects medical personnel’s 
working conditions and the healing process for patients. Evaporative cooling technology is a sustainable option whose 
latent load can be handled desiccant dehumidification. The combination of a liquid desiccant and electro-
hydrodynamic techniques to produce small droplets with increased surface contact for humidity reduction is 
commendable. Accordingly, this study is centered on developing Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations in 
ANSYS FLUENT for electrospray modelling. A numerical code is developed to simultaneously solve the coupled 
electrohydrodynamic and electrostatic equations and determine the shape of cone jet as an effect of the applied electric 
field for a glycerol electrospray in an air dehumidification system. The Volume of Fluid model of CFD FLUENT and 
Melcher-Taylor leaky dielectric model was established. The CFD model developed does not include a droplet break-
up and the dynamics of droplet evaporation.

1. Introduction 
 
The microclimate in hospitals disturbs working conditions of the medical personnel and healing process for patients 
under treatment. To ensure a conducive healing climate, Zimbabwe’s tertiary hospitals employ vapour compression 
based systems, (VCS), to condition air as per tradition (Ascione et al., 2013) but these have been condemned of their 
considerable dependency on electricity (Tao, et al 2019). This is so because  the sensible and latent heat load are 
handled by cooling air below due point which at times may require reheating to achieve required temperature. The use 
of ozone layer depleting and global warming chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) based 
refrigerants in VCS is disturbing. The unsustainability of these systems has pushed for the development of sustainable 
green air conditioning system technologies in which sensible and latent heat loads can be handled separately (Tao, et

Evaporative cooling technology is non-polluting and energy efficient (Oliveira et al., 2000; Buker and Riffat, 2016; 
Rafique et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2015; Teke and Timur, 2014). The sensible load is removed by evaporating the water 
on a pad using the air’s sensible heat as it passes through a wetted pad using a quarter  of VCS’s energy (Rafique et 
al., 2015; Khoukhi, 2013; Luo et al., 2016; Rong et al., 2017) and water (R718) as refrigerant which is non-polluting 
(Maurya, et al, 2014).  
 
The latent load in form of extra water in processed air is a challenge in humid and tropical climates like Zimbabwe’s, 
(Guan, et al, 2015). This latent load after evaporative cooling can be handled by electrochemical and desiccant 
dehumidification (Jain, et al, 1994; Fakhrabadi and Kowsary, 2016). Solid desiccant technology have proved to be 
inefficient and consume high energy (Fakhrabadi and Kowsary, 2016; O’Connor, et al 2016) thus research is looking

This simulation show that diameter of resulting jet of electrosprayed glycerol quickly disintegrates after the throttle. 
There is need to simulate jet formation using different emitter diameters in order to come up with a nozzle diameter 
which results in a strong jet. Varying the electric potential may also help positive results. The volume fraction for jet 
formation is presented in Figure 7 and it can be seen that glycerol bubbles are generated throughout the time of analysis.  
 
 
 
Figure 7: Volume fraction chart 
 
In order to produce a strong jet, it requires a higher onset potential for a liquid with higher surface tension. Contrary 
to this, an emitter of smaller diameter have need of lower onset potential if the value of surface tension is to be constant. 
This is for the reason thatreduction in emitter diameter results in a rise in electric field strength. Therefore for better 
analysis, multi-micro sized emitters are a necessity for quality electrospraying process.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations in ANSYS FLUENT has been successfully done for 
glycerol based electrospray. A numerical code has developed to simultaneously solve the coupled

field in an air dehumidification system. The emitter is observed to have been able to generate a jet with an applied 
electric potential and given liquid desiccant properties, making it appropriate for the analysis. There is a correlation 
which exists between spray current and jet diameter and the flow rate, potential difference, surface tension and the 
viscosity, as confirmed by results in literature.

Abstract 
 
The important role played by the small-medium scale contractors in Indonesia has been flawed by their lack of 
performance and inefficiency. It demands improvement through innovation processes. Yet, the endeavor has been 
challenged by the limitation in sources of funding. This study therefore, was set to investigate the significance of the 
available source of funding to the innovation processes for Indonesian small-medium scale contractors. The result has 
shown that majority of the respondents were not having difficulties in accessing source of funding. Moreover, the 
interest rate was the most highlighted by the respondents amongst financial factors which might stimulate the 
innovation. However, the available source of funding still could not support the innovation processes. A solution has 
been proposed in order to overcome the problems. It is a system which has scanning, monitoring and training processes 
in one complete mechanism and known as microcredit. All the respondents agreed that the program would boost the 
industry performance. Yet, there was a major concern shown by the respondents for its contingency and success. The 
program would also bring a major change to the industry’s structure.

1. Introduction 
Globalization has become a major challenge for the construction industry and changed its structure. Globalization 
means that the boundaries are becoming wider, in context of opportunities and challenges. The Indonesian construction 
industry naturally has become one of the effected sectors which needed to respond to it. Yet, Soeprapto and 
Trigunarsyah [2005] argued that the Indonesian construction industry was not ready to enter the competition. Major 
changes and contingency endeavors need to be done by the industry. On the other hand, the highlighted for the industry 
was 60% market share was taken by the big scale contractors which registered only 1% from all Indonesian 
contractors’ population [Afriyanto, 2016]. Therefore, further studies and major concerns are needed to be addressed 
to the small-medium scale contractors due to their improvement for surviving within the industry. 
 
Under the heading of small-medium scale contractors, surviving within the industry is equally with a continuous 
improvement or innovation. The construction industry has a unique characteristic. Almost all construction projects 
are temporary basis activities whilst as a corporate the construction companies are managed based on day to day basis 
activities. In more common words, the incomes are temporarily whilst spending are continuous. Inadequate in liquidity 
to support the daily activities has brought many construction companies out of the business [as Singh and Lokanathan, 
1992; cited by Nesan, 2012]. On the other hands, contractors which part of construction companies, tend to bid lower 
prices in order to stay within the business. By doing this, contractors take more risks beyond their power and make 
them more vulnerable to the unexpected financial aspects during the project completions [Purnus and Bodea, 2015].

2238","4.2. Discussion 
Within this sub-chapter, the discussion constructs analysis based on literature reviews and gathered questioner’s 
data. The discussion answers questions which been stated as research’s objectives. 
 
“What are the kinds of financing sources currently used by small-medium scale contractors in Indonesia?” 
 
As has been discussed earlier, the economic crisis experienced in some time period of Indonesia economy has 
changed many aspects of the financial structure. Difficulties have been also experienced by the construction industry. 
The sources of funding used by the industry and an overview on how it has been accessed will be explored. 
  
The economic crisis has shifted the Indonesian financial behavior. Many financial institutions tend to relocate 
their credits. This condition has brought difficulties to the contractors with limited resources. Moreover, the economic 
recovery does not mean that the industry performance has healed to the level it had before the crisis. It has been 
confirmed by the research that the majority of the respondents are still distressed by the difficulties accessing sources 
of funding.  
 
On the other hand, the research finds that the majority of the respondents have used a combination between 
private and debt sources of funding as their main resource. Many factors have forced the firms to be more flexible and 
creative combining the available resources. The diversity of the projects undertaken, delay on the payment process 
and complicated credit/loan processes have forced the firms to have options for the financial resources. 
 
Finally, concerning the methods used by the enterprises to access debt or credit the research has found that the 
majority of the respondents have utilized their projects as financial mortgages.  
 
“What is the influence level of the available financial sources on the level of innovation in small-medium scale 
Contractors in Indonesia?” 
 
This question is tightly related with the first arguments, innovation process and source of funding. To begin with, 
an analysis of the sources of funding currently used to support the innovation process will take place. It will then 
continue with the analysis of the ideal condition of sources of funding which might lead to innovation.  
 
The conducted research denotes that the most respondents feel that their current resources do not support the 
innovation process within the firms. The existing resources have only been utilized for the works undertaken. 
Therefore, it is necessary to identify an appropriate mechanism which might support the process. The investigation 
has been pursued to classify and identify the sequences of the influential factors.  
 
The research highlights that the most important financial variable when determining the pace of innovation is 
the interest rate. Moreover, the other factors which follow it are; the duration of the debt, the government policies, 
financial distribution method and financing institutions, respectively. 
 
Meanwhile, the literature review regarding this has acknowledged that the microcredit mechanism, which 
theoretically might grow with the required financial conditions, could lead a proper innovation process. The research 
on funding confirms the most of respondents agree that this proposed financial mechanism might be appropriate for 
supporting the innovation. This enthusiasm comes because there has not been any assistance from the professional 
bodies, which in many cases are expected to be significant.       
 
Finally, the discussion under this heading is underlined by the respondents’ concern. They believe that the 
successful of the microcredit program depends on the consistency of the involved parties. This concern is based on 
the fact that the implementation of such programs might provoke a major change within the industry. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The research noted that in case of Indonesian construction industry, the major concern under the heading of 
accessing source of funding for the small-medium scale contractor was incorrect. The majority of the respondents 
(73%) were not having difficulties accessing source of funding for their project. Even though debt was not their main 
source of funding in gaining capital, only 9% of the respondents whose fully self-financed. Shared finance, fully debt

respondents, the source of funding used was only served the project purposes and left no room for the companies 
conducting such of innovations.  
 
 Furthermore, under the heading of innovation within the Indonesian contractors, the research highlighted that 
amongst financial aspects, interest rate was believed could stimulated the innovation within the enterprises (31%). 
They agreed that the professional bodies have to contribute more in serving the purposes. Moreover, they believed 
that innovation process could be more appropriate under the proposed scheme (microcredits) even though it would be 
difficult and could change the industry’s structure.

Abstract  
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological trend or development that is changing the world in several amazing 
ways. It is a technological trend or development that developing countries such as Zimbabwe can adopt to jumpstart 
their economies so as to improve the welfare of their populations. This technological trend has expeditiously 
captivated the global attention with business organisations, academia and governments assigning high priority to 
them. Reviewed literature shows that most developed economies have embraced and implemented IoT technologies 
in tertiary education institutions resulting in the improvement of the learning experience and management of 
resources, an opposite characteristic of developing economies such as Zimbabwe which still lag behind with regards 
to technological stature of institutions of higher learning. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential that IoT 
holds for the tertiary education sector in Zimbabwe. The study develops a framework to harness the power of IoT in 
Zimbabwe’s education sector that institutions of higher learning can adopt in their quest to drive the nation’s socio 
economic development. This is achieved through the exploration of a case study (University of Zimbabwe) on the 
feasibility, possible adoption options and how this enhances the return on the ICT investments already made on the 
existing ICT infrastructure. The case study analysis process undertaken sheds more light on both positive and 
negative factors that require consideration when IoT is set to be implemented in the education sector. A framework 
for the adoption was developed and recommendations rendered.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The world has for decades been experiencing changes which affects and dictates the way 
production of goods and services is realised as well as the way they are consumed by both 
business organisations and individuals. Some of the recent changes are attributable to the use of 
the Internet that transformed the way computer systems are utilised by both individuals and 
business organisations and how they interact (Kalle & Rose, 2003). Since its inception, the 
Internet has evolved significantly thereby paving way for greater functionality for both 
individuals and business organisations. This evolution has necessitated the acquisition and 
dissemination of information and/or data across the globe as well as the facilitation of 
collaborative efforts amongst individuals and groups irrespective of geographic location. As a 
result, this laid a solid foundation which supported the birth of the phenomenon referred to as the 
Internet of Things (IoT) that triggered the evolution of the global economy, a characteristic 
commonly known as the fourth industrial revolution, a revolution deeply rooted in the concept of 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) (Boyes, Hallaq, Cunningham, & Watson, 2018). These two 
concepts (IoT and IIoT) have expeditiously captivated the global attention with business 
organisations, academia and governments assigning high priority to them. As a result, several

2247","7.2 Management and Control 
The implementation of the technology should transform the organisation to be more efficient and effective as it 
would have been empowered to have greater control on its resources such as HR, students, vehicles, energy, etc., 
thereby availing financial resources which are key for the development of the institution and services that it 
provides. The management and control of the institution becomes simplified as the status of components can easily 
be obtained in real time providing for better and well informed decision making. 
7.3 Availability and Susceptibility of Key IoT Infrastructure 
IoT is a new technology and as new technology it brings with it new security challenges. These security challenges 
are augmented by the very nature of IoT as it is founded on the theory of connecting “things”. The integration of 
these various things presents enormous opportunities for attackers as they can utilise numerous threat vectors due to 
the diversified composition of the IoT infrastructure and has an adverse impact on availability. It is crucial to note 
that system attacks, attackers and attacking tools are evolving at an alarming rate. The system attacks are becoming 
more complex, executed with greater speed coupled with simplicity and readily available tools hence the attacker 
needs not to be a sophisticated programmer but rather a mere computer user. It exerts more pressure on the 
institution as it has other none technical challenges to grapple with. Therefore, the institution must become agile, 
learn continuously and evolve as the technology evolves ensuring that security is applied on three key layers which 
are policies and procedures; products and people (Ciampa, 2017). 
8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
Technological advancement is creating vast opportunities that developing countries can take 
advantage of in order to bridge the gap of development with their counter parts in the first world. 
These opportunities, when fully utilised, empower business organisations and individuals to 
leverage ICT investments they make thereby harnessing fully the power embedded in ICTs. This 
study presents an opportunity that institution of higher learning in Zimbabwe and beyond can 
take advantage of and become more efficient and effective in their quest to deliver higher quality 
education.

2019. The aim of this research is to interpret the distribution of subsurface andesite rocks qualitatively in the 
research area. The equipment used in this research are Proton Precession Magnetometer, Global Positioning System, 
compass, and other supporting tools. The final result is the local magnetic anomaly map with value of -1,238.13 – 
1,892.40 nT. This local magnetic anomaly map show the anomalous sources distribution in the subsurface which is 
interpreted as andesite igneous rocks that dominate in the middle to northwestern of the research area. This result 
has been clarified by pseudogravity anomaly map and analysis of its horizontal gradient. The pseudogravity 
anomaly map which has value of -75.99 – 119.50 mGal represents the distribution of subsurface rocks density. 
Whereas the horizontal gradient map which has value of 0.0022 – 0.3305 mGal/m represents the subsurface rocks 
lithological boundaries. Both of them shows the distribution of subsurface anomalous sources which is interpreted as 
andesite rocks tends to be western of the research area.

1. Introduction 
1.1. Background 
Andesites rocks are one of the natural resources that are often found in nature, especially in the area around 
volcanoes. These rocks are formed due to very high volcanic activity. Andesite rock has a strong resistance to 
weather and is durable. One of the results of technical testing shows that the andesite rock has an average uniaxial 
pressure (Unconfined Compression Strength) of about 410.93 kg/cm2, a broken resistance of about 22.6%, and an 
absorption of about 1.82%, so that andesite rock can be used as building foundation and building materials 
aggregate (Hardiyono, 2013). Andesites rocks not only ""make"" the structure of buildings become stronger, but also 
leave the cold impression which is strong enough and have very high aesthetic value.  
One region in Central Java which has a large potential of andesite naturally is Kutasari District Purbalingga 
Regency especially Cendana, Candiwulan, Karangcegak, Bumisari, and Candinata Villages (Ariyanto, 2014). 
These villages are located below the southern slope of Slamet Volcano, Central Java. This volcano is located at 
geographical positions of 7°14′30′′ S and 109°12′30′′ E with altitude of 3,248 meters above mean sea level 
(Pratomo and Hendrasto, 2012). The community's knowledge of the presence of andesites rocks in these villages 
with a high selling value resulted in a traditional mining process of andesites. The andesites rocks mining business 
is often found in the lower slopes area of Slamet Volcano. The presence of andesites rocks in these areas is 
marked by rock outcrops that appear at some locations on the surface as shown in Figure 1. However the

map of the research area (Djuri et.al., 1996) and direct visual observation in the field as shown in Figure 1. 
The pseudogravity anomaly and horizontal gradient contours maps reinforce the indications that there are some 
subsurface anomalous sources which are interpreted to be in the northwest of the research area. The gravity anomaly 
data including the pseudogravity anomaly data is generally associated with density of subsurface rocks (Omosanya 
et.al., 2012), where almost overall igneous rocks including andesites have high density (Ekinci and Yiğitbaş, 2015). 
Therefore, the pseudogravity anomalies data can be associated with the presence of subsurface igneous rocks in this 
research area. Based on Figure 7, many high pseudogravity anomalous closures dominate in the northwest, whereas 
low anomalous closures dominate in the middle to east. This is interpreted that the subsurface rocks in the northwest 
area are dominated by dense igneous rocks, especially massive andesite rocks (according to the geological map). 
Whereas in the east area, although vesicular andesite rocks outcrops are still found on the surface, but these rocks 
may have weathered or are being weathered. 
The horizontal gradient method was used extensively to locate the boundaries of density contrast from gravity 
or pseudogravity data. The red closure that stands out on the horizontal gradient map indicates the maximum (steep) 
gradient, which is usually associated with contact or lithological fracture (Setyawan et.al., 2015), as shown in Figure 
7 (right). Local faults that are mostly found on the horizontal gradient contour map are thought to be fracture in the 
andesite rocks. Based on the geological information, this andesite rocks consist of massive lava rocks with many 
fractures and vesicular lava rocks (Iswahyudi et.al., 2018). The massive lava is dark gray, with layered structure, has 
many cracks, sometimes forming a flow structure, and are affanitic with the minerals size contained are very small. 
However there are several different phases of the lava flow formation to form the different layers, besides the cracks 
(Iswahyudi et.al., 2018). Local faults in the form of fractures are found in the northwest region of the research area, 
which indicates that the igneous rock is localized in the area. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Magnetic survey with magnetic method for qualitative interpretation of andesite igneous rocks distribution in 
the subsurface has been done in Kutasari District, Purbalingga Regency, Central Java, Indonesia in April 2019. The 
research area is the lower southern slope of Slamet Volcano, Central Java. Geologically, the dominant rocks in the 
research area surface are andesite rocks. The local magnetic anomaly map that represent distribution of subsurface 
anomalous sources has values ranging of -1,238.13 – 1,892.40 nT. This value interval which relatively very large is 
associated to the magnetic susceptibility quantity of the subsurface magnetic object which interpreted as andesites 
igneous rocks. These rocks have dominate in the western to northwest of the research area. This fact is reinforced by 
pseudogravity anomaly and it′s horizontal gradient maps. The pseudogravity anomaly map represents distribution of 
subsurface rocks density, where almost all over igneous rocks including andesites have high density. Whereas the 
horizontal gradient contour map represents the lithological contact boundaries of subsurface rocks. Both of them 
show that the subsurface anomalous sources distribution interpreted as andesite igneous rocks are in the western of 
the research area.

Abstract 
Owing to the large-scale public health crisis arising from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global health 
system could not adequately deal with the entirety of infections. Consequently, improvisations meant to complement the 
healthcare systems in remedying the pandemic emerged. “Hospital-at-home” improvisations include the use of wearable 
technology to triage patients within households before consulting the health institutions. The wearable devices collect 
physiological and activity data in order to detect or predict the prevalence of the disease. 
 
Unfortunately, Do-It-Yourself health improvisations expose citizens to security vulnerabilities and interoperability 
challenges. This study proposes the adaptation of a prototype developed prior to the pandemic in securing smart homes 
and to interoperate health wearable devices used in detecting the prevalence of COVID-19 before symptoms manifest. 
Focus is placed on: 1) Integration of wearables from different vendors to ensure interoperability using the Mozilla 
WebThings gateway on Raspberry Pi; 2) Use of Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain to secure the data and allow for 
implementation of legal restrictions through software. The proposed user-centric wearables architecture enhances data 
privacy through edge and fog computing, whilst opening up Smart Homes to General Data and Protection Regulations 
(GDPR)-inspired “data portability” and personal data monetization opportunities.

Introduction 
 
The emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 crippled the global health system as evidenced by 
incidences of infected patients, shortages of hospital wards, artificial ventilators and face masks. World Health 
Organisation (WHO) guidelines to isolate or quarantine COVID-19 infected or exposed individuals respectively, 
heightened the need for remote health monitoring alternatives. As a way to respond to the need for remote 
healthcare models, numerous IoT innovations including wearable devices, drones, robots, IoT buttons and 
smartphone applications are being explored to fight COVID-19 at different phases of the pandemic including, 
early diagnosis, quarantine time and after recovery (Nasajpour et al., 2020)⁠. ⁠IoT-powered wearable devices

Abstract 
Global pandemics significantly disrupt local food supply chains as was evident at the peak of the Corona Virus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 lockdowns adversely affected food security among mostly the poor and 
vulnerable. Limited interactions among farmers, inputs providers, food processors, transporters, and retailers 
negatively affected the provision of food. To cab food shortages, implementing the Internet of Things (IoT) based 
household Aquaponics in order to ensure sustainable food production, is a potentially viable solution.    
Ordinarily, poor and vulnerable households are digitally illiterate. Privacy concerns adversely influence the adoption 
of IoT-based automation. Consequently, guaranteeing security by default among the digitally illiterate becomes 
necessary to improve IoT adoption. A potential solution is utilizing an architecture that ensures “Privacy by Design” 
in addressing IoT privacy concerns. We propose an “offline-first” architecture for automated and low-cost 
household Aquaponics units. The privacy-preserving architecture moves machine learning, data storage, and 
computation away from cloud platforms into privacy-preserving, community-hosted fog and edge computing 
platforms.

1. Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected problems on food systems, creating food insecurity in many 
countries. Due to travel restrictions, COVID-19 imposed shocks on all segments of food supply chains, 
simultaneously affecting farm production, food processing, transport and logistics, and final demand [1]⁠. The state 
of food security and nutrition was already alarming before the outbreak of COVID-19: according to the “State of 
food security and nutrition in the world (SOFI)”, an estimated average of 821 million people were undernourished 
between 2016 and 2018, and the majority of the world’s hungry  live in low-income countries, where 12.9% of the

2281","The Aurdino microcontrollers, which provide edge computing services, have water leak, electroconductivity, pH and 
temperature sensors attached to it. Fog computing is implemented as a cluster of Raspberry Pi single board 
computers operating as a mini-data centre. A LoRa  network glues together the household Aquaponics units creating 
the fog layer within the community. The data cluster was developed using the k3s, a lightweight Kubernetes 
distribution which manages the NodeRed and MongoDB docker containers. 
Conclusion 
The present project demonstrates the feasibility and the strong security in an IoT architecture that prioritizes 
processing within the edge and fog networks. Security guarantees within IoT applications will enhance adoption of 
the technology. It also demonstrates the possibility of implementing IoT-driven Aquaponics within households, 
making communities food self-sufficient. Machine learning model implemented at a local level improves efficiency 
and frees user from relying on internet connectivity for all processes. Although researches in edge and fog 
computing focused on aquaculture is still new, the results show that the adoption of mature, robust platforms for 
edge-enabled services, rather than customized implementations, will help address this area to grow. Expensive 
internet access in Zimbabwe and Africa is still a problem, and the use of edge and fog computing will help to 
overcome the problems related to inadequate internet. It also can ensure digital sovereignty and play a key role to 
meet the global challenge posed by food insecurity.

Abstract  
 
The South African Architecture, Engineering and the Construction (AEC) industry falls victim to fragmentation of 
processes and lack of coordination amongst professionals. Therefore an urgent need to explore and embrace 
techniques, technologies and innovations reduces building cost, materials and time, while collaboration amongst 
professionals is enhanced. Building Information Modelling has shown promise to solve some of the problems 
associated with building design’s ineffectiveness and facilitates a more collaborative approach to project delivery. 
While Lean Construction can reduce waste and non-value added activities in a process. However, it is unclear how 
the two concepts straddled together can further improve efficiency in construction. Therefore, it is critical to determine 
the barriers and opportunities of combined systems. Various sources of literature reveal that several barriers affect the 
synergy between lean construction and building information modelling. This research uses a comprehensive literature 
review to gather data for analysis. Furthermore, the authors use their autoethnographic experience to synthesise factors 
contributing to the systems’ successes and failures in South Africa. Finally, a framework of strategies to synthesise 
lean construction and building information is created. This research will be necessary for researchers, practitioners, 
and other professionals to add to the body of knowledge in construction and information technology.

1. Introduction 
 
The South African construction industry, similar to other countries falls victim to projects that are over budget, late 
in delivery, inaccurate information, communication issues and other pressing issues. Although standard solutions can 
solve many problems, some specialised solutions are required to resolve others. To this end, two paradigms have 
shown promise and are at the forefront of the construction industry, Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Lean 
Construction (LC).  BIM has shown great potential on construction projects in terms of accurate information, clash 
detection, visualisation, cost savings and other benefits. LC comes into the solution pool, providing waste reduction, 
value and quality improvement, reduced project time and cost and other solutions. Although the paradigms both 
provide immense benefit to construction projects, they can be mutually exclusive of each other. Many researchers 
favour interlinking the two paradigms to provide better construction projects within budget, time, and quality.

Abstract 
The development of transportation information technology has been going on for a long time. The development of 
information technology has forced every individual to master it. Including the development of parking information 
technology. Limited parking spaces at public service locations have become a problem for the community. Integrated 
parking information technology using mobile communication devices, laptops and personal computers is needed. The 
problem faced now is to be able to ensure a parking space is available. This study aims to answer these problems. The 
methodology used is to create an Android-based parking information technology application. With the hope that the 
convenience of this parking application will make certainty about the place and time of parking users.

INTRODUCTION 
The definition of parking according to the Technical Guidelines for the Implementation of Parking Facilities, 
Directorate General of Land Transportation (1996) is a state of immovability of a vehicle that is not temporary. Parking 
is one of the needs of the community for transportation in placing vehicles at a certain time or for a certain period of 
time. Various parking management policy efforts have been made by most of the City Governments or other regions 
to organize parking. However, parking can create various potential advantages and losses. The expected potential 
advantages are parking regularity, economic benefits and vehicle safety. On the other hand, a poor parking 
management seems to cause bigger problems, such as vehicle security vulnerabilities, inexpedient and hardship of 
obtaining parking locations, and more importantly it can cause traffic jams.  
 
The parking management patterns have been carried out in various ways. It could be manually(conventional), 
modern (IT-based) or combination of both. However, in term of parking location, it can be categorized as on-street 
and off-street parking (Figure 1). Each of those variables will bring difficulties that need to be challenged by a good 
parking management system. Surono and Wasono (2019) noted that the proportion ration between space availability 
and volume of vehicles must be well considered, otherwise it could disrupt the orderliness and comfort for the parking 
users. These are figures which picture current parking management.

Conclusion 
As has been discussed in early chapter, the availability of parking space has become one of major issue within 
transportation management systems. Many researches have been conducted in regard of solving the problems. 
However, a unique model was required for specific problem solver within transportation issue. This parking 
management system was constructed to challenge the problem faced within train station parking facilities. The use of 
IoT bring the development of such systems to the next level and it was proved which could facilitate the uniqueness 
of the required program.  
 
The program is open for the further explorations and ready to be implemented for permanent basis. Furthermore, 
its employment hopefully will bring advantages for the future regulator and for sure, will make the parking user 
satisfied.

Abstract 
 
Mathematical communication is one of the abilities that students need to have to understand mathematics 
meaningfully. However, the reality is that there are still many students who have low mathematical communication 
skills. Therefore, it is necessary to apply specific learning models to increase these abilities. This study aimed to 
analyze the quality of the improvement in mathematical communication skills of students who received the 
Quantum Teaching model. This research is a quasi-experimental research with data collection techniques using 
quantitative analysis obtained from the pretest and post-test results. The study population was all seventh-grade 
students at one junior high school in Garut with a sample of two classes. The instrument used in this study was a test 
in the form of questions to measure mathematical communication skills. The results showed the quality of the 
increase in students' mathematical communication skills who got the moderate interpretation Quantum Teaching 
model. 
 
Keywords: 
Mathematical Communication Ability, Quantum Teaching Models 
 
1. Introduction 
Mathematics has a role as a language of symbols that allows for accurate and precise communication. The rapid 
development of information and communication technology today is also influenced by mathematics as a science. 
Vital mastery of mathematics from an early age is needed by students to master and create future technology. 
Therefore, mathematics subjects need to be taught at every level of education to equip students to keep up with the 
times. 
However, in its implementation, there are still many problems in learning mathematics. This is as said by 
Johar, R., et.al (2018) that is the fact that Indonesian students lack mathematical communication skills. From the 
interviews with several mathematics teachers, it was found that most students already had a large enough interest in 
learning mathematics. However, the students' ability in mathematics communication is still low. It can be seen from 
1. When faced with a story problem, students are not used to writing what is known and what is asked of the 
question before solving it, so that students often misinterpret the meaning of the question; 2. Students still do not 
understand a mathematical concept. It appears that most students still have difficulty using the idea of comparison in 
problem-solving; 3. The lack of students' accuracy in mentioning mathematical symbols or notations can be seen in 
most students still unable to distinguish between equals and unequal characters. 4. There is a sense of reluctance and 
students' hesitation to occasionally express or communicate mathematical ideas through pictures, tables, and graphs, 
so this causes students to have often difficulty reading problems (Elastika et al., 2019).

In Table 1, it is found that the average N-Gain in the two classes has moderate interpretation. Furthermore, the

In Table 2, it is found that students with the Quantum Teaching model have a value of  Lmax = 0.1151 Ltable = 
0.1610. Students with conventional models have a value of Lmax = 0.1338 Ltable = 0.1634. This study uses 5%. The 
criteria for normally distributed data is Lmax < Ltabel, It can be concluded that the N-Gain results of the two groups of 
students are normally distributed. The variance of Quantum Teaching class 0.12 and Conventional class 0.11. So 
that it is obtained Fcount = 1.0610 and Ftable = 1.8500. This shows that Fcount < Ftable, so the two variances are 
homogeneous. 
The data from the calculation results obtained the combined standard deviation value (csd) = 0.1161, the value 
of tcount = -1.574 with 5% and degrees of freedom (df) of 59, obtained ttable = 2.0013. The test criterion is if -ttable < 
tcount < ttable then Ho is accepted, it means that Ho is accepted. So the conclusion is that there is no difference in the 
improvement of mathematical communication skills between students who get the Quantum Teaching model and the 
conventional learning. 
The results of the previous data analysis, namely the increase in mathematical communication skills between 
students who received the Quantum Teaching model with conventional learning models did not show any significant 
differences, and when viewed from the average calculation of the increase in the two groups showed the same 
results, namely moderate interpretation. 
In general, students who get the Quantum Teaching model tend to be confused when working on Student 
Worksheets because, in this model, students are expected to be able to bring their own experiences to fill in the steps 
on the Student Worksheets so that they find a concept. The Quantum Teaching model with the  (TANDUR) syntax 
Grow, Natural, Name, Demonstrate, Repeat, and Celebrate. It turned out that after the application of this approach, 
some students did not like the repetitive syntax. But in general, quantum teaching learning model can improve 
students' mathematical communication skills. This is consistent with the results of research from Rumapea, G, etc 
(2017) that there is an increase student learning outcomes in study algebraic operations by using quantum 
teaching learning model. 
This has implications for the 1st and 2nd indicators of mathematical communication skills, namely explaining 
ideas, situations, and mathematical relationships orally or writing with real objects, pictures, graphics, and algebra, 
and states everyday events in language or symbols. The increase in mathematical communication skills on indicators 
1 and 2 exceeded half of the number of students showing moderate interpretation. So it can be said that some 
students have not been able to explain ideas, situations and mathematical relations orally or in writing with real 
objects, pictures, graphics, and algebra; and express everyday events in language or symbols even though they have 
got the Quantum Teaching model. 
Another case for the 3rd indicator, students can make conjectures, compile arguments, formulate definitions, 
and generalizations. In the Quantum Teaching class, some students are able to define or draw conclusions from a 
problem. It can be seen from the interpretation of the improvement for this 3rd indicator is high. Similar to 
conventional learning classes, some students can define or conclude a problem.

2312","The results of the achievement of these two classes do not show any difference, because seen from the posttest 
results of mathematical communication skills in the class that received the Quantum Teaching model, the highest 
score obtained was 15 with a value of 75, meaning that new students were able to answer 75% of the whole 
questions, as well as with In the class that received conventional learning, the highest score obtained was 17 with a 
value of 85, which means that new students were able to answer 85% of all the questions. 
In line with the obstacles faced, other factors cause the improvement of students' mathematical communication 
skills who receive the Quantum Teaching model is still not optimal, namely learning is carried out after sports 
lessons. The fatigue factor can be one of the causes for the lack of concentration during learning. Also, in terms of 
time, it is cut by the time to change clothes after exercising. When learning, the Quantum Teaching class is not 
optimal in terms of time availability and utilization. 
According to the researchers' observations, the things that have been described above are the factors that cause 
there is no difference in the increase in mathematical communication skills between students who receive the 
Quantum Teaching model and conventional learning. Also, students' attitudes towards applying the Quantum 
Teaching model still do not show high enthusiasm, especially related to self-regulated learning. This is in line with 
the results of Hidayah's research (2014, p. 11), which states that students tend to dislike mathematics, students' 
busyness in other activities makes them ignore mathematics, even if they only learn mathematics when they do tests. 
And this is in line with the results of Qohar and Sumarmo’s research (2013, p. 71) there was association between 
mathematical communication and self-regulated learning. 
  
5. Clonclution 
Based on the description of the results and discussion, it is concluded that the increase in mathematical 
communication skills of students who get the Quantum Teaching model is in the moderate category, and there is no 
difference in the increase in mathematical communication skills between students who get the Quantum Teaching 
model and conventional learning.  The teacher should understand each step of the learning model that will be 
applied and pay attention to time to be appropriately used, and learning objectives can be achieved. Also, further 
research is needed to improve students' mathematical communication skills and learning independence.

Abstract 
 
The junior coal companies in South Africa are facing a number of challenges which have contributed to poor 
performance, resulting in some of them having to close down. The SA government developed a mining charter 
which encourages 26% black ownership (Broad Based Black-Economic Empowerment) in mining companies, 
which aims to support junior miners. In addition, Eskom has also developed a policy that enforces that 40% supply 
of thermal coal must come from junior miners. As a result, Richards Bay Coal terminal in conjunction with Transnet 
increased its capacity to boost junior coal miners. Despite this support that junior coal miners are getting, they still 
face operational challenges which range from finance, transportation, production, and lack of skilled personnel. This 
has caused a number of junior miners to shut down their operations as the taxes, royalty fees and community 
investments continue to be a burden. Data was collected using questionnaires as well as personal interviews. The 
study revealed that the most common challenge for the junior miners is lack of capital and financial support. The 
lack of finance has led to junior miners not being able to afford relevant industry skilled personnel.

2315","When it comes to tonnage production, the majority of miners seem to be producing between 0.6mt to 10mt per 
annum as shown in Figure 5. This seems to indicate low production compared to what customers like Eskom 
consume per year.  The lack of resources might be a contributing factor to this low production.  
 
According to Figure 6, 14% of respondents use road to transport their cargo. Out of the 14% who use road transport, 
80% of them indicated that they were unhappy with the damaged roads condition. They also expressed their concern 
regarding the high costs of using road transport, which in turn carries low load; 30 tons per truck to be precise. This 
means they have to pay for multiple trips to complete their delivery. There is also a high rate of truck breakdowns, 
which causes delays and costs more money. There was a strong view that the railway lines could be much 
convenient if they were closer to their mines and the sea port but they are far; which means they still have to 
transport their cargo by road to load into a train and again to transport to the port.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The aim of this study was to identify the factors that contribute to poor performance of junior coal miners in South 
Africa. The questionnaires and interviews were sent to 120 respondents of which 85 participated, which is about 
71% response rate. The miners were asked basic questions in a questionnaire, and more information was extracted 
during the interviews.  
 
The study revealed that the most common challenge for the junior miners is lack of capital and financial support. 
Though they received contracts from the likes of Eskom and Sasol, the money made from these contracts goes into 
bank repayments, contractors, consultants and transportation. This results in junior coal mines being unable to 
sustain their business which leads to poor performance and subsequently shut down. Government intervention is 
needed in a form of providing capital for purchasing equipment and funding for the miners to be able to pay salaries 
for the first few years. This will assist the miners to sustain the business as they will not have to borrow money from 
the banks.

Abstract 
 
In mid of December 2019, Wuhan sea food, China a new mysterious illness was reported lately called Coronavirus 
(COVID-19, The virus triggered a severe respiratory disease, rapidly speeded to many other states of China and 
around the world. COVID-19 is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Hundreds of 
millions of people have been placed in some form of isolation. Governments announcing country wide lockdown 
while declaring the emergency to fight the sharp rise in coronavirus infection. The epidemic’s consequences are 
devastating, currently around the globe more than three million confirm cases reported. Unfortunately, we are still 
counting the days, the cases and, most sadly of all, the deadly virus has taken more than three hundred thousand 
lives. The Wealth Health Organization (WHO) officially has called Covid-19 a Pandemic. The previous viruses 
SARS-CoV, Avian Influenza, MERS-CoV and the Ebola, emerged the geographic information system , remote 
sensing applications , mapping and tracking techniques and social media platforms were provided an indispensable 
support for appropriate, accurate and timely response in the epidemic outbreak. The aim of the research is to critical 
review the development of geospatial dashboards which are using in real time monitoring and providing decision 
support in terms of visualization and integration of mapping in Covid-19 pandemic. This paper presents a 
comparison of Covid-19 geospatial dashboards and key technologies and applications use to fight with deadly virus.

1.Introduction 
In mid of December 2019, Wuhan sea food, China a new mysterious illness was reported lately called Coronavirus 
(COVID-19, The virus triggered a severe respiratory disease, rapidly spread and affecting more than 210 countries 
and territories around the world. Compared to previous respiratory syndrome SARS-coV in 2002 & 2003 and 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012-2013, this new mysterious COVID-19 disease spreading very 
quick and reckless. The MERS had taken around two and half year to infect 1000 people, whereas SARS took 
around four months. The COVID-19 rapidly spreading. On Jan-30 the World Health Organization (WHO) officially 
has called COVID-19 a pandemic. As today,16th September 2020, the deadly Covid-19 took more than 931,321 lives 
and more than 2.9 million infected cases reported in the span of December 2019 to September 16th, 2020(WHO, 
2020).

4. Challenges and Future Directions 
The geospatial dashboards are heavily depending on the development of technology as these dashboards are 
interdisciplinary and seeking attention from interdisciplinary fields, such as medicines, aviation, geographical and 
remote sensing techniques, urban planning from resilient communities. We are on the verge of 4th industry 
revolution, by integrating and combining spatial dashboards with artificial intelligence and big data would give and 
open more avenues on decision support and research on visualization.  
5. Conclusion 
The innovative Spatial technologies, web-based tools, monitoring and providing a real time data, tracking, and 
mapping with improved data are playing a vital role in critical decision making (Abid et al., 2020). Increasing 
disaster resilience involves a focus on the strength and sustainability of a community’s lifelines, as well as 
strengthening the relations between people, services, systems, and structures that support the community to function 
(Sulaiman et al., 2019). Mapping dashboards as discussed above giving live and update information have been 
extremely popular in sharing and understanding the spread of coronavirus. In the situation of lockdown these 
dashboards giving accurate data from all over the world in a single web address. Interaction through online map-
based dashboards offers friendly information to people around the world eager to protect themselves and their 
families. These dashboards enhance data transparency and helps government authorities disseminate information. 
The dashboard depicts the future trends and providing a timely information to fight this pandemic. Certainly, the 
dashboards are providing indispensable support and creating awareness in panic condition. These are the powerful 
tools providing a new capability to under crisis situation, not only for Covid-19, but the mapping dashboards 
techniques are also familiar even to young children who have become accustomed to the Google Map and similar 
services. We must believe that how Covid -19 mapping dashboards can support the entire process of deadly disease 
outbreak.

Abstract 
 
In Malaysia, over the year’s disasters has affected buildings and infrastructure including healthcare facilities severely. 
The past events should provide a valuable lesson for future preparedness and planning in healthcare facilities whether 
from natural, man-made or both disasters. However, recent hospital disaster shows that more in-depth effort should 
be emphasized in hospitals of Malaysia. Therefore, to ensure that hospitals and health facilities can withstand 
emergencies and disasters, resilience strategies has been examined to highlight the importance of assessing risks and 
preparing for them. In this study, a different toolkits of health care facility management were identified. The research 
is based on published literature review and past research to achieve the objective. Through the identification and 
integration of the factors and Resilience Healthcare Facilities Management (RHFM) toolkit was identified to highlight 
the health care management in the hospital public sector. The toolkit contributes significantly to resilience healthcare 
facilities management process. These findings not only give benefit to the people involved in the hospital industry but 
also to the public officials in guiding them to be more accountable in handling risks, emergencies, disasters, and 
resilience strategies process.

1. Introduction 
The term “resilience” was introduced into the English language in the early 17th century from the Latin verb “resilire”, 
which means to rebound or recoil (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2017). The term has become current in recent years, 
and the multitude of interpretations and usages has become diverse. According to McAslan (2010), the term resilience 
has broad range of definitions used in different contexts which are materials, environment/ecological, individuals, 
communities, organizations, and national security. 
In the case of disaster, United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction UNISDR (2009), defined 
resilience as “the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and 
recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner”. While in the context of building design and 
communities, Resilience Design Institute, (2017) defines that it is the capacity to adapt to changing conditions and to 
maintain or regain functionality and vitality in the face of stress or disturbance.

Abstract 
 
This project investigates different strategies Trump can utilize in reopening states during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During the pandemic, the President and state governors face the challenge of deciding when to reopen the states and 
whether they should all be opened all at once or based on their individual situations. Based on several calculated 
variables, such as past win margins of swing states, infected cases, deaths, and unemployment increases for 16 
different swing states from past elections, the authors draw conclusions on which states President Trump should be 
put into consideration to “liberate” or “reopen” to not only safely reopen, but to maximize his chances of winning the 
2020 election. With the calculated and collected variables, a statistical model is created to aid in decision making. 
Although the safest option is to stay closed, many state economies and the overall national economy suffer due to the 
closure. Trump’s pro-economy campaign must wisely select which states to liberate based not only on unemployment 
rates, but chances of winning that state in the upcoming 2020 election. This project plays special attention to Michigan, 
Minnesota, and Virginia, which were called out in President Trump’s tweet on April 17, 2020. Ultimately, this project 
concludes that Minnesota is a safe state to liberate, Michigan is too risky, and Virginia can be liberated, but the authors 
advise against it. Additionally, two possible scenarios are also covered in this paper. This project demonstrates a 
practical and statistical modeling framework considering social and political science factors.

1. Introduction 
On April 17, 2020 President Trump had urged Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia to “liberate” themselves in an 
apparent criticism of stay-at-home orders. If the states were to “liberate” they would no longer have to follow stay-at-
home-orders that were put in place in an attempt to impede the spread of the virus. President Trump’s tweets had 
signaled support for protestors who were demanding that the economic-crippling stay-at-home measures be eased, or 
removed. Of course, relenting on the social-distancing orders risks a resurgence of infections and deaths, but what 
about effects on business? On April 22, President Trump said he “strongly” disagreed with the move to reopen 
Georgia, which contradicted his previous statements on “liberating” the other states and a source who said he agreed 
with it. President Trump must address why he chose to ”liberate” or not “liberate” some states. This project explores 
and predicts what President Trump’s decisions should be on liberating. First, we establish a statistical model to study 
COVID-19 effects and Jobless Rate on the 2020 US Presidential election result on swing states. In order to control 
the spread of COVID, President Trump must consider that if he opens too late, the economy will be in trouble (which 
would cause him to lose votes), and if he opens too early then there will be an increased risk of contracting the virus 
(which would also lose him votes). The authors explore what are the risks and consequences of liberating Michigan, 
Minnesota, and Virginia, and which swing states should President Trump reconsider reopening for business.

Figure 3 depicts the Z-COVID, Z-Unemployment, 2020 Win Margin, Z-Risk 1-1, and Liberate Index for all the swing 
states. President Trump prefers the Z-COVID index to be negative, indicating minimal impacts of COVID-19 on that 
state. Michigan is starkly positive, while Virginia and Minnesota are negative. President Trump also favors a negative 
Z-Unemployment, indicating a lower than average increase in unemployment is favorable. Michigan appears to be 
positive, so does Minnesota, while Virginia is negative. Next, President Trump would like a positive win margin, 
meaning his chances of winning in that state are high. Michigan is the opposite at negative, Minnesota seems to be 
neither positive nor negative, and Virginia appears to be barely positive. For President Trump, the Z-Risk 1-1 must be 
negative as well. Michigan is distinctly positive, Minnesota evidently negative, and Virginia slightly positive. Lastly, 
President Trump prefers a negative liberate index indicating a lower chance of the state “swinging” away from him. 
Michigan appears to be positive, Minnesota negative, and Virginia barely positive. Overall, Michigan seems to be 
dramatically the opposite of what Trump wants, while Minnesota barely leans towards President Trump, and Virginia 
stays virtually neutral.

4. Conclusions  
In conclusion, the authors would not suggest President Trump to liberate Michigan and Virginia because Michigan is 
way too risky with high infection and death rates, and if liberated the risk of spreading COVID is too high and 
dangerous. Virginia is hard to decide since the pros and cons are too similar and it is best left not liberated. It is not 
worth the risk opening just for business when unemployment rates are not a big problem in Virginia. However, 
President Trump could potentially liberate Minnesota, since the risk of spreading COVID is not high and there is a 
huge benefit for businesses and people when reducing the unemployment rate. Furthermore, President Trump could 
liberate Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire if necessary in attempts to sway them to his 
side since the risk of COVID is relatively low and they could benefit from businesses reopening. 
 
There are two possible scenarios the authors thought out. In Scenario One if President Trump doesn’t push any states 
to liberate, he will win the 2020 election, because even though he loses 36 votes from Michigan (liberate index of 
33.54) and Pennsylvania (liberate index of 1.39), he gets four more from New Hampshire (liberate index of -7.20) and

President Trump may lose Florida, which is very likely with a Liberate Index of 45.59, but win Minnesota, which is 
possible with a liberate index of -16.35 and barely win Virginia. In total, President Trump will still win with a single 
vote above the breakeven line. This may be cutting it too close for President Trump, so the authors recommend him 
to pay attention to Florida to maybe reconsider whether Florida should be opened in the future, however unlikely it 
may be. COVID-19 infection risk in Florida is quite high, so it is safer to liberate Minnesota and guarantee the votes, 
but it may still be risky for Virginia.  
 
5. Future Investigations 
Some future investigations could involve more scenarios and possibly a more updated version of the infected cases, 
deaths, and unemployment rates as these were recorded in April 2020. Additionally, the authors may monitor winning 
margin weekly through weekly updates on the infected cases, deaths, and unemployment rate.

Abstract - 
For the last few hundred years emotional intensity and reaction have often been attached to hormonal teenagers going 
through puberty or even people with higher social sensitivity. As society progresses, variables like time of day are 
more common as standards of structure. Specific Correlations of emotions to hours and segmented periods of temporal 
change has been labeled as a psychological staple of all humans, dating back to the applications of the Ancient Greeks. 
These tests compare two very important aspects of life, the unpredictable and spontaneous nature of emotions, and the 
ordered structure of our 12 hour time schedule. These different emotions being anger, happiness, disgust, and sadness, 
which are induced using various Medias. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient test is used to understand 
statistically significant correlations between the two variables. Then, an ANOVA Test is utilized to certify that the 
subjects used in the experiment were not more “emotional” or more receptive to certain emotions than the other. This 
is important to add because of emotion’s boundless nature. This project finally concludes that the specific time of day 
does not necessarily correlate to emotion, but rather that emotion is a much stronger virtue of the mind than previously 
thought.

1. Introduction and Research 
An EEG, or Electroencephalogram Is an apparatus that uses electrodes (receptors that you can place on various parts 
of the head to detect waves from different parts of the brain), to record specific interactions between electrons 
recorded as electrical impulses. These electrodes connect to a Pre-Amplifier, which allows the very small signal 
from brain waves to be amplified enough to pass through a filter, making the data digestible for the interface. Next, a 
second Amplifier allows this new filtered EEG data to be transcribed into a computer. In this experiment, the 
electrodes will be placed on the bottom of the head and next to the neck to be able to detect Alpha waves, Beta 
Waves, Theta Waves, and Gamma Waves (all these waves correlate different activities which can be drawn to 
correlation of separate emotions). (Goleman et al. 2016)These brain patterns are the most detectable from surfaces 
above the from the occipital lobe, more electrodes will be placed on the top of the head, and on the sides of the head 
all to detect waves coming from the limbic system, or more directly the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, 
hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate gyrus all of which are mainly known for being in charge of our brains 
process of what we know as emotion (Harmon-Jones et al. 2016). A visual representation of this location placement 
is shown in Figure 1.

Finally the p value is 0.67, and the given a value is 0.05, because the p value is greater than the a value we accept the 
null hypothesis once more 
For all four tests for each emotion, the null was accepted. We, therefore, conclude that no subject had higher 
reception to specific emotions than the other. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research comes to the conclusion that there is in fact no statistically significant correlation between emotion 
intensity, and the time of day, we also know that various people do not have too different of emotion 
intensity/reception variables (People are not much naturally angrier than another). We would expect humans to be 
more variable, with emotions flipping like a coin, but we see here that reaction and emotions are much more inset, 
and are much stronger than previously expected. We also see that though it is expected for Teens to be more 
emotionally variable than their adult counterparts, this is proven wrong with relatively similar results, hormonal 
changes change more immediate reactions rather than overall emotion.  
 
6. Future Opportunities 
This field of emotional informatics, and classifications is revolutionary, especially with this smaller scale application 
of EEG, this concept allows for higher groups of people to create, and apply higher level of tests. Usually, EEG’s 
are often upwards of thousands of dollars, with the design that is applied, and used in the aforementioned research, 
we are able to derive reasonable data sets. Some ways to clean up this experiment could be to use higher level 
machinery, such as MRI, and even internal EEG sensors, offering the highest level of recording. Though this has 
some limitations, direct applications of specific neurotransmitters to insight specific emotions could be helpful for a 
standard emotional response for easy recording, such as dopamine for happiness, and acetylcholine for anger. There 
are many fields to develop on, the brain is the last frontier of the human body and this experiment offers a new lense 
to worlds of psychoanalysis and consciousness, with lots of untapped potential.

Abstract 
 
Poker is a very popular gambling game in casinos, but except professionals, most poker players lose money 
without applying probability statistics. This paper studies the poker probability by using a partial deck (a 
total 16 AKQJ cards with up to 6 players). The authors have used combination formula and derived general 
formulas of matching probability for each matching pattern. To simplify probability simulation, partial deck 
poker game was designed which can increase the matching probability significantly on some higher ranked 
patterns such as “Full House”. With this creative AKQJ game, the winning patterns are down to “Four of a 
Kind”, “Full House”, “Three of a Kind”, and “Two Pairs”. If all 6 players are playing, this Poker AKQJ 
game can be very competitive since the basic Poker probability would be calculated to guide each poker 
player on their betting to avoid any risky move. To study the player’s personality and psychology, each 
player has been assigned different playing characters based on the assigned degree of risk taking. Through 
this Poker AKQJ data simulation based on the worst-case probability, the poker players may avoid 
gambling disorder and lose a lot of money.

 1. Introduction 
 
This introduction section would cover three different subjects: Poker Project Background, Gambling Disorder 
Psychology, and Innovative Poker AKQJ Game. 
 
1.1 Partial Deck Poker Project Background 
 
Most Poker players lost Money in Poker Gambling since they gamble blindly without applying the poker 
probability and assessing their risk on each play. Authors have utilized JAVA coding to simulate Poker Probability 
and study Sample Size effect on Statistics and decision making (Wang 2017, Chen 2018, Chen 2020). The project 
scope was for a learning purpose, not for gambling purpose. Authors used partial deck (J, Q, K, A) of 16 cards to 
simplify JAVA poker simulation. The full deck poker for 6 to 7 random cards is very popular in most Poker tournament 
(Billings 2002, Li 2013). Several research papers have demonstrated and simulated the poker probability by using 
Monte Carlo Simulation (Ulam 1949), Evolutionary Computing (H. Quek 2009), and Artificial Intelligence (Billings 
1998), and there is also an US Patent (Ward 2004) studying the partial deck on Royal Flush probability. Nevertheless, 
the ranking of Partial Deck may be different from the Full Deck, and the Poker players will have to analyze the 
complex situations in real time quickly in order to have a reliable judgement. Using less partial deck could simplify 
the cards’ situation and calculation of the winning probability.

he was supposed to win due to having only 50% confidence based on the current worst-case algorithm even with a 
Full House. 
 
Table 12. Players’ Win or Lose Summary 
 
 
4.4 Future Work 
 
Each Poker AKQJ run takes one author about 30 minutes to collect the raw data and summarize the results and 
pattern; thus, it is impossible to complete the 92 datasets manually. The authors are developing a Python code to 
automatically simulate these random AKQJ runs and summarize the results using programming. Also, as mentioned 
in this paper, there is still room for improving the Worst-Case algorithm by either optimizing the characters’ 
confidence setting or adding additional rules like the Full House situation. The shuffling bias may be also addressed. 
This game can also be easily expanded from current one betting round to multiple betting rounds. The other 
opportunity is to consider the number of players still in the game as the game progresses, less and less players are 
still in the game which would impact the calculation of the worst-case scenario since less hidden cards may 
complicate the calculation and impact the character settings. 2-Players case may prefer more accurate calculation on 
the worst-case algorithm. 
 
 5. Conclusions 
 
This innovative AKQJ Poker Game has significantly simplified the winning probability calculation. The worst-
case algorithm has made it feasible that the Poker players could calculate their overall winning probability and make 
a rational betting decision based on their pre-set risk-taking character. The simplified AKQJ game has significantly 
minimized the players’ emotional character and limit players’ tricks to confuse the winning probability. The winner 
of each run becomes more random and less dependent on players’ psychological characters while calculating the 
winning probability quickly in real poker game becomes more critical.

Abstract 
 
This paper adopts STEAMS (Science, Technology, Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Math, Statistics) 
methodology. The objective of this paper is to introduce the benefits of integrating all 6 “STEAMS” 
elements, especially living in the Big Data World. The NBA Draft Position case study was demonstrated 
to present this novel “STEAMS” concept as compared to the current “STEM” or” STEAM” approach. 
There are three core visions of this “STEAMS” methodology: (1) replace “Art” with “Artificial 
Intelligence”, (2) separate “Statistics” from “Math”, and (3) integrate all six “STEAMS” elements. Adding 
the “Artificial Intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “Sports” science research 
and “Math” algorithms. Separating the “Statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management 
and draw practical conclusions. Due to the previous two benefits, integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements is 
becoming a widespread methodology for most scientists and engineers working in the modern Big Data 
era. Several techniques are used to help determine the NBA Player position and identify the similar NBA 
players for the benchmarking objective. It’s critical and urgent for educators and teachers to abandon the 
traditional STEM approach to adopt the new “STEAMS” approach to educate our next generations in their 
early school learning and career development.

 1. Introduction 
 
“STEM” (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) or “STEAM” (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) 
are popular in School Education is a term used to group together these academic disciplines (Fas 2017, Colwell 2016). 
This term is typically used when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools to improve 
competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national 
security concerns and immigration policy. The acronym came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting 
on science education held at the US National Science Foundation. In the early 1990's, a summer program called STEM 
Institute is arranged for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area. Based on the program's 
recognized success and expertise in STEM education (NSF 2018), that NSF was first introduced to the acronym 
STEM. 
 
1.1 Criticism of STEM 
 
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted many criticisms. The efforts of the U.S. 
government to increase the number of STEM graduates, the science and engineering occupations have been flat or 
slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations (Teitelbaum 2014). 
There was a ""mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job in the United States, with only 
around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM 
degree (Charette 2013). Based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, 
because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, ""many sciences, particularly the life sciences, pay 
below the overall median for recent college graduates (Casselman 2014). Efforts to remedy the perceived domination 
of STEM subjects has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. Some critics feel that this practice in 
higher education, as opposed to a strict meritocracy, causes lower academic standards (MacDonald 2018).

In Table 2, Okpala’s basketball statistics was compared against three identified players in the Clustering 
Dendrogram analysis. This similarity analysis can help prove that Okpala is fit more for the small forward position 
and also can help develop his NBA functions by benchmarking to three similar players. 
 
Table 2. Okpala’s statistics benchmarked to three Similar NBA Players 
 
 
 
2.7 Model Validation 
 
Based on our STEAMS study, player Okpala should have a greater potential to play the SF position over the SG 
position. Okpala is currently playing in the Miami Heat in 2019-2020 season as a rookie. Here is the NBA scout report 
on his current NBA status: Okpala is likely going to be a very solid player in the NBA. His collegiate statistics stack 
up nicely against the likes of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, and so does his frame. However, it might be hard for 
the 6’9” rookie from Stanford to earn a huge chunk of playing time this summer. Our STEAMS study has successfully 
predicted his NBA SF position over SG position. 
 
 3. Conclusions 
 
“STEAMS” methodology is very successful on understanding Basketball Sports Science.  Understanding the 
NBA Pre-Draft Combine Measurement and Testing can be done effectively through a systematic “Engineering” 
problem solving framework. Modern “Artificial Intelligence” methods can help determine player’s NBA preferable 
SF position and similar players. Hierarchical clustering distance mathematics is critical to determine the clustering 
dendrogram patterns. Benchmarking players’ statistics can be compared by using the descriptive statistics. In the 
modern Big Data era, most scientists and engineers shall adopt this “STEAMS” methodology and integrate all 6 
elements seamlessly and collectively.

Abstract 
 
The University Class Scheduling Problem (UCSP), or the process of building a class schedule for a university, has 
been a difficult problem in computer science due to its combinatorial complexity and multi-objective nature. As a 
result, several heuristic-based approaches have been tested, one being the genetic algorithm (GA). The application of 
GAs to this problem has presented its own difficulties due to the generation of infeasible solutions. Thus, this article 
presents novel methods of decoding random-key genetic representations such that only feasible solutions are 
generated. It is then demonstrated empirically that these modifications still constitute a viable algorithm, and 
analytically that these changes affect no additional bias on the otherwise unmodified GA. Going forward, similar, 
more generalized methods can be developed and applied to a wider range of problems.

1. Introduction 
 
Scheduling problems, or timetabling problems, essentially involve the distribution of limited resources over a finite 
space. This article focuses on a specific variation of this problem called the University Class Scheduling Problem, 
which is often considered to be a combinatorial problem and known to be NP-hard. UCSP can be broken down into 
hard constraints (room capacity, one class per room per period, etc.), which must all be satisfied for a solution to be 
viable, and soft constraints (teacher preferences, room utilization, etc.), which should be optimized to create “good” 
solutions. 
 
The presence of both hard and soft constraints has led to the development of several approaches towards optimizing 
UCSP, some of which are exact and others heuristical. Some exact approaches include brute-force search and integer 
linear programming. Integer linear programming takes a selection of variables and optimizes them based on a 
mathematical model while keeping the inputs bounded by a set of constraints. Both of these approaches suffer from 
combinatorial intractability as the search space increases. Due to these issues leading to a lack of satisfactory solutions, 
approximate methods were developed. Some heuristical approaches include genetic algorithms and particle swarm 
optimizers, as well as tabu search which uses meta-heuristics. 
 
This article focuses on the application of genetic algorithms in particular. GAs are one of the most powerful heuristic 
optimizers since they use random noise to explore a problem’s search space, meaning no additional information about 
the function being optimized is required. This is blindness towards the loss function is not required; local optimizations 
have been employed for some problems such as the traveling-salesman problem.

2387","The first fact that must be proven is that 𝑓𝑓 is a uniform-assignment function. Because of the size of 𝐴𝐴 in relation to 𝔇𝔇, 
the queue-like mapping is equivalent to a direct mapping. This is because by assigning every element in 𝐴𝐴 to a subset 
of a set within 𝔇𝔇, every set within 𝔇𝔇 will have fewer than 𝑙𝑙 unassigned elements remaining after every element in 𝐴𝐴 
is given an assignment. Hence, 𝑓𝑓 is a uniform-assignment function. 
 
For the proof that 𝑔𝑔 is also a uniform-assignment function, 𝑔𝑔 must first be constructed from the output of 𝑓𝑓. In a sense, 
the source of 𝑔𝑔 is (𝐴𝐴× 𝔇𝔇) × ℜ2, however the element from 𝔇𝔇 is more of a meta-parameter, thus it is denoted as a 
subscript and not included in the source set. The process by which 𝑔𝑔𝐷𝐷 selects a subset from 𝐷𝐷 is similar to the queue 
method. The elements in 𝐷𝐷 are reordered according to a random-key 𝑅𝑅∈ℜ2, and the first 𝑙𝑙 elements are used. Since 
the size of 𝐷𝐷 can be smaller than the size of 𝑅𝑅, the key must be truncated. By theorem 3, the first |𝐷𝐷| elements of 𝑅𝑅 
can be used to form the random-key, and the function will retain its property of uniform-assignment. With this 
information, a proof can be constructed. 
 
Let 𝔉𝔉 = {𝐹𝐹 | 𝐹𝐹 ⊂𝐷𝐷 and |𝐹𝐹| = 𝑙𝑙}. Order is not accounted for when removing duplicate elements from 𝔉𝔉. This is 
because the sets within 𝔉𝔉 correspond to the list of days available that each room maintains. Days of the week have a 
natural order, so any subset can always be re-ordered in a consistent manner. Fix (𝑎𝑎1, 𝑅𝑅2) ∈𝐴𝐴× ℜ2 and fix 𝐷𝐷∈𝔇𝔇 
and (𝑎𝑎2, 𝐹𝐹) ∈𝔉𝔉. As demonstrated earlier, 𝑃𝑃(𝑎𝑎1 = 𝑎𝑎2) =
1
|𝐴𝐴|. Since the reordering of 𝐷𝐷 is uniform, the result of taking 
the first 𝑙𝑙 elements of the reordered set is equivalent to taking 𝑙𝑙 elements randomly from 𝐷𝐷 without replacement. 
Because of this, the probability that the outputs match can be calculated as follows: 
𝑃𝑃(𝑔𝑔𝐷𝐷(𝑎𝑎2, 𝑅𝑅2) = 𝐹𝐹) = ቆ
|𝐷𝐷|
|𝐹𝐹|ቇ
−1
= ቆ
|𝐷𝐷|
𝑙𝑙ቇ
−1
. 
Thus the overall probability, 
1
|𝐴𝐴| ൫|𝐷𝐷|
𝑙𝑙൯
−1, is equivalent to 
1
|𝐴𝐴×𝔉𝔉|. Furthermore, the uniformity remains invariant across all 
values of the meta-parameter 𝐷𝐷. 
 
Since 𝑓𝑓 and 𝑔𝑔 are uniform-assignment functions, and since 𝑔𝑔 retains its property of uniform-assignment for all 𝐷𝐷∈
𝔇𝔇, the “composition” of these two functions is also a uniform-assignment function. 
 
5.4. Application to Methodology 
 
As demonstrated above, the initial mapping of classes to teachers is a uniform assignment. The more complicated 
mechanics take place after this point. The class-teacher pairings are mapped to rooms with implicit periods in sections, 
with the class-teacher subsets being disjoint. This process is not entirely clear-cut due to the mutability of the set of 
rooms. If the first subset of class-teacher pairings is assigned to a specific subset of rooms and periods, then that will 
affect the possible assignments for the following subsets of class-teacher pairings. Ultimately, however, regardless of 
which slots are used at which point in the process, the union of the target sets for every individual assignment function 
will yield the same, global target set. Thus, by theorem, the result of combining each separate assignment yields a 
uniform-assignment function overall. Lastly, by theorem, the composition of the class-teacher assignment with the 
room assignment yields a uniform-assignment function. This proves overall that the proposed methodology is 
unbiased in its conversion from random-keys to schedules. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
This article presented a novel method of decoding random-keys to produce class schedules that satisfied a set of hard 
constraints. Empirical results were presented that demonstrated the viability of this method, and then mathematical 
analysis was employed to demonstrated that the method was unbiased. Overall this novel method appears to have 
promise going forward. 
 
Future research should be done to find new search space restriction methods and other areas of application. The 
methods employed here are unfortunately limited to the scope of UCSP and related problems, however some of the 
basic concepts can be applied elsewhere. Since it was shown that uniform randomness, probabilistically speaking, can 
be preserved through a wide variety of transformations, more inventive decoders can be developed and tested. The 
one drawback with these search space restricting decoders is their computational load. They are far less efficient than 
index-related decoders, and thus take significantly longer to translate a representation into an actual data structure.

Abstract 
South African transportation still faces quite a few challenges despite the implementation of BRT 
systems across various metropolitan cities. These include, “lack of public transport accessibility in semi-
urban areas, low ridership, equity imbalances and traffic congestion”. Observations have revealed that 
the BRT has not been effective in meeting all its objectives. This paper evaluates the strategic integrated 
transport growth and development in South Africa particularly focus on the City of Johannesburg based 
Rea Vaya. A qualitative research design using one-on-one semi-structured interviews was used for data 
collection. Twelve participants were purposefully selected, which included the commuters, drivers, 
cleaners, fare collectors, security officers, and managers who had been working or using the BRT 
transport system for not less than a year. Qualitative content analysis techniques were used for analysing 
the data and providing an audit trail; the writing of thick descriptions and a reflexive journal were used 
to attain research quality. The findings suggest that there is a high number of car ownership, 
overpopulation, large BRT lanes, road renovations and traffic light malfunctioning are responsible for 
traffic congestion in the City of Johannesburg. In spite of the introduction of BRT system that was 
developed to foster integrated transport particularly with an intention to encourage sustainable growth 
and development. Furthermore, findings revealed that the impact of the BRT transport system in the City 
of Johannesburg was positive in terms of saving travelling time, low-prices and creating job 
opportunities. While the negative impact is that the advent of BRT has led to the closure of small 
businesses that are located on the road. Poor service delivery, corruption, resistance by taxi drivers, 
disrespectful passengers, inadequate number of buses, and poor remuneration for the employees and 
interference by road users, were found to be the challenges of the BRT operational system.

Abstract  
A mining company called “Kanyon coal mine” is introducing collision avoidance technology as a means to 
minimize accidents and incidents, this is in line with global trends for safe mining. The mine is introducing collision 
avoidance through Radar, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Global System for Mobile Communications 
(GSM). This paper is a study of the effects of introducing new technology to the existing one; the use of technology 
for safe mining. The mining equipment is upgraded with new technology at the coal mine and this created an 
unintended problem of safety, the mining equipment uses echolocation, GPS, GSM, and Rader as means to assess 
possible collision of machines with each other in the dark, during poor visibility or due to operator negligence. All 
these systems we call “anti-collision system”, these translate to an “emergency engine kill switch” (EEKS) in case 
the driver is unaware of the pending danger, which will result in the switching off of the engine and engaging the 
braking system, by locking the wheels in place, the problem here is; after the power dies what will happen to the 
momentum of the truck, and what are the safety measures to counter slip of the locked wheels on gravel roads, 
resulting in a deadweight collision anyway. The study investigated the braking system, the slope and the mechanics 
the truck in statics. The paper argues that the unintended consequence is as a results of doing as engine kill on a 
wrong slope level, this was studied intently using Coulomb’s law and results presented.

1.1 Background 
 
Kanyon Coal Mine in Mpumalanga is one of 19 coal mines in South Africa; these mines supply power stations like 
Majuba, Matimba and Medupe to name but a few. The coal industry is the backbone of a grid that supplies about 
seven countries with electricity, that is South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Lesotho, eSwatini, Namibia, DRC, and 
Mozambique, the electricity regulator produces over 54 400 MW of power of which 40 000 MW is owed to the coal 
industry, that is 73.52% of power supplying seven countries. (Salaza et al, 1990)

the slip is just before 35º and for the loaded truck the slip angle is much smaller at just before 15º, making the 
difference between a loaded truck and unloaded truck about 20º apart, this tells us that for the 218kN emergency 
braking force as rated by the manufacture (Bell International, 2020) for the unloaded truck we can switch off the 
engine for slopes at lower than 35º and for loaded trucks we can only switch off the engine at slopes of lower than 
15º. Figure 6 shows that the normal force to the slope follows the theoretical trajectory of Figure 5, and follows 
coulomb’s law of static friction. Industry problems require solutions that save them money and time, it is very 
important for an engineer to go further and add the element of safety and controlled mining, the technology we are 
introducing is one that priorities safety of people and machines, hence the company has invested such a lot of money 
in the collision avoidance technology, The shorter the distance the trucks have to travel the more it saves on fuel 
costs, hence the engineer has to constantly work around other engineers to make sure that safety is not 
compromised, ideally the maximum slope of a mine is about 12 º but some have gone as high as 45º, so this paper 
contradicts any slope that is more than 35 degrees and not just reckless but a danger to the people and machines. 
(Zare et al, 2013) 
 
Conclusions  
 
Mechanical engineering work primarily rely on problem solving while mechanical equipment is supplied standard 
from the manufacture or suppliers. However, because there are different departments in industry pushing for 
maximum production at minimum cost, there are codes and practices that are modified, in some instances, some 
even ‘cut corners’. For example, there is a minimum slope angle for open cast mining but in reality user experience 
has been pushing boundaries and making a mismatch between legal requirements and codes of practice, in a sense 
that the mechanical engineer’s job is to harmonize these two to ensure maximum safe working environment for the 
people and the machines. An engineer’s job and function becomes dynamic in the sense that this may not necessarily 
end where it was intended. The paper was set to address the issue of a slipping truck and as a result unintended 
consequence of dead weight collision, and in this set up minimum slope angles to which the Collison Avoidance 
Technology can be used to switch off the truck or rather safe slope angles, measured by the digital inclinometer for 
the performance of engine kill manoeuver, which was 15o for loaded trucks and 35o for unloaded trucks.

Abstract 
This paper uses Technology Organisation Environment framework to investigate the adoption of e-commerce by 
Zimbabwe's hotel industry. Adoption of e-commerce in the hospitality industry has been found by other studies to 
vary in different locations and to be influenced by factors that also tend to vary by location. This makes it difficult for 
findings to be generalised across different domains. To enable informed investment and policymaking decision it is 
necessary to conduct a country-specific enquiry into the factors that influence e-commerce adoption in a sector. This 
paper explores e-commerce adoption in the wider context of e-readiness in Zimbabwe's travel and hospitality sector. 
A qualitative methodology under an interpretivist philosophy was used for this research and findings show that the 
inhibitors to e-commerce adoption were mainly at organisational level because of the lack of management support, 
organisational structure, organisational support and organisational readiness. On the other hand, the highest number 
of enablers were environmental factors that were due to customer and supplier expectation as well as competitive 
pressure from other hotels.

1. Introduction
The internet has disrupted and revolutionised the way that business is conducted and how people socialise. This has 
also happened across industries and countries, disrupting processes, practices, systems and procedures across the 
business value chain (Sulvankov, 2010). Adoption e-commerce in the hospitality industry is expected to take the lead 
ahead of other sectors in the developing world because international visitors remain its key target market. Other 
empirical works show that target market influences e-commerce adoption. The need to reach such distant markets 
naturally demands the use of a cheap and efficient marketing platform as the internet (Sahadev and Islam, 2005). As 
a result, a growing body of literature on the adoption of e-commerce in developing countries is exploring this 
phenomenon (Nwakanma, Ubani, Asiegbu and Nwokonkwo, 2014; Obonyo, Kabona, and Okeyo, 2016; Chevers,  and 
Spencer, 2017). 
While internet use has increased in the travel and tourism industry, empirical evidence shows that business models of 
current EC adopters in DCs have not been redesigned to adapt to e-commerce strategy. There is a tendency among 
enterprises to use the internet to automate their traditional ways of doing business instead of business process re-
engineering (Bhaskar, 2017). Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (2018) states that the hospitality sector provided 1.386 
billion to the economy and 7.2 % of jobs. The internet-enabled e-commerce is a fast, convenient channel to sell the

Abstract 
 
This paper is a literature review on the importance and impact of municipal density-related strategies on real estate 
developments. Developers focus on maximizing profit.  Therefore a feasibility should be conducted and the 
profitability assessed.  Municipalities have an influence on the development opportunities as urban spacial planning 
and land use management indicates the density permitted.  The density of developments in turn affects the feasibility 
of developments in some way, whether through delays, extended timeframes or policy amendments.  Further 
research will follow, analysing the feasibility of development projects, testing the impact of various densities for 
each project.

1. Introduction 
Density determines the coverage that may be constructed on a specific site. In order to determine whether density-
policy change is considered a significant and determinable risk in the feasibility of residential developments, it is 
important to grasp the background of property development, understand at which point it is a risk in the property 
development process and understand how a change in density can affect the feasibility of a residential development.  
 
1.1 
Property development background 
 
Phyrr et al. (1989) noted that property development is a process aimed at increasing the value of an existing property, 
either developed or undeveloped, through the application of resources such as material resources, human resources 
and capital resources.  
 
Collier noted that “most development occurs because of the potential for added value to be obtained from the process 
but the risks are still high and often factors which are outside the control of developers can spell disaster” (Collier, 
1995). 
 
Ratcliffe et al. (2009) described the property development industry as both complex and diverse. The complexity of 
the property development industry originates from the multitude of agencies (i.e. public versus private, large versus 
small) that undertake development as various legal entities. The diversity of the development industry results from the 
multitude of businesses across a wide range of sectors with varying development objectives.  
 
Ratcliffe et al. (2009) also noted that the property development industry is risky, cyclical, highly regulated and lengthy 
in production and acknowledged that the increasing intricacy of the property development industry “has led to the 
need for a deeper understanding of public policy, the real estate development process, physical planning, municipal

Hargitay and Yu (1993) and Brown and Matysiak (2000) defines risk in the context of property investment as “total 
risk” which is divided into two main categories, unsystematic (or specific) risk and systematic risk. Unsystematic (or 
specific) risks are specific to individual projects and the causes and consequences of these risks can be controlled by 
developers to an extent as they are mostly due to internal factors, whilst systematic risks are risks that affect the entire 
market and other investment markets that are generally out of the developers control since they are caused by broader 
economic and political issues. 
 
Similarly, P2P Residential Limited (2018), a London-based property development and investment firm, also divides 
the risks into systematic and unsystematic risks and lists the following risks that should be identified, assessed, 
controlled and mitigated in property development:  
 
In order to understand the impact of density changes on a real estate development, the components of the financial 
feasibility (i.e. total capital outlay, gross income, operating expenses and the vacancy factor) and the factors that affect 
these components must be understood. Should a market analysis reflect that an increased number of dwelling units 
will be absorbed by the market, the gross income can be increased by increasing the number of dwelling units, which 
consequently reduces a component of the total capital outlay (i.e. the land cost) by reducing the land cost per dwelling 
unit or square metres. However, an increase in density is usually associated with an increase in height, which would 
have cost implications in terms of engineering services, services such as lifts and structural requirements. It is therefore 
important to determine the breaking point with regards to the potential income from additional units and the marginal 
increased cost of the construction thereof. 
 
It is evident that the product of the development process is a result of the coordinated effort of various professionals. 
During each phase of the development process, the developer works with officials in the public sector in order to 
obtain in principle support, approvals, building regulations, infrastructure, etc. Public policy is therefore a key 
determinant in the feasibility of a development, particularly in the pre-development stage. The amendment of strategic 
planning documents whilst a development application is being assessed is of particular concern, especially if the 
developer has proceeded with construction of the development without final approvals in place. 
 
2. Conclusion 
It can be concluded from the literature study that the amendment of strategic plans, which could include density-
related strategies, is considered a valid risk, which is mostly present in the pre-development stage of the development 
process. Furthermore, the scale and nature of the development will affect the degree at which the amended density 
will impact the feasibility of a residential development.

Abstract  
 
Intrusion detection has become a popular solution of mitigating cyber-attacks in this technological era. Deep 
learning algorithm have become the go to solution in developing intelligent intrusion detection models and they 
have been successful. However, deep learning algorithms are too slow in training and this may not be effective for 
real time applications. Therefore, we propose to develop a faster intrusion detection model using a novel majority 
voting ensemble with Random Forest recursive feature elimination to improve computation time as well as the 
detection rate. By including the random forest recursive feature elimination in the proposed model, redundant 
features will be removed while maintaining the most discriminative features. We evaluated the efficacy of the 
proposed model on the CICIDS 2017 dataset. In addition, we compared our model with deep learning algorithms 
which include Resnet50, LSTM and AE-FCN. The experimental results showed that our proposed model 
outperformed the other deep learning algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and computation time.

1. Introduction 
 
Communication has become extremely dynamic because of the ever-evolving computing resources (Vinayakumar et 
al. 2019). This has been recently spear-headed by the Covid 19 pandemic which has forced a lot of businesses to 
allow their employees to work from the comfort of their homes. This has presented hackers with opportunities to 
hijack and hack the computing systems of most people. Over the years, intrusion detection systems have been 
developed to protect systems from such malicious and nefarious activities. However, while these systems were 
developed and improved over time, hackers have not been taking vacations. They have also been developing new 
ways to exploit computer systems. Intrusion detection systems are intelligent software designed to handle cyber-
attacks on the network (Rajagopal, Kundapur, and Hareesha 2020). In addition, these systems are responsible for 
inspecting packets of data entering into a system connected to the internet as either abnormal or normal. In this case, 
abnormal packets or behaviour are described as misuse detection or anomaly detection (He et al. 2019). Misuse 
detection involves the situation whereby the signature of a malicious transaction determines the attack model 
whereas in anomaly detection there is no relationship between the expected behaviour of network flow and the data 
involved (Thapa et al. 2020).  
 
 Machine learning has become a preferred option for developing intrusion detection systems because it provides the 
required intelligence of classifying unknown data or behaviours as either normal or abnormal (Manimurugan et al.

5. Conclusion 
 
Intrusion detection has and still is a popular problem in this digital age. This is because the nature of attacks are 
always evolving making it difficult to develop intrusion detection systems that detect them with the precision of a 
surgeon. The proposed model was highly focused on the reduction of the dimensionality of the features to improve 
both accuracy and computation time. The results showed that the proposed model is an excellent tool for developing 
intrusion detection models because of its superior performance compared to deep learning classifiers. The proposal 
also supported our hypothesis, which states that feature selection can improve the computation time since it was the 
fastest in comparison with the deep learning models. The results of the experimental study also showed that 
Resnet50, LSTM and AE-FCN are highly effective in detecting DDoS attacks. The main limitation of this body of 
work was the unbalanced structure of the CICIDS 2017 dataset. Therefore, we would like to create a balanced 
dataset as part of our future work.

Abstract 
This study evaluates the importance of e-commerce adoption to the growth of Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) as well as the dynamics that motivate e-commerce adoption by SMEs in Developing 
countries using evidence from Zimbabwe. The study facilitates the development of strategies and initiatives 
aimed at scaling up the adoption of e-commerce among SMEs in developing countries. It adopted a qualitative 
research methodology that made use of explanatory research. A sample of 15 participants was purposively selected 
for the in-depth interviews with participants from the furniture and metal fabrication sectors. The study contributes to 
the existing body of knowledge about the significance of e-commerce adoption and its use in SME growth in 
developing countries. The Zimbabwean case represents the challenges that affect most developing countries which 
suffer economic stability and have inadequate IT infrastructure. The study found that ecommerce adoption is inhibited 
by technological factors like ICT Infrastructure, Technology Competence and Technology Affordability. It also shows 
that all other organisational factors (i.e. Organisational Awareness, Customer Orientation and Organisational 
Resistance to change) inhibit adoption except for management support. At the environmental level, Suppliers / partners 
expectations and Government support enable while customer expectations and competitive pressure enable it.

1. Introduction
Garg and Choeu (2015) refer to Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) as a nascent trigger of economic growth within 
developing nations. E-commerce is a major innovation, which has benefited industries across the globe even the Small 
and Medium Industries (SMEs)(Schaper 2002; Essays UK, 2018). A number of challenges have plagued the adoption 
of e-commerce by SMEs globally (Ahmed, 2018). The SMEs sector is dominated by business actors that lack 
management skills, experience and the capacity to experiment with new technologies that big businesses exploit. Garg 
and Choeu (2015) attribute the difficulties partly to the ever-shifting domain of information systems and the changing 
demands of national and international business in general. 
SMEs play a significant role in the growth of both industrialised and developing countries. This is because they create 
employment and they foster rapid economic growth (Mazikana, 2019). SMEs are ideal for start ups that have no access 
to huge capital outlays. As a result, governments and scholars across they north-south divide have realised their 
importance (Schaper 2002; Kruja, 2013; Akugri, M, S., Bagah, D. A., and Wulifan, J. K. (2015). They are therefore 
compelled to craft policies that enhance the growth of SMEs.  While governments are begining to appreciate the need 
to support SMEs, there is a dearth of legislative support to foster their growth. This is especially the case in developing 
countries where the e-business front is still in its infancy.  
The challenges that SMEs in developing countries face in their quest to adopt e-commerce seem to be an obvious 
problem that emanates from the technological front. By simply scratching below that the surface, I.e. where entry 
point challenges obtain, we encounter a myriad of environmental and organisational imperatives that require a deeper 
analysis. We must on the onset warn that e-business and e-commerce is not solely dependent on technology. After all, 
information systems research has already warned about the folly of technological determinism (Avgerou, 2010). 
Technological determinism is the mistaken notion that technology on its own can foster social change (Dusek, 2007).

Abstract 
 
In this work, we demonstrate a hand-gesture controlled mobile robot with omni-directional movement capability. 
Hand-gesture control is achieved using a Myo armband.  When compared to a hand-held control device, hand-gesture 
control has the advantage of full robot observability rather than having the operator mainly focusing on the remote 
control device. Myo armband control has the primary advantage of low-cost and significantly fewer computing 
algorithms when compared to a vision-based gesture control. In this work, the hand gesture is recognized using an  
wearable arm device, which has EMG sensors that measure the electrical signals from muscles in the arm. Based on 
the contraction and rest movements of the muscles, the signals are used to control the locomotion of the mobile robot. 
Keywords  
Mobile robot, hand-gesture control, EMG, Myo armband 
 
 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
Gesture recognition is a commonly used approach for human-robotics interaction, as it can be used in all environments. 
Additionally, body language using hand gestures is the best way to demonstrate human intentions [1]. 
 
In recent years, different methods of gesture recognition for human robot interfacing have been used. One such method 
is the vision-based gesture recognition in which a camera is used for video-sequence-gesture recognition [2].  Gestures 
are recognized by color tracking [3], skeleton tracking, or even finger joint tracking using Leap Motion sensors, which 
can be used to communicate emotions [1].  Another method for gesture recognition is based on electromyography 
(EMG) sensing methods [4] [5] [6] . EMG sensing may be achieved by invasive or non-invasive techniques.   
 
In 2014, the Myo armband, developed by Thalmic Labs in 2014 [4] offered a new method for gesture control that is 
by far the simplest approach at a competitive cost.  It is equipped with electromyography sensors and an Inertial 
Measurement Unit (IMU) which consists of an accelerometer with a gyroscope and a magnetometer that work on all 
three axes.  The Myo armband works by surface (non-invasive) detection of electrical signals that are produced as a 
result of muscle contractions.   The electrical signals that are produced as a result of muscular movements are known 
as electromyography signals. 
 
Vision-based methods require computing complex mathematical algorithms such as support vector machines and 
Kalman filtering [3]. That is in addition to the need of expensive vision systems and powerful processing systems. 
Using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and electromyography sensing of muscle electric signals for gesture 
control applications can simplify the processing needs. Hidden Marcov Models (HMM) can be used to increase the 
recognition rate of multiple gestures [7].

robot processor, and the processor determines that the Myo armband is the paired controller, it allows it to control the 
robot wheels. The robot controller will also take overdrive inputs from the user directly via the robot touch screen, as 
shown in the figure.

4. Conclusion and Future Perspectives 
 
In this paper we demonstrate the use of the Myo armband, developed by Thalmic Labs, for gesture recognition and 
control of a mobile robot.  With the controller being a wearable device, the operator gains full awareness of both 
his/her own and the robot's surroundings.  The robot control successfully exhibited real-time human-robot interaction 
through hand gesture using a low-cost EMG noninvasive device.  The utilization of the armband control requires a 
short training by the user.  
 
The main drawback of the armband control is the small number of movements of the mobile robot that can be 
controlled, hence, for medical applications, controllability of a multi-axes robotic manipulator may not be achievable 
with the armband. For a robotic unit to reach any point in its working space, a minimum of six degrees-of-freedom 
are needed other than the movements required by the end-of-arm tooling.  Furthermore, the armband accuracy and 
precision in acquiring gesture data may differ from user to another, both inaccuracy in acquisition of hand gestures 
and inability to detect gesture signals may be magnified in users with medical conditions in which muscular movement 
is impaired or the motor performance is limited such as in Parkinson’s disease [8].  Furthermore, recent studies show 
that electromyographic signals generated from muscles of patients of Parkinson’s disease can change considerably in 
patients who undergo Deep Brain Stimulation treatment [9].  
 
Although a small number of degrees of freedom may be controlled with the armband, particularly in persons with 
impaired muscular functionality such as in patients of Parkinson’s disease, Myoclonus, and Tremor, however, 
secondary auto-assist systems may aide collaboratively to achieve full control. Such as including a secondary 
controller, a built-in obstacle avoidance functionality, force sensing, and vision-based perception capabilities for more 
robust operation, as well as including a return-to-home functionality to overcome potential loss of signal from the 
Myo armband. 
 
Future perspectives include determining the precision and accuracy rates of acquisition of gestures in persons with 
impaired muscular functionality such as in patients of Myoclonus, which causes sudden muscle jerks [10], and the 
involuntary oscillation of a body part  referred to as Tremor [11], and Parkinson’s disease.

Continuous quality improvement is one of the keys for business success as well as business problem solving. Six Sigma is the 
most recognized and perceived quality change technique. Six Sigma can be defined as a statistical measure of variability which is 
the cause of defective and out-of-control processes. In this paper, six sigma was utilized to eliminate duplex gluing defects in 
cartoon production at Noor company. The number of defectives has been successfully decreased after identifying and changing 
the level of three factors were found to be the reason behind the increasing defective units. These factors are speed, amount of 
pressure applied to fix glue, and how long the pressure time.  
Key words 
Six Sigma, DPMO,  DMAIC, Master Black Belt, Green Builts, ANOVA. 
 
1-INTRODUCTION 
Six Sigma is a term for process performance that produces only 3.4 defects for every million opportunities or 3.4 DPMO, in 
other words, almost defect-free performance. 
Very limited number of global companies have attained Six Sigma. Most organizations, however, are working at levels of 
around four sigma, or approximately 6,000 defects per million (A. & Y. 2005). Also, Six Sigma is the focus of many businesses as 
there is a direct relationship between the number of product defects, wasted operating costs, and the level of customer satisfaction.  
Six Sigma can be viewed as a strategic improvement methodology with six steps: define, measure, analyze, improve, and 
control (DMAIC). DMAIC is used to carry out the philosophy of Six Sigma in manufacturing, design, engineering, human 
resources, purchasing, customer service, and others (Huckabee, T. 2015). 
Six Sigma has a clear focus on achieving measurable and quantifiable financial benefits and gives importance to strong and 
passionate leadership support. In fact, it solves problems through the use of both human elements like culture change, and customer 
focus, and process elements such as process management, statistical analysis and measurement system analysis (D. Sunil et al 2013). 
Six Sigma has an organizational hierarchy structure for managers and employees depending on their expertise. The Master 
Black Belt is the one with the highest level of technical and organizational efficiency and plays technical leadership in the Six 
Sigma program. Whereas Green Belts are the employees trained in Six Sigma tools who contribute in Six Sigma projects but still 
have other responsibilities (Gaspersz, V. 2007).  
There are two known methodologies for Six Sigma. The first one is the DMAIC which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Improve, and Control. Define is the first step that enable the leaders set the goals of a selected projects and develop the statement 
of work. Measure is the origin where the team gauge the improvement of the project. Analyze is the stem where the team identify 
the possible causes of defects that affects the outputs of the organization. Improve is where the team brainstorm for 
countermeasures for lasting improvements. And lastly, Control is the step to reduce variation by controlling the inputs and 
monitoring the outputs. 
The other one is the DFSS (Design For Six Sigma), which has two well-known methodologies. First is the IDOV, wherein the 
first step is Identifying the criteria for success, second is Design wherein the parameters of design identified in the first step is 
translated into an effective design. Third step is Optimize wherein the further consideration of the design is ensured for effective

4.CONCLUSION 
In this study, six sigma methodology (DMAIC) has been applied on the gluing operation at Al-Noor factory. 
Initially, the number of defective units at gluing section was considered as significant and needed to be improved. After Data 
collection and Analysis, three factors (speed, pressure level and pressure time) were considered as potential causes. The most 
influential causes have been identified as speed and pressure time and their optimal levels were suggested to be at 175 (sheet/hr) 
and for 2 (sec). 
After applying the new recommended levels, the number of defective units has been significantly decreases from 297 to 101 
units, which consequently increased the level of sigma from 2.2 to 2.91. 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 below illustrate how the defects rate is reduced after applying the new speed and amount of pressure time 
factors.

Abstract 
 
As entities merge, operations consolidation by reducing the number of operating facilities, minimizing the staffing levels and 
reengineering flow between supply and customers’ demands are of utmost importance for mergers success. In this paper, branch 
restructuring of two Saudi-based banks after their mergers will be discussed. The bank branch restructuring will be optimized by 
minimize the operating cost, satisfying customer demand (number of transactions) and discarding extra supply by closing some 
branches. Set covering and transportation models will be used in assigning each branch to a customer node area, ensuring it 
satisfies their demand. Final results suggest a 3% decrease in operating costs.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Saudi Arabia recent social and economic reform blueprint has created a major focus on developing the financial services 
sector. Driven by high operating costs and a competitive banking market, Banks in Saudi Arabia are focusing on decreasing costs, 
consolidating their operations and in particular, mergers; where entities reengineer and construct a single operating model. 
Considering this major change at organizational level, the distribution of services centers, specifically branches, has to be 
redesigned to reflect the new merger organization. This research paper presents the work conducted with the merger team 
responsible of consolidating two Saudi banks branch operations after their merger in 2019. The main objective of this work is to 
evaluate and deliver a new design of the branch network distribution, yielding to an optimum branch network that can process 
customer transactions (satisfy demand) with minimized cost.  This work is organized as follows: 
-First, a literature review that will cover bank mergers, branch consolidation, Bank operations optimization. 
-Second, the branch network optimization model will be covered by introducing the problem statement, methodology, data 
and the mathematical Model. 
-Finally, results of the mathematical model will be discussed   
2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
Merging Banks is a popular research area, and it has been widely addressed in the literature where many published studies 
try to evaluate the arguments of achieving positive results through bank merging (Madura, J. & Wiant, K. 1994). 
For example, (Mavri, M. 2015) developed a mathematical framework algorithm for reconfiguring bank branch network. In the 
first phase, the proposed algorithm finds the optimum number of branches for bank networks and the optimum performance each 
branch should provide. While in the second phase, the model finds branches' optimum locations. The proposed performance 
algorithm defined the values of the variables to improve performance and relocation costs. 
In (Gattoufi, S. et al 2012), the authors proposed an Inverse Data Envelopment Analysis application (InvDEA) model. To 
achieve higher level of efficiency, InvDEA model gathered information about quantities of input and used it to predict the level 
of produced output. To show the practicality of the proposed method, the model has investigated 42 banking units for merging 
banks in real data set. 
While mergers present great opportunities to consolidate operations and increase profits, achieving that is not as easy and 
straightforward as it seems.  For instance, (Healy, P. et al 1992) suggested that there is a clear positive relationship between stock 
returns at merger announcement and post-merger raises in operating cash flow returns. Also, the authors in (Al-Sharkas, A. et al 
2008) confirmed (using Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA)) the positive impacts on cost and profit efficiency effects in case of

The Branch Network Optimization will select of the set of branches that can cover the customer nodes demand with the optimal 
cost where each customer node can be served by one branch or more. In the following, the mathematical Model including the 
decision variables, parameters, Objective function and the different constraints will be presented.

Constraint (1) guarantees that each branch doesn’t process more transactions that its capacity. 
Constraint (2) ensures that the number of transactions required by each customer node are fully fulfilled 
Constraint (3) uses the big M method to ensure that if a branch is closed, it doesn’t process any transactions demanded by 
customers. M is chosen to be the highest capacity within all branches. 
4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
The Branch Network Optimization Model introduced in part IV was implemented and solved using LINGO with data 
(demand, capacity, cost...etc.) being imported from Excel. The implemented Model that selects the set of branches that will fulfill 
customer nodes demand at the minimum cost, resulted in 20 and 18 branches, corresponding to Bank A and Bank B respectively, 
with significant cost savings. Actually, by closing 10 branches, a total of SR51.7 M (around US$13.7 M) per year will be saved.  
After presenting these results to the Merger Integration team, a second scenario where capacity and demand are not considered 
emerged. In fact, the Merger Integration team wanted to quantify the potential savings if the minimum number of branches that 
will cover all the customer nodes is kept open, without necessarily fulfilling the required demand. While fulfilling demand 
constraint is necessary to have a realistic and feasible solution, the Merger Integration team wanted to investigate this scenario, 
quantify the potential savings, and expand capacity (if needed) later on. 
 For this scenario, a new Mathematical Model was built and consisted of a Set Covering Model where the customer nodes are 
covered with the minimum number of Branches. Actually, the Set Covering Model built: 
 uses the same objective function and the binary decision variables as the Capacitated Facility Location model presented 
in part IV

2450"," ignores the capacity and demand constraints  
 includes the coverage constraint: each customer node should be covered by at least one branch. 
The set covering Model was implemented and solved with LINGO. The solution consists of a set of 34 branches (21 branches 
from Bank A and 13 branches from Bank B) with total savings equal to SR72,9 M (around US$19.4 M) per year. 
while investigating the two scenarios discussed earlier gave the Merger Integration team a better understanding of the financial 
ramifications of the available consolidation options, the final branch network will take several months to be finalized because of 
several challenges like: terminating or reassigning employees and the costs related to that, growth perspectives, Reassigning 
existing Customers to new Branches,  and Marketing the new redesigned  Network.

Cyber Security researchers, professionals and enthusiasts are currently faced with the challenge of coming up with 
advanced methods to deal with the bludgeoning of highly sophisticated Malware attacks on critical infrastructures 
housing sensitive information. The task of detecting, analysing and investigating the presence of Malware in a system 
is a daunting one, necessitating deep knowledge and skills in Malware Analysis. This analysis helps practitioners to 
uncover the behaviour and also the characteristics of Malware, thereby enabling Cyber Security practitioners and 
businesses to be proactive in building tools and techniques for defence against this type of Cyber-attacks. Malware 
authors are becoming more sophisticated in the methods they are using to evade detection. State of the art techniques 
are being applied to Malware Analysis with Machine Learning increasingly becoming popular while yielding very 
promising results. This paper proposes a hybrid framework for Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning 
methods for dynamic and static Malware analysis.

1. Introduction  
Malware which refers to any type of Malicious Software such as viruses, trojans, rootkits, trapdoors, adware, 
ransomware etc (Distler 2007), is among the myriad of threats that have become ubiquitous across the Cyberspace 
wreaking havoc to organisations worldwide. These have an adverse impact not only on business operations and service 
delivery but also the security of individuals’ personal information. Those using Microsoft Windows operating system 
have been the most vulnerable. In addition, huge financial losses due to Malware, are recorded incessantly.  In the 
past,  cases of Ransomware attacks have mainly been popular in large organisations, but recently even individuals 
have lost data owing to such attacks. Merchants Point of Sale (POS)  machines have been infected by various variants 
of POS Malware aimed at scraping credit card details of customers by using remote access tools and credential 
dumpers to access the system and inject Malware (Rautmare 2020). Malware can be introduced into the system 
through phishing attacks whereby an insider may naively open a link sent to their email with Malware embedded

2452","5. Results and Discussion  
The work presented recommends a method catering for both dynamic and static Malware analysis of executable 
binaries using Machine Learning. The hybrid framework ideally implements a stacked unsupervised and supervised 
Machine Learning model which seeks to profile the files based on behaviour that is deemed as normal and that which 
is anomalous in the presence of Malware. Unsupervised Learning algorithm supports dynamic analysis as executable 
binaries are unpacked making it possible to create profiles for the files. This is important as Malware behaviour can 
be identified instead of dependency upon signatures alone which is not adequate to detect Zero-day Malware instances. 
The output then passes on to the supervised Learning algorithm which supports static analysis whereby the profiled 
files become training input to build a predictive model to aid in the detection of Malware. This combination of the 
two types of Malware analysis is expected to yield better results towards protection of information systems. This may 
help to detect stealth malware attacks and reduce the risk of extensive damage to the systems.  
 
5.1 Proposed Improvements and Validation 
The proposed hybrid framework is the earliest of efforts on the roadmap by the researchers to contribute towards this 
important area of Cyber Security. The current work will culminate in the implementation and testing of supervised 
and unsupervised algorithms on a Malware dataset. In addition to simple Machine Learning methods, Ensemble 
Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods shall also be tested which are expected to yield more superior results 
than previous methods highlighted in literature.  
 
 
6. Conclusion  
The research work revealed that, as techniques for introducing Malware in Information Systems and evading detection 
continue to evolve at a fast pace, more effort is being applied towards improving defense mechanisms and safeguards 
focused on preserving the security of the systems.  More stealth detection techniques are being developed to ensure 
the Malware analysis does not leave a trace of the analysis performed in a virtual environment it does not give the 
Malware author an advantage. Dynamic and static Malware Analysis techniques are commonly applied with Hybrid 
techniques yielding better results by harnessing the strengths of the two types of analysis. Malware authors aim to 
bypass the defenses by applying techniques such as obfuscation, anti-debugging, anti-disassembling, sandbox evasion, 
antivirus evasion etc. Sandboxing is key in Malware analysis so as to prevent risks of executing infected files in the 
system. A hybrid framework for Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning was proposed. This framework 
enables dynamic analysis to be performed in a virtual environment Implementation and validation shall be done in the 
future works.

Abstract 
The study revealed that the companies that supplies TSAM has well-established R&D department that work with 
the Individual Quality sections to improve productivity by eliminating defects. Both companies aim at preventing 
defects from passing to the customer if identified in the manufacturing plant.  Customer identified defects are 
studied by the R&D team to improve productivity and corrected once and for all. The study looked at the 5Ms 
namely Method, Material, Manpower, Machine and Mother nature. The root causes of defects in material, process, 
operator, and equipment were mitigated using the 5WHY approach. The study revealed that the defects caused by 
materials is the highest in the sample taken and mother nature also played a significant role due to the covid 19 
pandemic.

In LM, management intervenes and acknowledge any defect in their products. The source of the defect is 
identified and analysed so that the team can start to develop the corrective measures. All staff in the section is 
given a chance to explain his ideas in brain storming until a proper solution has been obtained. Rather than blame 
the specific staff members whose work did not meet the expected outcomes they do the Poka Yoke process. A 
defect at TSAM is the starting point for improvement. Exceptional treatment is given to all sections where 
customers have issues and respect the customers’ demands.

Abstract 
 
The advancement of computerized technology enables us to handle the file size as large as needed and 
retrieval may take a split of a second as well as the interaction of several files is quite possible. Therefore, 
the entire manufacturing system may change. Lately, Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling (IPPS) 
systems are published in abundant and probably successfully implemented for various level of the 
manufacturing scale. It seems that the previous system of Material Requirement Planning (MRP), capacity 
planning, production scheduling is going to disappear and the IPPS system replaces them. However, 
management insists to impose controlling factors such as delivery date and cost on IPPS systems to achieve 
successful execution. This paper proposes a flexible manufacturing system and describes the tasks of each 
unit. The production-order section is negotiating the realistic cost and delivery due-date and release jobs to 
IPPS and report customer inquiries on production order progress. IPSS is working as a processing system 
on the integration policy that a free resource searches a free operation. The proposed approach has been 
described with examples as well as the algorithm has been explained.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Manufacturing involves a series of activities to meet various objectives of governing management such as the 
execution and implementation of policies by Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), all Return On Investment (ROI) as 
well as efficient and optimal utilization of available resources of the company. In other words, the industry must make 
profit. Manufacturing is mainly concerned with the production of tangible goods and the activities are, as a rule, 
specified by the engineering profession as well as it is divided to many segments as per the specialized functions 
within the manufacturing. A usual manufacturing company follow the hierarchical structure which functions in a top-
down manner having defined modules and their functionality with local objectives, in which the cost and profit is 
never the priority. Modules communication is permitted among the parent (top department) and child (bottom 
department). The planning and execution related to previously fixed decisions. So, it deprives the flexibility and 
efficiency from production [Jain et al 2013; Halevi 1980, 2012, 2014, 2017; Halevi & Wang, 2007; Halevi & Phanden 
2019]. 
The hierarchical approach of manufacturing is the one-way sequence of linked events, where each link has a specific 
function and the earlier link being deemed as a constraint. For instance, a master production schedule accepts the Bill

from the preceding sequential cycle, then the system searches the matrices of all parts in this specific resource column, 
and lists all free operations with the best spot on them. This list includes all free operations that the specific resource 
can do the best. 
 
If the list contains only one entry, then this entry (operation) is allocated to the resource and its RSFs are updated and 
its resource counter is set to the new operating time. On the other side, If the list comprises more than one entry, then 
the system assigns the operation with the biggest time gap of achieving it on an alternative resource. This value is 
revealed by searching the operation row in the applicable roadmap and calculating the processing time difference 
among the best resource and the processing time on several resources. Each free operation will be labelled by this 
difference value. The free operation with the top tag value will be the one that will be given on this sequence cycle on 
the idle resource.   
 
Table 5 demonstrates this algorithm. R4 is the idle resource and there are four free operations for which this resource 
is the best one. The system searches these operations through the whole resources and calculates the variation among 
minimum time (BEST) and the time on each resource. The maximum difference value is on the column marked by 
delta “Δ”. In this case, the difference among the BEST resource and the resource processing time of item 5 operation 
2 is the biggest (13.9 - 9.95 = 3.95). So, this operation will be assigned to the R4 resource. Its RSF is updated, and its 
counter is set to the new operating time. 
 
If the list is empty a “look ahead” feature is used to determine the ""waiting time"" for the best operation to become 
""free"". This hunt is done by examining the idle resource column for a quest of free operation. When such operation is 
encountered, (it is not the best for that resource) the BEST field of this raw indicates which resource is the best for 
that operation. The entry in the field resource counter of the resource status file indicates the waiting time of that 
resource. 
 
6. CONCLUSION 
With the advancements in the computational capability, the manufacturing data could be handled more carefully, and 
which ultimately yield a better decision-making process. Therefore, the IPPS can be achieved and consideration of 
delivery due date and cost is possible. Based on this assumption, this paper proposed a flexible manufacturing system 
and describes the tasks of each section. The production-order section is negotiating the realistic cost and delivery due 
date and release jobs to IPPS and report customer inquiries on production order progress. IPSS is working as a 
processing system on the integration policy that a free resource searches a free operation. The proposed approach has 
been described with examples as well as the algorithm has been explained. However, the practical implementation of 
the proposed system is still pending.

Abstract 
 
This paper anchors and grounds the culture, and architecture of Technical and Vocational Education and Training in 
Africa which was vibrant and later drowned by colonization. African governments failed to domesticate and embody 
decolonization curriculum strategies and deploy budgets to promote and enhance heritage based TVET educational 
philosophies. The TVET DNA architecture in Africa was grounded in various cultural settings from creation. The 
Creator (God) illustrated the power and philosophy of TVET when He created the universe with all the plethora of 
living and non-living, Genesis 1. The Universe is typical example of Industrial Engineering And Operations 
Management System. Nations are built and sustained through TVET Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Systems. The researcher will argue that the tenets of African TVET philosophy were intercepted, 
interrupted and bastardised by slavery and colonization. Resultantly foreign-centric technologies and culture permeate 
and perpetuate dependency syndrome to the detriment of African Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Systems. Africa is now a vast warehouse for everything foreign inclusive of the education, health, industrial, 
technological and engineering systems. Paradigm paralysis is domiciled in Africa to the extent that industrialisation 
appears to be a distant cousin having been relegated by slavery and colonisation. Drucker (1985) notes that a 
knowledge society is one in which the quality of life is dependent upon the primary production of knowledge as a 
resource instead of capital and labour as was the case in the agrarian and  industrial economies. The researcher submits, 
and proffers possible gateways to circumvent some of these challenges from an Afrocentric can perspective. The 
research is a mixed mode approach necessitated by the need to unbundle and unpack ontological reality, 
epistemological and existential shortcomings and shortfalls in the developmental agenda as exhibited by unsupported 
TVET policies in Africa. Zimbabwe will be at the core of the study.

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background to the Study 
The TVET DNA architecture for Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Systems in Africa was 
embedded in cultural settings from time immemorial and was more pronounced during the Timbuktu era and the 
construction of the Great Zimbabwe superstructure during the 12th and 14th century BC respectively. This was the way 
of life for Africans. All the traditional activities were based on TVET architecture for Industrial Engineering and 
Operations Management Systems with properly structured and segregated norms and values. TVET was grounded 
and anchored on politics, fire making, hunting, great hunter (hombarume), medicine, farming, great farmer (hurudza), 
engineering (Umhizha), mining, blacksmithing, basketry, weaving and geometry. All these were suppressed during 
slavery and later colonization as foreign education systems were superimposed on Africans. Hence, initiatives and 
innovations of African origin were suppressed or ignored or stolen or intellectually burgilarised to this very day.  
African governments have generally ignored indigenous TVET Knoweldge systems in favour of foreign-centric 
technologies which have perpetuated the dependency syndrome to the extent that Africa is now a vast warehouse of

2486","5. Findings, Recommendations, Wayforward and Conclusion 
5.1 Empirical findings  
• 
Africa education ecosystem is rooted is foreign centric discourse. These alienate and disorient learners from the 
local context and push them to what to be identified with that which is foreign. 
• 
TVET knowledge acquisition is characterised by low conversion, under-utilisation and mis-utiliation, limited 
collaborations and networking.  
• 
Generally TVET knowledge workers’ qualifications are not commensurate with current global trends and the 
dichotomy of Industrial Engineering And Operational Management Systems. 
• 
TVET Knowledge Management system is hampered by lack of Afro-centric policy. 
• 
ICT plays a determining factor as key enabler and facilitator to the acquisition, sharing, networking and generation 
of Industrial Engineering and Operational Management Systems.  
 
5.1.1 Recommendations 
Emanating from the implication of the research study as explored above, the researcher makes the following 
recommendations for effective and efficient Industrial Engineering and Operations Management In Africa.  
• 
TVET Knowledge Management practices and initiatives should be reasserted and repurposed to anchor 
national development in terms Industrial Engineering and Operational Management Systems. 
• 
Develop clear policies and philosophies that repurpose and support the implementation of national Industrial 
Engineering and Operational Management Systems in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) 
embedded in indigenous knowledge systems. 
• 
Understand and emphasise practical approaches and solutions to create indigenous TVET Industrial 
Engineering and Operational Management Systems as a competitive edge.  
5.1.2 
Wayforward  
5.1.3 
This study opens opportunities for future research due to the complexity and limited resources of the 
researcher that ultimately affected the landscape of the research area to mainly polytechnics in 
Zimbabwe. Further appropriate research to validate the model used can be explored to determine if there 
is an optimal interrelationship of Knowledge Management processes and performances. 
5.1.4 Conclusion 
This research study has managed to demonstrate that African governments through their education institutions need 
to rediscover, reposition, repurpose and reassert the philosophy of indigenous Technical Vocational Education and 
Training for national reskilling, industrial engineering and operational management. Adequate budget provisions, 
public policy orientation, and resources mobilization to improve efficiency, good corporate governance and 
effectiveness of public educational institutions should be put in place. African governments must domesticate, 
institutionalise, commoditizatise, and embody decolonization curriculum strategises that promote and enhance 
heritage based TVET philosophy. Thinking philosophies need to be recoded, reengineered and reconfigured to enable 
mindset repositioning to enhance development of Industrial Engineering and Operations Management System.

Abstract 
Seed Certification prerequisites trade and marketing of crop seed varieties within and across countries or Global 
Regions. A Seed Lot can only be certified if it meets minimum quality of genetic and physical purity standards as 
enshrined in Certification Schemes of Certifying Authority or Agency of respective Organisations, Countries, or   
Regions. The quality standards set may vary considerably across Seed Certification Schemes. Meeting of genetic 
purity standards in maize seed production requires Distance and Time Isolation husbandry techniques in the 
separation of seed production fields from sources of foreign pollen in neighbouring contaminant maize fields. These 
two Seed field Isolation techniques however require minimisation in response to ever rising pressure on land and 
tight turn around cropping schedules in farms. Essias Michael Kok (1985), with help of Ephrame Kudzaishe 
Havazvidi, showed that minimum Distance Isolation set for Certification of maize seed crops could be reduced to 
122 metres provided that the protected maize seed crop is planted on the leeward side of the potential contaminant 
maize crop and that the synchronisation (or nicking) of pollen shed in the male parent of the seed maize crop with 
silking period in the female parent of the protected seed maize crop is perfect. Time Isolation technique obviates 
distance separation of seed fields from potential contaminant maize crops and furthermore removes wind current 
challenges which may reduce effectiveness of Distance Isolation. Ephrame Kudzaishe Havazvidi (1989) derived 
Time Isolation Formulae and quantified Safety Factors in the formulae to ensure reliability in their effectiveness. He 
derived Time Isolation Constants specific to the genetic constitution of female parents of the different seed maize 
crops i.e. inbred females, sisterline cross females and single cross females, respectively. Corrective measures to 
conform excessive genetic contamination of seed maize to certification standards set can be taken using algorithms 
derived by the Author (unpublished). The principle behind Ephrame Kudzaishe Havazvidi’s algorithms lies in the 
mixing or blending of inferior quantities of seed lots with specified quantities of seed lots containing much higher 
genetic or physical quantity fractions than those stipulated in Seed Certification Schemes in question. These 
algorithms can also be applied in other Industrial Blending or Stoichiometric formulations.

1. Introduction  
Maize (Zea mays L.) derives high agronomic performance from heterotic mating or hybrid vigour. Any genetic 
recombination towards homozygosis will lead to inbreeding depression in traits of economic importance such as 
grain yield. Undesirable pollination arising from maize fields bordering hybrid seed maize production fields breaks 
down heterotic genetic recombinations resulting in low yield performance of the hybrid seed produced. Furthermore, 
uniformity in expression of pertinent traits is lost when seed maize crops are pollinated by foreign pollen. Seed

Distance Isolations in the prevention of genetic contamination in seed maize production, can be revised backwards 
particularly when good pollinator male parents and good synchronisation of flowering of male and female parents 
are ensured. Effective Time Isolation of seed maize crops from maize contamination can be calculated from 
Havazvidi (1989) C1 and C2 Formulae inserting safety parameters estimated in this project. Seed Lots not meeting 
Seed Certification can be reclaimed by blending with above Standard Seed Lots using Havazvidi (2014). Blending 
Algorithms provided the seed contaminant does not corrupt the resultant seed blend.

Biography  
Dr Ephrame Kudzaishe Havazvidi is the Senior Group Research Consultant for Seed Co Group Ltd, in retirement. 
He has served this top Pan African Seed Organisation for forty years since 1980. Dr Havazvidi headed Seed Co 
Group Research and Development Function for ten years (2005-2015) during which he recruited, mentored, trained 
and directed a Team of Plant Breeders to top performance in the region. Dr Havazvidi and his Team significantly 
raised genetic grains in maize, wheat, and soyabean varieties in pertinent traits such as grain yield, disease tolerance, 
climate resilience and heat and drought tolerance, conferring wide adaptation across Sub Saharan Africa. Dr 
Ephrame Havazvidi released thirty high Industrial Quality wheat varieties whose top yield performance enabled 
Zimbabwean irrigated spring wheat farmers to rank top in the world in 1996 up to 2014. There after this crown 
slipped to Egypt upon land ownership reforms. Dr Havazvidi has been nominated by SAPBA among the top twenty 
influential Plant Breeders in Africa after receiving the C.F.U  ‘Alan Pilditch ‘ and the Zimbabwe Wheat Board

Abstract 
 
The study discussed below is one that centers around the following research question: Is gender identification at birth 
correlated with empathy level? In understanding the empathy levels of humans, one can gain insight into the topic of 
empathy with relation to gender and the role that empathy of different genders plays in human society. Moreover, this 
study holds the possibility of illustrating that transgender people mentally identify with the empathy levels of an 
alternative gender, contributing to a higher level of understanding from human society. In understanding those who 
are transgender more fully, studies such this one could increase societal toleration, allowing transgender people the 
acceptance they deserve. After collecting dozens of responses via a virtual survey, the collected data was analyzed via 
the Chi Square Test for Association and the Mann-Whitney U-Test. Ultimately, both tests determined that the collected 
data was highly statistically significant, indicating that gender identification at birth is correlated with empathy level.  
 
Key Words 
Empathy, gender, statistics, correlation, nature  
 
1. Introduction 
First, the motivation and basis for this study will be discussed, and some scientific information will be 
included. Additionally, the hypothesis developed prior to carrying out this study will be detailed. 
 
Often, human females are assumed by society to be the most altruistic or empathetic of the genders (Christov-
Moore, Leonardo, et al., 2014). What was intriguing about this commonly believed assumption is that females of 
specific species in nature tend to be less empathetic than male organisms as shown by the routine consumption of their 
mates and young (Suttle, 1999). These same behaviors have been predicted and observed in male organisms of specific 
species more rarely (Revynthi, A.M., et al., 2018). Consider the example of the male black widow spider. This 
illustrates the contrast between the empathy of different genders in the animal kingdom, contributing to the question 
as to how human empathy appears different between genders. Interested in both the sharp contrast between nature 
versus human society and the assumption that females are more empathetic, the authors carried out this study in order 
to determine the answer to the following question: Is gender identification at birth correlated with empathy level? 
Unlike other studies which have conducted research regarding wild animal behavior with regard to empathy, this study 
will provide an interesting contrast to studies regarding wild animals. By comparing human empathy to the empathy 
of wild animals, one can gain insight into the role of empathy and how it differs in human society.  
 
After considering the above question with regard to personal experience, the following hypothesis was 
developed: Gender identification at birth does correlate with empathy level. A study such as this one is pertinent to 
society today and is growing more and more relevant to society's discussions. In a world where so many assumptions 
are simply made without basis, finding the “truth” is a hugely valuable endeavor. In studying this topic, the objective 
is to determine if the common assumptions made about male, female, or alternate gender empathy levels are accurate, 
scientifically and statistically. Based on research, my preliminary belief is that the empathy level of males will be 
lower than that of females.  
 
2. Methods 
 
In this portion of my paper, the materials used to carry out this study will be discussed. Further, the method 
used to carry out this study will be described. This study did not require a great deal of materials to yield statistical 
data. After collecting statistical data, several procedures were carried, specifically statistical tests.

The resulting Chi-Square value of 13.77 exceeded both the 95% (9.49) and 99% (13.28) significance 
thresholds, meaning that that the correlation between gender identification at birth and empathy level is statistically 
highly significant, and again, that the alternative hypothesis should be accepted. The result of this test is particularly 
important as it proves that the formation of empathy level intervals did not alter the results of the statistical tests, 
suggesting stronger validity of the observations. Moreover, this test highlights the reliability of the data at hand.  
 
3.5 Mann-Whitney U-Test 
By conducting the Mann-Whitney U-Test, it will be determined if there is a significant difference between 
the average4 empathy levels of males versus females. From here, one would be able to make further conclusions based 
on the results of this test. Because the data collected falls on the ordinal and nominal scales, it is only logical to use 
the Mann-Whitney U-test as it is a nonparametric test. The null hypothesis for this experiment is as follows: there is 
no difference between the average empathy levels of males versus females. The alternative hypothesis for this 
experiment is as follows: there is a significant difference between the average empathy levels of males versus females.

2524","In short, this study provided the opportunity to apply biological and statistical concepts to a realistic and 
pertinent topic with real world implications for society today. Future research building on the study discussed 
throughout this paper could contribute to the end of the baseless persecution of transgender people. Studies such as 
the one described in the above subsection could possibly demonstrate that those who are transgender mentally identify 
with the empathy levels of an alternative gender. By studying the relationship between changes in gender and empathy 
level, human society would be able to better understand those who are transgender. The increased understanding that 
comes from such scientific studies could likely lead to the increased level of tolerance from human society that 
transgender people deserve.

Abstract 
This study was motivated by the primary investigator’s love for the environment. Specifically, an interest in ocean 
acidification led to the process described in which common brine shrimp were used to simulate the impact of 
acidification on the world’s oceans. Through the use of white, distilled vinegar acting as the “acidification” for the 
simulated conditions, three populations of brine shrimp were monitored before, during, and after varying levels of 
acid were added to their individual habitats. Analyses of the data utilizing the Kruskal-Wallis Tests and Chi-Square 
Test for Association were implemented to compare the effect of acid levels on brine shrimp survival. The results 
demonstrated statistically significant differences in the survival between the populations of brine shrimp as a function 
of varying acid concentrations utilizing the Kruskal-Wallis method. Further, the results of the Chi-Square Test for 
Association demonstrated an association between the acid levels and brine shrimp populations. This investigation is 
significant because it provides insight into the damage that ocean acidification can cause to oceanic organisms and is 
demonstrative of the impact humans might be having on our global environment.   
 
Key Words 
Ocean, Acidification, Statistics, Correlation, Chi-Square 
 
1. Introduction 
 
This investigation studied the effects of human-induced acidification of the earth’s oceans in order to prove 
a specific point: namely that ocean acidification is harmful to our global environment and that continued increases in 
carbon dioxide levels as a result of human pollution are unsustainable and detrimental to the world. 
 
Throughout the course of human habituation on earth, humans have seemingly thrived. While the constant 
advancement in human innovation has led to improved human livelihood, these advancements have also taken a huge 
toll on the environment. To study these issues, the growing environmental impact of ocean acidification was 
investigated. Specifically, simulated conditions were created to monitor common brine shrimp survival in controlled 
environments with varying levels of acidification. The world's oceans absorb approximately one-third of the world’s 
carbon dioxide supply (Fabry, V., et al., 2008 ), and the absorption of this carbon dioxide comes at a cost. 
 
Ocean acidification, or “the other CO2 problem,” is a major problem that has accompanied the increase in 
human populations and the resulting carbon dioxide levels for centuries, worsening as human populations continue to 
grow (Doney and Scott C., 2008). As a result, ocean acidification has contributed to the destruction of organisms, 
habitats, and ecosystems in our world’s oceans. Further, ocean acidification has led to numerous mass extinctions 
(Guinotte et al., 2008) as well as a decrease in calcification, the process by which organisms create calcium carbonate, 
a critical component of marine animal’s shells. For example, ocean acidification was likely responsible in part for the 
Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (Anthony, et al., 2008). A decrease in calcification means that Cretaceous organisms 
are unable or less likely to be able to produce their protective shells. Because ocean acidification is such a prominent 
problem but receives so little attention, the main study objective was to simulate the effects of increased acid levels 
on our ocean on marine wildlife.  
 
 
2. Relationship between shrimp and acidity 
 
Throughout this section, the specific methods and materials used by the researcher will be outlined. From 
background research, the investigator formed a hypothesis from which they compared their results to. In this section,

2527","shows that the later decrease in population sizes was due to the addition of vinegar, not because the tanks had different 
levels of shrimp to begin with. 
 
 
3.3 Kruskal-Wallis Assessment for Medians Part 2 
The second Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the medians of the three tanks after their specific levels 
of acid were added. This test was used to prove that there was a statistically significant difference between the 
populations of brine shrimp per quadrat with the addition of vinegar. VassarStats was once again used to run the 
Kruskal-Wallis test. A very high H score of approximately 73.89 was obtained. After comparing this H score with the 
same critical value as prior (5.99) because both tests had the same degrees of freedom (2), and, recognizing that 73.89 
greatly exceeds the critical value of 5.99, the null hypothesis was rejected and instead the alternative hypothesis was 
accepted. The alternative hypothesis was that there was a statistically significant difference between the means of the 
medians of the average population of brine shrimp per quadrat in these tanks. This is important because it proves that 
the acid added directly affected the brine shrimp in that by creating an acidic environment, the organisms living in it 
likely struggle to survive. 
  
3.4 Chi-Square Test for Association 
The second analysis utilized the Chi-Square Test for Association. The 
Chi-Square Test for Association is a statistical method used to figure out whether two variables are associated. The 
Chi-Square Test for Association uses frequency data. Since this study’s data was collected as individual samples, the 
raw data had to be converted into frequency data. After the data was correctly converted, the Chi-Square Association 
test was run on VassarStats. 
 
 As expected, the chi-square value turned out to be very high, supporting the hypothesis that there was a 
direct association between levels of vinegar and populations of brine shrimp per quadrat. It came out to be 68.62. To 
assess this score, the critical value listed in Appendix 3 under Degrees of Freedom of 4 was assessed. This showed 
that the correct critical value for the 0.05 p-value was 9.49. Because 68.62 so greatly exceeded 9.49, the null hypothesis 
was rejected to show that there was no association between the two variables and the alternative hypothesis (that there 
was a direct association between levels of vinegar and populations of brine shrimp per quadrat) was accepted. This 
proved the hypothesis that there was an association between these two variables. This is important because it shows 
that the addition of vinegar to the brine shrimp tanks directly affected the survival rate of the shrimp, suggesting that 
ocean acidification decreases the survival rate of organisms. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
From these statistical results, one is able to understand that a Kruskal Wallis test run between the medians of 
the populations of brine shrimp per quadrat before the addition of vinegar does not produce a statistically significant 
result. Thus, it is most likely that the drop in population sizes was not due to an outside factor but due solely to the 
addition of white vinegar. The second Kruskal-Wallis test run between the populations of brine shrimp (in medians) 
after the addition of vinegar demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the medians of the populations 
of brine shrimp once vinegar was added. Finally, the use of a Chi-Square Test for Association shows that there was, 
in fact, an association between the levels of acid in the three tanks and the amount of brine shrimp that remained 
living. Overall, the data did support the original hypothesis that there was an association and relationship between the 
levels of acidity and the populations of brine shrimp for each quadrat. 
 
The conclusions that can be drawn from the statistical analyses done are numerous. To begin, one is first able 
to conclude that there was an association between the levels of vinegar in the brine shrimp tanks and the populations 
of the brine shrimp (per quadrat). This is important because it supports the conclusion that, on a larger scale, ocean 
acidification directly affects organisms. If this study were to be replicated on a larger and more complex scale, it is 
likely that it would produce similar results. One can hope that if more people were made aware of such findings that 
they would take more steps toward stopping ocean acidification. Further, this experiment also allows one to draw the 
conclusion that vinegar is in fact acidic and that even a low acidic pH such as 2.4 can be detrimental to a population. 
That is, one is able to conclude that even a low acidic pH can make a large difference. 
 
5. Future Research

2531","Possible further investigations that could take place based off of this research if a scientist were trying to 
raise awareness about the effects of ocean acidification. That is, based on this research, people could begin to realize 
the harm in ocean acidification and begin to attempt to heal it as opposed to continuing to produce thousands of tons 
of carbon dioxide each year. Though this is far easier said than done, this investigation would be a good springboard 
for a much larger scale investigation completed at a much higher level to prove that ocean acidification is a global 
issue.  
 
Through undertaking additional similar experiments on a larger as well as far more complex scale, scientists 
may be able to discover possible solutions to ocean acidification as well as gain a better understanding as to how such 
low levels of acid can adversely impact our environment. Since current research predicts that ocean acidification will 
cause harm in the future (Pörtner H, 2008), it is imperative that further investigations for a solution begins now. As 
humanity continues to advance technologically and produce more waste as a population, it is vital to understand how 
human waste has and is affecting the environment and to ponder potential solutions. Though ocean acidification is 
only one issue arising from our species and its growth, it is still of critical importance. Perhaps through a better 
understanding of this and other environmental changes that we are inducing globally may have a chance to stop 
damaging our oceans and our planet before it becomes too late.

Abstract 
 
One purpose of Students to learn was to have good communication skills. In fact, some students have been anxiety 
in communicating. The research objective is to identify differences of student communications anxiety before 
and after group guidance service treatment. The research was using quantitative method that pre-experiment 
design. The discovering of student communications anxiety this research are: 1) before group guidance treatment 
was 76.76%. 2) after group guidance treatment was 49.78%. 3) there was a tendency that anxiety levels in 
communication after use group guidance was reduced..

1. Introduction 
Students not only learn to achieve the learning achievement, but also learn to interact and communicate well 
with the peers, teachers and all personnel at school and outside school(Webb, 1989). This is because the nature 
of human beings as social beings(Fiske, 2009; Muhid et al., 2020), which human always interact and 
communicate with other human in fulfilling the requirement.  
In fact, not all individuals can communicate fluently. There are some obstacles which face by the individuals 
in communicating, such as the anxiety in communicating. According to Mc Croskey  “Communication 
apprehension is an individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication 
with another person or persons""(McCroskey et al., 1984). Mc Croskey’s opinion can be concluded that 
communication anxiety is a level of fear or a person’s anxiety, whether it’s real or just prejudice, related to the 
communication with others or with many people. This is in line with the previous opinions Litle John and Foss 
which said: “fear of communicating is part of a group of concepts consisting of social evasion, social anxiety, 
interaction anxiety and social delicacy”(John, 2009).  
According to Mc Croskey (in Litle John and Foss, the efforts that can be made to reduce the anxiety in 
communicating is by doing the individual training(John et al., 2009). Group guidance is one of the guidance and 
counselling services that trains the students’ communication skills and help students overcome the problem in 
communicating.  
The purpose of group guidance according to Prayitno are (Amti, 1997):  
Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management
Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020
© IEOM Society International
2542","Based on the above opinion, it can be concluded that the group guidance is useful to train the students 
skillfully communicate with others and dare to speak in public. The skilled students communicate in public will 
lower the level of anxiety communicating. To achieve all that, of course in group guidance activities help to 
overcome all barriers experienced by the students in communicating like the anxiety in communicating. 
Apparently from the result of the study also found that the level of anxiety students speaking in public decline 
after following the guidance service group.   
Based on the result of the research, Rahayu  states that there is a significant relationship between positive 
thinking patterns with the anxiety communicating in public(Rahayu et al., 2004). That is, the higher a person’s 
positive mindset, the lower the level of the anxiety communicating. In this regard, the group guidance services 
seek to guide the students to improve the positive thinking. This is done by providing the information through 
the topic covered.  
This is supported by Winkel’s opinion “the group guidance strives for changes in attitudes and behavior, 
indirectly through the presentation of the information that emphasizes the cognitive processing by participants, 
so that they can apply themselves.” So with the discussion of the topic in the group guidance that has been done, 
there will be a cognitive processing of the information given to the members of the group, resulting in a change 
in attitude and behavior indirectly. The changes that occur in the group members (research subject is a decrease 
in the level of anxiety communicating experienced)(Hastuti et al., 2006).  
In this finding, there were also four respondents, after being given a group counselling service, the level of 
communicating anxiety remained in the high category. This means that the group counselling has not been 
effective in reducing the anxiety of communicating publicly for that four respondents. This may be because of 
these respondents have a trauma when speaking in public, making it difficult to reduce their anxiety in public 
speaking. It is suggested that one of the causes of the anxiety communicates in public is an unpleasant experience 
felt by the individuals, it is causing the individual have negative thoughts and feelings for himself and avoid the 
public speaking(Ruffner et al., 1981).  
Another way that can be done to reduce the anxiety of public speaking is with relaxation techniques and 
cognitive therapy. According to Winkel the method that can be used in group guidance to help the students reduce 
their anxiety in communicating is by doing a role-playing method(Hastuti et al., 2006). This game is played by 
the group members with playing a scene about the social intercourse that contains the communication issues 
which must be completed. Then the scene is played in public. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Based on the result of research data and discussion analysis, it can be concluded: 1) the level of anxiety 
communicating students before being given the counselling services group is in the high category. 2) The level 
of students’ communication anxiety after being given a group counselling service is in the low category. 3) there 
is a significant difference between the anxiety level of communicating students before and after being given the 
group guidance services, where the anxiety level of communicating students decreases from the high category 
into low category. 
Based on the result of research that has been described above, it can be put forward the following 
suggestions: 1) it is expected for the teacher of counselling guidance to carry out the group guidance activities 
bin schools, in order to help the students to alleviate the problem, especially the problem of communicating. 2) 
the subject teachers are expected to develop a learning process with a method of learning that enables many 
students to communicate such as group discussion and group presentation so that the more the students experience 
in communicating and speaking, the lower the level of communication anxiety experienced, and the principal 
hoped to assist in the provision and procurement of the facilities and infrastructure needed by the guidance and 
counselling teachers in carrying out the school guidance and counselling services.

Abstract 
 
One purpose of Students to learn was to have good communication skills. In fact, some students have been 
anxiety in communicating. The research objective is to identify differences of student communications anxiety 
before and after group guidance service treatment. The research was using quantitative method that pre-
experiment design. The discovering of student communications anxiety this research are: 1) before group 
guidance treatment was 76.76%. 2) after group guidance treatment was 49.78%. 3) there was a tendency that 
anxiety levels in communication after use group guidance was reduced..

1. Introduction 
Students not only learn to achieve the learning achievement, but also learn to interact and communicate 
well with the peers, teachers and all personnel at school and outside school(Webb, 1989). This is because the 
nature of human beings as social beings(Fiske, 2009; Muhid et al., 2020), which human always interact and 
communicate with other human in fulfilling the requirement.  
In fact, not all individuals can communicate fluently. There are some obstacles which face by the 
individuals in communicating, such as the anxiety in communicating. According to Mc Croskey  
“Communication apprehension is an individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or 
anticipated communication with another person or persons""(McCroskey and Daly, 1984). Mc Croskey’s 
opinion can be concluded that communication anxiety is a level of fear or a person’s anxiety, whether it’s real 
or just prejudice, related to the communication with others or with many people. This is in line with the 
previous opinions Litle John and Foss which said: “fear of communicating is part of a group of concepts 
consisting of social evasion, social anxiety, interaction anxiety and social delicacy”(John, 2009).  
According to Mc Croskey (in Litle John and Foss, the efforts that can be made to reduce the anxiety in 
communicating is by doing the individual training(John and Foss, 2009). Group guidance is one of the 
guidance and counselling services that trains the students’ communication skills and help students overcome 
the problem in communicating.  
The purpose of group guidance according to Prayitno are (Amti, 1997):  
 Be able to speak in front of many people 
 Be able to express the opinions, ideas, suggestions, responses, feelings and so on in front of the crowd 
 Learn to value the opinions of others 
 Responsible for the opinions expressed 
 Able to control oneself and restrain the emotions (psychological fluctuations that are negative) 
 Can be tolerant

and avoid the public speaking(Ruffner and Burgoon, 1981).  
Another way that can be done to reduce the anxiety of public speaking is with relaxation techniques and 
cognitive therapy. According to Winkel the method that can be used in group guidance to help the students 
reduce their anxiety in communicating is by doing a role-playing method(Hastuti and Winkel, 2006). This 
game is played by the group members with playing a scene about the social intercourse that contains the 
communication issues which must be completed. Then the scene is played in public. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Based on the result of research data and discussion analysis, it can be concluded: 1) the level of anxiety 
communicating students before being given the counselling services group is in the high category. 2) The level 
of students’ communication anxiety after being given a group counselling service is in the low category. 3) 
there is a significant difference between the anxiety level of communicating students before and after being 
given the group guidance services, where the anxiety level of communicating students decreases from the high 
category into low category. 
Based on the result of research that has been described above, it can be put forward the following 
suggestions: 1) it is expected for the teacher of counselling guidance to carry out the group guidance activities 
bin schools, in order to help the students to alleviate the problem, especially the problem of communicating. 2) 
the subject teachers are expected to develop a learning process with a method of learning that enables many 
students to communicate such as group discussion and group presentation so that the more the students 
experience in communicating and speaking, the lower the level of communication anxiety experienced, and the 
principal hoped to assist in the provision and procurement of the facilities and infrastructure needed by the 
guidance and counselling teachers in carrying out the school guidance and counselling services.

Abstract 
 
Public speaking is one of the conditional subjects that should be pursued by higher education students. It offers 
students the ability to talk as a subject of learning with a voice. Some of the components of speech that should be 
measured by students include comprehension, vocabulary, pronunciation , and grammar. This research was a 
descriptive study designed to explain students ' speaking skills that were acceptable for speech indicators. The 
population was seventh semester students of the English Department of STAI Miftahul Ula, a total sample of 40 
students was used. The research instrument used the speech test to test the validity and reliability of the test. The 
data was analyzed using the percentage formula. Based on the finding of the result , it was found that the capacity of 
students to talk in a speech was in different categories. In comprehension, the majority of students were strongly 
categorized (62.5 per cent), therefore the student's fluency in speech ordering was high categorized (67.5 per cent). 
When the vocabulary was chosen and the words pronounced, 55 % of students got better, but in grammar, students 
still have a problem. The data showed that only 32.5 percent of students had a high category.

1. Introduction 
Speaking is one of crucial skills should be mastered by the students. Speaking is one of the English skills to be 
priority in teaching and learning foreign and second language (Richards et al., 2008). In the other words, speaking is 
the important skill in English. Speaking is needed skill in learning (O’malley et al., 1985). It is used toconvey the 
idea in communicating each other. Speaking is needed in various condition and situation (Hismanoglu et al., 2011).  
Moreover, speaking is one of conditional subjects in learning at Seventh semester students of English department of 
STAI Miftahul Ula, the students should pass speaking I, II, and then they can continue to public speaking class.

Grammar has an significant role to play in speaking. It can be seen from the data that 17.5 percent of students 
have issues with grammar when speaking. A few students can be classified as having a high ability to speak in 
grammar. The other is the only medium capacity to use grammar to communicate in public settings. In order to talk 
in public contexts, such as reading, students need to know the components of reading well. It is important to help 
students deliver a speech (Shumin, 2002). Based on the results, it can be seen that comprehension, fluency , 
vocabulary, and student pronunciation can be classified as high ability, even though the percentage of students is 
less than 100 percent.It needs to develop the ability of students to communicate. Students who pursue the public 
speaking class mean that they have gone through speaking I and speaking II. Ideally, students can speak well by 
using a good speech part. Grammar is an essential feature of speech (Quirk, 2010). The result showed that the 
students still have a problem in grammar. Grammar is difficult component to be mastered (Richard, 2008). Evidence 
has shown that only 32.5 per cent of students can be classified as high grammatical skills, and 17.5 per cent of 
students have poor grammatical skills. In the sector, students were afraid to make a mistake in using grammar. It 
requires the effort of students to improve their grammar in the spoken class.   
 
4. Conclusion And Suggestion 
4.1. Conclusion  
The product of students' ability to talk in public speaking classes is usually defined as high ability. More than 
50 percent of the students had a good speech score. 30 per cent of students had a middle ability to speak and 15 per 
cent of students had a low ability to speak. Specifically, comprehension can be classified as a high skill, with 62.5 
percent of students recognizing the ability to speak in a public speaking class. Fluency has been classified as high 
capacity; 67.5 percent of students have a strong fluency score.  Vocabulary is the next part. In delivering a speech, 
students scored well in using vocabulary; 5 % of students ranked poor ability to use vocabulary. Student 
pronunciation also had a decent speech rate. 52.5 percent of students were classified as having a high ability to 
pronounce words in speech. Last, students' grammar has a middle capacity. 32.5 per cent of students were 
categorized as high, 50 per cent of students were categorized as middle, and 17.5 per cent of students were 
categorized as poor grammatical capacity to express speech in public speaking classes.  
 
4.2. Suggestion  
The students of STAI Miftahul Ula Nganjuk can be categorized into high ability in using some of components 
of speaking skill in public speaking class. But it is not enough, by the students who learn in English department 
ideally can speak well in English for public situation. It needs the improvement and effort from the students. The 
students need to know their skill in speaking. Besides that, the students should practice more outside of the English 
department environment. By evaluating students’ speaking skill, it can be information to the students to develop 
their skill in speaking.

Introduction
Reading activity is a complex exercise, more than just activity. The reading is an interactive activity to pick and
understand the meaning contained in the board material(Somadayo, 2011; Azizah et al., 2019). Furthermore, based on 
Slameto, (1988) reading is also a process that is undertaken and used by readers to know the message to be delivered 
by the author through the words/writing materials as the medium. In the stage of reading, activities that demanded not 
physical that use jus the senses of sight, but also including mental activity is understanding and arrests mean good 
reading of what is read. Miftahul Huda (2011) said that the reading is not only the ability to recognize letters arranged 
into a sentence or a fine ability to pronounce, it covers mental capabilities directed that could capture and understand 
the ideas behind the writing was disguised by readers. 
Reading comprehension is a process of acquisition of meaning that actively involves the experience and 
knowledge that has been owned by the readers and be connected to the content of reading. Somadayo (2011) states 
that there are three main points in reading comprehension, are (1) the experience and knowledge that has been held

Abstract: 
This article presents a methodology approach and a  specific features that must be considered to design and formulate an optimization 
model for automotive industry's Supply chain in the delocalization context. 
An extensive literature review of the important existing supply chain models in general and particularly in automotive industry is 
presented in this article. 
The review objective is to see how the automotive supply chain design is approached with a mixed integer programming model. We focus 
on the identification of the relevant aspects included in the formulations and characteristics specific to the automotive sector study.  
The models supply chain design discussed are then classified in a summary table according to aspects viewed to identify their lack of 
features and to verify how they support the delocalization problem. 
Finally, we propound some guidelines, methodology approach to respect in supply chain modeling and identifying opportunities for 
further research.

1- Introduction:
Certainly the delocalization is a strategic decision currently being made by several MCNs (Multinationals) taking advantage of the 
globalization of markets, and it seen as the most effective way of reducing costs, in particular salary costs, and generating a comparative 
advantage to remain competitive in face of globalized competition. 
Delocalization can be defined in the first instance as the transfer of the production units from developed country to low cost countries. In 
addition to reducing production costs, the delocalization decision is motivated by the measures taken by low-cost countries to motivate 
foreign investment by improving the attractiveness and the business environment by reducing costs and taxation, the creation of industrial 
free zones benefiting from export exemption rules. 
Morocco is one of those low cost countries that have integrated measures into their industrial plan to improve the business environment 
and has become in the last decade a delocalization platform and the primary destination in the North African region for companies 
operating especially in automotive industry. 
The arrival of the car manufacturer Renault had a catalyst effect that motivates the automotive suppliers delocalizing as the RENAULT 
ex-CEO Carlos Ghosn stated:” We are the ones who brought the suppliers and who restored the credibility of Morocco”. We can 
distinguish here between two delocalization objectives: the first one consists of sourcing or manufacturing in low-cost countries and, the 
second consists of being close to emerging markets and / or consumption areas and to a potential industrial client. Morocco is considered a 
low-cost country, offering the best investment conditions for the automotive industry, namely reduced labor cost, tax exemptions and 
especially that car construction was already initiated by SOMACA Morocco Company. All that represents opportunities motivating 
Renaut Company to delocalize.

Modeling the manufacturing system: At a tactical level of the delocalization problem, a complete description of the manufacturing
system (processes, technologies, products, etc.) must be considered. The components description of all intermediate and final
products is necessary to define material requirements constraints (BOM constraints). Hence, technological decisions that are of major
importance in the delocalization context can be appropriately made, also the inventory requirement and the safety stock that are must
be held at each stage of supply chain can be planned.
4-
Fixing the goals and relevant decision variables: Identifying all costs and constraints at different stages of supply chain of
automotive assembly industry, with a complete description of the manufacturing system permits determining some shortcomings and
fixing goals to reach, and the decision variables to consider in supply chain model.
5-
Fixing the objective function and Model taxonomy choice: The optimization of supply chain design leads us to define the objective
function under all constraints previously described, also we have to make decision about the taxonomy model that will be adopted and
choose between deterministic stochastic and hybrid models.
6- Conclusion
In this paper, we are interested on the design of a car assembly industry supply chains in the delocalization context. Our objective was the 
proposition of a conceptual modeling approach at a tactical level and provides a model builder with guidelines. 
According to the characteristics of the delocalization phenomena described in Hammami (2008), we identified those characteristics 
adapted to automotive assembly industry. In light of this preliminary step, we identified the most relevant keys dimensions that should be 
incorporated in an automotive assembly supply chain design model that is adapted to the delocalization problem at a tactical level. Most 
factors highlighted were: BOM constraints, transportation, inventory cost and labor costs evolution. 
We selected the papers according three criteria: the last published in the subject, famous specialist author on supply chain, the most 
relevant paper identified in the literature review in particular in Hammami (2008), and classified them according to four dimensions 
(decisions, cost factors, constraints and other supply chain aspects), which regroup the delocalization features in tactical level. The results 
resumed in Table 3 which confirm that Hammami (2013) paper is the best one including the most relevant delocalization features, indeed 
it focused in their impact on the lead time. We can also take notice the inventory management allocation is not issues have not received an 
adequate attention as well as the labor cost evolution, Inventory cost, transport cost and BOM constraints. 
Based on the literature review and on our own professional experience, we can assure that inventory allocation management cost and the 
transport cost are the success keys of delocalization that must have more focus in the future supply chain modeling design, particularly in 
delocalization context. Furthermore, the pandemic due to covid19 confirmed the importance position of transport and inventory 
management in supply chain especially that the china role in the global economy is increasing, and it was the first country impacted by the 
pandemic crisis. We then proposed an algorithm approach for modeling supply chains at a tactical level in the delocalization context that 
can help a model builder to construct an analytical model for designing the supply chain in the delocalization context. 
Hence, there is a real need to provide new tools that can help decision makers to optimize and taking appropriate decisions about 
inventory management and transport while facing delocalization projects.

Abstract 
 
This study focuses on voice of customer to design best practice to improve quality care, quality service, 
enhance financial productivity and profitability using lean six sigma. It generates greater customer / client 
retention. The company loses significant number of clients due to misconduct and ineffective services. A 
survey was conducted to identify the causes through 200 clients for three months. Pareto chart was used to 
identify critical areas causing most problem. Control chart was used to monitor dissatisfied clients by 
category before improvement. Lean six sigma methodology was applied to improve it. Initial health 
assessment root cause analysis process was used including fishbone diagram. A QFD chart was develop for 
Voice of Customer (VOC). Nine categories of clients dissatisfaction was found through extensive survey. 
After analysis, the team found four most frequent root causes: deficiencies in policies and procedures. Lack 
of employee training, lack of communication and coordination. And deficiencies in preparing client’s health 
assessment, service plan and lack of important and vital information about the client. Policies and 
procedures have been revised. All office staff, field supervisors, care givers and clients were trained on 
policies, procedures and about ensuring health and safety of the clients. After implementing client’s 
dissatisfaction average rate was decreased from 15% to 3.6%. similar approach can be used for healthcare 
improvement for similar situation.

Abstract 
Energy is a crucial component to every nation’s economic and social growth. Mitigation of global energy demands 
and climate change are essential factors for renewable energy supplies in recent times. This paper presents the 
Performance Evaluation of some selected Mediums Wind Energy Conversion System for Wind Power Generation 
at Anyigba, Nigeria. Wind speed data for this work was collected at 4m height from the Campbell Scientific 
Automated Weather Station under the Tropospheric Data Acquisition Network (TRODAN). The data is at an 
interval of five (5) minutes update cycle for sixty months. The wind speed data height was then interpolated to 
20m using a power-law relationship. Three selected Wind Energy Conversation System (WECS), were used for 
the wind power evaluation. The result indicated the Wind Energy Conversion System-30 (WES-30) as suitable 
for Anyigba. 4.961m/s was the highest wind speed obtained in February 2016 while 1.135m/s was the lowest wind 
speed in November 2015. This might be linked to the dry season and the rainy season for the high and low wind 
speeds. Using the Weibull model, the average scale parameter and shape parameter value are 0.88 in November 
and 6.31 m/s in January of the entire months

1. Introduction 
With the rapid growth of the economy and modern civilization, energy demand has risen exponentially across the 
globe(Verma et al., 2016)(Salim et al., 2019). Factors that threaten global climate change as a result of 
environmental problems related to over-reliance on the generation of energy from traditional fossil fuels 
(Benaaouinate et al., 2020),(Ighravwe et al., 2018),(Saleh, et al). For such reasons, several scientists are being 
motivated to search for alternative clean, renewable energy sources with energy efficiency and economic 
advantages. Wind power is highly preferred as an alternative to conventional energy sources as a remedy of long-
term environmental degradation. (Benaaouinate et al., 2020),(Pachauri & Chauhan, 2012). Wind energy has been 
used in boats, maize grinding, agriculture as well as many other sectors as an eco - friendly energy resource. In 
addition, wind technology is being used to balance energy needs, which will be a key concern for the future. 
(Mahersi et al., 2013). Global installed wind capacity rose from 100GW in 2008 to 542GW in 2018. It is also 
estimated that this figure will hit 1787GW by 2030.(Aldaoudeyeh et al., 2020).  
 
wind power investigation by (Wang et al., 2018) the employing data on wind speed for the development and 
application of wind power. The results suggest that the evaluation of the output of wind turbine generators is 
important for applications like wind farm location. (Ishaq., et al ), Shows that the probability density function of 
the wind power is the Weibull function pulse at both ends when the wind speed approaches the two-parameter 
Weibull distribution and the characteristic of the wind turbine matches the cubic function. (Islam., et al), Shows

Power density is a valuable way of determining the available wind resource at a potential site, since it shows 
how much energy is available at the site for wind turbine conversion i.e. the higher the wind speed, the higher 
the energy to be produced (Wu et al., 2018). 
4. Conclusion  
In-situ measurements of wind speed, in Anyigba have been achieved for the purpose of evaluating it for electricity 
generation and the following conclusions are drawn. 
 
Wind energy is the fastest growing technology and energy resources in the world, and it can be reusable. There 
have been a rapid development on this technology, this is due to its cleanness and reusability. Wind energy is an 
alternative renewable source of energy compared to all other sources of energy derived from fossil fuels that 
pollute the lower parts of the atmosphere. While concerns such as environmental pollution and energy supply 
requirements are growing, it is important to make use of a pollution-free energy like wind. Also the wind turbines 
can be used to convert the wind energy to more commonly used electric energy. Wind speed is the most critical 
parameter of the power that was generated from wind turbines.

Abstract 
 
The project displays on how to use clustering methods to help study Environmental Science when playing 
the strategic video games. The main focus is on Phase II where in the game, soldiers attack nearby weaker 
opponents. The objective of the game is to create kingdoms, produce resources (wood, stone) to build 
castles and then form an alliance to defeat enemies. Therefore; the main question is “how to build a powerful 
troop/castle”? First, we need to know the types of troops needed to build a castle. In phase II, there are up 
to 45 types of troop units which are mostly used for attacking and defending. There are seven characteristics 
for each troop unit which are Melee/Range Defense, Melee/Range Attack, Travel Speed, Looting Capacity, 
and Food Consumption.  
 
The objective of this paper is to introduce an advanced multivariate statistical methodology for  
advancement through the Empire 4 Kingdoms strategic video game. A novel Troop Power Index (PI) is 
derived  that captures the objective of developing a powerful troop army and expanding the size of one’s 
own kingdom. The Power Index applies specified weighting coefficients that consider  how to build a 
powerful troop army which can both attack and defend well, have good looting capability and speedy travel 
capacity, and minimize food consumption.  Ater the PI was established, the following were considered (1) 
summation/ weighting of the untransformed PI, (2) Z-Transformed PI, and (3) Non-Parametric transformed 
PI, in order to reduce the variance bias and the impact to outliers among the seven troop characteristics.  
Approaches (1) through (3) were compared to determine their unique characteristics in the distribution of 
relative PI ranks among the troops.   
 
Next, supervised clustering based on power index (4 clusters) and unsupervised JMP hierarchical clustering 
were used (8 clusters) to select the top vital few troops from each cluster based on PI ranking. The Non-
Parametric method was assessed to be the best model to optimize the troop units since most of the troop 
characteristics were highly skewed. The troop types considered fit to the Kingdom Expansion Strategy were 
reduced from 45 to 15, therefore, based on the Non-parametric Troop PI Ranking.  In future work, Transfer 
Function Sensitivity Analysis may be explored within the Troop Constraints in order to further optimally 
select the troop units to meet the current Kingdom expansion strategy.

Abstract 
 
The economic liberalization, political democratization and governmental decentralization have significantly 
brought about changes in the public sector management. The dominant roles of the state as a regulator as well as 
provider of public goods and services have massively eroded, and subsequently replaced by society (non-state 
actors). Consequently, the vertical relationships among actors either within the state institution or, generally, in 
social relations are getting out of fashion. At present, the model of government has been replaced by the newly 
model, that is, governance. In this model, the inter-organizational relationships grow to be much more significant 
characteristic, rather than inter-organizational patterns.Many practitioners in government, who had habitually 
employed the hierarchical patterns, faced many difficulties to understand and to place their position in these 
chaotic and anarchical situations. Meanwhile, the organization theories, which have widely focused in the inter-
organizational model, have no significant contributions to cope with these changes. This paper endeavours to 
search for a new model of relation management, which possibly captures the more horizontal relationships in 
inter-organizational arenas..

Mayor as the only ruler in every district or province. As the vice of the central government, they are the leader 
of every government bearau in local government, eg: the legislature, the judiciary, the police and the military that 
became as one as Deliberation of Regional Leaders. They are automatically became the head of supervisors’ 
board of Golkar, as the government party, of their own working area. Worked in authoritarianism political system, 
those regional leader also had a strong political control capacity over social, political, and economic organisation. 
Disobedience of the single ruler policy would drag on to subversion constitution that used to keep those 
disobediences in silence and got follower(Devas, 1989). 
Relationship between the single author and the society describing the relationship pattern which is hierarchy 
and authoritarianism. Regularity in governance is build through authoritarianism mechanism using coercion’s 
instruments, whether it is law or even violence using. Public policy not really built by many partied involved 
agreement, but it is more about juridical authority in relationship pattern of hierarchy. In a kind of political 
pattern, leaders were building discipline, obedience and regularity. 
But, that condition is no more exist. By the process of democratization, citizen’s political rights to deliver 
their opinion and doing association is guaranteed by constitution and political mechanism. The connection of 
state officials and society is not always hierarchical. Public policy, regularity and discipline cannot be 
implemented by ordered, but it should by negotiation mechanism to build a consensus(Budiman et al., 2000). 
Orde Baru era governance style which is authoritarianism is not effective any longer to be used, so that a new 
way to guaranteed discipline and agreement are needed. 
This study is not discussing about Indonesian politics shifting specifically, more over, not even discuss 
about decentralization. The symbolization in previous just showing that there is a intra-organizational difficulty 
to organize the horizontal relationship in new political setting. Discussion will start by the appearance of

2596","The connection between government and society in market model is not a power structure connection as 
the first model, but it is a connection between provider and customers. This market model is arisen since part of 
it is a response of a phenomenon which is called a democracy deficit. Most of time, people sovereignty that had 
given to representative institution directly can not be accountable for its constituents. Meanwhile, constituent can 
not control its representative institution. Democracy deficit describes disconnection situation between 
representative institutions which duty to determine and to formulate society needs with its constituent that had 
given its command  (Peters et al., 1998). 
In this kind of situation, inspite of counting on policy due to society needs on government institution which 
is not really to be responsible to its constituent, will be more effective if only government put on market principles 
in policy formulating and public service. Here, society that is considered as customers may choose it directly 
through transaction mechanism.   
 
3.3. Networking Model 
Since an organization distributes its functional systems on other units and departments, start on that time, 
needs of coordination arisen and developing more complex. In intra-organizational connections, might be needs 
of coordination can be established through hierarchy-control mechanism. But, since those connections involving 
organizations wider, so, the effort to make sure the coordination into inter-organizational setting will be more 
difficult. Because of it, coordination mechanism with wider reach is needed and most of time it is virtual, without 
clear appearance. This called networking mechanism. 
The consequents of networking mechanism is public policy will be depend on actors’ needs that connected 
with negotiation process. Government’s  relationship with other actors seems to be equal and government can 
not insist on its interest easily anymore. In this context, even though networking mechanism is intended for 
managing public sector based on interest of relevant actors, government still asked to be accountable to its society 
(Pierre et al., 2000; Peters et al., 2000). 
The connection of government had networking mechanism is dependent. Networking is a shape of massive 
representative needs which consists of people with capacity, of that potentially become an important element in 
policy processes. But, networking is also build based on needs alliance between groups that might threatening 
government needs. In tension of any kind of relations, networking mechanism has it specific uniqueness. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The changes of relational pattern and other consequences that already been discussed previously, is a part 
of contemporary change of society in reform era.  According to Under and Peters, political world in reform era 
having two bid tendencies. First,  the development of policy-making sector as the consequences of issue 
complexity of each sectors and professional groups growth. The implication is policy-making model which is 
monopolistic by state will be not popular any longer. Processes of policy-making will be done more often in a 
relatively open with relatively autonomous actors.  
Second, political world in this era also asking for society involving more in policy-making process. 
Nowadays developments put on participations not only as an instrument or a process of democratically policy-
making, instead of participation become its own goal. It is very clear in good governance principles that become 
a dominant perspective in government reform. Its implication is policy-making is a bargaining process and 
negotiating nowadays, not to be insisted on and formulated by higher power hierarchy centrally.    
   Problem which has to be answered by organizational theory is how to manage the connection of intra-
organizational which area is open wider and its relations pattern is getting more horizontal. No wonder any kind 
of organizing models which applied will always set on its instrument, and at the end will define whether those 
processes are worth developing or not. in this context, the way to manage relations by networking model has a 
great potential to be developed in organizational theory.  
Even though there is a great chance of lose and win, but the problem is no longer on epistemological level 
(problem point of view) but on strategic level. Success in this model can be measured by the capability to build 
collective action based on common goals-making. Strategy which might be develop is, first, upgrading incentive 
structure  in order to this networking become a magnet pole for actors to make a coordination and build a 
consensus-making. Second, upgrading actors managerial capability for network-making innovatively, so that, it 
will invite actors’ interaction in networking. Even though it is not easy to create theory formatting to formulate 
common action between actors that are not uniform and autonomous, but it is a challenge that must be answered 
by organizational theory.

Abstract 
 
The character education in university should be done as a continuation of the previous educational institutions, 
because the character education has not been successful optimally in both senior and junior high schools before 
university. The character education in universities is conducted through: Tridharma Universities, Curriculum 
improvement, the competency improvement, performance and character of lecturer, and the integration of character 
values in campus culture. The character values that can be developed in a college is a character value that relates to: 
God, self, family, community, country and environment. Therefore, the character education in higher education 
needs to be developed in order to form the qualified graduates. 
 
Keywords : Character, Higher Education, Quality Student 
 
1. Introduction 
The higher education or university as one of the education centres, has a heavy burden in the formation of the 
student characters. The character education in higher education is a continuation of the character education in 
schools. Although the character education has been implemented since kindergarten, elementary school (SD/MI) and 
junior-senior (SMP/MTs–SMA/SMK/MA), but the graduate of the educational institution is not necessarily have 
good character. Even the graduate of boarding school was necessarily have as expected. Evidently, there are many 
behaviours that are not characterized when they become students, such as student clashes, free sex, drinking, even 
radicalism and terrorism also tarnished the campus environment. The desire to graduate easily and quickly, the value 
of an unfair, sale and purchase the diplomas, plagiarism and others are still often occurring in the campus 
environment. It shows that the character education in educational institutions before universities has not 
succeeded(Walid, 2012; Oetomo et al., 2019).  
Therefore, the universities need to have a pattern of character formation of students in accordance with the 
vision, mission and the characteristics of the higher education. The character education in higher education needs to 
be designed intact, its mean that when the students enter a new territory as freshmen in faculty, in the study program, 
until graduation as alumni must all be designed completely (Budimansyah et al., 2010).  
Universities form academic people who can learn by themselves or learn independently by doing self 
improvement and seeking and defending scientific truth. The existence of character education applied in higher 
education, students are expected to design a vision of the future for themselves, the environment and family and

2602","Related to character education, each educational unit can effectively allocate available time in order to apply 
cultural values planting using active learning methods.  This can be done since the teacher begins the learning, 
during the process, the provision of independent and structured tasks both done individually and in groups, as well 
as assessment of learning processes and results. The strategies carried out by different schools, in some schools, 
generally, from the beginning come to school, children are used to greeting each other, greeting each other when 
meeting their neighbors and teachers.  For kindergarten and elementary school level, in general some teachers 
welcome students with greetings, smiles and greetings. In some schools, daily study hours are 30 minutes early, and 
they are used to perform routine activities such as prayer together, kultum, or other relevant activities.  In order to 
habituation, in various schools also carried out the implementation of worship by utilizing rest time.  There are also 
schools that increase the time in the afternoon after lesson hours to perform extracurricular activities or other 
relevant activities chosen by the school.  Some schools carry out all the extracurricular activities on Saturdays from 
morning until noon. 
 
3. Conclusions 
From the above description, it can be concluded as follows: 
 
The character education in college is something that cannot be ignored, because it affects to the quality of 
graduates. 
 
The character education in universities can be done through Tridharma, curriculum improvement, competency 
improvement, performance and character of lecturers, and the integration of character values in campus 
culture.  
 
The character education that can be developed in college as character value that is related to God, the character 
value that is related to oneself, the character value that is related to the family, the character value that is 
related to the society, the character value that is related to the state and the character value that is related to the 
environment.  
Therefore, the character education should be done continuously (running for life), both from the basic level, 
medium and college in order to produce the quality output.

1. Introduction  
Organizational culture becomes the values, norms, attitudes, and work ethics in an organization that 
become common guides in running the company. These elements can also be used to assess the 
employee's way of thinking, employee attitudes and behavior, cooperation and interaction with the work 
environment. If the organizational culture that has been running in the work process is good, then this can 
improve employee performance and will also build company success (Arianty , 2014: 144). 
According to Nuroniah and Triyanto (2015: 86) explained that human resources in a company play 
a very important role in carrying out company activities in order to achieve company goals. So that the 
company is a body with human resources as the framework. Companies where the employees have low 
human resources, the production steps of the company are also not optimal. 
This is also expressed by Eddy (2016: 52) which states that human resources are the key to being 
able to achieve the goals of a company or in other words, the success and failure of a company depends 
on the management process and the work of its human resources . It can be said that a good company can 
reflect good resources, while a company that is less productive has low resource values.

mediates meaning culture organization and organizational communication can mediate the influence 
on employee performance with a positive and significant effect. This study agrees with Arief (2016: 
50) that organizational culture mediated by organizational commitment has a positive and significant 
effect on performance. The organizational communication variable mediated by organizational 
commitment has at count of 3.3288 which is greater than the t-table, 1.96 with a significance level of 
5%, it can be concluded that the mediation coefficient of 0.5015218 is significant, which means that 
there is a mediating effect. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
From the results obtained, the hospital needs to improve the performance of its human resources. This is a 
demand that must be met because HR performance is closely related to the achievement of overall 
company performance, especially in, 
1. The influence of organizational culture and organizational communication on employee 
performance, which states that the existing culture is not good enough to increase the level of 
employee performance 
2. The influence of organizational culture and organizational communication has a positive and 
significant direct effect on organizational commitment because a firmly embedded organizational 
culture will form a maximum commitment 
3. Organizational commitment has a positive and significant effect on employee performance, so that a 
high level of integrity will have a major contribution to the company 
4. Organizational commitment can mediate the influence of culture and organizational communication 
on employee performance with a positive and significant effect

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study to determine the effect of Corporate Financial Performance on CSR Disclosure (Corporate 
Social Responsibility) Registered on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2014-2016. Financial performance is projected 
with return on asset, return on equity, and debt to equity ratio. Corporate CSR disclosure is measured using the GRI 
(G4) aspect. The type of research is Explanatory Research. Sampling method using Purposive sampling with criteria 
of Mining company listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange and issuing annual report which during period 2014-2016. 
Data analysis techniques use multiple linear regression. The results showed that the financial performance variable 
did not significantly influence the disclosure of social responsibility either partially or simultaneously. The results of 
the insignificant research indicate that this research is not in line with stakeholder theory but in line with legitimacy 
theory.

1. Introduction 
Each company will not take action that will bring adverse impact to the company's performance, so it takes a 
careful planning in every activity undertaken and no negative impact on cash flow and can affect the financial 
performance of the company (Von Krogh, 1998). The company's performance measurements include planning, 
controlling and transactional processes for securities firms, fund managers, corporate executives, owners, stock 
executors, creditors and other stakeholders (Roos et al., 1997). The assessment of the company's financial performance 
by stakeholders is used as one of the basis of decision-making relating to their interests to the company(Ruf et al., 
2001). The interests of the company are closely related to their welfare expectations. Measuring financial performance 
is one very important factor for the company, because the measurement is used as a basis for preparing a reward 
system within the company that can affect the behaviour of decision-making within the company (Katz, 1964; Achmad 
Daengs et al., 2020). 
A company's financial performance is more measured based on financial ratios over a given period. 
Measurement based on financial ratios is very dependent on the method or accounting treatment used in preparing the 
company's financial statements. Analysis and interpretation of various ratios can provide a better view of the 
company's financial performance than an analysis based solely on its own financial data that is not in the form of a 
ratio (Altman, 1968). Media that can be used to assess the company's financial performance is the financial statements. 
The financial statements are the results of the collection and processing of financial data presented in the form of

2621","company to have the image which is good in the eyes of its stakeholders. This shows that not all companies that have 
good financial performance will have a good social responsibility. The Company will perform its social 
responsibilities in accordance with the environmental and political conditions in which the company is located. In 
addition, the role of government in overseeing social responsibility activities in Indonesia is also one of the supporting 
factors of responsibility level undertaken by the company 
 
4.3. The Effect of Debt to Equity Ratio Against Disclosure of Corporate Social Responsibility on 
Mine Company Listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2014-2016 
In this study, debt to equity ratio describes the ratio of debt and equity in the funding of the company and 
shows the capability of the company's own capital to fulfil its obligations. The use of debt will affect the financial 
condition of the company so that will indirectly affect the social activities undertaken by the company. The result of 
data analysis with the significant value of debt to equity ratio greater than 0.05 is equal to 0.487 means that the variable 
debt to equity ratio partially has no significant effect on corporate social responsibility disclosure in the mining 
company during the period 2014 - 2016. The estimated debt to equity ratio has value positive (+) in accordance with 
the a priori expectations, where when the company has a high risk then the company will perform activities of social 
responsibility / social performance. 
However, in this study the variable debt to equity ratio is not significant to corporate social responsibility 
disclosure of companies in mining companies period 2014 - 2016. The results of this estimate shows that when the 
risk of the company rises then the company will perform social responsibility but not significant. This indicates that 
the company uses other alternatives in managing the risks such as minimizing debt or selling corporate bonds. The 
results of this study indicate that the level of debt to equity ratio of a company will not affect the level of corporate 
CSR. Although the company has significant debt or risk levels, the company will continue to exercise social 
responsibility to its stakeholders. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Return On Asset has no effect on CSR disclosure with argument in relationship between profitability and social 
responsibility disclosure level is when company have high profit, company not need to report things that disturb 
information about success of company finance. Conversely, when the level of profitability is low, they expect 
the report users to read the ""good news"" of the social and environmental performance that has been done by the 
company. 
 
Return On Equity does not affect the cause of social responsibility activities is a new thing in Indonesia so that 
companies do not have full awareness to perform social responsibilities other than that CSR disclosure is still 
part of the ads made by the company to have a good image in the eyes of its stakeholders . This shows that not 
all companies that have good financial performance will have a good social responsibility. The Company will 
perform its social responsibilities in accordance with the environmental and political conditions in which the 
company is located. In addition, the role of government in overseeing social responsibility activities in Indonesia 
is also one of the supporting factors of responsibility level undertaken by the company. 
 
Debt to Equity Ratio does not affect CSR disclosure due to the company related to Natural Resources has been 
obliged to conduct CSR activities which have been stipulated in the Constitution Number 40 year 2007, so big 
profitability does not affect CSR disclosure. However, for companies that are not related to HR can be the size 
of profitability affect the CSR activities and disclosure based on items set by GRI G4. 
 
6. Suggestion 
The researcher may further extend the sample not only using a sample mining company but may include all 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in order to result from the effect of profitability assuming 
ROA, ROE and DER on CSR disclosure is more significant. 
Subsequent research should not only use annual report only in obtaining data related to Corporate Social 
Responsibility done by company, but can also expand the scope by looking from reports on company website, 
print and electronic media. 
Researchers can then use or add other research variables that are not used in this study such as company age, 
public ownership, board size, media disclosure, etc. to further explain the effect of corporate characteristics on 
Corporate Social Responsibility.

1. Introduction 
In general, all companies were founded with very ideal goals, that is to survive and continue to gain maximum 
profit. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have manpower and resources that are strong and reliable. 
The most important thing that must be owned by a company is the existence of good human resources. Human 
resources are valuable assets for a company. Companies that have superior human resources will win increasingly 
fierce business competition. Companies that have quality human resources will be able to overcome challenges that 
come from within and from outside the company. 
 
One of the efforts to have superior human resources is by sharing knowledge. Lumbantobing (2011) explains that 
knowledge sharing is a systematic process of sending, distributing, and disseminating knowledge and 
multidimensional contexts from a person or organization to other people or organizations in need through varied 
methods and media. Through knowledge sharing activities, individuals who do so will get individual benefits. 
Knowledge sharing will encourage the learning ability of an employee. The ability of employees will increase in 
various ways, such as externalization, internalization, socialization, and community of practice (CoP) (Fernandez & 
Sabherwal, 2010). Knowledge sharing is an activity through which knowledge is exchanged among people, friends, 
peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations. People share knowledge through many channels 
such as conversations, meetings, learning sessions, workshops, videos and other communication media. Sharing

value of 0.000 or less than 0.05. Therefore it can be said that organizational commitment can help to 
significantly mediate the effect of organizational communication on knowledge sharing. 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that organizational communication affects knowledge sharing. This is based on the results of the 
hypothesis test where the P value of organizational communication to knowledge sharing is smaller than 0.05 which 
means that organizational communication has a significant effect on knowledge sharing. The more positive 
organizational communication, the higher the knowledge sharing. Likewise, vice versa, the more negative 
organizational communication, the lower the knowledge sharing. The results showed that organizational 
communication affects organizational commitment. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P 
value of organizational communication to organizational commitment is smaller than 0.05 which means that 
organizational communication has a significant effect on organizational commitment. This means that the higher the 
organizational communication, the better organizational commitment will be. The results showed that organizational 
commitment affects knowledge sharing. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of 
organizational commitment to knowledge sharing is smaller than 0.05 which means that organizational commitment 
has a significant effect on knowledge sharing. This means that the more positive organizational commitment, the 
more positive impact on knowledge sharing. Conversely, the more negative organizational commitment, the more 
negative the impact on knowledge sharing. The results showed that organizational commitment mediates the effect 
of organizational communication on knowledge sharing. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the 
P value of organizational communication to organizational commitment and to knowledge sharing is smaller than 
0.05 which means that organizational commitment mediates the effect of organizational communication on 
knowledge sharing.

1. Introduction

goals is the individual or human resources in the organization who need to be managed. Human resource 
management considers that employees are the main asset of the organization that must be managed 
properly. In order to achieve the desired results, a positive work attitude is needed. An organization is 
expected to be able to realize and create a management system that takes into account the factors that 
influence employee work attitudes in order to achieve organizational goals itself. The company's goals 
will be achieved if the performance of the company's human resources is good, therefore it needs to be 
maintained and treated properly (Supriyadi, Priadana, and Setia, 2017). 
Employees are the most valuable assets in a company because they are the most important element in 
determining the success of a company to achieve its goals. For that the company needs employees who 
are able to work well and provide the best performance to the company. The ability of employees is 
reflected in performance, good performance is optimal performance. 
Employee performance is the result of work in quality and quantity that can be achieved by an employee 
in carrying out tasks in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to him (Widia and Rusdianti, 2018). 
Employee performance can be seen from the number of work results produced by employees, the level of

or less than 0.05. Therefore it can be said that job satisfaction can help to significantly mediate the 
effect of work discipline on employee performance. 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that work discipline affects employee performance. This is based on the results of the 
hypothesis test where the P value of work discipline to employee performance is smaller than 0.05 which 
means that work discipline has a significant effect on employee performance. The more positive work 
discipline, the higher the employee performance. Likewise, vice versa, the more negative work discipline, 
the lower the employee performance. The results showed that work discipline affects job satisfaction. 
This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of work discipline to job satisfaction 
is smaller than 0.05 which means that work discipline has a significant effect on job satisfaction. This 
means that the higher the work discipline, the better job satisfaction will be. The results showed that job 
satisfaction affects employee performance. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P 
value of job satisfaction to employee performance is smaller than 0.05 which means that job satisfaction 
has a significant effect on employee performance. This means that the more positive job satisfaction, the 
more positive impact on employee performance. Conversely, the more negative job satisfaction, the more 
negative the impact on employee performance. The results showed that job satisfaction mediates the 
effect of work discipline on employee performance. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test 
where the P value of work discipline to job satisfaction and to employee performance is smaller than 0.05 
which means that job satisfaction mediates the effect of work discipline on employee performance.

Abstract 
 
This reserach aims to determine the effect of work discipline and reward on work performance with work motivation 
as an intervening variable. This study uses a quantitative approach that explains the causal relationship between 
variables using SmartPLS 3.0 software. The variables analyzed in this study were work discipline, reward, work 
performance, and work motivation. The population in this study were employees of PT Mitra Optima Valve with a 
total sample of 35 employees. Data collection methods used were interviews and questionnaires with a Likert scale 
of measurement. The questionnaire was then tested for validity and reliability. The results showed that there is a 
significant and positive effect of work discipline on work motivation, work discipline on work performance, rewards 
on work motivation, rewards on work performance, work motivation on work performance, work discipline on work 
performance through work motivation, and rewards on work performance through work motivation.

1. Introduction 
An organization needs human resources (HR) as system managers to achieve goals. Rumondor, Tumbel, 
& Sepang (2016) stated that human resource management is an important indicator of effectively and 
efficiently achieving organizational goals. Thus, employees are required to have the ability to carry out 
their duties and responsibilities. Afif et al. (2016) also showed the importance of work discipline to 
empower employees to have optimal performance abilities in achieving company goals. The researcher 
found problems at PT Mitra Optima Valve, including 1) low work discipline as seen from a large number 
of employee absenteeism and lack of employee compliance with office working hours, based on the data 
and information obtained, there are about 15 employees who do not come to work every month; 2) the 
reward system that is not maximal in increasing employee discipline; 3) lack of sense of responsibility for 
the work assigned to them, and 4) lack of work motivation on employees. With these existing problems, it 
is feared that it could disrupt the performance of PT Mitra Optima Valve in running its business in the 
trade sector.  
 
The success or failure of an organization in achieving its goals, apart from depending on the quality of its 
human resources, is also shown through the level of work discipline because the abilities possessed by

Abstract  
 
  Predictive maintenance is a prominent strategy to minimize downtime, associated costs and failure risks. In this 
paper, a study review of some supervised learning algorithms is presented. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Support 
vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) are compared in terms of prediction accuracy. The data considered for 
simulation is often used in literature; it is applied to aircraft engine sensors measurements to predict in-service engine 
failure. The performance of the algorithms, cited above, has been compared in terms of classification accuracy, 
precision, recall and F-score. 
In this study, the support vector machine provides better results than other techniques for maintenance prediction.

1. Introduction: 
 Maintenance costs are a major part of the total operating costs of all manufacturing plants (R.Keith 2002). Every 
year, it is estimated that U.S. industry trade spends two hundred billion dollars on maintenance of plant equipment 
and facilities. 
The ineffective maintenance results in a loss of more than sixty billion dollars (Mobley et al 2002). In fact, it is fully 
required for industries to detect faults early and accurately. 
In industrial plants, two maintenance management systems are frequently used, which are run to failure and preventive 
maintenance. Run to failure means that the maintenance interventions are performed only after the occurrence of 
failures. This is clearly the simplest approach to deal with maintenance (Gian et al 2014). The major loss associated 
with it is high overtime, labor costs, high machine downtime and lower production availability (R.Keith 2002). 
Preventive maintenance takes place where maintenance actions are performed according to a planned schedule based 
on process iterations. Therefore, failures are usually prevented, but unnecessary corrective actions are often performed, 
leading to inefficient use of resources and increased operating costs (R. Keith 2002). 
The predictive maintenance allows the monitoring of equipment to avoid future failures and detect abnormalities, 
identify the root cause of issues and schedule maintenance when it is needed. It is performed through historical data 
and decision making tools 
In this paper, machine learning (ML) for maintenance prediction of aircraft engines are used. 
Referring to literature, ML is the most appropriate to deal with prediction issues. The aim of the study is to analyze 
and compare some of the most supervised learning algorithms used for classification issues, so the most accurate one 
can be identified for prediction purpose.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief literature review to introduce the ML algorithms used. 
Section 3, introduces an overview of maintenance requests and methodology. Section 4 presents the experimental 
results. Finally, section 5 concludes the obtained result.

In order to visualize the performance of various models, we will use the AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver 
Operating Characteristics) curve. AUC for ROC and Precision-Recall curves were plotted as shown below:

A false positive rate of the ROC curve plots on an x-axis (The probability that true value is zero for the target is equal 
to one) against a true positive rate on a y-axis (The probability that the true value is one when the target is equal to 
one). The curve of Multi-layer perceptron, Decision tree and SVM has been showed. 
SVM has the lowest AUC-ROC and scored better than other classifiers in precision-recall curve. 
 
6. Conclusion: 
This paper has presented a comparative study of different machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification 
tasks in maintenance prediction. In the experiment, a typical use case of aircraft engine failure detection was studied. 
We have included tree ML predictive techniques; Multilayer perception (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and 
decision tree (DT), to perform a binary classification study in order to predict if the engine will fail in a specific period

likely to have a good performance for failure prediction; it scored better in Precision, Recall and Accuracy. The multi-
layer perceptron and the decision tree have shown a poor performance although they scored better in AUC-ROC. 
Future work will include the implementation of more machine learning algorithms with more numerical datasets and 
will focus on unsupervised learning and new hybrid models.

make decision is still being intervened by family or friends. 
  
5.10 The Influence of Product’s Image on Decision of Selection With Employment 
Opportunities as Intervening Variables 
The calculation results show that employment opportunities as intervening of product’s image on the 
decision of selection. Therefore, hypothesis 10 is accepted. Product’s image is the product overview in 
consumers’ perspectives based on knowledge, responses and experiences of consumers to the product 
concerned (Kurniawan, F,et al, 2018). In that study, it shows that the product’s image has a significant 
effect and has a dominant influence on respondents' buying decisions. In this context, the decision of 
purchasing is the decision of selection. A positive image of the product will be shaped itself over time in 
consumers’ perspective since the products they purchase from the company has a good quality and able to 
create company’s positive image. With good quality products, then it implies indirectly that the company 
is also going to get a high sufficient profit due to consumers shall buy the products of these companies in 
regular basis, even though consumers do not know who makes the products. 
 
Employment opportunities illustrate the availability of jobs which are ready to be filled by job 
seekers. Every person who is ready to work will compete to get the jobs. Competition in looking for 
works will become increasingly difficult if the number of opportunities to work is less than the number of 
workers who are ready to work. Product’s image significantly influences the decision of selection on 
employment opportunities. Whereas employment opportunity is a condition where all workers who want 
to work at a certain wage level will easily find jobs. Therefore, employment opportunities as media for the 
decision of selection have a direct influence on the employment opportunities. 
 
 
6. Conclusions And Recommendation for Future Research 
Conclusions 
Conclusions withdrawn after conducting research on respondents is elaborated as follows: 
1. There is a significant influence of institution’s image on employment opportunities. Therefore, the first 
hypothesis is accepted.        
2. There is no significant effect of user’s image on employment opportunities. Therefore, the second 
hypothesis is rejected.        
3. There is a significant influence of product’s image on employment opportunities. Therefore, the third 
hypothesis is accepted.        
4. There is no significant effect of institution's image on the decision of selecting Business Administration 
study program. Therefore, the fourth hypothesis is rejected.        
5. There is no significant effect of user’s image on the decision of selecting Business Administration study 
program. Therefore, the fifth hypothesis is rejected.        
6. There is a significant influence on product's image on the decision of selecting Business Administration 
study program, the sixth hypothesis is accepted.        
7. There is a significant influence of employment opportunities on the decision of selecting Business 
Administration study program. Therefore, the seventh hypothesis is accepted.        
8. The institution’s image influences the decision of selecting Business Administration study program with 
employment opportunities as intervening variable. Therefore, the eighth hypothesis is accepted.        
9. Employment opportunities does not function as intervening variable of the impact of user’s image on 
the decision of selecting Business Administration study program. Therefore, the eighth hypothesis is 
rejected.

2695","Recommendation for Future Research 
The study results show the employment opportunities that the significant factors are the institution’s image 
and product’s image. Meanwhile, what determines the decision is the product’s image. This means that 
what STIAMAK institution must do is to improve its product’s image, which is Business Administration 
study program. Improving the product’s image can be carried out through advertising, promotion and 
uprating the quality of graduates. Through advertising and promotion, many people will know about 
products from STIAMAK. The second point, improving quality is one of the real ways that STIAMAK can 
produce quality graduates. This can be a clear evidence that shall not be indisputable. The success of quality 
improvement must be advertised and promoted through all existing mass media. 
  
This study is limited to examining brand image of employment opportunities and decision-making at one 
university. Future researches can be done on some universities with prospective students who have 
graduated from high school as respondents.

Abstract  
 
The Aerodrome Inspector at the Airport Authority Office, he carries out control activities in the form of: providing 
directions, guidance, technical assistance and recommendations for licensing extensions. The objective of the research 
is to evaluate and analyze the performance and excellence of the Aerodrome Inspector in 2019 and to analyze what 
are the alternative strategies for developing the Aerodrome Inspector's performance, using the Internal Factor Analysis 
Strategy (IFAS) and External Factor Analysis Strategy (EFAS) methods, then determining strategic priorities from 
the results of the IFAS and EFAS analysis with the QSPM matrix ( Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix). The 
competitive advantages of Aerodrome Inspector in Region III Airport Authority offices in 2019 can be formulated as 
follows:1. Competent Aerodrome Inspector; 2. Officials who support the performance of the Aerodrome Inspector; 3. 
An appropriate Aerodrome Inspector educational background; 4. Aerodrome Inspector's knowledge of data base 
processing software; 5. Aerodrome Inspector's knowledge of the data processing software; 6. Aerodrome Inspector's 
knowledge of license renewal data processing software. The results of the study show that the right strategy for 
developing the performance of the Aerodrome Inspector in 2020 is a product development strategy through developing 
the productivity skills and knowledge of the Aerodrome Inspector himself.

 1. Introduction  
The air transportation is one of the lifeblood of a nation's economy. The development of sustainable air 
transportation is the task of the government in improving the people's economy. The development of air 
transportation is not only in the form of developing transportation facilities and supporting equipment but 
also in the form of guaranteeing flight safety and improving services to passengers. Airport Authority Office 
Region III - Surabaya was formed based on the Regulation of the Minister of Transportation Number PM 
41 of 2011 concerning the Organization and Work Procedure of the Airport Authority Office. The Airport 
Authority Office oversees airports in four provinces in Indonesia, namely: East Java, Central Java, 
Yogyakarta Special Region and South Kalimantan which are the Technical Implementing Units within the

2698","In Figure 2 it can be seen that the total IFE value of 3.24 indicates that the Aerodrome Inspector is in a 
strong position (more than 2.5 IFE total score) in an effort to take advantage of existing strengths and if 
needed can also hide weaknesses – weakness. And then the total EFE value of 2.65 shows that the Airport 
Inspector responds well to opportunities and avoids threats in the external environment. And the results of 
the mapping of the total IFE value and the total EFE value of the Airport Inspector into the IE Matrix show 
that the position of the Aerodrome Inspector is in quadrant / cell IV. This position implies that the most 
appropriate strategy to use is the Grow and Build strategy. Strategies that can be applied are intensive 
strategies (market penetration, market development and product development), and Integration Strategy 
(vertical integration and horizontal integration). To determine the recommended alternative strategy 
because it is the same strategy that is generated through the use of two different matrices, and it can be said 
that the results are suitable. After analyzing using QSPM, the total value of relative attractiveness (Total 
Attractiveness Score) was obtained for each alternative strategy as can be seen in table 4. 
 
Table 4 .Total Attractiveness Score Aerodrome Inspector 
 
 
Based on table 4, it can be seen that for the future development of Airport Authority Officers, the use of 
product development strategies in terms of Airport Inspector productivity can be prioritized. This strategy 
was chosen because it has the largest Total Attractiveness Score (TAS) among other alternative strategies 
with a score of 5.15. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Based on the SWOT Matrix Analysis and Discussion and based on the IE matrix (IE Matrix), the 
recommended strategy recommendations for Aerodrome Inspector Development in 2020 are growth and 
development strategies. Furthermore, the Quantitive Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) is used as a tool to 
evaluate alternative strategic choices more objectively based on the main internal-external success factors 
that have been previously identified. After analyzing using QSPM, that for the development of Aerodrome 
Inspectors' performance in 2020 or in the future Aerodrome Inspectors must prioritize the use of product 
development strategies in terms of aerodrome inspector productivity because they have a value of Total 
Attractiveness. The highest score (TAS) among other strategies, namely: 5.15.

Abstract  
 
This study was conducted to investigate the mediation function of the variable brand trust on the relationship 
between brand satisfaction with brand loyalty; as well as to discover the attributes of brand trust that has the 
greatest role in strengthening customer satisfaction and establish brand loyalty. The research will be focused on 
testing the influence of brand trust and in particular the relationship with the antecedent elements held once a 
major asset on brand loyalty. Many empirical studies prove that it has an influence brand satisfaction on brand 
loyalty. However, the mediation function of brand trust on the relationship between brand satisfaction and brand 
loyalty are not a lot of attention of researchers, whereas brand trust is conceptually a picture of the emotional 
aspect of a customer to a brand that is consumed. Object of research in this study is consumers using the iPad in 
Surabaya. This study proves that brand trust has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between brand 
satisfaction with the brand loyalty and proves that brand trust has a direct influence on brand satisfaction and brand 
loyalty.

1. Introduction 
Increasingly tight business competition requires companies to compete on a competitive basis for creating unique 
market offerings and can provide added value to maintain loyal customers. Brand is the main capital of the 
company to stand out in increasingly fierce market competition is once again realize that the brand is the most 
valuable assets in an effort to win market competition. Brand is the company's promise to consistently deliver 
values such as features, benefits at the same service to customers. The brand also regarded as internalization 
number of impressions received by customers resulted in the existence of a special position in the minds of 
customers to the benefits of the emotional as well as functional obtained from consuming a product from a brand, 
which is also defined as a name, term, sign, symbol, design or all of which combined and is intended to identify 
the goods or services offered so different from the products or services produced by competitor. Building a strong 
brand in the market competition is the main goal of many organizations because it allows the creation of profits for 
the company, including reduced risk, greater profits, cooperation with other parties that may increase as well as the 
need to do brand extension. 
 
Thus, the question that arises then is what are the things that can cause the power of the brand. This question is the 
fundamental problem and become the main observations in the study of the brand at least in the past two decades, 
which ultimately results in a more powerful paradigm to study further the concept of brand equity. Most studies as 
performed by Falkenberg (1996), Hooley et al. (2005), Srivastava (1998) and Srivastava (2001) consider brand 
equity as a market-based assets that are interconnected because the brand equity actually be outside the company 
and lies in the relationship with the brand end user. At the same time, the emergence of relationship marketing as a 
starting point in a study conducted by researchers or marketing practitioners suggest that trust is a major factor in

2708","This empirical study is able to strengthen the concept of brand loyalty is influenced by two variables: brand 
satisfaction and brand trust, while finding that the two variables were also to be mediated by other variables that 
brand trust. This empirical study is able to strengthen the concept of brand satisfaction as measured by indicators of 
saliency, reputation, familiarity, trustworthy and service excellence. Familiarity variable has a dominant 
contribution to measuring brand satisfaction in this case shows consumer perceptions of a brand technology 
products. When viewed from the loading, the other dominant element that can be used to measure satisfaction is 
brand saliency. From this it can be said that consumers who in this case is also very concerned about the student 
aspect of the hallmarks of a brand technology products. The next aspect is the reputation of a brand that can be 
used to measure brand satisfaction. While the rest is trustworthy and service excellence. 
 
This empirical study was also able to strengthen the concept of brand trust were measured using two indicators 
namely reliability that operated with the impression that a brand is believed to have reliability in providing good 
quality to consumers; and intentions are operated with the impression that the brand is believed to have a 
willingness to meet the expectations of consumers. Further aspects of product reliability technologies that 
illustrates the brand trust. Although it has a different loading values between indicators of reliability and 
intentions, but this study proves that the overall ability of each of the indicators in the variable representing the 
brand trust is very strong, because both have a loading value greater than 0.5. Thus, theoretically this study 
strengthens the measurement of brand trust by using indicators of reliability and intentions. This study found that 
through the two indicators, brand trust variables proved to have a role mediating the relationship between values 
with brand loyalty behavior and brand satisfaction with the brand loyalty behavior. This is indicated by the results 
of path analysis, all of which are significant, even though the mediation role of mediation is not full. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the purpose of research, analysis of the relationship between variables and hypothesis testing, it can be 
drawn some conclusions of the study. Consumer behavior is influenced by brand satisfaction that can also be 
mediated by aspects of consumer confidence in a product. Products having positive image in the minds of students 
can bring the students confidence in a product, so that the relationship between satisfaction with the brand 
behavior, brand loyalty can be mediated by brand trust. Consumers who have a positive impression in his mind 
will trust a brand if the brand is able to meet his expectations about the positive images that exist in the minds of 
consumers. The emerging belief will encourage consumers to make a specific purchase behavior. 
 
Brand trust is considered as a relational asset markets has implications for the development and maintenance of 
trust to the brand, because it is a key characteristic of a successful long-term relationship. Ideas used in this study 
is that trust is a key driver of brand loyalty behavior because it creates a valuable long-term relationships. 
Although in this study the influence brand trust does not have a full mediation, but it can be said that in a 
managerial perspective, a brand must also consider the idea of grabbing consumer confidence to build a 
relationship. It was precisely the main purpose of marketing is to generate intense relationship between the 
customer and the institution and the main supporting element underlying this relationship is trust. This study 
though capable of generating a theoretical model of inter-relationship between brand trust and brand satisfaction 
with the brand loyalty and brand trust mediating role to the relationship, but it has limitations as mentioned in the 
previous section.

1. Introduction 
Employees are the most valuable asset in a company because employees are the spearhead of a company 
so that human resources management practices must be considered properly. Employees are the most 
important element in determining the back and forth of a company. To achieve company goals, 
employees who are in accordance with the requirements of a job are needed, and must also be able to 
carry out the tasks that have been determined by the company. The goals of an organization will be 
achieved if the performance of the company's human resources is good, therefore it needs to be 
maintained and treated properly (Supriyadi et al. 2017). Every company will always try to improve the 
performance of its employees, with the hope that the company's goals will be achieved. The ability of 
employees is reflected in performance, good performance is optimal performance. The employee's 
performance is one of the assets for the company to achieve its goals. 
 
Employee performance is a result achieved by workers in their work according to certain criteria that 
apply to a particular job. Robbins (2015) explains that employee performance is a function of the 
interaction between ability and motivation. Furthermore, Robbins (2015) states that performance goal

value of 0.000 or less than 0.05. Therefore it can be said that knowledge sharing can significantly 
mediate the effect of organizational culture on employee performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that organizational culture affects employee performance. This is based on the results 
of the hypothesis test where the P value of organizational culture to employee performance is smaller than 
0.05 which means that organizational culture has a significant effect on employee performance. The more 
positive organizational culture, the higher the employee performance. Likewise, vice versa, the more 
negative organizational culture, the lower the employee performance. The results showed that 
organizational culture affects knowledge sharing. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where 
the P value of organizational culture to knowledge sharing is smaller than 0.05 which means that 
organizational culture has a significant effect on knowledge sharing. This means that the better the 
organizational culture, the better knowledge sharing will be. The results showed that knowledge sharing 
affects employee performance. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of 
knowledge sharing to employee performance is smaller than 0.05 which means that knowledge sharing 
has a significant effect on employee performance. This means that the better knowledge sharing, the more 
positive impact on employee performance. Conversely, the more negative knowledge sharing, the more 
negative the impact on employee performance. The results showed that knowledge sharing mediates the 
effect of organizational culture on employee performance. This is based on the results of the hypothesis 
test where the P value of organizational culture to knowledge sharing and to employee performance is 
smaller than 0.05 which means that knowledge sharing mediates the effect of organizational culture on 
employee performance.

1. Introduction 
In this era of globalization, many new companies have emerged which have made competition between 
companies even tighter. The company must race to be superior to other companies so that the company is 
able to compete so that it can maintain its existence. To make a company superior to other companies, 
company management must pay attention to the performance of its employees first. Every company is 
expected to be aware of and create a management system that takes into account the factors that influence 
employee work attitudes in order to achieve organizational goals. The company's goals will be achieved if 
the performance of the company's human resources is good, therefore it needs to be maintained and 
treated properly (Supriyadi, Priadana, and Setia 2017). 
 
Performance is a problem that must receive attention from the company. The low performance will hinder 
the achievement of company goals, especially in terms of company development towards a better 
direction in facing global competition. Performance improvement will not happen by itself, but there must 
be effort and participation from the company as well as from the employees. Employee performance is 
the result of work in quality and quantity achieved by an employee in the ability to carry out tasks in 
accordance with the responsibilities assigned by the superior to him (Mangkunegara 2016). Employee 
performance can be seen from the number of work results produced by employees, the level of efficiency

Therefore it can be said that organizational justice has a significant effect on job satisfaction. 
3. The effect of job satisfaction on employee performance has a P value of 0,000 or less than 0.05. 
Therefore it can be said that job satisfaction has a significant effect on employee performance. 
4. The effect of organizational justice on employee performance through job satisfaction has a P value of 
0.011 or less than 0.05. Therefore it can be said that job satisfaction can help to significantly mediate 
the effect of organizational justice on employee performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that organizational justice affects employee performance. This is based on the results 
of the hypothesis test where the P value of organizational justice to employee performance is smaller than 
0.05 which means that organizational justice has a significant effect on employee performance. The more 
positive organizational justice, the higher the employee's performance. Likewise, vice versa, the more 
negative organizational justice, the lower the employee's performance. The results showed that 
organizational justice affects job satisfaction. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the 
P value of organizational justice to job satisfaction is smaller than 0.05 which means that organizational 
justice has a significant effect on job satisfaction. This means that the higher the organizational justice, 
the better job satisfaction will be. The results showed that job satisfaction affects employee performance. 
This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of job satisfaction to employee 
performance is smaller than 0.05 which means that job satisfaction has a significant effect on employee 
performance. This means that the more positive job satisfaction, the more positive impact on employee 
performance. Conversely, the more negative job satisfaction, the more negative the impact on employee 
performance. The results showed that job satisfaction mediates the effect of organizational justice on 
employee performance. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of 
organizational justice to job satisfaction and to employee performance is smaller than 0.05 which means 
that job satisfaction mediates the effect of organizational justice on employee performance.

Abstract  
The process of democratization in Indonesia is part of the flow of world democratization changes. In the 
political field, reform has replaced the authoritarian political system of the past with a democratic system. 
A democratic political system guarantees freedom of association and voice, including establishing 
political parties. This study aims to determine the effect of current events, personal events and epistemic 
issues on voting attitudes in the 2010 Pilkada in Ternate. The number of respondents being sample as 
many as 220 respondents. The description of the respondent's answer is the result of the respondent's 
answer to each research variable. In political campaigns there are two relationships that will be built, 
namely internal and external. Current events, personal events and epistemic issues. Current events have a 
significant effect on voting attitudes, this result provides support for the one hypothesis in this study. The 
component of attitude that has the most influence on the formation of voting attitudes in current events is 
cognition. Personal events have a significant effect on voting attitudes, this result provides support for the 
two hypotheses in this study. The attitude component that has the most influence on the formation of 
voting attitudes in private events is conation. Epistemic issues have a significant effect on voting 
attitudes, these results provide support for the three hypotheses in this study. The component of attitude 
that has the most influence on the formation of voting on epistemic issues is affection.

1. Introduction 
In the regional and global environment, this political context changes in line with a number of other democratic 
changes in a number of countries. In other words, the process of democratization of Indonesia is part of the changing 
flow of world democratization. In the political sphere, reform has replaced the past authoritarian political system 
with a democratic system. The democratic political system guarantees freedom of association and voices including 
establishing political parties. The president and representatives along with regional heads, both governors, regents 
and mayors, are now directly elected by the people, thus making competition or competition between candidates 
from advanced parties increasingly crowded. in the election. 
The old paradigm won the battle for political power, especially general elections during the new order with 
repressive patterns that were outdated The number of parties that were diverse, directly implicated in tactics and 
strategies to win the struggle for political power. Political parties that rely on force and repressiveness are no longer

2742","The results of reliability testing in the table above on the endorser credibility and attitude variables on the ads all 
have an alpha Cronbach value greater than 0.6. Thus the item statements in the questionnaire are reliable and further 
analysis can be carried out. 
 
3.2 Hypothesis testing 
Parameters of whether or not the effect is partially can be known based on the significance value of CR (Critical 
Ratio). To determine whether there is an influence of exogenous variables on endogenous and endogenous to 
endogenous, the following provisions are used: 
1.  Viewed from the level of significant α = 0.05. If the significance value is < 0.05, then there is the influence of 
exogenous variables on endogenous or endogenous towards endogenous. 
2.  And vice versa if the significance value is > 0.05 then there is no effect of exogenous variables on endogenous or     
endogenous towards endogenous. 
    The complete results of hypothesis testing can be seen in the table 2 below:

Based on the table above, the hypothesis test can be explained as follows: 
1. The magnitude of the CR value calculated by this variable on the attitude of choice is 2.424 with a     significance 
level of 0.015. Because this significance level is smaller than 0.05, it is concluded that there is a significant effect 
of current events on the attitude of voting. 
2. The magnitude of the CR value calculated by the personal event variable on the voting attitude is 2.114 with a 
significance level of 0.034. Because this significance level is smaller than 0.05, it is concluded that there is a 
significant influence of personal events on the attitude of choosing. 
3. The magnitude of the CR value calculated the epistemic issue variable on the attitude of choice is 2.054 with a 
significance level of 0.040. Because this level of significance is less than 0.05, it is concluded that there are 
significant epistemic issues with regard to voting attitudes. 
 
4. Results and Discussion 
From the results of the tests carried out using SEM with Amos program, that current events, personal events and 
epistemic issues show a significant effect on attitudes.  Current Events have a significant effect on voting attitudes, 
this result provides support for the fifth hypothesis in this study, namely the current event influences the attitude of 
voting. The component of attitude that has the most influence on the formation of voting attitudes in current events 
is cognition. Personal events have a significant effect on voting attitudes, this result provides support for the sixth 
hypothesis in this study, that is, personal events affect the attitude of voting. The attitude component that has the 
most influence on the formation of voting attitudes in private events is conation. Epistemic issues have a significant 
effect on voting attitudes, these results provide support for the hypothesis in this study, namely the epistemic issue 
influences the attitude of voting. The component of attitude that has the most influence on the formation of voting 
on epistemic issues is affection. The results of this study support previous research conducted by Azwar (2008: 24); 
Petty & Cacioppo, (1986); Baron & Byrne, (1991).  
 
5.  Conclusions 
Based on the results of the study, some suggestions were given as follows: 1) For successful teams, it is better to 
offer programs that are more specific to the community as voters and 2) For local governments to better prepare 
campaign facilities, including TV channels. local, so that the candidates and programs offered are truly known by 
the community.

Abstract  
The current era of globalization makes it easier for foreign companies to enter Indonesia and makes business 
competition even tighter. With the times, companies face challenges where competition for market share is very 
important for the survival of a company. Employee satisfaction is a very important factor, because employees are 
company assets. In a company, one of the determining factors for employee loyalty and job satisfaction is often 
associated with the element of compensation in the form of a salary. So that some companies provide relatively high 
salary compensation to their employees to buy satisfaction from them. We could say, the company provides high 
salary compensation. This research was conducted at PT. Bakti Jaya Abadi Surabaya with the aim to analyze the effect 
of financial rewards and work motivation on job satisfaction and loyalty. This type of research is quantitative. The 
sample of this research is 87 respondents who work at PT Bakti Jaya Abadi. The analysis technique used is SEM_PLS. 
Data obtained from questionnaires and tested with the SmartPLS 3.0 application. The results of this study are: financial 
rewards and motivation have a significant effect on job satisfaction and job loyalty. Job satisfaction has a positive and 
significant effect on job loyalty. Financial rewards and work motivation have a significant effect on job loyalty 
indirectly through job satisfaction.

commitment among employees ensuring high standards of performance (Wang, 2004). Loyalty is an 
employee's tendency not to move to another company, because loyalty greatly affects the comfort of 
employees to work for a company. One way to make employees loyal to work is to provide motivation or 
rewads to employees who are considered to have achievements. Because the more rewards or awards 
given to these employees will be able to create a feeling of satisfaction so that it will encourage these 
employees to be able to further improve their performance and achievement, this will make employees 
become loyal at work.

effect on job loyalty through job satisfaction. The result p-value 0,000 <0.050 and the t-statistic>t-table 
4,898> 1.96. In building a company or organization with the science of human resource management, 
there are many things that must be considered and thought out carefully, not only benefiting the company 
but not detrimental to the employees who are the driving force for the life of an organization or company, 
because that is one way to maintain Employees in the company are by looking at the things that affect job 
satisfaction and loyalty to employees, one of which is by providing good motivation and appreciation.

Along with the times, the role of human resources is very important, this is because the main function as a subject is 
in managing other resources so that they have more benefits. Human resource management is the strategic area of 
the organization. Human resource management should be seen as an extension of the traditional view of managing 
people effectively and frequires knowledge of human behavior and the ability to manage it Soejipto, (2002) . The 
existence of motivation and job satisfaction for employees, can provide good performance and quality for employees 
in the process of achieving company goals, each company has a different view in achieving its organizational goals.

performance in the company. Most u marsh that companies should do is to motivate and provide opportunities kepa 
da employees to participate and be involved in determining the way they work, communicate well and behave

meet all the regulations of the company ( Veithzal Rival, 2014)  
 
Hypothesis 7 : Effect of Job Satisfaction on Employee Performance through Quality of Work Life.

Abstract  
 
The era is now the era of the millennial generation which is theoretically those born in the period 1981 – 1993. In 
2019, the are in the range of 26 – 38 years, which are generally in the key period brilliant careers and performance 
in organizations or companies. Individual performance in this age generation is very decisive towards 
organizational performance. This study took subject as many as 40 employees by transformational leadership and 
organizational communication with job satisfaction as a mediator variable. With the background of shipping and 
private industry organizations, the result of regression analysis show that there is a significant influence between 
transformational leadership variables on individual performance and job satisfaction as a mediator variable. 
However, no significant effect was found between communication variables on performance through job 
satisfaction as a mediator variable. It is possible that the millennial generation’s present communication has 
different characteristics compared to communication and the performance of the millennial generation so that more 
variable will be known that affect individual performance.

1. Introduction 
Individual performance is the main concept that gets the attention of many work research and organizational 
psychology (Sonnentag and Frese, 2001). Armstrong (2009), Bono, Judge, Patton and Troresen (2001), Hogan and 
Coote (2013) and Simanjuntak (2011) said that in relation to performance that companies that understand 
performance including performance measurement can be ensured that the sustainability of the company will be 
better compared to companies that are not able to measure performance. These measurements can be at the level of 
individual performance, group performance or organizational performance. 
 
Performance (job performance) is conceptually divided into two, namely task performance and contextual 
performance (Jankingthong and Rurkkhum, 2012). Task performance is related to how effectively an employee or 
official carries out his duties in the company. Whereas contextual performance is not formally related to the tasks of 
each position but rather how to shape the social and psychological context of an effective organization 
(Jankingthong and Rurkkhum, 2012).

performance in the organization. 
 
Leadership has an influence on followers performance (Chelladurai, 1978). In his multidimensional model of 
leadership, Chelladurai argues that the character and behavior of a leader can influence the satisfaction and 
performance of his followers. The character of a leader who influences performance is formed from : past 
experiences; temperament; personal quality; skills; expected standards and decision making skills. 
 
Communication and individual performance 
Theoretically, actually the pattern of communication in an organization affects individual performance. This is 
evidenced by research conducted by Balondi. According to Balondi, companies that have very good communication 
patterns are those who become effective listeners to their workers and who have good planning. (Balondi, 2006) 
suggests that good internal communication makes employees work directed and improve company performance. 
 
Workers productivity increases when there is communication within the organization (Hellweg and Phillips, 1982). 
Besides many things, communication in organizations helps employees to carry out their jobs well, to get 
information about the tasks they have to carry out and about goals the purpose of the organization where they work. 
The existence of communication within the organization also supports the achievement of effective decision making 
(Hellweg and Phillips, 1982). 
 
In one study it was found that communication between employees as a communication transaction (Smidts, et al, 
2001). In the study it was concluded that employees who get adequate information about the activities of the 
organization will develop and obtain achievements that can form characteristics that distinguish it from other 
organizations. 
 
Communication has a very strong relationship with organizational functions. Communication activities in 
organizations that consist of sharing knowledge and communication between organizational members are able to 
create new innovations in organization (Monge, et al, 1992). Monge et al also found that communication activities 
have a strong effect on performance outcomes in organizations. They state that participatory environments in 
organizations increase productivity and work outcomes in organizations. 
 
The findings made by Dirks et al shows that communication that creates trust has a direct influence on various work 
outcomes in the organization (Dirks, et al, 2001). According to them, trust that emerges is an important element in 
the organization because it is positively related to the attitudes, perceptions, behaviors and work results of 
individuals in the organization. 
 
This study found no significance of the relationship between communication and performance through job 
satisfaction, made possible due to the different millennia characteristics of other generations. According to Pew 
Research Center (2010), the millennia generation has communication that does not require physical interaction, but 
can be biased through cyberspace. This could be the reason that the conception of communication that is identical to 
sender, media, interaction and receiver, is understood differently by the millennia. 
As a result, research found no effect of communication on performance through job satisfaction as a 
mediator variable. 
4. Conclusion 
1. Job satisfaction is the mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and individual 
performance. 
2. Job satisfaction is not a mediator of the relationship between communication and individual performance. 
 
5. Recommendation for next research 
1. Further research in order to add research samples to get better results 
2. Further research in order to add more relevant independent variable such as compensation and 
organizational commitment.

2787","involving community participation, beneficial programs, programs that can develop knowledge and programs that 
can enhance collaboration between citizens will be able to shape or influence changes in the corporate's reputation. 
The establishment of this reputation consists of the existence of a corporate that is considered significant, a proper 
commitment; the community already feels part of the corporate, success in the implementation of the program and 
also the public is more confident in the certainty of the corporate's concern for the surrounding environment. The 
formation of the corporate's reputation can also be through the strength of the community's social capital and 
increasing public welfare. This research supports Arrohmah (2014), The Influence of Social Capital on Community 
Participation in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Programs and Their Impacts on Community Economic 
Capability, from the documentation study concludes that CSR is an inseparable part of efforts to create community 
welfare, as well as participation The level of community participation in CSR is related to the economic capacity of 
the community. In general, empowerment is a series of activities to strengthen the power of weak groups in society, 
including individuals who experience poverty problems. Local economic empowerment means enabling the 
surrounding community to be economically independent or at least provide a boost to economic development in the 
area. With the existence of CSR, it is expected to have a positive influence on the welfare of the community and the 
economic development of the surrounding community. Community empowerment can be realised through the 
involvement of the whole community in its implementation. With this full involvement, it can strengthen social 
capital in the community, and this will have a positive impact on the image and sustainability of the corporate's 
value. Besides, it is also known that high social capital will affect the desires of civil society participation in various 
forms. 
 
5.  Conclusions 
The results of this study are the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs directly affect the 
strengthening of community capital, the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs directly 
influence the improvement of community welfare, the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs 
directly affect the corporate's image, and the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs can explain 
the positive changes in the corporate's reputation through community social capital and improvement of community 
welfare. Research results can be an opportunity for future managerial practices and research agendas. Managerial 
Practices; Several things need attention in the context of implementing CSR programs that are associated with social 
capital, community welfare and the reputation of the corporate including; a). CSR programs must be able to improve 
community capacity for long-term (sustainable) activities not in the context of spending program funds; b) The 
corporate must continue to encourage the recipient community to have the responsibility and ownership of the 
program implemented; and c) The corporate must implement a more concrete CSR program in increasing income 
economically because it is the primary objective in the concept of triple bottom CSR. The research agenda allows 
further research to add to the effectiveness variables of business institutions or business groups assisted by CSR 
programs.

Abstract 
 
The property attributes – physical, neighbourhood and location attributes – are incorporated into Hedonic Pricing 
Models (HPM) to determine property prices or evaluate the relative contribution of each attributes to the 
property prices. However, the findings of most studies on the influence of the property attributes on prices have 
been diverse. The directionality and quantum of influence are not static rather dynamic. Therefore this paper 
reviewed previous hedonic pricing models studies and summarise the influence of property attributes on price. 
The review found that the magnitude and directionality of the property attributes influence on prices are not 
uniform but rather diverse depending on the property type, situations and consumer preference. The divergence 
of findings was found to be more common in the physical attributes and location attributes. The findings on 
neighbourhood attribute are relatively more uniform. This is because most of the neighbourhood attributes are 
both positive or negative externalities, and deals with the overall society rather than a single property. The 
review shows that most of the hedonic pricing model applications are in the housing market with fewer 
applications in the commercial property market. The paper recommends more application of the hedonic pricing 
model in the commercial property market.

1. Introduction  
Properties are real estate assets which are physical structures (Lecomte, 2019) whose ownership gives the holder 
the right of enjoyment, possession, letting and disposal. The property market involves the transaction of 
properties in terms of letting, buying, selling, mortgaging and auctioning as the case may be. The property 
market performs a strategic role to the individuals, institutions and the economy in general. To the individuals, 
the property market provides them with the avenue to have their shelter and accommodation, a source of income 
to those that let their properties and provides employment opportunities to the teaming members of the populace. 
For instance, in Malaysia alone, about 1.4 Malaysian are employed in property-related jobs (Ling, Almeida, 
Shukri, & Sze, 2017). The property also serves as the greatest household’s wealth as well as their dominant 
liability (Campbell, 2012; Usman & Lizam, 2016). The property market, unlike other markets, is imperfect. 
Properties are heterogeneous, unique and distinct. No property is identical with another at least in their locational 
position. Properties are thinly or rarely traded, have a cyclical market with relative information asymmetry, 
illiquid, have a high cost of transaction and relocation (Aliyu, Sani, Usman, & Muhammad, 2018; Wiley, 2017). 
These characteristics make the property market price largely uncertain and volatile (Hardin III, Jiang, & Wu, 
2017). 
 
Real estate property is a bundled commodity. It is made up of many components that cumulatively make-up the 
final product – residential properties, commercial properties, hotel properties, industrial properties, agricultural 
properties, recreational properties, etc. The property bundles are broadly grouped into three attributes – the

Abstract 
 
The hedonic pricing model is extensively applied in property pricing modelling. It considers property as a bundled 
commodity and models its price as a function of its constituent parts – physical characteristics, neighbourhood 
attributes, and location factor. However, several issues in the conventional HPM hinder its accuracy in predicting 
property prices. This paper reviewed these issues with the ways of addressing them simultaneously. The review 
found the major issues in HPM include – normality of property prices, linearity, heteroskedasticity, 
multicollinearity, spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, spatial autocorrelation, and aggregation bias. These 
issues were found to substantially reduced the accuracy of property price modelling. These issues are minimised by 
specifying correct functional form which log-log specification was mostly found to be more efficient, dimension 
reduction using PCA or factor analysis, and property market segmentation. The use of these measures significantly 
reduces estimation errors and improves model fit thereby increasing the accuracy of property price prediction.  The 
review recommends caution in choosing the correct functional form a well as the application of property market 
segmentation in modelling property market using different methodologies.

1. Introduction  
Real estate properties are strategic to the economic development of nations. They play a vital role in providing 
employment opportunities, the market for construction material, account for substantial household and institutional 
wealth, and contribute significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of nations (Usman & Lizam, 2020; 
Usman, Lizam, & Adekunle, 2020; Joseph Awoamim Yacim & Boshoff, 2020). As such, significant attention is 
given to it by various stakeholders such as property investors, policymakers, financial institutions, households and 
academia. Most of the concern is the accurate pricing of real estate property assets. Property price is required for 
various purposes such as sales, purchase, taxation, mortgages, leasing, insurance, litigations, compensation, 
inheritance, balance sheet, inheritance, and investment and financing decision making (Núñez-tabales, Rey-
carmona, & Caridad y Ocerin, 2016; Pagourtzi, Assimakopoulos, Hatzichhristos, & French, 2003; Usman, Lizam, & 
Burhan, 2020). These uses of property worth require accurate estimation of the property prices to be effective. 
Properties values are conventionally determined using the traditional income, cost and market approaches of 
valuation. It is noteworthy to distinguish between property price and value and how they relate in the context of 
property pricing.

Abstract 
 
This study is a desk study that reviews the impact of lean principles in the Small and Medium Enterprises in the 
construction industry. The study used a systematic approach to review books, thesis, conference material, and 
journal articles that were written on lean principles. The review process covers construction micro, small and 
medium companies involved in civil engineering projects, residential and non-residential buildings. The results 
revealed that lean principles were poorly implemented and that most SMEs had minimal knowledge of lean 
principles. There was a clear understanding of some lean tools, and in most cases, they were applied on an activity 
and not for the entire duration of the project. This revealed that most SMEs were using lean tools but were not aware 
of their usage in their organizations. These findings assist local construction companies to identify opportunities for 
reducing operating costs. The researcher proposes interventions that the local and central governments should make 
in order to help the SMEs develop into a competitive segment of the industry. The interventions assist in; growing 
the SMEs, creating more job opportunities for the citizens, and generating revenue for the treasury.

1. 
INTRODUCTION 
   
Small and Medium Enterprises are the backbone of South Africa’s economy. They represent more than 98 percent 
of businesses and they employ between 50 and 60 percent of the country’s workforce across all economic sectors 
(Aigbavboa and Thwala, 2014; Tshikhudo et al., 2015; Rajagopaul et al., 2020). SMEs in general usually encounter 
difficulties in securing projects over their immediate rivals, thus affecting their performance. In South Africa, a 
business strategy that large construction firms use to reduce costs, complete projects on time and enhance 
competitiveness is subcontracting. Large construction firms have an influence on an SMEs access to work. 
Subcontracting is very common in the South African construction industry, with up to 70 percent of building and 30 
percent of civil construction projects being subcontracted to SMEs (CIDB, 2013).  
 
Another act that offers inclusion of SMEs to participate in large construction projects is the Broad-based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BEE). The Act seeks to, “empower rural and local communities by enabling access to 
economic activities, land, infrastructure, ownership and skills; and promoting access to finance for BEE start-ups, 
small, medium and micro enterprises, co-operatives and black entrepreneurs, including those in the informal 
business sector” (Act No. 46, Government Gazette). Under this act, the South African government set targets for a 
percentage in each sector to be controlled by SMEs. This has seen large construction companies selling their assets 
to achieve this objective (Thwala and Phaladi, 2009).  With this arrangement SMEs have been encouraged to   
participate in the main stream economy, thereby opening doors for employment creation. However, research in 
South Africa has shown that SMEs in the construction industry do not have the requisite skills for proper project 
delivery, (Hall and Sandelands, 2009; CIDB, 2015; Maake et al., 2016; Jones,2018). The industry is overwhelmed 
by inefficiencies, delays, reworks, corruption and operational wastages. Several projects have not been delivered on 
time and within their budgets (Assaf and Al-Hejji, 2006; Nicholson, 2013; Kgosi et al., 2018). For example, Medupi 
power station, the 4th largest coal-powered power station in the world, was delayed by 30 months and the estimated

Benchmarking has been used and adopted by many companies in industries as a tool for 
performance measurement and possible improvement. It has been difficult to implement 
benchmarking as cost reduction tool in the restaurant industry because of high operational 
costs, and also different cost structures require different cost control measures. This study 
evaluated the role of benchmarking as a possible cost reduction tool in the restaurant industry. 
The main objectives are to: (1) identify the drivers of cost in the restaurant industry; and (2) 
demonstrate the implication for adopting benchmarking as a cost reduction tool in the 
restaurant industry. The study adopted a survey research design reflecting on 5 restaurants 
purposively sampled and a mixed method research approach was used. Interviews and 
questionnaires were used for data collection. The research findings reveal that those restaurants 
that implemented benchmarking realized an improvement in their overall costs reduction, and 
have a better understanding of their cost drivers. The challenges that are faced by restaurants 
in implementing benchmarking included lack of consistency and inadequate resources for an 
effective control of the whole process. Recommendations included the need to hire well trained 
employees that can effectively and consistently use the resources provided.

5. Conclusions 
 
In South Africa, most restaurants have not fully implemented benchmarking. They have limited 
knowhow and experienced employees that can implement it effectively. As a measure that can 
help to generate new ideas of reducing costs in restaurants, benchmarking needs to be a 
continuous process that has to be communicated among all employees. Training should be an 
on-going process with staff members so that they get support and work as a team. Training 
restaurateurs in benchmarking practices will lead to increased productivity, higher profit and 
improved service quality. This will enable them to understand their operations so as to gain 
more competitive advantage in the industry locally and internationally.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this research is to find the COVID-19 pandemics that did influence the stock market as the past stock 
market crashes that happened in 1929 and 1987. In late February, due to the coronavirus pandemic spread out, the 
stock market started crashing. By creating a new multivariate statistical model and analyzing the coronavirus 
pandemic, the authors found out the recession of the stock market. The data to be analyzed includes eight previously 
bought stocks which averagely gained a lot and are considered to sell. Authors then bought twenty-three stocks that 
were COVID-19 impacted but expected to surge in the future. The research is supposed to find out if there is any 
possible opportunity to do stock exchange operations instead of merely buying or selling. All the data used the Z-
Standardized Algorithms calculation to convert to be ready for comparison. There are three most important indexing 
signals, the selling, buying, and exchanging, through the statistical analysis software JMP, to find the correlation 
between the stock market and the pandemic trends and to show how to earn money for college tuition. The project 
used the Quantile Range Outliers Algorithm, and Robust Fit Outliers Algorithm to find the best occasion and 
strategy of stock investment.

Abstract 
 
By building statistical models, this project is to show how age is a big factor for NBA players. Using the trend for 
former players to predict the active NBA player's career future. 36 valid candidates have been chosen who 
completed at least 1200 games and 15 seasons (excluding the short season or players who did not complete more 
than 20 games) in their career. Doing Z-Standardization and removing any standard deviation, means bias before 
creating each age model. Combining the Z statistics of each player to make sure equal weights for players' Career 
Average. The purpose of this project is to see how age affects a player's total playing time and total points received 
in each season add on. To predict active duty NBA players' career future, authors calculated the combo average of 
three categories (point average per game PPG, minutes played per game MPG, and points per minute PPM) with 36 
sets of data and concluded the golden age range for players. By using statistical analysis software JMP and Minitab, 
the authors partitioned 36 players into 7 clusters, and the multi correlation has been studied. Contrasting the 
correlation of players having the same position in each cluster, to see if the value is close to their cluster average, the 
project is to show how two players are similar to each other and to predict out the active duty player’s future 
performance by using the former player career trajectory.

Abstract 
This project applies the Monte Carlo Simulation, the authors were able to take a deeper look inside the 
human mind, with modern approaches to computer programming. The game of poker uses key strategies 
of wit and deception, all in all ending with the sickness of gambling. The Monte Carlo Simulation uses 
the programming language Python to set up a 6 player game of Poker with a 16 card partial deck using the 
various face cards. This game counts only the full-house, 3 of a kind, pair, and high cards for winning 
combinations to maximize the data significance. In this game these characters have different thresholds in 
categories like checking, folding, and even betting, which is edited using various variables and wagers 
applied through a complex malleable percent confidence level interface in an effort to model real human 
psychology. These confidence levels affect how these players participate in the game.  This results in 
players that are concise and specific, only betting when the cards have higher chances of winning, to 
players that bet no matter the cards that are presented. This program allows for numerous simulated 
rounds in seconds, while making advanced calculations on winning probability, and intricate 
hypothesis/correlation tests to deduce that gambling is not only harmful to the mind, but economically 
non-beneficial. This is only the first stepping stone for the possibilities that this simulation can explore, 
offering countless applications that simply have no limits.

This paper deals with maintenance outsourcing in product-service system (PSS) as a new service –oriented 
manufacturing. As a new service, the PSS is a new opportunistic to manage maintenance for complex system. We 
develop a fleet maintenance under smart PSS that applied in a public transport. Maintenance is used to reduce the 
occurrence of damage and downtime. The degradation process is considered to be influenced by age, usage and 
operating condition. The purpose of the paper has two-folds. Firstly, it is to show that the traditional maintenance does 
not perform satisfactorily when facing with a complex system and secondly to show how smart PSS can performs 
better. The case study in Indonesian public transport is presented to illustrate the problem.

1. Introduction 
 
Recently, many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are turning to product-service packages where they deliver 
the physical assets with an integrated service contract (Jackson and Pascual (2008), Wang (2010) and Iskandar et al, 
(2014)). The OEM or an external agent normally offers a variety of maintenance service contracts including the system 
that can monitor and give information about the condition of the equipment. In order to provide more assurance to the 
owner of the equipment, this system is embedded with Internet of Things and system censors (see Figure 1.). Then 
the OEM can give combination maintenance decision such as CM, PM and also condition based maintenance (CBM).

Abstract 
This paper studies sports injury risks and prevention, specifically focusing on figure skating. USFSA STARS science 
and injury biomechanics are also illustrated. Modern 3D-motion techniques were introduced to help develop sports 
strength training curriculum -- sports injury failure modes and injury prevention stretching techniques were analyzed 
and used to develop a cohesive curriculum. Clustering Principal Component Analysis was utilized to understand the 
different clustering methods that can help select the appropriate clustering algorithms to discover more injury insights. 
Statistical data visualization tools were used to provide more correlation and causation patterns on understanding the 
injury mechanisms. Using results from our statistical analysis, the appropriate injury prevention program was 
developed for figure skaters.

Abstract 
 
Entrepreneurs are the backbone of all prosperous economies worldwide, since they are regarded as a key driver of 
economic growth in creating job opportunities, eradicating poverty and leading to the production of both developed 
and emerging countries' gross domestic product (GDP). This paper presents the findings of a pilot survey aimed at 
validating a questionnaire explicitly designed to gather data on the relationship between financial literacy and 
business performance among entrepreneurs. A total of 37 sampled respondents were used in the analysis using a 
stratified and clear random sampling technique. The data were analyzed with the assistance of the Statistical Kit for 
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, of which the study of the variables and assessment of the reliability were carried 
out. As a result, only 44 of the 49 elements that initially formed the survey were retained. A total of 9 components 
emerged from the data that were named in accordance with their underlying constructs. The factor loadings reported 
met the appropriate threshold of .50. The reliability of the items and the respective scales was also within the 
acceptable range of .70. It was thus concluded that the questionnaire was reliable and could be used for the reason 
for which it was built.

1. Introduction  
Financial literacy is a combination of understanding, information, expertise, behaviors and actions that is necessary 
to complete financial choices and ultimately to promote individual financial well-being (Lusardi and Mitchell 2013). 
In business financial literacy, is considered to be the degree to which one understands important financial concepts 
and has the capacity and confidence to manage the funds of appropriate, short-term decision-making and sound 
long-term financial forethought (Remund 2010). Entrepreneurial financial literacy is therefore essential in enabling 
an entrepreneur to make successful decisions on the use of financial capital over a lifetime and to interact effectively 
with financial products and services (Wise 2013).  
 
It is understood that the financially literate entrepreneur has an understanding of simple principles such as 
investing, accounting and certain economic concepts such as inflation and exchange rates (Lewis and Lindley 2015). 
Financial literacy education provides a person with the opportunity to identify business opportunities, awareness, 
self-esteem and skills, while enhancing his or her business efficiency (ACCA 2014). Financial literacy also provides 
young entrepreneurs the opportunity to access sources of finance, and access to financial services encourages their 
business sustainability and development (Vincent 2014).  
 
The positive outcome of being financially literate is determined by actions, e.g. managing spending and building 
insurance, whereas unquestionable activities, such as extreme use of credit, can affect the financial well-being of 
individuals (Peng et al. 2015). In addition, financial conduct is understood by economic and non-economic values 
maintained by the decision-maker as a consequence of such actions, and is thus considered to be a central factor in 
the personal decision-making process (Potrich et al. 2015). Financial literacy help Entrepreneurial financial planning 
skill, as regard to record-keeping, risk management and budgeting (Annamaria and Olivia 2014). Entrepreneurial 
financial literacy improves the opportunity for business gains with improved operating capacity and business 
performance (Adomako & Danso 2014).

4. Conclusion  
A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on 49 orthogonal rotation (varimax) items. The Kaiser – 
Meyer – Olkin test confirmed the sampling adequacy of the study, KMO = .715; .736; .715; .669; .835; .882; .864; 
.878 and .876. All values were above the acceptable limit of.5, which confirmed that the sample was sufficient for 
analysis (Williams, 2010). The Bartlett’s test of sphericity χ² were all less than .05 (p < .000), indicating that 
correlations between items were sufficiently large for principal component analysis (PCA). An initial analysis was 
run to obtain eigenvalues for each component in the data. Nine components had eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion 
of 1 and explained 61.42 %, 73.502 %, 73.502 %, 62.104 %,70.025 %, 79.735 %, 83.177 %, 82.482 %, 79.916 % 
variance in the respective factors extracted. The analyses resulted in retaining 41 items out of the 49 items that were 
originally included in the first draft of the questionnaire. The factor analysis result indicated that the 41 items can 
appropriately be clustered into 9 factors which were labelled Access to Credit, Financial Awareness, Debt 
Management, Book Keeping, Savings, Risk Management, Diversification, Sales and Employee Competency. The 
findings of reliability analysis revealed that all the scales were reliable which therefore lead to the conclusion that 
the questionnaire can be used to collect information from the broader population the main survey.

Abstract 
 
Recently there are some mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission have been developed in an 
attempt to understand the disease. Various approaches of modeling have been devised by many authors 
which broadly divided into two different methods, the mechanistic modeling method and the empiric 
modeling method. In empirical modeling process ones usually look at the available COVID-19 data such 
as the cumulative cases of insidence and the daily cases of incidence. The data of such cases are usually 
available from legit situs such as the Worldometer website. This website provides total confirmed cases, 
daily new cases, daily active cases, daily death, etc. Ones usually use the time series data of the total 
confirmed cases to fit with a certain growth model. In this paper we will model the COVID-19 disease 
transmission by looking at the growth of the confirmed and daily new cases data. The growth model we 
choose is the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) equation. We use two methods depending on the minimization 
process of the RMSE. We used the equation to model the COVID-19 transmission of Indonesia data starting 
from 2 March 2020, the official first day of the reported pandemic cases in Indonesia, up to 30 November 
2020.  In applying the growth  equations to the pandemic data we  denoted that X(t) is the cumulative of 
confirmed case at time t. The calculation is done using Solver in the Microsoft Excel application by 
choosing the GRG Nonlinear (Generalized Reduced Gradient) for the oftimization to find the minimum 
root of the mean square error as the measure. The results show that both methods give relatively similar 
results and reveal the strongly dependence of prediction on the sufficiency number of data being used.

1. Introduction 
COVID-19 pandemic was officially announced less than a year ago by the WHO. The disease has been declared as a 
Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. However, devastating impact to almost all 
aspect of human life becomes apparent from time to time. It is a very dangerous new disease in terms of health impact, 
economy, and other human aspects. COVID-19 so far is still regarded as a disease that difficult to understand, let 
alone to control, due to several reasons such as lack of data and confusing report  (Caudill 2020). This is among the 
reasons why so far most infected countries still struggling combating the disease. This disease is caused by the Corona 
SARS-2 virus and is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China. At that time, more than 118,000 cases were recorded 
in 114 countries with 4,291 people losing their lives (WHO 2020). To see the widespread of the disease, we note that

Figure 2. Total Coronavirus Cases (a) and Daily New Cases (b) in Indonesia pandemic data fitted by the MMF 
growth function (Method 2). The data used  to parameterize the equation are taken from the beginning of the disease 
(2 March 2020) to 30 November 2020. Figure (a) shows that the MMF growth function fits in agreement  with the 
cumulative data. Figure (b) shows that the model predicts that at this date the disease nearly reach the peak of the 
outbreak. The value of the peak significantly depends on the number of data we used (see Table 3).  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
We modeled the pandemic data of Indonesia (the total confirmed cases and the daily new cases) from the Worldometer 
website (Worldometer, 2020) using the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin  (MMF) growth function. The results show that the 
MMF growth function fails to predict the long-term outcome due to the strong dependence of the method to the data. 
Sufficient data is needed to estimate the best parameter, hence the more accurate prediction can not be obtained in the 
case of lack of data.  There are some reasons why the MMF growth function cannot predict this long-term outcome.  
One of them is when it is applied too early, in which the disease still in the exponential growth phase, then  the method 
cannot locate the inflection point accurately.

Abstract 
This project is to build statistical models to validate who should win 2015-2019 regular seasons’ NBA Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) Award.  Prior building the MVP models, the player statistics data has been Z-
standardized to remove any mean and standard deviation bias. The “Uniform MVP Index” has been derived 
from combining each player’s Z statistics with equal weight. Team has further derived a ""Weighted and Subset"" 
model by adding the weight factor and the best subset feature selection.  Authors have added the ""Team 
Winning"" factor in the Power Model from power= 0 (equivalent to the Weighted Model), 0.5,1,1.5 to power= 
infinity (MVP from the best Team).  The Power MVP Index will be multiplied by the power of the team 
winning% in the Power model. Based on the Validation of 2015-2019 Seasons, there is no single MVP model 
could determine the MVP winner from year to year.

Abstract  
Integrated Waste management system was the important thing to protect and control the transmission disease. 
Waste was still the main problem in Indonesia. The College students were the agent of change to better 
environmental, essecially to manage the waste. The purpose of this study is to analyze the knowledge, attitude 
and practice of the college students about the waste management system in their campus. The method of this 
research is a cross sectional study that conducted in Jember, Indonesia on Agustus 2019. The sample were 1230 
college students that token randomly. The results showed that the characteristic of respondents were 63,1 % 
female, 75,1 % living in the boarding house and their parent`s job were farmer, fisherman etc (46,1 %). The 
knowledge were good (94%), positif attitute (97,2%) and moderate practice (73,7%) on waste management 
system. The respondents have good knowledge and positive attitude but their practice had moderate. There 
were sig correlation spearman between knowledge (p=0,00), attitude (p=0,019) and their practice. The college 
students were the key to change the community practice abaut intergrated management system, so they should 
have had good practice in the waste management system.

This research showed that there was a sig correlation between knowledge (p=0,00), attitude (p=0,019), and 
practice among college students on Integrated Waste Management system. Good knowledge and a positive 
attitude do not always get good practice. Some research showed that good knowledge and positive attitude in the 
waste management system but the practice were still not good (Kiran et al., 2015). But some research showed 
that knowledge, attitude, and practice were a correlation with the practice. The research  (Shewasinad et al., 
2017) said that good knowledge, a positive attitude will get the good practice too, and when the knowledge and 
attitude were moderate will get the moderate practice too (Rahmaddin MY, Hidayat and Yanuwiadi, 2015). 
There was a sig correlation between knowledge, attitude, and practice in waste management (Syam, 2016); 
(Alimohammadi et al., 2018). 
The waste management system was an important thing to do to control the quality of health life (Simarmata, 
Pandia and Mawengkang, 2018).  The waste management system is the strategy to control the environment and 
health. Community involvement should be doing together with the government to create a healthy life. 
Educational about reusing the waste (Thirumarpan et al., 2015) and community involvement  (Essuman, 2017) 
should be one of the programs to reach the good practice in the waste management system.

CONCLUSIONS 
The knowledge of the respondents was good, the attitude was positive, but the practice of waste management 
system was moderate. There was a sig correlation between knowledge, attitude, and practice among college 
students. The college curriculum may have been an improvement to increase the knowledge, attitude, and 
practice among the college students in waste management. The college students can be role models and agents 
of change in the community to save the environment.

Abstract  
 
Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide platform that creates a connected network between physical objects and 
devices through internet to be located, identified, and controlled. Nowadays, IoT plays a vital role in supply chain 
management. However, IoT shed the light for the academic researchers, there was a clear gap in exploring and 
investigating the impact of IoT on supply chain performance particularly in developing countries. Therefore, this 
exploratory study tries to fill this gap by investigating the impact of IoT on supply chain performance through semi-
structured interviews on a sample of 9 companies located in Egypt. The purpose of the semi-structured interviews 
would be to identify the impact of IoT on the supply chain performance metrics of the chosen companies and examine 
the extent to which the advantages of IoT are extended to their supply chains. Purposive sampling was applied as the 
companies chosen would be involved in using technologies in managing their supply chains flows and operations. The 
findings showed that IoT would have a positive impact on supply chain performance metrics of the selected sample, 
with exception of very few measures that shown as no change. At the end of the study, recommendation for future 
work is determined. 
 
Keywords  
Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management and supply chain performance.   
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Supply chain organizations in the present global environment operate in a market that is increasingly complexity, 
and sharp competition environment was created due to the global markets. Supply chain comprises of suppliers, 
producers, retailers, wholesalers, distributors, and end customers. The stated partners need to be synchronized to create 
a balance between demand and supply (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Moreover, to become more competitive 
and achieve preferred objectives of partners (Abdel-Basse et al., 2019). Supply chain management (SCM) means 
having the correct item in the correct volume at the correct time at the correct place for the correct price in the correct 
condition to the correct customer (Wu et al., 2016). Traditional supply chains are becoming more costly, complex, 
and vulnerable. To overcome these challenges; managing supply chain effectively is a must.  
The Information Technology (IT) nowadays, plays a vital role to manage the supply chain effectively (Ross, 
2002). More than ever before, information technology (IT) is permeating the supply chain at every point, transforming 
the way exchange-related activities are performed (Palmer and Griffith, 1998).One of most important development of 
IT is the Internet of Things (IoT) (Abdel-Basse et al., 2019). IoT is supposed to strengthen the supply chain integration 
by connecting the objects through Internet (Ping et al., 2011 and Tu, 2018 as cited in De Vass et al., 2018). The word 
was first coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, co-founder and executive director of the Auto-ID Center at MIT, for 
companies such as CISCO, the IoT was born in 2009, when more devices than people were connected to the Internet 
(Sembroiz et al., 2018).

2879","5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The effect of IoT on supply chain performance becomes essential in today’s academic research. However, 
evocative evidence to explain the role of IoT in and its impact on supply chain performance is vital to be investigated. 
Nevertheless, academic literature was found to have an outstanding gap in research that addressed the impact of IoT 
on companies’ supply chain performance measures – particularly within developing countries and this research was 
an attempt to fill this gap.  Through findings of this study using the semi-structured interviews, all the interviewees 
spoke positively about the outcomes of IoT deployment in their companies to improve supply chain performance for 
their strategically, technically, and operationally levels.  
Further research would be recommended to further investigate the drivers and barriers of implementing the IoT 
along the supply chains and operations in developing countries.

Abstract 
This paper attempts to examine and evaluate an extended theoretical model which was devised by combining earlier 
theoretical frameworks developed by theorists on transformational leadership and new product development (NPD) 
team climate. The research sample represents three work teams representing different global work location of a 
European multinational company i.e., Finland, Norway and the UK. The process of hypotheses testing confirmed the 
validity and feasibility of the newly extended theoretical model. The study results demonstrated positive association 
among selected theoretical concepts and the related variables, e.g., transformational leadership’s linked variables; 
leader’s competence to empower and management initiatives, while NPD team climate’s linked variables; work 
situation and collaboration. However, the study results disapproved the positive association between the variables; 
supportive leadership and organizational trust. 
Keywords: Transformational leadership, management initiatives, new product development, supportive leadership, 
organizational trust 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The subject study evaluates data obtained through a research survey that has endeavored to confirm and disseminate 
the significance of transformational leadership and effective corporate management initiatives to establish suitable 
team climate in a selected energy sector multinational company. This transformational process was appraised on the 
basis of feedback obtained from the targeted company’s product development and associated operational work 
teams with reference to the NPD team climate to ensure effective innovative capability of the overall organization. 
This research survey is an attempt to explore and analyze the interconnection among the selected concepts of 
transformational leadership, NPD team climate and organizational trust to support, and strengthen organizational 
innovative competency.  
The current study commences with a brief literature review to introduce the concepts of transformational leadership 
and supportive organizational leadership linked to the phenomena of organizational trust as well as NPD team 
climate. This process will continue through the formulation of the study hypotheses. The methodology involved in 
this research will be discussed in the middle section of the paper. Finally, this study will be concluded with an in-
depth analytical review and discussion on the study results, in addition to the recommendations for industrial 
managers and researchers. 
 
2. Theoretical background 
 
2.1.     Transformational leadership   
  
The concept of transformational leadership, is viewed as the leader’s ability to encourage and promote shared 
vision of the future, intellectually stimulate employees, and attend to the phenomena of work force diversity 
(Lowe at al., 1996; Kazmi and Naaranoja, 2015a; Kazmi et al., 2014; Kazmi et al., 2015). The recent research 
work on transformational leadership by theorists have acknowledged a common assumption that leaders

Abstract 
Effort to spur the development and growth of small business actors or MSMEs, a certain method is needed to 
increase their sales. One of the efforts made is utilizing digital media which has been rapidly developing online 
by many business actors. The problem that arises is how to choose and determine the most effective media in 
order to increase marketing activities so that sales turnover can increase significantly. To answer these 
problems, this study intends to try to test in order to find and determine the best digital media (marketplace) for 
the marketing media of the business actor, so that the marketing activities of small business actors can run 
effectively. To prove the effectiveness of digital marketing media in the form of a marketplace, research 
subjects are needed, that is small business people who are directly involved with online marketing, interview 
approaches and their success rate in using the digital media (marketplace). Through this research, it is expected 
that small businesses can choose wisely and effectively the use of digital media (marketplace) in their marketing 
activities so that their sales turnover can increase. The study took the location or object of research in six 
districts in East Java that is Sidoarjo, Pasuruan, Mojokerto, Tuban, Lumajang, and Malang. Considering that 
consumer and social behavior of people in six districts differ from each other, of course, they must be measured 
and tested, is there a significant linear relationship in market use in an effort to increase marketing activities and 
sales of business actors. Based on the results of the Crosstabs test, the results show that there is a linear 
relationship between the existence of the marketplace and the efforts of small businesses to market and sell their 
products online in six sub-districts in East Java.

1. Introduction 
The presence of the marketplace now helps many community needs. Anything in the marketplace. You just 
moved house and need important furniture, you can find a wide variety of furniture at competitive prices. Not 
only furniture, there are also primary needs such as fashion, food to daily needs. For example buying cinema 
tickets, paying credit. All that can be done with the help of the marketplace (Maheshwar et al. 2018). Seeing 
how much activity is spent using the marketplace as meeting daily needs, this is what makes this marketplace 
hunted. Not only by users but also investors. Enthusiastic community increased because it was supported by 
adequate infrastructure and easy access. The Investment Coordinating Board (ICB) revealed the value of 
investment in the digital market sector in 2017 reached USD 5 billion. This makes the marketplace the most 
sought after economic sector today, (Harlipan, 2017). 2019 seems to be the year that marks the emergence of 
many startups engaged in the e-commerce industry. Marketplace is one of the business concepts used by these e-
commerce sites. Before discussing further, it helps us to know what a marketplace is. Marketplace has a concept 
like a traditional market that seems to be on the internet. Marketplace owners have the role of parties who bring

The purpose of this study is to provide a solution so that babies born can undergo the immunization process 
properly using a special application and is equipped with a design such that it is easy to use, operated based on 
an SMS gateway. So that mothers and babies are born always get accurate information about immunization 
activity until the baby's age limit is exactly 59 weeks and without errors. SMS gateway based applications can 
be implemented in health centers or hospital services. This application has a range of up to several cities in the 
vicinity which are close to health care centers or hospitals that are responsible for providing the fastest service.

1. Introduction 
The development of smartphones now have very mushrooming community, ranging from small children up to 
adults often have activity with smarphone. At the end of 2016 is estimated to be approximately 85 million 
smartphone users in Indonesia. While the total penetration growth reached 41.26 percent. The activity of people 
on any smartphone range of games up to business. According to research Google along with TNS Australia 
found, 75 percent of owners of smartphones in Indonesia makes that device as the main, including 
telecommunications equipment to access the internet (Abdallah et al 2020). The process of the development of 
the world of digital technology has affected many areas of. One of the central areas experience penetration of 
digitization technology is in the area of health. One of the influences that add to the health field is medium with 
a large number of emerging health applications that can be easily accessed via a smartphone or tablet device. 
For example, in developed countries the current process of medical examination the ear or hearing children have 
can be done using your smartphone (Ailes et al 2015). Through the device doctor can diagnose the infection and 
prepare the proper treatment for his patients. Growing number of mobile applications in the health field will 
certainly ease the course of patient care.  
One of the aspects in the eHealth Technology emphasized the use of the mobile device (mobile) for health 
services. With the use of mobile devices, such as Smartphones, medical services can reach better on areas,

also be carefully controlled.  
This SMS based application is felt to be increasingly important because several considerations, including health 
workers at the district level, are still too limited. With this application, the role of health workers in serving the 
community can be increased even though it is limited by distance and time. Another factor to consider is the 
level of knowledge of people living in remote areas who are still lagging behind in understanding the 
importance of immunization for the health of their babies. On the other hand, the development of technology in 
the field of information has progressed so far, if this is not utilized, the program to reduce infant mortality in 
remote areas will still be difficult to overcome by the local government all the time. With the application of this 
SMS-based application, local government programs aimed at immunization activities nationally can be helped 
properly, including the process of collecting data related to the health of infants and mothers after giving birth, 
and can help health workers and their institutions in gathering data on new types of diseases that may arise 
related to infant growth during immunization. why is it more prioritizing developing SMS-based applications? 
Most ordinary people understand how to use cellular devices in a simple form, even though mobile devices are 
now a daily necessity in the process of communicating in every aspect of life, including people who live in 
villages. Therefore the development of SMS-based applications is felt to be more suitable for the community in 
the village, easier to operate by every family member who has this device. In everyday life, the use of 
applications that run using mobile devices can be easier to use, does not confuse users, easy access, simple form, 
does not require special expertise. Based on interviews conducted in the previous period, people in villages are 
more familiar with cellular devices in their lives than devices that are run using different methods. This has 
given a better hope to the local government in reducing the infant mortality rate due to ignorance of mothers in 
handling immunizations for their babies' health. After being successful and running well in Malang district, this 
application program will be developed and implemented in other areas with the same goal of reducing infant 
mortality for rural communities living in remote areas and beyond the reach of health services.

Abstract 
 
Health Minister Nila Moeloek says that environmental factors, not health services, greatly influenced 
public health. The statement made by the Minister of Health was based on H.L. Blum's opinion, which 
says that environmental factors constitute 40% of health degrees. It means that increasing the degree of 
public health can be done through ecological hygiene, including handling household waste. 
In the study, community behavior, regulation, and reliable waste infrastructure are independent 
variables that can affect environmental cleanliness (dependent variable). Data processing uses SPSS 
linear regression stepwise analysis, highlighting the independent variable's effect on the dependent 
variable partially and draws conclusions. 
Based on the multiple linear regression analysis results with the stepwise method processed using the 
SPSS version 24 data processing program, from 10 regression equations, the best equation is obtained. 
The value of the best regression coefficient (R) is R = 0.933 in step 7 (seven). It means that the variables 
of how to manage waste at home, how often officers transport garbage, the availability of waste 
transportation services, the availability of containers used to collect waste in the kitchen, and how the 
community's behavior in disposing of household waste, has a very significant effect, namely 93.3% on the 
cleanliness of the environment around the house.

5.1. Conclusions 
From the regression equation that has been carried out from the SPSS.24 Stepwise Regression 
Analysis, it can be concluded that the factors that influence environmental cleanliness related to waste 
handling are: 
a. 
Garbage that is allowed to pile up around the environment. 
b. 
Garbage that is not put in a closed trash basket/bag. 
c. 
No garbage officer routinely pick up garbage from the house to the temporary disposal site. 
d. 
Community behavior that does not fully understand how to handle the waste.  
  
5.2. Recommendations  
From the conclusions above, there are several recommendations for the Ngawi Regency Government 
to improve waste management and maintain environmental cleanliness, including: 
a. 
Clean and healthy behavior campaigns to increase public understanding of the waste problem so that 
this also affects people's habits in disposing of garbage. Awareness of providing trash in his house 
and throwing garbage in its place. 
b. 
Coaching efforts, socializing waste management policies, the dangers of waste to health and the 
environment, and providing training with the 3R principles (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to mobilize the 
community in simultaneous and continuous waste management. 
c. 
Increase the provision of solid waste infrastructure facilities (infrastructure) made to be closer to 
settlements and easily accessible to the community so that people do not experience difficulties 
disposing of waste. 
d. 
Local government also needs to provide transportation facilities and communal trash cans close to 
settlements and reachable to residents. The formation of community groups that care about 
environmental cleanliness is also required.

1. Introduction 
Every organization strives for success because today the competitive business environment is very 
competitive. Regardless of the size of the company and the company's market share, every organization 
strives to manage employees to be able to work properly. The company will always try to improve 
employee performance in order to be able to achieve company goals. 
 
Performance is very important for the organization because high performance can certainly reduce 
employee absenteeism, high employee performance makes the work given to him will be completed on 
time or faster, with high performance the organization will benefit. High performance automatically 
makes employees feel happy at work so that employees are less likely to move to another place, high 
performance can reduce the number of accidents because employees who have high performance tend to 
work carefully and thoroughly so that they work according to existing procedures (Tohardi 2011). 
 
The thing that must be considered by companies is knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing is a 
knowledge sharing activity within an organization. Either among employees or between superiors and 
subordinates. Knowledge sharing is an activity that is not easy to do in an organization. Not all

2943","Satisfaction has a significant effect on Employee Performance. This means that Hypothesis 5 
is accepted. This shows that the job satisfaction felt by employees can improve their 
performance significantly. This is supported by research conducted by Febriyana, (2015) 
which shows that job satisfaction has a significant effect on employee performance. while the 
results of research conducted by Khairiyah & Nur Syaima Annisa (2013) show that job 
satisfaction has a positive influence on employee performance. 
6. The Direct Compensation construct has a significant influence on the Employee Performance 
construct through the Job Satisfaction construct. This can be seen from the t value of 3,541 
with a p-value of 0,000. This value is smaller than t table (1,960) and the p-value is greater 
than 0.05. This result means that direct compensation has a significant influence on employee 
performance mediated by job satisfaction. This means that Hypothesis 6 is accepted. This 
shows that the Direct Compensation applied by the company is able to significantly increase 
employee performance when mediated by Job Satisfaction. 
7. The Work Environment construct has a significant influence on the Employee Performance 
construct through the Job Satisfaction construct. This can be seen from the t value of 3.773 
with a p-value of 0.000. This value is smaller than t table (1,960) and the p-value is greater 
than 0.05. This result means that the work environment has a significant influence on employee 
performance mediated by job satisfaction. This means that Hypothesis 7 is accepted. This 
shows that the work environment in the company can significantly improve employee 
performance if it is mediated by job satisfaction. 
 
5. Conclusions  
Based on the problems that have been formulated, the results of the analysis and hypothesis testing 
that have been carried out in the previous chapter, the following conclusions can be drawn from 
the research conducted: 
1. The results of data processing show that there is a significant influence between the Direct 
Compensation variable on Job Satisfaction with a p-value of 0.000 and a t value of 4,423. 
Based on the results of this data processing, this means that the Direct Compensation 
implemented by the company is good enough because it can significantly increase employee 
job satisfaction. 
2. The results of data processing show that there is no significant influence between the Direct 
Compensation variable on Employee Performance with a p-value of 0.176 and a t value of 
1.336. Based on the results of this data processing, this means that the Direct Compensation 
implemented by the company is not sufficient to significantly boost employee performance. 
3. The results of data processing indicate that there is a significant influence between the Work 
Environment variable on Job Satisfaction with a p-value of 0.000 and a t value of 6,566. Based 
on the results of data processing, this means that the work environment in the company is good 
enough because it can significantly increase employee job satisfaction. 
4. The results of data processing show that there is no significant influence between the Work 
Environment variable on Employee Performance with a p-value of 0.644 and a t value of 0.463. 
Based on the results of data processing, this means that the existing work environment is not 
capable enough to significantly boost employee performance. 
5. The results of data processing show that there is a significant influence between Job 
Satisfaction and Employee Performance with a p-value of 0.000 and a t value of 4.588. Based 
on the results of this data processing, this means that the job satisfaction felt by employees will 
be able to encourage them to significantly improve their performance.

1. Introduction 
Looking from every angle of social glasses, it can be seen that every human being has many needs that 
he wants to be fulfilled. Everyone's needs are different. With the desire to fulfill needs, humans try to achieve 
the desired needs in various ways, one of which is by working, both working alone and with others. When 
humans work, they will get a reward that can later be used to meet their needs. If every human need can be met 
then a prosperous life can be obtained by themselves.  
A work relationship is a relation that occurs between employers and workers after a work agreement is 
made (Lalu Husni, 2003). In the pattern of work relations between employers and employees, it is necessary to 
have interconnectedness and good relations to achieve prosperity. Djumadi (2004) states that the labor factor is 
one of the factors that determines the running of an activity. Welfare in the company, especially for employees 
needs to be built to achieve the planned objectives. Employee loyalty to the company is very important and also 
the role of employers in employees is an important factor in the pattern of welfare. In the context of employment 
relations between employers and workers, must contain the conditions of work that supports the achievement of 
a welfare. Through the terms of work, it is then regulated regarding the rights and obligations of each party, both 
workers and employers, to create a pattern of work relations within a harmonious Industrial Relations 
framework. 
Efforts to guarantee the welfare of workers in the context of industrial relations is to provide full 
protection both at work relations, working hours, wages and social security. Although the roles and 
responsibilities regarding the issue of fulfilling wages and social security are considered not only the obligations 
of employers, but the government has an important role in determining the components or the minimum amount 
of fair wages and the implementation of a comprehensive social security system that can be accessed by workers. 
The problem or problem in the current industrial relations context is the frequent termination of employment 
(FLE) without clarity on employees or workers. According to Zainal Asikin (2008), In everyday life termination 
of work interaction between workers & employers is commonly known as layoffs or termination of employment 
relations, which can happen because it has been agreed or promised before & can also occur due to disputes

stipulated in a work agreement, company regulations, or collective work agreement; 
e. Employees build unions or members or become administrators doing activities outside working 
hours can also work hours with the knowledge of the company in accordance with the 
provisions governing. 
f. 
The employee complains the business owner to the authorities regarding criminal actions 
committed by the business owner. 
g. Having differences in pamaama, political flow, ethnicity, color, class, sex, physical condition, 
or marital status; 
h. Employees experience permanent disability caused by work accident or because of illness that 
has a work relationship according to a letter from a doctor that cannot be known. 
The reason for the dismissal was found to be contained in a legal defect, in the sense that there was 
something wrong with the letter of dismissal from the business owner, including: 
a. 
Not mentioned because of dismissal. 
b. 
Because dismissal impressed by finding fault. 
c. 
If the dismissal tends to be more burdensome than the dismissal of the owner of the business or 
contrary to the applicable rules, it will not have a good reason. 
The implementation of layoffs has to do with income security for employees or workers who have lost 
their jobs. At the same time, rules must be made that relieve layoff procedures by taking into account the 
interests of both parties accompanied by givingstep the solution correctly and in accordance with the value of 
Pancasila. Thus there remains a good working relationship between employers and workers. Workers / laborers 
are entitled to protection from possible layoffs, the exercise of rights in the form of certainty over the types of 
actions that can result in layoffs or severance due to being laid off. Life needs require humans to work, with 
this perspective the shadow of layoffs will disrupt work productivity. A worker will be able to increase work 
productivity if guaranteed in security and protection at work.  
 
5. Conclusions 
Psychologically layoffs are a serious threat to workers in doing work. The significance of layoffs is also 
used as a reason for employers in matters that can support investment, that layoffs can cause regional instability 
and social sanity. 
Article 1 Paragraph 25 of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 13 Year 2003 concerning 
Manpower explains that the definition of termination of employment is the termination of the rights and 
obligations of employees with work owners for certain reasons of the company. In the case of layoffs, the 
company is required or required to provide compensation in the form of severance pay or rewards during work 
for workers or employees. The right of reimbursement is regulated according to article 156 number 4 of the Law 
of the Republic of Indonesia Number 13 of 2003 concerning Labor in the Civil Code The provisions regarding 
labor obligations are stipulated in Articles 1603, 1603 a, 1603 b, and 1603 c of the Civil Code. 
Legally, Article 6 of Law Number 13 Year 2003 regulates the legal protection of workers. The rules 
regarding the prohibition of layoffs are regulated in Article 153 paragraph 1 of the Law of the Republic of 
Indonesia Number 13 of 2013 concerning Labor. Workers / laborers are entitled to protection from possible 
layoffs that occur.

Abstract   
 
Surgical patient safety is a global issue that is currently widely reported patient demands for medical 
errors that occur in patients. The nurse is an important part in carrying out surgical patient safety 
because as part of the team in the surgical room. The purpose of this research is to analyze the 
application of surgical patient safety in hospital. The research design used was an analytic correlation 
with the cross sectional approach with the sample of nurses of Surgical Room of RS ""X"" and ""Y"" in 
City ""A"" as many as 48 people with total sampling technique. Data were collected using 
questionnaire and observation checklist and then data were analyzed using Spearman Rho. There was 
a significant positive correlation between age, education level, work experience, knowledge, attitude, 
work culture and motivation with the application of surgical patient safety by the nurse. While the

1. Introduction 
 
Surgical patient safety is the most important global issue right now, it is now widely reported the patient's 
demands for medical errors that occur in patients. Nurses have an crucial role in the implementation of patient 
safety. The performance of nurses has contributed to the implementation of quality nursing care so as to develop 
a patient safety culture in the hospital (Moody, Pesut, & Harrington, 2006). Nurses have a duty in socializing 
patient safety in patient care environment. Patient safety becomes an important role in providing effective and 
quality nursing services (Armellino, Quinn Griffin, & Fitzpatrick, 2010).  
 
Patient safety is a matter of great concern in the hospital because it is able to provide quality services including 
risk assessment, identification and management of issues related to patient risk, incident reporting and analysis, 
incident and follow-up learning abilities and implementation of solutions to minimize risks and prevent injury 
caused by errors resulting from an action or not taking action that should be taken (WHO, 2008). In the patient's 
safety there is a term of patient's safety incident, here in after called incident, any unintentional incident and

people nau do and cooperate optimally implement something that has been planned to achieve goals that 
have been set (Azwar, 2011). This implies that the operating room nurse has both external and internal 
motivation when performing its work. Motivation owned by nurses will have an effect on the productivity 
of their work.  
High motivation can change a person to do his job well so that will also apply surgical patient safety. 
Nurses who have high  resilienc and high work motivation will tend to overcome various problems in life, it 
encourages someone to do his work without the burden and without stress (Nuari, 2017). Based on other 
studies found that patient safety is related to nursing workload. This is evidenced by the less nurses 
workload, the better the application of patientt safety (Magalhaes, Dall’Agnol, & Marck, 2013).  The 
quality of the nursing practice environment is also associated with patient safety. The better the quality of 
nurse work environment and nurse leadership in a hospital has a close relationship with the implementation 
of patient safety so as to reduce burnout (Spence Laschinger & Leiter, 2006).  Patient safety climate in the 
hospital is in need of commitment from hospital managers and team nurses in implementing patient safety 
in hospital work environment (Hughes, Chang, & Mark, 2009). Patient safety is very important in indicator 
nursing accreditation level. Nurses should always improve competency, professional capabilities, 
knowledge and skills in implementing patient safety. This requires the support of health services managers 
to realize a good patient safety level (Teng et al., 2012). 
 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
Based on the research, there is a significant positive correlation between age, education level, work 
experience, knowledge, attitude, work culture and motivation with surgical patient safety implementation 
by nurses. While the gender has no correlation with surgical patient safety by the nurse. Implementation of 
surgical patient safety in addition to individual factors there is several other factors that play a role such as 
leadership, infrastructure and environment. Therefore, its application needs to be improved with the 
formulation of special policies on documenting surgical patient safety to improve the quality of service.

Abstract 
 
Statistical analysis and survey were conducted for this study. Recent data from the CDC shows that there 
is a significant disproportion between cases and deaths for minorities due to COVID-19. A statistical 
analysis was conducted on the trends of cases and deaths for minorities compared to white Americans. 
These statistics were found on the CDC’s website and were attained by research. The CDC claims American 
Indians, African Americans, and Hispanics are four times more likely to be hospitalized and almost three 
more times likely to die due to COVID than white Americans. After learning this information, a survey was 
conducted on how much people viewed different causes (such as poverty and racism) attributed to this 
disproportion. Those surveyed were asked to rate on a scale of one to five (one being least likely and five 
being extremely likely), how much they believed the causes given were the actual cause. The results were 
surprising. For most causes mentioned, 60-70% responded it was highly likely to be an actual cause. When 
it came to racism, on the other hand, only 30% believed racism to be a likely cause. With racism and social 
justice being prevalent in the media right now, one would think that others would say racism to be the cause 
of a disproportion of cases and deaths for minorities. Furthermore, on the CDC’s website, it is stated that 
racism is the leading cause of a disproportion between minorities but this thought was not reflected in the 
survey.

Abstract 
Finding the appropriate balance for Engineer-to-Order (ETO) prefabrication firms between work in process (WIP), 
finished goods inventory, buffer hedging, transportation time and the field installation consumption rate is difficult to 
determine. The difficulty arises due to the high degree of variability in the product offerings to meet the architectural 
and performance requirements of different projects and locations where the products will be delivered and installed. 
Variability also exists in plant production rates, on-site equipment availability, and efficiency of on-site installation 
crew. This paper examines these challenges of ETO panel fabricators and evaluates potential applicable solutions.  In 
addition to the analysis for a single firm, a survey of firms performing similar work spread across the continental US 
was conducted to gauge their respective solutions to similar problems. The majority of the respondents plan to 
commence fabrication in advance of field operations and half of the respondents have experienced situations where 
they had to slow or halt production of the panel products due to storage constraints.

1. Introduction
Substantial research and publications have addressed the productivity trend in the construction industry and its failure 
for appreciable improvement for decades. Industry stakeholders continue to be frustrated with expanding construction 
schedules and increased project costs. Construction is a capital intensive and, payment terms vary throughout the tiers 
of contracting and supply chain. All stakeholders in a construction project want to minimize carry costs while 
completing projects, however, carry costs for some firms are more substantial.  
Industrialized Construction (IC) and Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) are evolving applications of 
manufacturing methodology and lean practices to improve the productivity and final project outcomes in the 
construction industry. This is achieved through the decoupling of sub-assembly operations from the traditional 
construction site and fabricating these building components at facilities located off-site. An accepted overarching term 
utilized throughout the construction industry is prefabrication. To meet this demand the majority of prefabrication 
companies deliver their products in an Engineer-to-Order (ETO) model.  
Precast concrete has been available to building owners for decades as an exterior cladding option for their facilities. 
Unitized glazing systems have offered building owners an exterior system that can be preassembled on or offsite and 
installed as large units on the façade, improving overall productivity. Other prefabricated exterior systems, such as the 
panel systems fabricated by the ETO companies examined by this research, are multi-layered high-energy 
performance cladding systems that aggregate multiple building materials to create the panels. Panel products generally 
are assembled with a structural frame made of cold-formed metal studs, glass mat sheathing, a liquid applied air 
barrier, some form of insulation and varying finishes such as metal panel, cement siding or EIFS.   
Whether it be precast, unitized glazing or prefabricated exterior panels, these units are large and take up substantial 
space while being staged at either an offsite facility or onsite. Depending on the jobsite or the prefabrication facility

In addition to the estimated yearly fixed cost of the purchase price over the period exceeding that of the rental option 
it does not provide the flexibility to reduce the commitments if there is a slowdown in demand. The survey of other 
ETOs when specifically asked about if they owned the trailers necessary to fulfill their transportation needs versus 
other lease/rent options all responded that they either lease or use rental options. These findings validate that leasing 
and rental options are the most desirable structure for trailer needs of ETO panelizes.  
 
4.2 Proposed Improvements  
4.2.1 Based on Survey Results 
Of the surveyed firms, all of the respondents want to have a large portion of the project complete or underway prior 
to the installation activities commence. The large dimensions of the panel products and the buffer hedge most of the 
ETOs plan to have complete, results in storage capacity issues. The ETOs need to evaluate, when establishing their 
operation, a location that can accommodate the volume of finished goods inventory on hand. This is also a 
consideration when the business grows. With all respondents storing their finished panels outside and on trailers, a 
location that can house dozens of trailers is necessary. ETO’s should consider a secure storage lot in a location that is 
advantageous to their projected project locations and ample supply of trailers.  
 
4.2.2 Recommendations from Centroid Method Results for Offsite Storage Facility 
As a result of the survey, respondents indicate that storage of finished goods (panels) is a problem that can result in 
them slowing or stopping their production line to address the problem. The result of the Centroid analysis determined 
a location for an offsite staging yard to be located in or near Sturgis, MI. The resultant location is approximately 90 
minutes from the factory. Evaluation of Sturgis as a community for a staging yard does not seem to be ideal due to its 
distance from major freeways. A location that is closer to a major east-west and north-south freeways would allow the 
ETO more efficient distribution of finished panels. 
 
The Centroid method calculation was based on the previous 24-month period and does not consider future project 
locations. A forward-looking analysis based on revenue projections along with weighted probabilities would allow for 
evaluation of the solution location’s longevity.  
 
4.2.3 Fleet Management from Trailer Purchase vs. Rent Analysis 
The monthly installment cost to purchase a trailer of $637 compared to an average rental rate of $690 does not account 
for the general maintenance or yearly certification costs. Maintenance items such as tires, breaks and bushings can be 
expensive to repair with some of the parts being proprietary to the OEM. Notwithstanding the estimated yearly costs 
of purchase exceeding rental, the ETO should strongly consider the rental option of the trailers over purchasing even 
though they may have less control on trailer availability. They can minimize this risk through multiple vendors with 
rental fleets and do thorough projections of their project needs more than six months in advance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results of the survey confirmed that ETO panel fabricators all believe that they must commence fabrication and 
have a large portion of the project in finished goods inventory prior the installation process starting. The majority of 
the panel fabricators store their finished goods inventory on trailers at their facility. Half of the respondents stated they 
have had to slow or stop their production line because of storage constraints of finished goods inventories. This finding 
is substantial and undoubtedly shows that there is a cost impact for the forced shutdown or slow down to not run out 
of space. The findings stress the need for an ETO panel fabricator to develop a plan or method for address storage 
related issues of finished goods inventory such as an off-site storage facility while being mindful of the costs associated 
with trailer usage and availability.  
 
The detailed investigation of a Michigan-based ETO panel fabricator’s preceding projects utilizing the Centroid 
Method to determine a location for off-site storage resulted in a reasonable determination. ETO panel fabricators can 
3408","Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

utilize this method to identify geographic areas to search out temporary, or even permanent, staging facilities for their 
finished goods inventory. If there is not consistency in the general locations where they ship finished goods, an off-
site location may not prove to be beneficial for an extended period of time. It may be advisable to plan for ample 
storage capacity when determining the location of the fabrication facility.  
 
All of the respondents to the survey utilize trailers for storage of finished goods inventory of panels. While the costs 
of ownership compared to lease on a monthly incremental basis may appear close, maintenance costs are often borne 
by the lessor. In this arrangement the ETO panel fabricator can better estimate their costs in a forward-looking manner 
through a lease arrangement versus a purchase scenario. Additionally, most ETO panel fabricators do not have in-
house maintenance staff qualified to complete the necessary maintenance on the trailers. If the ETO panel fabricator 
services a large geography, some of the contract carriers may provide their own trailers for deliveries outside of 150 
miles.   
 
5.1 Limitations 
Of the 235 trailer trips utilized in the analysis, 208 went to destinations within Michigan. The disproportionate quantity 
of trailer trips in Michigan did offset the long-haul trips to other states that resulted in a calculated storage facility in 
Michigan.  Shipping costs were assumed to be equal and the calculation did not take into consideration oversized load 
definitions or costs associated with special permits that vary from state to state. Trailer pricing analysis was based on 
interest and lease rates as of November 2020. The cost of trailer ownership does not factor in depreciation value that 
companies may look to maximize as part of their decision process.  
 
5.2 Future Research  
Additional research should be conducted eliminating some of the furthest locations in the previous 24-month period 
if the investigated ETO believes there is a small probability of future projects in those areas. Future research should 
focus on developing a forward-looking tool for ETO’s to project both trailer needs, and location of offsite staging 
facilities based on revenue projections or backlog. Additionally, further study on techniques to improve productivity 
for the ETO panel fabricators could alleviate some of the storage capacity if their throughput was greater.

Abstract 
The industrial revolution especially in the IR4.0 era have driven many states of the art technologies to be introduced. 
The automotive industry as well as many other key industries have also been greatly influenced. The rapid 
development of automotive industries in Europe have created wide industry gap between European Union (EU) and 
developing countries such as in South East Asia (SEA). Indulging this situation, FH JOANNEUM, Austria together 
with European partners from FH Aachen, Germany and Politecnico di Torino, Italy are taking initiative to close down 
the gap utilizing the Erasmus+ United Capacity Building in Higher Education grant from EU. A consortium was 
founded to engage with automotive technology transfer using the European framework to Malaysian, Indonesian and 
Thailand Higher Education Institutions (HEI) as well as automotive industries in respective countries. This could be 
achieved by establishing Engineering Knowledge Transfer Unit (EKTU) in respective SEA institutions guided by the 
industry partners in their respective countries. This EKTU could offer updated, innovative and high-quality training 
courses to increase graduate’s employability in higher education institutions and strengthen relations between HEI and 
the wider economic and social environment by addressing University-industry cooperation which is the regional 
priority for Asia. It is expected that, the Capacity Building Initiative would improve the quality of higher education and 
enhancing its relevance for the labor market and society in the SEA partners. The outcome of this project would greatly 
benefit the partners in strong and complementary partnership targeting the automotive industry and enhanced larger 
scale international cooperation between the European and SEA partners. It would also prepare the SEA HEI in 
sustainable partnership with Automotive industry in the region as a mean of income generation in the future.",,,african 2020

Abstract 
 
Waste management and practices is a pervasive world problem. This is mainly due to the continuous rise in 
urbanization which comes along with a rise in waste generation. Even though proper waste management has a vital 
role to play in the ecological environment by greening through the recovery of energy from waste, its management is 
a menace.  
Reports in Ghana indicate that about 5 million tons of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is generated annually and about 
60% is organic. Out of this, the non-recyclable components constitutes about 20%, which indicates that 80% can be 
recovered and recycled, technically. Further, about 25% of the organic waste received at the material recovery and 
compost facility remains as compost for use in agricultural and other purposes. 
Considering the population of Ghana pegged at 30 million in 2019, and daily solid waste production of about 0.45 kg 
per person (Amoah, 2006). Proper management and greening of MSW is very much essential with increasing demand 
of energy and that is what this paper seeks to tackle. 
This paper mainly emphases on analyzing and classifying (segregating) solid waste using Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN) to productively process solid waste materials to enhance the separation process of converting waste 
to energy. Also, the potentials and prospects of organic waste to energy is exploited to reveal the technologies, socio-

5.0 Conclusion and Recommendation  
 
In this paper, an emphases on segregation of solid waste, right at the point where it is generated using convolutional 
neural networks due to its ability of minimal pre-processing time to enhance the waste separation process of converting 
waste to energy is conducted. Results indicate that, the waste segregation systems developed has the ability to 
efficiently separate waste with an accuracy rate of 98%. In order to attain a good detection, a total number of 611 
images including some repeated images of the waste material all four category considered were sampled. This was 
compiled to achieve an extensive dataset of about 2,444 images in total. The dataset comprised of images augmented 
into different angles to increase diversity to suit real time testing conditions. On the other hand, the prospects and 
barriers of waste to energy researched on, indicated that socio-economic gains, jobs, tourism, technological 
advancements, environmental cleanliness and reduction of communicable diseases are the prospects of generating 
energy from waste plants in Ghana. Also, insufficient Infrastructure, lack of technical education on modern approach 
and methods of proper waste management, improper implementation of policies and politics are the challenges of 
waste to energy generation in Ghana.

Abstract 
This study is determined to analyse the effectiveness of working capital on the Siola MSME Central in Surabaya. 
This research uses the effectiveness ratio to assess the minimum cash balance, gross working capital turnover, 
accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover. The method used was a qualitative descriptive approach by 
using quantitative data. This research was conducted on the Siola MSME Central in Surabaya which was built by the 
local government. The path analysis results show that the working capital on the Siola MSME Central is relatively 
less effective, with the minimum cash balance is on average of 0.32 times, the average gross working capital 
turnover is 0.20 times, the average accounts receivable turnover is 0.65 times while the inventory turnover is 1.85 
times in each period of its cycle. The results of this study also indicate that the working capital management ability 
of each MSME business proprietor determines the effectiveness of the working capital itself.

1. Introduction  
 
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, abbreviated as MSMEs or Small Medium Enterprise (SME), is type of 
businesses that is very developed and plays an important role for the Indonesian economy. MSMEs have provided 
many contributions for the economic joints. The MSMEs have the ability to reduce the unemployment number by 
absorbing a huge number of unskilful labour forces.  Therefore, MSMEs are an important part of building the 
economy of a country or region, as well as in Indonesia. MSMEs are subjected as one of the priorities on the 
development agenda in Indonesia. For MSMEs, every business activity will have impacts on the ability to fulfill 
short-term obligations (liquidity) and the company's ability to earn profits (profitability), therefore working capital 
must be managed and considered properly. There are many benefits from the availability of sufficient working 
capital, however there are also issues regarding its disadvantages. 
Working capital is basically a continuous amount that must be available to support the business of a company 
that splits between expenses in obtaining materials or services, and the time of receipt of sales, or expenditures that 
are not fixed assets. With an increase in sales, the company's assets will also develop, even though some of these 
assets fluctuate seasonally. Management of working capital in MSMEs is an activity that refers to the arrangement 
of all current assets and current liabilities. Management of working capital at MSMEs is said to be effective if the 
available working capital is able to cover expenses of daily operational activities and other interests to reach the 
level of company profits.

1. Minimum cash balance If you look at the average Siola SMEs Center industry, the minimum cash turnover 
in January is 0.45 times where the lowest cash turnover is SMEs Mamak Moet with minimum cash balance 
turnover of 0.33 times and the most effective minimum cash balance turnover is SMEs Restu that is, 0.58 
times cash rotates per period. In February it also decreased to 0.44 times cash revolved each period, in 
March it also decreased to 0.43, in April it was 0.14 times cash rotated per period. Boasting the following 
May, the minimum cash balance becomes ineffective because the minimum cash turnover becomes 0.03 
times the rotating cash of each SMEs operation in one period is said to be ineffective because it is under the 
minimum cash turnover effectiveness standard of 10%. In the following June, the Siola SME Center 
Industry average increased again to 0.43 times and was on the effective line. 
2. The average gross working capital turnover of the Siola SME Center industry in January was 0.28 times 
while entering February and March it fell to 0.27 times and in April it fell to 0.08 times becoming 
ineffective, entering May is increasingly ineffective because working capital turnover can only be rotating 
0.02 times. The cause of this ineffectiveness is the occurrence of a pandemic or health epidemic called 
COVID-19. However, when entering June, the turnover of working capital again increased to 0.26 times. It 
can be said that Rp. 1,- for working capital can generate sales of as much as Rp. 0.2.-. This indicates a lack 
of existing working capital management. While the standard according to Kasmir is 6 times, it can be said 
that the working capital turnover ratio is not effective because it is below the standard. 
3. Accounts receivable turnover using accounts receivable turnover ratio in January averaged 0.99 times 
receivable turnover, while in February it decreased to 0.77 times and rose again in March to 0.87. However, 
in May there was a significant decrease to 0.04 times and again in June to 0.97 from credit sales, so that the 
average collection of accounts receivable for 46 days. Meanwhile, according to Kasmir, the standard 
effective inventory rotation ratio is 15 times. A low accounts receivable turnover means that the working 
capital is bound to take longer. It can be said that accounts receivable turnover is less effective because it is 
below standard. 
4. The average supply turnover in January was 3.54 times, in February it decreased to 2.84 times and in 
March it continued to decline to 2.69 times, in April it also decreased to 0.68 times, even in February the 
inventory turnover was 0.08, but again improved in June to 1.26 times. This shows that the funds held in 
stock decrease each period. According to Kasmir the standard effective inventory ratio is 20 times. It can be 
said that the supply turnover of Siola MSME Centre is ineffective because it is below the standard. The 
lower the existing inventory turnover, the higher the working capital required. Conversely, the higher the 
inventory turnover, the lower the working capital required.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of working capital effectiveness analysis, several conclusions can be drawn that are useful 
to answer the problem formulation and research objectives that have been previously stated. 
The effectiveness of Gross Working Capital Turnover by using the Activity Ratio is less effective, with a value 
that includes Gross Working Capital Turnover from January to July decreasing every month with an average value 
of Rp. 0.20 meaning that each Rp 1 working capital can generate sales amounting to Rp 0.20. This shows the lack of 
existing working capital management. Inventory also likewise has an average value of 1.85 times indicating that the 
funds held in the spinning inventory can reach 1.85 times per turnover period. Accounts receivable turnover shows 
ineffectiveness with the average value of accounts receivable turnover which is 0.65 times, meanwhile according to

2998","Kasmir the standard effective receivable turnover ratio is 15 times. Low accounts receivable turnover means longer 
working capital. It can be said that the instrument turnover was not effective because it was below the standard. 
Based on the results of the discussion and conclusions above, the researcher suggests that the Siola UMKM 
Center in Surabaya should be even more effective in utilizing existing resources or assets so that companies can use 
capital to increase sales. In each sales transaction, the researcher also recommends that each MSME business 
proprietor be able to make a simple report regarding the cash flow in and out of the existing cash balance so that he 
can find out how much minimum cash balance each MSME actor has.

Abstract 
 
For more than a decade, Southeast Asia has been a growth market for consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) 
manufacturers. Countries that are members of the ASEAN-5 group are countries with the best economic growth in 
Southeast Asia, thus they are expected to represent Southeast Asia accurately. The purpose of this study is to 
analyze the effect of Currrent Ratio, Return On Investment, Asset Growth, and Good Corporate Governance on 
Dividend Payout Ratio. The population in this study are 227 consumer goods companies in ASEAN-5. Using 
purposive sampling technique, 18 companies were selected. The data in this study is secondary data obtained 
through documentation technique. The analytical technique used is Multiple Regression Analysis tested with SPSS. 
The results showed that Current Ratio has no effect on Dividend Payout Ratio. Return On Investment and Good 
Corporate Governance have a significant positive effect on Dividend Payout Ratio. However, Asset Growth has a 
significant negative effect on the Dividend Payout Ratio. Meanwhile the results of the research simultaneously 
showed a significant positive effect of Currrent Ratio, Return On Investment, Asset Growth, and Good Corporate 
Governance on the Dividend Payout Ratio.

I. Introduction 
 
For more than a decade, Southeast Asia has been a growth market for consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) 
manufacturers. Based on McKinsey Global Consumer Sentiment Survey 2017 Total grocery sales in Southeast Asia 
have more than doubled since 2006, reaching $290 billion in 2017.  Over that period, modern grocery formats (such 
as supermarkets and hypermarkets) have certainly captured market share—but their gain has been a mere six 
percentage points. Today, modern grocery still accounts for only 23 percent of the grocery market in Southeast 
Asia.2 By contrast, in Japan and South Korea, modern grocers generate approximately 80 percent of total grocery 
sales. 
Countries that are members of the ASEAN-5 group are countries that have the best economic growth in 
Southeast Asia. The selection of ASEAN-5 countries as sample objects in this study is expected to represent 
Southeast Asia accurately with better economic growth than other countries in the Southeast Asian region.  
The largest economy in Southeast Asia is Indonesia. In Indonesia, the consumer goods company is one of the 
large-scale companies. For investors, consumer goods company is one of the companies with promising prospects. 
In early 2018, the average stock index of the consumer goods sector recorded a correction of 13.77% as of Friday

3011","The result of the coefficient of determination (R2) showed the value of Adjusted R Square of 0.372 or 37.2%. This 
means that the projected dividend distribution rate with the DPR can be explained by the independent variables (CR, 
ROI, AG, and GCG) of 37.2% while the remaining 62.8% is influenced by other variables not examined. 
 
4) F Test (Simulltaneous) 
Simultaneous test or F test is used to determine the effect of the independent variables CR, ROI, AG, and 
GCG simultaneously (simultaneously) on the dependent variable DPR. The results of the f test in this study can be 
seen in table 6.

negative effect on the Dividend Payout Ratio. 
The partial test results on the GCG variable (X4), the regression coefficient of 1.128 (positive), with t count 
(2.523) and significance (, 033) when compared with t table (1.676), mean tcount > ttable and significance < (0.05) 
assuming other variables are considered constant, it can be concluded that Good Corporate Governance has a 
significant positive effect on the Dividend Payout Ratio. 
5.  Conclusion 
This study aims to prove the influence of Current Ratio, Return On Investment, Asset Growth, and Good 
Corporate Governance on Dividend Payout Ratio of consumer goods companies in Southeast Asia 2017-2019, based

3017","The partial test results show that Current Ratio (X1) has no effect on the Dividend Payout Ratio (Y). This 
means that the high Current Ratio will not be followed by an increase in the Dividend Payout Ratio in consumer 
goods companies. 
The partial test results show that the Return On Investment (X2) has a significant positive effect on the 
Dividend Payout Ratio (Y). This means that a high Return On Investment will be followed by an increase in the 
Dividend Payout Ratio for consumer goods companies. 
The partial test results show that Asset Growth (X3) has a significant negative effect on the Dividend Payout 
Ratio (Y). This means that the high Asset Growth will not be followed by an increase in the Dividend Payout Ratio 
in consumer goods companies. 
The partial test results show that Good Corporate Governance (X3) has a significant positive effect on the 
Dividend Payout Ratio (Y). This means that high Good Corporate Governance will be followed by an increase in the 
Dividend Payout Ratio in consumer goods companies. 
Sugesstion that can be proposed in this study are: Dividends distributed by growing companies are a signal to 
investors that the company can still generate profits in the face of uncertain global economic conditions. The 
company fully understands the character of their investors thus management will pay more attention to aspects that 
will increase the company's value, such as the stock price. For investors who want a stable dividend distribution, it is 
advisable to invest in big companies that have large assets, because this will affect the distribution of dividends. 
This research was conducted by looking at the Dividends Payout Ratio as a proxy for dividend policy for 
consumer goods companies. The results found that of the three variables only had significant effect. Further research 
is expected to be able to do more specific searches that have not been able to be explained in this study because of 
the limitations of the study. Future studies can examine the condition of the dividend distribution ratio when there is 
a stock repurchase and stock split with the addition of a more recent research period.

Abstract 
 
Undergraduate engineering education methodology has remained largely unchanged at universities for many decades, 
if not centuries. Apart from computer technology, not much has changed for at least the last century. The sudden 
appearance of COVID-19 forced all tertiary institutions across the world to drastically change the way they present 
courses to their students almost overnight. Due to the highly infectious nature of the pandemic, it was evident that 
courses needed to be delivered online. While study programmes such as some business and social sciences 
programmes were very successful in transitioning to an online delivery mode, engineering and other science-based 
programmes encountered additional challenges, both in terms of delivery as well as the way assessments are 
conducted. 
 
Keywords 
Engineering, Online Education, COVID-19. 
 
1. Introduction 
The online delivery of engineering courses in an online environment posed significant challenges to teaching staff at 
many, if not most universities worldwide. However, many universities in developed countries may have had a more 
manageable task at hand for several reasons: 
• 
stable high-speed internet is available nationwide, 
• 
most, if not all students own a computer device (laptops, desktops and tablets), 
• 
students have easier and controlled access to university laboratories due to better transport infrastructure, i.e., 
students would find it easier to return to the university in small numbers to attend laboratory sessions, 
• 
many universities are already in possession of virtual laboratory software where students can run an 
experiment in a virtual environment without having to return to campus, 
• 
a plurality of universities and colleges nationwide makes it much easier to organise laboratory or test sessions 
for interstate students at a university or college in their own state during lockdown,   
• 
university IT departments provide invigilator software for assessments given to students to do at home.  
 
This paper describes the experience switching from face-to-face to online lecturing at the Namibia University of 
Science and Technology (NUST) during this COVID-19 impacted academic year of 2020. Being a typical university 
on the African continent without most of the indicated amenities, staff at the Faculty of Engineering at NUST had to 
invent methods to address shortcomings at this institution while still providing quality education to students during 
this period.

3047","Lacking sophisticated software to monitor students during online assessments, Faculty staff have developed ingenious 
solutions which have reduced cheating during assessments significantly, albeit not completely. The technique works 
as follows: 
• 
The assessment questionnaire, which resides on the university’s online teaching platform, Moodle, is opened 
to all students at the time on which the assessment commences. 
• 
Students complete the assessment on physical paper in their own handwriting of which a specimen is kept by 
the management of the Faculty. 
• 
The assessment is designed to consume the entire allocated time with little chance that any student will 
complete it before the end of the allocated time. To ensure a fair assignment or examination question paper, 
the latter questions are discarded up to the point where the top 25% of students were able to get to within the 
allocated time. The marks are then recalculated accordingly. 
• 
Students are trained beforehand to use a smartphone scanner app such as TurboScan or CamScanner, to 
convert their assessment answer scripts to a single PDF file small enough to be emailed, i.e., smaller than 12 
MB. The size of the file is governed by the quality setting of the scanner software. 
• 
At the end of assessment time, students have 5 minutes to scan their assessment scripts and email it from 
their official university student email account to the lecturer. 
• 
The assessment script includes a mandatory standard heading with the course name and code, the student 
name and student number and the assessment date. 
 
Following this strategy, significant success has been achieved and the typical normal distribution of student 
performance was once again achieved. 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
The appearance of COVID-19 has forced all universities to venture into online teaching. Many universities, and in 
Africa, one could probably say most universities, had no prior experience with online remote teaching. As a result, 
these universities had to rethink their teaching and lecturing delivery style quite substantially. 
 
Numerous problems faced African universities in general during this time, however, the delivery of courses and the 
fair and proper assessment of students remained large obstacles. This paper aims to provide some approaches that may 
be taken to overcome some of these obstacles without having to spend large sums of money. It is concluded that it is 
indeed possible to provide quality education and teach and assess engineering students without spending large sums 
of money. 
 
The authors want to recognise our colleagues within the Faculty who have contributed to making a success of online 
teaching during this COVID-19 transition period.

Abstract  
 
This study focus on enhancing the Iraqi diesel fuel with palm kernel biodiesel. Palm kernel biodiesel was prepared by 
transesterification process using methanol and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as catalyst. The performance evaluation and 
emissions of inline four cylinders, four strokes, direct injection diesel engine. The engine operated with palm kernel 
biodiesel (100% biodiesel) and its blends with diesel fuel for the ratios (20% palm kernel biodiesel with 80% diesel) and 
(50% palm kernel biodiesel with 50% diesel) and compared with pure diesel fuel (100% diesel).The tests carried out at 
constant speed of (1500 rpm) with variable loads (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25). The results show reduction in BSFC when using 
B20 and B50 blend ratio. The maximum reduction was at B20 by about (8.28%) compared to diesel fuel. The same blend 
gives higher thermal efficiency by about (12.11%). The increasing biodiesel blend ratio led to reduce the exhaust gas 
emissions for CO2, and SO2 were (47.51%), and (97.20%) respectively. However, NOx emissions showed at B100 
increased by 7.10% with the increasing of biodiesel blend ratio.

1. Introduction 
The growth and development of a nation is heavily dependent on energy. From cars to cell phones, from health to 
pleasure, from air condition to heating, from exploring space to communication, energy plays an important role in 
our lives. Post industrial revolution, new technologies have been developed to help make life easier and better. 
Energy has played a great role in helping us perform various activities like farming, computing, manufacturing, 
construction, and health and social services. Each of the 7 billion people on this planet use energy to make their lives 
richer, more productive, healthier and safer. There are many energy players tapping into this market with an 
objective of bridging the gap between demand and supply. With the standard of living of people increasing and our 
lives becoming increasingly dependent on energy, it is estimated that we will see about a 35% increase in energy 
consumption over the next 5 years until 2019 (Exxon Mobile 2014 ) . 
 
Biodiesel is increasingly gaining importance and interests as an alternative fuel for diesel. It is made from vegetable 
oils or animal fats through a chemical process called transesterification. This involves a chemical reaction with 
methanol using sodium or potassium hydroxide as a catalyst ( Mendow et al. 2012 ),( Lam et al. 2010),( Demirbas 
2008). 
 
There has been a tremendous amount of research done around the world to find a way to decrease the harmful 
emissions produced by engines using both Diesel and gasoline. Most of these are associated with the fuel oil 
properties and the local climatic and geographical conditions ( Rao and Gopalkrishnan 1991). The fuel injection, 
combustion and atomization characteristics of vegetable oils are very different than those of diesel fuel. The high 
viscosity of vegetable oils interferes with the injection process in the engine resulting in poor and improper 
atomization. Poor and improper mixing of fuel oils with air in the engine leads to improper combustion, lower 
power output and high emissions often leading to deposit formations in the combustion chamber, piston head and 
injectors. The combination of high viscosity associated with vegetable oils and their low viscosity causes poor cold 
stat of the engine and misfires. Over a long period of operations, vegetable oils start gumming, chocking of injectors 
and valve sticking which can result in engine breakdowns ( Srivastava and Prasad 2000),( Haldar et al. 2009 ). In

6. Conclusions 
This paper prepared biodiesel from palm kernel oil for diesel engine as alternative fuel without any engine 
modifications. The reduction in brake specific fuel consumption for biodiesel blends about (8.28%) for blend B20 and 
(2.88%) for blend B50, but increased at B100 by about (16.18%) compared with biodiesel. The thermal efficiency of 
blend B20 is higher than diesel by about (12.11%) followed by B50 by about (11.18%), but in B100 thermal efficiency is 
reduced by about (1.83%). There is significant reduction of exhaust gas emissions in (CO2 and SO2) with the increasing of 
all biodiesel percentages as compared to the diesel fuel. Maximum reduction of these gasses emissions was found at B100 
by (47.51%), and (97.20%) respectively. The NOx emission shows slight increase with the increasing of biodiesel blend 
ratio. The maximum increasing found at B100 by about (7.10%). The results show the possibility of the use of palm 
kernel biodiesel blends with diesel fuel which improves engine performance by reduces the amount of brake specific fuel 
consumption and reduces the amount of toxic emissions. The palm kernel biodiesel considered environmentally friendly 
fuel and improve the impact on human health and the environment.

Abstract 
This research paper presented the detailed and broader picture of one major lean tool i.e. Value Stream Mapping 
(VSM) in terms of its implementation in manufacturing industries. This narrative research is based on the review of 
previous studies. Literature review is summarized, discussed and presented in tables. Since, the waste has been the 
severe problem in industries due to its association with cost; thus it has been the focus of academicians and 
practitioners to study and implement such waste elimination philosophy. Since, lean manufacturing is an effective 
waste elimination technique and its tools have captured the immense attention of academicians and practitioners. 
Therefore, there is an extreme need to conduct such studies about the usefulness and drawbacks of the 
implementation of lean tools. In future, other lean tools can be discussed in depth to put clearer and broader picture 
and to draw more comprehensive conclusion. Moreover, existing studies lack to investigate the implementation in 
various sectors. Studies related to VSM are significantly important in development of lean knowledge due to 
individual sectors have major differences in their processes. In this regard, present review is conducted so as to put 
the open and broader picture of Value Stream Mapping (VSM) comprehensively.

1. Introduction 
Currently around the globe, companies based on manufacturing require to keep their production level sustainable as 
per customer demand. When they appears any capacity related problem, instantly they look ahead to increment in 
number of shifts, increases overtimes and purchase new equipment or machines(NALLUSAMY et al., 2018). 
During manufacturing process, the machines plays a pivotal role to keep the production smooth in other case 
production can confront several inhibits(Nurprihatin et al., 2019). On the other hand, the focus should remain on 
harnessing better resources and surging in performance of the machines that already exists which could pursue in 
reducing bottlenecks, improvising performance of equipment, curb overall downtime, turn operator performance 
efficient and reduce setup time and other loses, hence enabling in any decision on the investment of purchase of new 
machines (NALLUSAMY et al., 2018). In order to stay competitive and confront market pressures, companies 
requires to bring efficiency and productivity. Since very long, several companies are utilizing lean manufacturing 
systems pursuing Toyota model to curb wastage in-process and expand their added value (Lugert et al., 2018). Lean 
manufacturing has resulted in recent time as a resilient substitute that, if adopted at balance level by various actor

Abstract 
This research paper presented the applications of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in production systems. This narrative 
research is based on the review of previous studies. Literature review is summarized, discussed and presented in 
tables. Since, the quality improvement & defects reduction have been the severe problem in industries due to its 
association with cost; thus it has been the focus of academicians and practitioners to study and implement such 
quality improvement & defects reduction philosophy. Since, lean manufacturing is an effective waste elimination 
technique and its tools have captured the immense attention of academicians and practitioners for quality 
improvement & defects reduction. Therefore, there is an extreme need to conduct such studies about the usefulness 
and drawbacks of the implementation of lean tools. In future, other lean tools can be discussed in depth to put 
clearer and broader picture and to draw more comprehensive conclusion. Moreover, existing studies lack to 
investigate the implementation in various sectors. Studies related to LSS are significantly important in development 
of lean knowledge due to individual sectors have major differences in their processes. In this regard, present review 
is conducted so as to put the open and broader picture of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) comprehensively.

During manufacturing process, the machines plays a pivotal role to keep the production smooth in other case 
production can confront several inhibits(Nurprihatin et al., 2019). On the other hand, the focus should remain on 
harnessing better resources and surging in performance of the machines that already exists which could pursue in 
reducing bottlenecks, improvising performance of equipment, curb overall downtime, turn operator performance 
efficient and reduce setup time and other loses, hence enabling in any decision on the investment of purchase of new 
machines (NALLUSAMY et al., 2018). In order to stay competitive and confront market pressures, companies 
requires to bring efficiency and productivity. Since very long, several companies are utilizing lean manufacturing 
systems pursuing Toyota model to curb wastage in-process and expand their added value(Lugert et al., 2018). Lean 
manufacturing has resulted in recent time as a resilient substitute that, if adopted at balance level by various actor 
through supply chain, deduce satisfactory results in making significant profits (Romero & Arce, 2017). Toyota in the 
1940-50s developed it, since then, lean has proven to be one of the significant managerial paradigms in business

Abstract 
 
The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global issue to its quick and widespread over 
the world, including in Indonesia. More than 60% of positive cases came from Java island, therefore the proposed 
model focused on six provinces in this area. We developed a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model, such as Spatial-
SIRD model, associated with the mobility of people by public transportation (air and land). Model parameters were 
estimated by fitting the data of October 22nd – 28th, 2020 and November 8th-November 14th, 2020 with the model. 
At the beginning of the estimation process, we used the coefficient of regression from the observation to estimate the 
range of parameters. Afterward, the order statistics method was carried out to determine the best parameters so we 
could forecast the number of infectious of each province. The SIR model was created by applying the regression rate

Figure 6. Prediction and parameter estimation of Spatial-SIR model for the infected cases of the six provinces after 
long weekend data. 
 
The prediction’s results based on data during this period show that the behavior of many infected cases in West Java 
will continue to rise until 2022 if current conditions are maintained. In Central Java and Banten provinces, the outbreak 
is hitting in the first and second quartiles of 2021. This is because of the contact rate in these provinces is the highest 
at more than 10%. 
 
The comparison of parameter estimation before and after the holiday is shown in Table 3. After the long holiday, the 
changes in population behavior were seen to be very significant in Central Java Province. All parameters were greater 
than before holiday, except the death rate. This has led to an explosion of cases (Figure 6c) so that conditions of 
mobility and interaction in this province need to be limited.

4. Conclusion 
 
This model aims to obtain an overview of the condition of each province in the case of Covid-19 desease spread in 
the future. One of the factors that can influence the condition of the case is the long vacation which causes an increase 
in the intensity of population mobilization and interaction. This could obstruct the government efforts to break the 
chain of COVID-19 spreading. Through this simulation, a comparison of the parameters before and after the long 
weekend on October 28th - November 1st, 2020 is obtained. The result of the simulation - with 𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1000, n = 10 
repetitions, and the distribution of the parameters depicted in Table 2 - shows that there has been a  society behavior 
change during these two periods. The average of percentage error of the estimation results of the two periods is only 
0.3% difference. Therefore, the resampling method in the Spatial-SIR model is sufficient to provide the desired 
description.

Abstract 
 
The Verhulst logistic function is among the most popular function to describe a growth phenomenon. 
Initially the theory is applied in studying the growth of living organism populations. However now it finds 
the applications in any growth phenomenon, including social, education, and engineering. There is a huge 
number of applications of the logistic function in various field. One of the strength of the model is its 
capability in estimating the carrying capacity or the maximum level of the growth. This upper bound   is 
very important to obtain and has many practical implication. However, in some circumstances the function 
may fail to estimate this upper bound, especially when the growth is still at the beginning phase.  In 
pedagogical context of mathematical modeling this failure is regarded as a good example in explaining the 
modeling process, in which when a model fails to comply with the reality, one should proceed to refine the 
model following the full cycle of modeling process.  In this paper we present a modified growth model of 
the Verhulst logistic function, since when it is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic data in Indonesia, it 
cannot estimate the carrying capacity satisfactory. The modification has improved the estimation 
performance in terms of the root of the mean square error measure (RMSE).

1. Introduction 
Teaching mathematical modeling is not only transfering the knowlegde of modeling concepts to students, but also 
should provide real experiences and full involvement in developing a reasonably good and realistic model. The system 
that is being modeled and the problem that is being addressed should also seen as a familiar system and problem. The 
appearence of COVID-19 as a pandemic can be seen as a good example. In this paper we will present a mathematical 
model that can be used as a good example in teaching how to refine a model to produce a better model according to 
Meyer (1984) criteria. Acccording to Meyer, a model can be called a good model if it has reasonably good in terms 
of  accuracy, descriptive realism, precision, robustness, generality, and fruitfulness. The fulfillment to those criteria 
might be partially (it is not necessarilly to fulfill all the seven criteria). To give a feeling to the problem in COVID-19 
pandemic, in the following we give a brief review of the disease transmission background.

capacity Kα  and produces curve that satisfactorily fits the data (compared to that in Figure 4.a). However if we look 
at the result for the daily new cases, the model shows that at this date the disease should also have already reached 
the carrying capacity K, which is in fact untrue (b).  
  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
We modeled the pandemic data of Indonesia (the total/cumulative confirmed cases data) from the Worldometer 
website (Worldometer 2020) using two growth functions: the original logistic function and the modified logistic 
function. The results show that the logistic function fails to estimate the carrying capacity K of the total confirmed 
cases data. The model shows that, in terms of total confirmed cases pandemic data of Indonesia, at this date the disease 
should have already reached the carrying capacity K, which is in fact untrue. The inaccuracy becomes apparent when 
we plot the daily new cases which clearly depart form the observed data. Meanwhile, the results also show that the 
modified logistic equation is able to estimate the carrying capacity Kα of the total confirmed cases and produces curve 
that satisfactorily fits the data. However if we look at the result for the daily new cases, the model also shows that at 
this date the disease should have already reached the carrying capacity Kα, which is also untrue. This concludes that 
while the modified logistic model is able to mimic the total confirmed cases data, it still fails to fit the daily new cases 
data. Further refinement of the model still need to be done. This is currently under investigation. There is some reasons 
why the logistic growth model does not fit for COVID-19 data. One of them is when it is applied too early in which 
the disease still in the exponential growth phase, such as in the case of Indonesia COVID-19 data

Abstract 
 
With no vaccine available on the market, handling the COVID-19 pandemic is still a difficult problem to do. 
Preventive actions, such as wearing masks, distance guarding, frequent hand washing, and others are still the most 
important interventions in handling the transmission of this disease. Apart from disease transmission, the mortality 
rate is also an issue that has been widely studied in order to reduce its intensity. So far several countries have allowed 
the use of convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) in the management of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. 
Although this method is a fairly old method and is often used for other diseases, so far there have not been many 
studies on the impact of using CPT for COVID-19 on the population level. Several early studies of this use have 
yielded prospective results with reduced mortality rates. In this paper, we show by using a simple discrete 
mathematical model, that the uses of CPT for COVID-19 patients can also reduce the outbreak, in the sense of reducing 
the peak number of active cases and the length of the outbreak itself. The model used is the simplest discrete SIR and 
SEIR models. The completion of the model is done numerically through simulation on a spreadsheet to obtain general 
insight regarding the effect of the CPT application in COVID-19 management. 
 
Keywords 
Pandemic COVID-19, SIR, SEIR, Discrete Equations, Convalescent Plasma Transfusion. 
 
1. Introduction 
COVID-19 pandemic was officially announced less than a year ago by the WHO. The disease has been declared as a 
Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. However, disastrous impact to almost all 
aspects of human life becomes apparent from time to time. It is a very dangerous new disease in terms of health impact, 
economy, and other human aspects. COVID-19 so far is still regarded as a disease that difficult to understand, let 
alone to control, due to several reasons such as lack of data and confusing report  (Caudill, 2020). This is among the 
reasons why so far most infected countries still struggling combating the disease. This disease is caused by the Corona 
SARS-2 virus and is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China. At that time, more than 118,000 cases were recorded 
in 114 countries with 4,291 people losing their lives (WHO, 2020). To see the widespread of the disease, we note that 
as of April 11, 2020, the figure has increased dramatically with a total number of more than 1.5 million cases of 
infection and more than one hundred fatalities and at the end of July 2020, there were 16,839,692 recorded positive 
cases of infection with 661,379 deaths, and even currently those number have reached to more than  65 million and 
one and a half  million, respectivelly (Worldometer, 2020).

4. Conclusion 
We have presented a simple discrete time version of SIR and SEIR epidemic models with the effect of the convalescent 
plasma transfusion (CPT). The models revealed both the SIR and SEIR models predict that the use of CPT is indeed 
prospective in reducing the number infection. In this case it could decreases the peak of the outbreak as well as the 
length of the epidemic period. With the progress on the clinical investigation of the use of CPT in COVID-19, related 
data may soon available and further refinement and parameterization of the model should be done to obtain prudent 
insight of the model prediction.

Abstract 
 
This paper deals with a two-dimensional maintenance service contract (MSC) characterized by time and usage limits. 
We consider that an agent offers the two dimensional MSC and promises a high availability of the equipment. The 
subsequent preventive maintenance (PM) actions are carried out to ensure the availability target. The optimal non-
periodic PM policy is obtained to maximize the availability. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the 
subsequent PM intervals meeting the availability target. 
 
Keywords 
Maintenance service contract; Two-dimensional; Availability; Imperfect preventive maintenance. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In many companies, maintenance activities are considered as non-core business activities, and hence outsourced to an 
external agent. The other reason to outsource the maintenance activities is that the facilities to do the maintenance 
activities require a large capital investment and it is not economical to carry out in house. As the demand of 
maintenance services tends to increase rapidly in the last two decades, agents respond proactively with offering various 
MSC (maintenance service contract) to meet a variety requirement of the companies. A MSC defines   maintenance 
(PM and/or CM) actions covered, period agreed and the payment to be made by the owner of the equipment to the 
service provider. Jack and Murthy (2017) provide a comprehensive review of MSCs studied in the literature. The 
MSCs can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) MSCs.

Conclusions 
In this paper we study 2-D MSC that ensuring availability using a sequential  imperfect PM. The algorithm 
is proposed to obtain the best value of decision variable, 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 and its corresponding availability (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖). Numerical 
results show that the proposed model is better for the case of moderate to severe conditions. The algorithm 
developed does not give the optimal solution – it is only the suboptimal solution, and hence the optimal method 
based the dynamic programming formulation is a challenging further research topic. Also, one needs to consider 
the total cost of maintenance as well as the availability to find the best PM policy, and this is another interesting 
topic for further research.

Abstract   
  
This study utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process, one of the most inclusive systems which are considered to make 
decisions with multiple criteria. This paper analyzes the prioritization of DOST programs and projects for endorsement 
to the Public Investment Program (PIP) of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).

Analytic Hierarchy Process, Public Investment Program  
  
1. Introduction  
The NEDA is the authorized body to spearhead the necessary activities for the formulation or preparation of 
development planning and investment programming reports and other documents. This includes the Public Investment 
Program (PIP) reports which contain the proposed and ongoing priority programs and projects (PAPs) that are 
responsive to the outcomes and outputs reflected in the Results Matrices (RM) of the 2017-2022 Philippine 
Development Plan (PDP). NEDA then consolidates, processes, and endorses the PAPs to the Department of Budget 
and Management (DBM) to which will be utilized for the preparations of the annual National Government (NG) 
budget. Following the said responsibility of NEDA, every year, they release a timetable of activities and submissions 
needed for the budget preparation process. Each agency or office is required to submit a rolling list of priority PAPs 
which contributes to meeting the PDP targets and achieving RM outcomes.    
  
The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is the premier science and technology body in the country 
charged with the twin mandate through Executive Order No. 128 of providing central direction, leadership and 
coordination of all scientific and technological activities, and of formulating policies, programs and projects to support 
national development. It is composed of three (3) sectoral planning councils, seven (7) research, and development 
institutes, six (6) science and technology (S&T) service institutes, two (2) collegial bodies, and 16 regional offices.

Figure 13 shows the priority given to DOST PAPs in terms of their typology for infrastructure as based on actual data 
from endorsed projects and results from the AHP Model. Like the results shown in Figure 12, actual data from 
endorsed projects shows that all infrastructures dedicated to capital investments. Similar results as in Figure 12 are 
also generated, in which according to the AHP Model, a quarter of the PAPs that are for government facilities should 
be given priority.    
  
3.1. Discussion  
Respondents of this survey are from the three divisions of the Planning and Evaluation Service (PES). Out of ten 
involved personnel of PES, eight answered the survey. PES provides services relating to policy development and 
planning, program coordination and monitoring, and S&T resource assessment and evaluation matters.    
   
As of this study, the DOST Central Office endorses all proposals submitted by the DOST system as long each PAP 
contains all requirements/documents needed by NEDA-PIP.    
   
In this study, the researchers focused on the 1,203 PAPs submitted by the DOST system - DOST-OSEC (central office 
and 16 regional offices) and 18 attached DOST agencies in October 2019. Its findings may have been seen in the light 
of limitations on the control of data. The researchers were not able to get data on the approved prioritized PAPs from 
NEDA, this may be due to the current situation nationwide, the pandemic CoViD-19.    
   
The AHP allows the researchers to classify the most important factors influencing the project or program priorities.  
Based on these findings, the three main factors for Investment are Innovation Stimulated, technology adoption, and 
STI Human Resource Development respectively. For Infrastructure programs or projects, STI Human Resource 
Development, disaster risk and climate change resilience, and Innovation stimulated respectively. The weights of each 
sub-criteria shown in Tables 3 and 5   
   
Because of the use of AHP in the analysis of the project and program prioritization, this type of study is strongly 
related to its context and the results vary from one country to another and even from one institution to another.   
   
The designed AHP model has good consistency ratios but the Actual Data is very far from the ideal AHP model as 
seen in the results of the conducted data analysis.   
   
The reason amid the gap between the actual data and ideal AHP model shown in Figures 8 to 13 is because most 
DOST attached agencies are very focused on Innovation and they have no priority weighing tool resulting in neglection 
of the other priority areas.  
  
4. Conclusion  
The researchers utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process, one of the most inclusive systems and considered to make 
decisions with multiple criteria. This paper analyzes the prioritization of DOST programs and projects for endorsement 
to the Public Investment Program (PIP) of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). Innovation 
stimulated investments as the top priority for both results. However, it is halved in the AHP Model, giving more 
opportunity to other investments such as investments focusing on developing a critical mass of globally competitive 
STI human resources   
   
Priority percentage for infrastructures for ensuring resilience to disaster risk and climate change and promotion and 
acceleration of technology adoption increased.   
   
The developed AHP model was created to have fair, balanced and efficient prioritization of projects and programs   
   
Innovation Stimulated, STI human resource development, and Disaster Risks and Climate Change Resiliency 
respectively should be considered as top priorities by the DOST

Abstract 
 
This study aims at describing the teaching English Teaching Techniques and media used in Indonesian Islamic 
Junior High Schools. The research is a descriptive qualitative study. The data was collected by using some 
instruments, namely observation sheets, documentation, field notes, and interview guide with the English teacher as 
well as students of eighth grades. The findings that the English teacher used warm up, setting, organizational, 
content explanation, role play demonstration, checking, question answer display, translation, dictation, copying, 
identification, recognition, review and testing, which are included in controlled techniques. Then, information 
transfer, information exchange, wrap up and preparation in semi-controlled techniques. Next, role play, interview 
and discussion were included in free techniques. Meanwhile, teaching media that were used by the English teacher 
were pictures about unique house and white board, which was included in visual and projected media. Next, 
textbook and English dictionary for printed media; then, role play as games media. The interviews with the students 
reveals that the teaching techniques and teaching media that were used by the English teacher were very interesting 
and suitable with the material in the textbook. Moreover, the interaction between the teacher and the students in the 
classroom was very attractive during the English lesson. 
 
Keywords: English Teaching Techniques, Media, Islamic Junior High School  
 
1. Introduction 
 
A good interaction between teacher and students within a classroom cannot be separated from teacher’s role. Many 
of English teachers in schools usually have their roles in teaching English as a foreign language. According to 
Brown (2007), the teacher has the chance to play many roles in the teaching process, such as being parents for the 
children, then the teacher can not only be satisfied by only playing a role. It proves that the teacher is free to choose 
the kind of roles that they want to be in the classroom. Moreover, Harmer (2001, p.73) conveys that the teacher who 
is teaching in the classroom has several roles according to the activities at that time such as being a controller, 
organizer, prompter, participant, resource, tutor, observer, assessor, and so on. Based on this theory, the teacher can 
play the roles or switch from a role to another role depending on activities in the classroom.

3148","5.2 Theoretical Implications 
 
The teaching techniques were also appropriate to use with the material that were given by the English teacher, and 
they were also successfully conducted because, based on the observations, documentation, field note and interview, 
the students can pay attention to the English teacher and actively participate in the classroom 
 
5.3 Limitations of the study 
 
Another conclusion is about the teaching media that was used by the English teacher in teaching English lesson for 
the eighth-grade students. The researcher explained in discussion of the previous chapter that the various teaching 
media that were used by the English teacher are pictures of the unique house and white board as a visual and 
projected media, text book and dictionary as printed media, then role play as games media. Those are included 
within traditional media. The teaching media that were used by the English teacher in teaching eighth graders were 
really exciting. The media can engage the students to enjoy the class and be conducive during the English lesson. 
Moreover, the teaching media is appropriate for the material within the textbook because the English teacher used 
the teaching media as the representative of the material that will be delivered by the English teacher at the end of the 
lesson. 
 
5.4 Future Research 
 
There are also several weaknesses of this study, such as the plenty amount of the students in the classroom because, 
for a class, there are approximately thirty students within classroom. But on the contrary, as stated by the English 
teacher, normal English class only consists of up to ten to fifteen students in the classroom. Another weakness is 
how the students would disturb other students to make noise and chaos in the classroom after finishing their 
assignments. It would be better if the students who already finished their assignment to go back, sit down and keep 
silent until end of the class.

Singapore and Malaysia. Although same in ordinary offense principle, implementation property laws in Indonesia 
covers broadcast, showing off, circulate, or sell creation or copyright infringement product to the public. In 
Malaysia, illustration of copyright infringement is wider. It is content sales, leasehold, propose to sell or rent, have 
for other than oneself, distribute, showing off, import to Malaysia or produce pirated  video compact disk or digital 
video disk. In Singapore, copyright infringement in VCD and DVD means sales, leasehold, offer, distribute and 
showing off pirated goods. The result of the research showed implementation intellectual property laws in Indonesia 
far for expectations with the result that not give deterrent effect for perpetrator. This is due two things specifically

1. Introduction 
Relation Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) between humans and other countries cannot be denied. IPRs are 
given and inherent in industrial community or the other community to be leads to it. Existence always follows 
community development dynamic.  So as with Indonesia people did not want intersect and involved with IPRs 
problem.  
IPRs divided in two categories that is Copyright and Industry Property Rights. While Industry Property Right 
covers patent, trademark, industry design, integrated circuit layout design, trade secret, and varieties of plants

3158","Yap Hau who was charged with pirated VCDs as many as 23,131 pieces of pirated VCDs from thirteen stores 
were sentenced to five months with ten months probation.  
Public relations of the Batam District Court, Ahmad Bondan said penalty applies if the person commits a 
criminal offense on probation. If the defendant made a mistake, whatever it was, like hitting a person or a similar 
type, then the punishment penalty for the month of confinement would apply to him. 
On the contrary, if the defendant did not commit any unlawful act in the probationary period, then the five-
month sentence of imprisonment will not apply to him. Other than that, Yap Hau was not charged as a pirated VCDs 
producer, but a seller. 
Bondan explained that the indictment submitted in the trial was adjusted with the official report of the 
examination from the police. It was no mention of evidence in the form of production machinery. 
Besides the evidence, a public prosecutor also present four witness, including producers Naga Suara Sakti 
Company, two assistant VCDs store belonging Yap Hau and one police who took part in the raid. From here 
revealed the reporting party objection with Yap Hau act than traded pirated VCDs KerisPatih band, which they are 
the producers. Other testimony mentions, pirated VCDs in Yap Hau store has, was purchased from from Zoom 2000 
belonging fugitive Aseng, not produced by one self.  
2) Case of Copyright Infringement in Malaysia 
For infringement has 1,480 pieces of pirated vcd belonging to the company Siti Norhaliza Production (M) 
SdnBhd, Datuk Soh Chun Seng (52) and his brother Soh Choon Meng (46) and Siew Mee Er (44), a minimum fined 
RM2,000 every pieces if proven guilty.  
Besides pirated VCDs evidence, police secured multiplier machine, but they did not plead guilty against 
accusations of having three units of multipliers of stampers that used make pirated VCDs. The mistake was indicted 
on the same date, time and place. 
For the second mistake, they violate seksyen 41 (1) (g) and seksyen 41 (1) (ii) copyright law 1987 with threat 
of punishment minimum fined RM4,000 every pieces and maximum fined RM40,000 every pieces. 
3) Case of Copyright Infringement in Singapore 
Teng YockPoh and Teng Kem Hong which seller and trader 40 (forty) cinematographic result entitled ‘’The 
Duke of Mount Deer, that copyright belonging Television Broadcast Limited (TVB) be avowed breaking the 
Copyright (amendment) Bill on February 19th, 1998 and imposed a fine of each person $20,000.  
 
3.4. Context Setting Copyright Act in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia 
About the perpetrators of copyright infringement, regulations in Singapore most detailed set if compared with 
Indonesia or Malaysia.  
About live recordings performance are copyright infringement. There are most detailed in Malaysian 
copyright laws compared to the rules in Singapore and Indonesia. 
About the authorities' authority. Among the three legislation, Malaysia copyright act No 332, 1987 explain in 
detail actions that are permitted by the police to investigate alleged copyright infringement cases. Details on the 
authority of the authority in Indonesian regulations, following the previous regulation on criminal procedural law.  
Arrangement about Copyright Council. Arrangement in Malaysia and Indonesia are more detail in the 
respective laws. While in Indonesia, this detailed arrangement through government regulations. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Although copyright laws are subject to change and revision several times and lastly in 2002, implementation 
in the field is still far from expectations, so it has not provided a deterrent effect for the perpetrators of crime. This is 
caused by two things namely the substance of criminal or civil sanctions of copyright regulations and low 
knowledge of the authority about copyright. 
Substantially, criminal and civil penalties, the copyright law state the longest penalty for criminal sanctions 
and at most for civil sanctions. Although substantially these sanctions are the same as copyright laws in Singapore 
and Malaysia, but the authorities of both countries are more proactive and coordinative in cracking down on 
copyright infringement. The proofwas from the result of a heavier copyright infringement judgment, when compared 
to the judgment of courts in Indonesia, especially in Batam. The lack of knowledge and coordination of the authority 
in Indonesiais not to be optimal in the role of civilian government investigator who assisted the police in 
investigating VCDs and pirated DVDs. 
Although the same adhering to the usual offense, but the contextual violations in the field of copyright in 
Indonesia include broadcasting, displaying, distributing, or selling to the public a creation or product of infringement 
of copyright or related rights. In Malaysia a broader breakdown of offenses which includes sales, leases, offers for

pirated VCDs or DVDs. While in Singapore, the definition of piracy in the field of VCDs and DVDs is selling,

Abstract 
Food safety is the right of each person, with no exception of students who are in growth, and their body has 
vunerable immunity to diseases. One of the causes of those diseases is consuming pattern of buying snacks 
recklessly and become students' habit, and the serving of the snacks make it easy for food having a contact with 
microba as one of the causes of various diseases. Besides that, school snacks as products dominated by home 
industry, are assumed to have risk for health, this is caused by unhealthy food condition, the use of unclean tools for 
producing food, unhealthy producer, food contminated by bacteria, to the use of raw material and additives, and 
other dangerous substances that affect the quality and safety of the food that should be avoided to be consumed. 
That social reality becomes the attention in the study that is meant to review and study the implementation of 
regulation policy of school snacks safety in Cirebon. The approach method used in this study is normative juridical--
-empirical, it means that law as Applied Law Research, which is legal study about law/regulation implementation 
vertically and horizontally related to food safety regulation, and In Action, law is in every legal event occured in 
society. Legal tool about food safety management as the base of policy making and to prevent school snacks 
unsafety substantially is enough, but in Cirebon technical regulation in the form of regional regulation on school 
snacks management has not been made yet, and on its application level, there is obstacle such as legal awareness and 
legal obidience of society to legal norm implementation. 
Keywords: Food Safety; Legal Norms; Cirebon 
1. Introduction 
In principle, food safety is a condition of food fulfilment for state to individual, whether its number or 
quality, safe, vary, nutritious, spread equally, and affordable and not against the religion, beliefs, and society culture 
to live healthy, active, and productive simultanously. Food safety is a right of each person, with no exception of 
students in growth. One of the food resources known and liked by students is snacks. Snacks in school area can be 
from school's canteen or vendors outside the school. School snacks, wherever they are from, must be safe to be 
consumed.  Specifically, food safety management in school canteen should be done directly by community in school 
area such as teachers, students' parents, and students [1]. 
Regulation on food safety covers: food sanitation, food additives, genetic recreation, food package, quality 
insurance and laboratory check and contaminated food. Food safety is needed to prevent food poisoning; one of the 
food sources that caused poisoning is snacks. Article 5 of Government Regulation Number 28 Year 2004 (PP 
No.28/2004) on Food safety, quality and nutrition states that the danger of food contamination covers: biological 
contamination, chemical contamination, and physical contamination. The requirements of food safety consist of: 
food sanitation standard and food raw material standard. Next, in PP No.28/2004 it gives the autority to Food and 
Drugs Asociation (FDA) to do monitoring to the safety, quality and nutrition of food distributed to society.  
One of food priority that become the special concern of FDA is school snacks that included into Society 
Healthy Life Movement (SHLM) issued by Ministry of Health, is a systematic and planned action done together by 
all nation's components with awareness, willingness and ability to do healthy life to improve the quality of life. This 
movement is started from family, because family is the smallest part of society in forming personality. And also the 
habit of consuming school snacks, the habit started from family by making healthy eating and balanced nutrition as a

3165","5. Conclusion 
Cirebon government has not made technical regulation in the form of Regional Regulation on school snacks. 
That regulation is important to make because there are many snacks contain dangerous food additives such as 
rhodamin, formalin, borax that can cause poisoning, diarrhea and cancer on students.  Food package that is not 
suitable with food package regulation and from school canteen hygiene is not enough. That social reality needs legal 
norm that can be used to manage and prevent possibility that endanger student’s health. 
 
6. Suggestion 
1. Cirebon government should be faster in handling circulation of school snacks contained dangerous substance 
and contaminated, so that regional regulation that specifically mange school snacks need to be made;   
2. Cirebon government must made identity card for seller, so if the sellers moved, they still have identity the 
same as seller identity to make Health Department Cirebon and Food and Drugs Association easy in 
monitoring and giving guidance more intensively..

Abstract 
Lesson study was first introduced during the Indonesian Mathematics and Science Education (MIPA). Recently, it 
has been developed in some other courses at UMMU Ternate such as at department of education of primary school 
teacher, department of public health, and especially at English department in Cross-Cultural Understanding course. 
Students’ awareness on local culture, national, domestic, and international first was not too easy to apply in the 
learning process, especially in individual interacting among students and teacher related to the material. To 
overcome these problems, it needs to implement the lesson study that includes 3  stages: 
planning 
(plan), 
implementation (do), and reflection (see). The goal of this lesson study in this course is to enhance students’ cultural 
awareness in-group discussion, improve the quality of teaching and learning, and build the pathways for ongoing 
improvement of instruction. This qualitative research was conducted in 4 cycles with its object was the fifth 
semester students consisting of 25 people. After reflection (see), the results found that students were actively 
participated and though insightfully to explore the ideas about the culture of what they met in their daily life through 
group discussion. Besides, teachers’ pathways in instruction had changed from being teacher center to be student 
center.

1.  Introduction 
Education seems to lag behind many decades by still aiming exclusively at functionality alone and it thus 
seems to miss the opportunity to enhance the learners’ involvement. It brings the impact to students learning that 
may be caused by instructional practices. Even though many college teachers may reflect in improving their 
practicing, there are view occasions to share with other colleagues about what they discovered about what they 
encountered. In fact, individual teachers are looking closely at the strategies and techniques to improve their 
teaching and their students' achievement in courses. In addition, the deepest desire is needed to experience sustained, 
high-quality professional development in order to improve students learning and teacher instruction. 
After discovering some strategies, teacher professional development efforts are often criticised by educators 
for their lack of continuity and ability to produce effective change in teacher practice and student learning (Loucks-
Horsley, Hewson, Love, & Stiles, 1998 in Rock & Wilson, 2005). Many educational scholars believe that a critical 
component of any educational reform effort should be to provide teachers with opportunities and appropriate support 
structures that encourage the critical work of on-going improvement of pedagogical practice (Darling-Hammond & 
McLaughlin, 1995; Garet, Porter, Desimone, Birman, & Yoon, 2001; Sparks & Hirsh, 1997 in Rock & Wilson, 
2005). To overcome these critical components from educators, one of the best ways is through lesson study practice 
that can improve teaching and learning in higher education. 
Lesson study is an on-going, collaborative, professional development process of teaching improvement 
activity in which instructors jointly develop, teach, observe, analyse and revise lessons for the courses in a single 
class lesson in a form of classroom (Cerbin & Kopp, 2006). Many teachers in Japan, the United States and Canada 
are interested in this process, particularly in light of the TIMSS (Third International Mathematics and Science 
Study) results, which highlighted the advanced performance and deeper thinking in mathematics by Japanese 
students.  
In Indonesia, the essence of lesson study was first introduced by Japan International Cooperation Agency 
(JICA) through the Indonesian Mathematics and Science Teacher Education Project (IMSTEP) (1998-2003).,

3171","connection of daily practice to long term goals, (f) stronger motivation and sense of efficacy, and (g) improved 
quality of available lesson plans (p.115). 
Furthermore, one way to lead the instructional improvement is keep-observing students during the class 
activity. Another interesting reflection found form observer: 
“During discussion session, I observe a student in group 5. He was just pretend to listen his group members 
without saying any word. The solution I would suggest to you as teacher, oppsss, I mean to us as teachers, 
please come closer to students for controlling the their activity. Our closer for them might engage them 
motivate to speak up”.  
 
Findings revealed from the data clearly indicate that the lesson study model can serve as a means of teacher 
professional development with positive impact on teacher instructional practice. Fernandez, 2002; Fernandez and 
Chokshi, 2002; Lewis and Tsuchida, 1998; Stigler and Hiebert, 1999; Yoshida, 1999) have commented that the use 
of “Lesson Study” has become prominent among teachers and educators. Improving teaching and student learning 
has become the focus of teachers’ professional development (in Cheung & Whong, p.137, 2013). 
Improving teaching and student learning through lesson study practice brings one of benefits which is stated 
by other observer, “Another benefit I learned in this study lesson was how to facilitate an effective discussion using 
the model of number head together (NHT) where students answered the questions through confirmation in their 
group members which that questions were delivered by other groups.  
Data from the study indicates that teachers consider themselves and their practice to be more effective as a 
result of participation in the lesson study model. It means that lesson study process engages teachers as learners 
within their own classroom. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
After implemented lesson study as classroom instruction, students’ behaviors that support student 
engagement are likely to contribute to both positive attitudes about the class and to enhanced learning. In particular, 
student perceptions in the lesson immediately, “present,” or significant to the interaction help establish the cultural 
awareness in which students attend to one another, share ideas, more tolerance, trust one another, and collaborate. 
Moreover, the vast majority of students’ awareness was immediately enhanced in their triads, discussing the 
potential focus and clearly appreciating the opportunity to discuss the lesson with their group members. 
This research shows that teacher of CCU was able to engage in the inquiry process of lesson study and 
successfully bring about change in his practice that addressed the individual learning needs of the students. 
In addition, the essential of lesson study has changed the college teachers’ pedagogical thinking and practices 
because it becomes the most effective way to improve teaching would be for teachers to develop further the culture 
of sharing and working together. Its essential is also found as the power of collaboration that focused on the 
classroom and the learning of students. 
Furthermore, there was an overwhelming positive reaction to the opportunities that lesson study was 
providing for many teachers. The positive outcome that it could use to encourage teachers in our community to 
engage in research as there needed to be a tangible outcome for them which they could relate to in terms of their 
own development.  
This research lesson is a continued need for further implementation and future research on the lesson study 
model. Implementing lesson study in Indonesia not as an educational project that is supported from ministry of 
education and culture, but this teaching and learning practice could be continue as the independent practice that 
should be applied in the Principe of Total Quality Management, which is to improve the quality of learners learning 
and teachers teaching (Ahmad & Gay, 2012). Darling-Hammond (2003) confirms repeatedly in her work “creating a 
profession of teaching in which teachers have the opportunity for continual learning is the likeliest way to inspire 
greater achievement for children” (p. 281). A better understanding of how to make this type of professional-

Abstract 
The availability of banking services and payments to the entire population without discrimination is the main 
objective of the policy of financial inclusion. Many financial technology-based innovations are emerging in the 
future to improve financial inclusion. The purpose of this study is to encourage the level of achievement of financial 
inclusion programs through the most effective and transparent financial services. In this study discusses various 
financial technological innovations used to reach rural communities and conceptual models are developed to identify 
the factors that drive financial inclusion. The results of the study developed through literature research identified that 
the level of financial literacy, high cost, technology, trust, income level, distance, and product, is the determining 
factor of financial inclusion in rural areas.

1. Introduction 
In the era of information technology, building a strong foundation and economic independence is essential, 
including the need for an increasingly widespread banking service in serving customers (customers). A strong 
financial system is essential to creating a market-based economy that is productive and competitive. A strong 
financial system, will also support higher levels of investment and boost growth in the economic sector. 
The banking industry has shown remarkable growth and progress in the last few decades. Nevertheless, there 
are concerns that much-needed banking services have not yet reached a broad segment of society, especially the 
poorer segment of society. 
The government has a long history of expanding financial inclusion. In 1975 the Government of Indonesia 
established a BPR for the same purpose. This encourages the expansion of banking roles especially in rural areas. 
The Financial Services Authority (OJK) in the National Literacy and Financial Inclusion Survey (SNLIK) 
conducted in 2016 found that Indonesia's literacy index and financial inclusion increased, compared to similar 
results conducted by OJK in 2013. 
In 2013, the financial literacy index reached 21.84 percent and the financial inclusion index reached 59.74 
percent. While the financial literacy index in 2016 reached 29.66 percent and the financial inclusion index reached 
67.82 percent. 
 In detail, the index of banking literacy increased from 21.80 percent in 2013 to 28.94 percent in 2016. 
Meanwhile, the index of insurance literacy fell from 17.84 percent in 2013 to 15.76 percent in 2016. The pension 
fund's literacy index rose from 7.13 percent in 2013 to 10.91 percent in 2016. 
Meanwhile, the lending index of finance institutions rose from 9.80 percent in 2013 to 13.05 percent in 2016. 
The index of parix literacy rose from 14.85 percent in 2013 to 17.82 percent in 2016. Then the index of capital 
market literacy rose from 3, 79 percent in 2013 to 4.40 percent in 2016. 
Financial inclusion is an important priority in terms of promoting economic growth and economic 
development of society. Through financial inclusion gives opportunity to the poor the opportunity to form savings 
and invest and get credit. 
The weaker part of society is generally ignored by formal financial institutions. There is a complexity facing 
banks in providing financing to the disadvantaged parts of society. This has led to vulnerable and low-income 
groups, remaining outside the most basic opportunities and services provided by the financial sector. 
 To solve the problem of such financial exclusion, it is important to ensure that various financial services are 
available to each individual. If such a priority can be affordable, it is possible to reduce the gap between rich and 
poor.

3182","Education about financial services is very important. The following suggestions should be implemented to 
improve financial inclusion: 
1. The central bank should increase the number of branches of banks in remote areas. 
2. The central bank should often check whether the financial product is actually utilized by the customer 
effectively, otherwise it should analyze the reason. 
3. Banks should focus more on products that are simple, affordable, and must have high utility. 
4. Banks should conduct regular surveys in villages to understand the financial needs of the community. 
5. NGOs and non-profit organizations and other non-governmental organizations may engage more to spread 
financial services to remote areas that are difficult to access. 
6. Banks shall allow customers to provide feedback on product services. 
7. The central bank should allow providers to provide better mobile banking products at affordable prices. 
8. Microfinance / non-banking organizations may be licensed to perform limited financial services in remote 
areas. 
9. Encourage many intermediaries / agents with incentives to facilitate the popularization of financial 
products in remote areas. 
10. Opening a bank account without minimum balance conditions should be allowed in all branches and 
places. Also simplify the procedure of opening a bank account. 
11. Opening of bank branches in remote and rural areas should be liberalized by the Central Bank. 
12. Telecommunications and bank service providers should jointly exercise and implement simple mobile 
banking solutions. 
13. The central bank should enable entrepreneurs to invest in new product innovations in financial 
innovation. 
14. Mobile Banking should be encouraged / incentivized as a smart way to send and save money in rural 
areas. 
 
4. Conclusions and recommendations 
Technological innovation and communication technology support play an important role in supporting the 
development of financial technology necessary to strengthen the role of financial inclusion. Increased financial 
inclusion significantly has a significant correlation and influence on poverty alleviation and reduced income 
inequality. The results of this conclusion provide a framework for stakeholders to strengthen the role of financial 
inclusion in rural communities and low-income communities. 
The suggestion of this research is the need for further research through field research with primary data 
collection to produce more in-depth quantitative research. While the framework in this study can be followed up 
through more in-depth field research.

Abstract 
Regional autonomy is defined as the granting of authority and obligations by the central government to regional 
administrators to regulate and manage government affairs and community interests on their own accord based on the 
aspirations of the community in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The policy of fiscal autonomy and 
decentralization is an answer to the demands of the people who expect a change in all aspects of the life of the 
nation and state, where one of the important aspects of the implementation of regional autonomy that must be 
managed carefully is the problem of regional financial management and regional budgets. To realize broad, real and 
accountable regional autonomy, it is necessary to have regional financial management that is able to control regional 
financial policies economically, efficiently, effectively, transparently and accountably. This research was conducted 
in June 2016 in the Office of Regional Finance and Asset Management Board of North Halmahera Regency 
Government, aiming at analyzing the financial performance of North Halmahera Regency Government for the last 
five years (2009-2014). The research finds that (1) the region’s mean financial performance is unstable; (2) several 
financial ratios still show positive and negative trends; (3) the regional financial independence level has not been 
stable since it still to some extent depends on external sources of fund, particularly from the central government; and 
(4) the performance of North Halmahera Regency Government has not been effective since its effectiveness and 
efficiency rations have not been 1 (one) or 100 percent.

1. Introduction 
The fiscal autonomy and decentralization policies constitute an answer to people’s demand for a change in all 
aspects of life as a nation and a country. The government is expected to give solutions for improving services to the 
people. One of these solutions is to provide the regional government with extensive autonomy, which means to give 
more space for them to manage the resources available to them according to the local people’s need priority (Djalil 
2014: 21).  
 
The consideration that underlie the need to perform regional autonomy is the development of events in both inside 
and outside the country. The condition inside the country indicates that the people long for transparency and 
decentralization. On the other hand, what happens outside the country indicate the increasingly expansive 
globalization which demand each country to improve their competitiveness, in this case this include its regional 
governments (Halim, 2007: 1). This competitiveness of regional government is expected to be achieved through the 
improvement of regional government decentralization. Furthermore, this improved regional government 
decentralization is expected to be reached through regional autonomy. 
 
One of the important aspects in the implementation of regional autonomy which should be carefully regulated is the 
issue of managing regional finance and budget. Purnomo (2009: 2) suggests that to materialize the extensive, real, 
and responsible regional autonomy, a regional financial management capable of controlling the regional financial 
policies in an economic, efficient, effective, transparent, and accountable manner is needed. 
 
The realization for regional expenditure of North Halmahera Regency in 2009 was Rp. 410,383,293,592.00 from 
what had been budgeted at Rp. 454,654,529,651.00, in 2010 its realized regional expenditure was Rp. 
393,216,766,959.29 from what had been budgeted at Rp. 424,509,741,640.34, in 2011 its realized regional 
expenditure was Rp. 502,887,227,889.41 from what had been budgeted at Rp. 559,298,730,795.22, in 2012 its 
realization for regional expenditure was Rp. 550,447,751,224.04 from what had been budgeted at Rp.

3199","As seen in Table 2, the calculation of growth ratio above, it can be seen that North Halmahera Regency 
Government’s financial performance from year to year was fairly low; its average growth was 1.670% which was 
below 100%. In 2009 it was 0.297%, in 2010 it decreased to -4.317%, in 2011 it increased to 4.898%, in 2012 it 
decreased to 4.654%, in 2013 it decreased further to 3.660% and in 2014 it increased to 3.841%. 
 
From the ratio calculation above, it can be seen that the development expenditure to APBD ratio was relatively small 
since the regional government prioritized more its regular expenditure. North Halmahera Regency government 
ought to increase its development expenditure from its APBD as needed by their region. 
 
3.5. Growth Ratio 
Growth ratio measures to what extent the regional government is capable of maintaining and improving the success 
it has achieved from one period to the next. When the growth for each component of expenditure and revenue 
sources, it can be used to evaluate which potentials require attention.  
 
From the calculation of growth ratio above, it can be explained that the growth of Regional Government Budget of 
North Halmahera Regency in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 budget years showed fairly positive growth 
because the absorption of PAD in 2014 was greater, i.e. Rp.115,814,255,742 compared to those of previous years.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Financial ratio analysis is a tool that can be used to assess the performance of local governments in regional 
financial management as outlined in the APBD. Based on the analysis results discussed earlier, the financial 
performance of the North Halmahera district government shows that the average regional financial performance is 
still unstable. The results of calculations in each year still experience fluctuating numbers so that some financial 
ratios still show positive and negative trends. For the ratio of financial independence of the North Halmahera 
regency government up to 2014 shows the level of regional financial independence that has not been stable because 
there is still dependence on funding sources from external parties, especially the central government. Based on the 
results of calculations for the effectiveness and efficiency ratio, it shows that the performance of the North 
Halmahera district government has not been effective because the ratio of effectiveness and efficiency has not 
reached 1 (one) or 100 percent. In the measurement of the activity ratio, it can be seen that most of the funds owned 
by the government after the implementation of the regional autonomy policy are still prioritized for meeting routine 
expenditures, so the ratio of public development spending to APBD is still relatively small.

(MSMEs) of industry sectors in Manokwari. The analytical review is based on operational aspects of AIS (business 
size, business type, firm age, owner’s educational level and accounting knowledge) in managing MSMEs. The data 
of this descriptive study was collected from questionnaires and interviews given to 35 MSMEs. The result shows 
that the majority of MSMEs use accounting information system in its operational activities. Further, based on the 
operational aspects it is shown that medium enterprises, handy craft industry, business that have been operating for 
more than 20 years, owner’s with bachelor degree and owner’s with accounting knowledge use accounting 
information system more intensively. This paper can be used as a material consideration in improving the business 
of MSMEs in Manokwari, particularly in industry sectors.

1. Introduction 
Micro to Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is one of economic activities conducted by most people in Indonesia. Based 
on International Finance Corporation (IFC) MSME Country Indicator data in 2010, Indonesia was among five 
countries in the world that had the highest density of MSMEs (Hermanus, 2016). MSMEs activities cover almost all 
business fields therefore it gives high contribution to generate people’s income, particularly those with low income. 
Therefore, its existence should be supported and encouraged in order to keep MSMEs developing and operating as 
well as to expand business opportunities and employment.  
 
However, MSMEs also face problems such as lack of education and technology, lack of human resources and also 
limited capital investment. Moreover, MSMEs owners often face difficulties in providing financial report of its 
business activities. Thus, potential MSMEs cannot optimally develop. Whereas, financial report can give them 
information in order to help them make economic decisions, evaluate their business development and help them to 
obtain financial assistance from financial institution such as Bank.  
 
In Manokwari West Papua Province, the growth of MSMEs based on data from Department of Industry, Trade and 
Cooperatives has increases by the year. In order to help the development of MSMEs in Manokwari, Bank Indonesia 
as the central bank of Indonesia has been involved in giving Training of Trainers (TOT) related to the use of 
financial recording system or in other words Accounting Information System (AIS) (Rizaldy, 2016). Nowadays, AIS 
is needed in many businesses. Without some adoption or implementation of this advancement in technological 
products it is difficult to gain competitive advantage and survive (Harash et al. 2014).  With the use of AIS, 
management can formulate various decisions in solving problems faced by the company (Fitriyah, 2006). Further, 
AIS help to provide financial data in the form of financial report that gives beneficial information to its users 
(Martani et al. 2012).  
 
Prior studies on the use of AIS by Siyami (2016) shows that majority of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in 
Purworejo does not use AIS in its operational activities. The majority of SMEs owners in Purowrejo in

3.5. The Use of AIS in MSMEs from Owner’s Educational Level Perspective 
The use of AIS in MSMES from owner’s educational level perspective is as follows: 
 
Figure 5. The Use of Accounting Information System in Micro to Medium Enterprises Industry Sectors in 
Manokwari seen from Owner’s Educational Level Perspective 
 
Figure 5 shows that owner’s educational level of bachelor degree has the highest percentage compare to other 
educational level. However, the difference among the four types of educational level is not significant. The use of 
AIS in MSMEs operational activities is not based on the owner’s educational level since in the educational level of 
primary school have also been using 63 percent of AIS in its operational activities.  Only 5 percent lower compare to 
owners with bachelor degree.  
 
3.6. The Use of AIS in MSMEs from Accounting Knowledge Perspective 
Perspective of accounting knowledge is measured using likert scale questionnaires that obtained statements about 
accounting knowledge. In Figure 6, it is shown that as the accounting knowledge increases, the use of AIS in 
MSMEs in its operational activities also increases. This means the use of AIS in MSMEs industry sectors is related 
to the understanding of owner about accounting. The better understanding of MSMEs owners about accounting 
knowledge, the better application of AIS in the company compare to owners with low understanding of accounting 
knowledge.

4. Conclusions 
The result shows that the majority of MSMEs use AIS in its operational activities. Further, based on the operational 
aspects it is shown that medium enterprises, handy craft industry, business that have been operating for more than 20 
years, owner’s with bachelor degree and owner’s with accounting knowledge use accounting information system 
more intensively.  
 
This study was limited to micro to medium enterprises in industry sector in Manokwari and also has high 
subjectivity since it is a descriptive study. Furthermore, this study only analyzes the use of AIS based on the

1. Introduction 
School culture in this essay is interpreted as an assumption pattern, value, belief, tradition and behavior of 
school community and is held together because it is believed can be used to face school problems. Zamroni (2016:8) 
contended that school culture can solve problems in school because culture covers something that is tought, 
possessed and done together in life. And character according to National Education Ministry (2010: 3) is 
“someone’s nature, character, moral, or personality that is formed as the result of internatiation of various virtues 
that is believed and is used a basis to view point, think, behave, and act”, therefore character is someone’s special 
character, and character cannot be separated from sociocultural context because character is formed in particular 
sociocultural society (Wardani, 2008).  
School culture and students’ character have inseparatable and interrelated relationship. The aim is to find out 
school culture phenomena and its influence on students’ character, in terms of personal character, social character, 
and students’ national character. School culture is a society condition that has great influence on students. John 
Locke’s Clean Slate Theory that contended that, students are just like white clear paper and then they will any 
scratch and the scratch can be anything depends on outer element, in this sense teacher (school culture) that will 
determine what character that will be possessed by the students (Sardimana. AM, 2003:12). Bad school culture will 
create chance for the students to have bad character and however, good school culture will make the students have 
creativity, achievement and good character. According to Stephen Stolp (1994), school culture is correlated with 
motivation icrease and students’ learning achievement as well as work satisfaction and teachers’ productivity. 
School culture influence is proven to have great role in the increase of educational upgrade (Zamroni, 2007:60).  
Regulations of Indonesian President, number 87 year 2017 about character education reinforcement, in 
konsederan it is stated that Indonesa as a cultured nation is a country that  uphold good behavior, high values, 
wisdom and character. In order to create country and people who have character, moral, religious character, ethics, 
tolerance, discipline, democtaric and culturally creative, the  government is currently implementing come policies, 
activities and learning development to enhance character education in every school. Indonesian regulation No.20 
Year 2003 about National Education System, Chapter 3, explained the Function and Aim of National Education, 
which is developing students’ ability and students’ nature or character. Students who have good character is hoped 
to be able to create prestigious country civilization. However, character education ideality is not always in line with 
current students’ character reality,

1. Introduction 
Teachers play a strategic role to realize a quality education. Growth and improvement of teachers' ability in 
teaching need to be developed because of that reason,  and therefore teachers need to be given a supervision. 
Supervision is an aid given to teachers to improve their ability in teaching and learning process in the classroom 
(Mantja, 2007). Minister of  Education  Regulation Number 13 of Year 2007 indicated the guidance activities are 
listed dimension of teacher’s competention and supervision. This dimension includes the activity of planning the 
academic supervision program for teachers byusing appropriate approaches and supervision techniques and 
following up on the result of teachers’ academic supervision in order to improve their professionalism. Tyagi (2010) 
emphasized the importance of principals to implement effective learning supervision in accordance with school 
conditions and to encourage teachers’professional development.The principal has many tasks, especially in the field 
of managerial. While school supervisors have a relatively wide area coverage within a supervisory area. A 
supervisor is responsible for about 16 schools, for that collegial supervision as an alternative to the implementation 
of supervision in schools in order to improve teacher quality. Collegial supervision isthe process of providing help to 
teacher and other fellow teachersby working together, giving each other encouragement or guidance in improving 
their competence.Collegial supervision is identified to reducethe obstacles of coachingdue tothe limition of the 
coaches (Mantja, 2007).Teachers do not wait for supervision activities done by school principals and school 
supervisors.Teachers can learn with other teachers,therefore their responsibilityto improvetheir professional 
competenceby learning to improve their abilities (Glickman, 2003). Teacher participation in self-development 
selected resources for feedback and makes decisions increasing year by year. Educators as a profession in the 
development of ability tends to shift from the model of ""inspector"" demodratic, collaborative model. The advantage 
of collegial supervision is that teachers are not afraid to convey the problem to other teachers; active teachers as 
supervisors and supervision; time between teachers is often done both in formal and non formal condition. The 
principal gives teachers the opportunity to help other teachers, so that teacher empowerment is more optimal for

3226","The findings of this study dealing with principal as a manager role provides space, library resources, 
facilities, and schedule of activities. Furthermore, the role of the principal as a school supervisor can facilitate the 
implementation of collegial supervision. The principal provides an example for teachers to carry out supervisory 
activities. Basically the supervision of learning is an effort to provide assistance that focuses on aspects that are 
directly related to the scope of learning activities, at the time students follow the learning process. Glickman (2003) 
suggested that supervision of learning is a series of activities to help teachers develop their ability to achieve 
teaching objectives. Learning supervision does not assess teacher performance in managing learning, but rather 
helps teachers develop their professional capabilities. Although in the process for data collection the principal 
provides a learning resource for teachers. Substitute teacher in class in class if needed can be adjusted schedule with 
time owned by team to cooperate. The principal has the final responsibility of maintaining team responsibilities. In 
addition, the principal also encourages teachers to maintain a climate of collegiality, establishes supervisory 
structures, and integrates programs that enable teachers to develop their professional expertise (Ruck, 2006). Thus 
the findings of this study can enrich the review of school supervision supervision. Besides, the intensity and quantity 
of the supervision implementation can be realized and the teachers get guidance and assistance in developing their 
capability from school principals and school supervisors. Help can also get from fellow teachers who can take place 
at any time according to the time owned by the teacher.  
 
4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
4.1. Conclusions 
1. There are four models of collegial supervision in implementation of  collegial supervision models practiced  by 
teachers at SDN 4 Menteng Palangka Raya Central Kalimantan. They were formal-group models; individual-
formal model, informal-group model and individual-informal model.  
2. The role principals  in the implementation of collegial supervisionas a school manager, plays a role in providing 
space, facilities, library resources, funds, scheduling collegial supervision activities. Except in brainstorming 
activities, the role of headmaster is less visible because it takes place spontaneously and in various places. The 
principal also acts as a leader. appoint teachers to become observers or supervisors and teachers to be supervised. 
The principal gives the teacher the opportunity to help each other improve the quality of learning, set an example 
to supervise teachers, develop mutual care, care and compassion. Emphasize the importance of learning all the 
time through interaction with other teachers. 
 
4.2. Suggestions 
1. Head of Education Office of Palangkaraya City, Central Kalimantan can use the results of this research as input 
to improve the policy of teacher elementary school competence development, through the implementation of 
collegial supervision. Enhancement of supervisors' capacity in developing principals and teachers should be a 
major concern. Especially the implementation of formal-group models and individual-formal models that are 
directly related to improving the quality of learning. 
2. Head of SDN 4 Menteng City of Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan can use the results of this research as an 
alternative of supervision of learning in school. Besides as an input to refine the various models of the 
implementation of collegial supervision, optimize teacher involvement and improve the role of principals in the 
implementation of collegial supervision in schools. 
3. Teachers should follow up on the results of collegial supervision conducted in the four models to be applied in 
the learning so that the quality of learning can be better. Teachers can also use the results of this research as a 
revision of the development of capability in detail so that it can be used as a refinement of supervision for further 
self-development. 
4. Other researchers may use the results of this study as a basis for further research that can still be developed with 
deeper reinforcement and different approaches. Other researchers should: (a). Research further the model of 
collegial supervision by emphasizing: (1) Characteristics of teachers coloring the model,(2) The effectiveness of 
the model in improving the quality of collegial supervision,(3) The existence of an expert in a formal-group 
model,(4) The role of school principals and supervisors in shaping the model of implementation of collegial 
supervision; and (b). Incorporate teacher career path invoices as conditions that color the effectiveness of the

Abstract  
This research was carried out to study and proven ineffective speed bumps are low-down in Port Street. The 
effectiveness can be seen in degrees services indicator (LOS = Level of Service) compared before and after speed 
bumps was set. Analytical relation among variable .i.e  speed vehicles, volume, and street capacity must be obtained 
to break the problem of inefficiency . In Ternate City region speed bumps usually be placed in local 
street/community areas. This phenomenon born in port street, speed bumps who have set in that area absolutely 
disturb the conformity and accessibility,  for the street usage. The outcome of the study declares that : Velocity free 
flow in non area facility Vfree = 29,424 km/H, meanwhile in the street in facility area Vfree = 5,147 km/H. Flow

1. Introduction 
A port according to legal terminology, is something related to the implementation of port functions to support the 
smooth, safe and orderly flow of ship, passenger,  goods traffic, sailing safety and security,  intermodal transfer 
places and to encourage the national economy and regions and while still paying attention to regional spatial 
planning (Deng et al., 2013). The port itself is a place consisting of land and waters with certain boundaries as a 
place for government activities and business activities that are used as a place for ships to dock, boarding and 
unloading passengers,  loading and unloading goods, in the form of terminals and berths equipped with safety and 
security facilities for shipping and port support activities as well as a place for intra-and inter-transportation transfer 
(UU No. 17, 2008).  
 
Ports have roles and functions based on various points of view . A port is a node in the transportation network, as a 
gateway for economic activity, a place for transfer of transportation modes, supporting industrial , trading activities, 
and a place for distribution, production and consolidation of cargo or goods (Liu et al., 2018). Politically, ports play 
a role in realizing Archipelago Insights and state sovereignty. In terms of transportation, ports are part of the total 
transportation chain (transportation system) (Hsu, 2012). The total transportation chain is a series of transport 
transfer processes from the sender to the recipient of the goods involving various points of the transfer process and 
modes of transportation (Monios & Wilmsmeier, 2013).  
 
To carry out the port function, the port itself is a complex system that includes various elements such as port 
authority, warehousing facilities, forwarders, transportation operators, shipping agents, stevedoring, trains, tally 
officers, mooring men, tugboats ), pilots, customs, storage, distribution, cargo handling, container terminals, as well 
as port police (Ekasari, 2017). 
In Indonesia According to Law Number 17 of 2008 concerning Shipping, legally, service businesses that can be 
carried out to support the smooth running of port activities can include several types, especially related to the 
movement of vehicles, namely (Parola et al., 2017 ; Kadir et al., 2017 ; Alises et al., 2014) :

calculated by looking at how far the road is, the factors that determine the direction, the dividing factor of the 
direction, factors of side drag, and factors determining the size of the city. Road capacity (C) itself actually has a 
definition as the definition of the maximum number that can be accommodated on a road section during certain 
conditions. Relation between density velocity variables, and flow with density Next will determine the level of 
service (LOS) for in the first location (no Speed Bump) and second (in the Speed Bump area). 
 
4.1. Service Level (LOS) 
Service Level in First Location (Area Before Speed Bump): 
a. Analysis of service levels in the first location 
Stoping sight distance, SSD  = 0,28Vt + 0,01V2 
= (0,28 x 29,424 x 1) + (0,01 x 29,4242) 
=16,8966 second 
Basic capacity  = (1000 x V) / (L + SSD)= (1000 x 29,424) / (4,055 + 25,1788) 
 
 = 1.006,5061 smp 
            Volume  = 1.172 vehicle/hour 
Volume / Capacity = 1.172 / 1.006,5061 = 1,1 
Value of speed V  
= 29,424 km/hour dan V/C = 1,1  level of service (LOS) F. 
b. Service Level in second Location (Area  Speed Bump): 
Volume = 194 Vehicle/hour 
Volume / Capacity = 194 / 601,7683 = 0,3224 ≈ 0,32 value of speed V = 5,147 km/hour  
and V/C = 0,32 .Level of service (LOS) F. 
 
4.2.  Analysis of Traffic Characteristics and Level of Service (LOS) 
From the results of the analysis of traffic analysis and level of service (LOS) in Jalan Port without the Speed Bump 
and in the Speed Bump area can be seen ie both in the no area (before entering) and there are Speed Bumps waiter 
level (LOS) F. The effect of the Speed Bump makes the driver at close range has reduced speed. Free flow velocity 
in the area there is no Vfree Speed Bump = 29,424 km / h, while in the VFree Speed Bump area = 5,147 km / hour. 
Maximum flow in area no Speed Bump Fmak. = 8.112 vehicles / hour, while in the Speed Bump area Fmak. = 1.157 
vehicles/hour. There was a maximum flow in the Speed Bump area. The results of the above analysis show that the 
change in vehicle speed before Speed Bumps is different from the speed of the vehicle when passing Speed Bumps. 
The decrease in speed that occurs in vehicles is between 0% - 69 %, this shows that the presence of Speed Bumps is 
significantly able to reduce vehicle speed. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
The absence of a standard size of Speed Bumps in the study area causes the decrease in speed between Speed 
Bumps installed by the community and the decrease in speed that can be produced by standard sized Speed Bumps 
(as stated in KM No.3 of 1994 concerning User Control and Safety Equipment. Street). On Port road 
after installing Speed Bump service level (LOS) F, the influence of Speed Bump makes the driver reduce speed, free 
flow velocity in the area no Speed Bump Vfree = 29,424 km / h, while in the free bed police area = 5,147 km / h, the 
maximum flow in the area is no Speed Bump Fmak. = 8.112 vehicles / hour, while in the Speed Bump Fmak. = 
1.157 vehicles / hour. There is a maximum flow in the Speed Bump area. 
 
The installation of Speed Bumps should be followed by the installation of signs or signs indicating the existence of 
Speed Bumps on the port road, so that their presence does not surprise passing road users. It is necessary to do 
further research on the analysis of Speed Bumps on speed, in order to obtain the factors that influence the speed at 
Speed Bumps and ideally the interval distance between installed Speed Bumps. when passing Speed Bumps which 
have been installed in port.

Abstract 
In the process of learning it is required various methods, one of the methods is individual assignment method which 
is a learning method that combines memorization, reading, repetition, and evaluation of self-ability. This method 
improves students' self-reliance so that they are independent of others, free, and can learn by themselves or in 
groups. The problem in this research is about how the stages of student learning independence in Christian 
Education lessons and whether the use of individual assignment method can improve the learning outcomes of 
Christian Education in grade VIII-A SMPN-7 Palangka Raya. This type of research uses quantitative research that is 
providing explanation and analyzing data on the object of the problems studied, among others, teachers and students 
in the classroom. The results of research indicate that the use of individual assignment method to improve student 
self-sufficiency is maximal and can be applied in every teaching and learning process of teachers and students in 
Christian Education. In addition, not only the value of students is increased, but also the attitude and readiness of 
students in doing tasks and learning

1. Introduction 
Learning is a complex process in all people and occurs for life from infancy to death. It must be realized that 
the current changes and progress of the era so rapid both in terms of knowledge and technology. Signs of a person’s 
learning are changes of behavior from not knowing to be knowing more (Mudjiono & Dimyati, 2009: 55). 
According to Meier, in learning, learners listen, see, talk, feel, think, write, or do and form something (Sidjabat, 
2011: 230). However, the diversity of activities also depends on teachers who manage, facilitate, and lead learning 
activities. 
In formal educational institutions, the subject of Christian Education is one of the areas of study which is 
relied upon to shape and build the growth of the faith of learners to God. This is in line with the goal of Christian 
Education that is to educate all church members to be involved in intelligent Bible study as guided by the Holy 
Spirit, to be taught to take part in worship, equipped to be able to practice their faith in everyday life. In Christian

3240","The independence of learning also speaks of the change in attitude that the student gives from within himself 
which is the result of self-experience and practice without being dependent on others. In the behavior of freedom, 
assessment and responsible for the task that has been given to him (Sanjaya, 2011: 228). Attitudes shown by each 
student in the implementation of learning in the first cycle of PTK less maximal, most students do not pay attention 
to the process of learning and not doing the task. Furthermore, the learning is done in the second cycle, the students 
have undergone a change of attitude and doing the task and actively involved in the group discussion. In the third 
stage of the learning process has improved both the results and attitudes that students provide by actively involved in 
learning and doing the task of the teacher (Tatang Sunendar: 2017). 
 
4.4. Use of Individual Assignment Methods to Improve Christian Religious Education Learning Outcomes 
In the learning process, students should be encouraged to perform activities that can foster the process of 
creative activities. Therefore, the method of assignment can be used to support learning especially the subjects of 
Christian religion. The use of individual assignment methods has the goal of growing an explorative learning 
process, encouraging students to behave reactions, familiarize students with comprehensive thinking, and foster 
student self-reliance in learning (Slemeto, 2010: 300). And should be considered in the use of recitation method 
according to Rusman (2010: 359) that the task should be addressed to students either individual or group tasks, the 
task can be completed or done in the classroom and outside the classroom, and the task is the final step to see the 
ability of each students in the material understanding already discussed by the teacher. 
By giving this task is expected so that students can learn freely but responsible and know the difficulties and 
can overcome difficulties experienced, because with the assignment of students can have the opportunity to compare 
the results obtained with other students young. The tasks assigned by the teacher should be clear, in accordance with 
the students 'abilities, and make the students think more critical to train students' skills in understanding the subject 
matter. 
At the time of conducting classroom action research (PTK) in three cycles conducted by the researchers, 
initially not very satisfactory both from the results of groups and individuals are still many students whose average 
score under the KKM in standardize. Therefore, researchers apply individual assignment method for each cycle, to 
see how far the students understanding in the subject matter. Assignment is urgently needed to be developed at the 
end of each material discussion, in order to help improve students' thinking skills, attitude changes, and skills. 
The first cycle is applied in the classroom with each end of the student lesson given the appropriate tasks of 
the material that has been discussed, there are still many students who do not understand and do not even do the task 
with a variety of reasons that one of them left at home. Researchers are trying to make more interesting Christian 
lessons while still giving the task at the end of the lesson for the second cycle. After the value and in check the 
results have been given an increase, students have started to understand the subject matter and willing to do every 
task that is given the teacher. Then in the third cycle, the results given by the students are more than the standard 
KKM scores that have been set both from the group task and individual tasks. Increased results that students give 
when individual assignment methods are applied in each lesson, especially Christian subjects, are clearly visible 
with the outcomes and students are actively working on the tasks of both groups and individuals. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the findings, conclusions were obtained as follows: 
1. The use of individual assignment methods is done by the teacher giving three cycles in the form of group tasks 
and individual tasks to see the improvement of students' learning independence in learning Christian Religious 
Education and the final results obtained have exceeded the predetermined standard values, it can be said that the 
method of individual assignment is successful in apply in class. 
2. The use of individual assignment methods to increase Christian Religious Education learning independence is 
seen in the percentage of student activities during each cycle. Cycle I learning activities 66%, cycle II is 74%, 
and the third cycle is 84.67%. 
3. The use of individual assignment methods in Christian Religious Education learning can improve student 
learning outcomes, seen in the average scores achieved by students for each cycle. In the first cycle is 66, the 
second cycle is 74.3, and the third cycle is 97.3. 
 
Based on the conclusions obtained several suggestions put forward as follows: 
1. Teachers can apply individual assignment methods in Christian Religious Education learning, with different 
materials. In addition, prior to the implementation of the teacher's learning should explain the working steps of

optimal results. 
2. Students can be more focused on learning because it is helped by the method of individual assignment, and have 
the spirit to do every task that is given by the teacher. 
3. The results of this study can be used as input in improving learning Christian Religious Education, as well as 
providing input for teachers have a more interesting method for learners interested in learning.

Abstract 
 
The paper is to optimize the cost and storing spaces of the inventory of the Firms’ HVAC spare parts without affecting 
the minimum required quantity of spare parts. Three models were introduced and simulated to calculate the required 
spare parts and their cost. The results of each model were evaluated and compared against the base case and the other 
proposed model. The best model was found that warehouse will be grouped into three groups based on their 
geographical locations. All the spare parts required for all locations in each group will be consolidated and allowed 
the lateral movement between group’s locations. The cost can be reduced by 28 percent, and the number of parts can 
be less by 25 percent.

1. Introduction 
In sunny and harsh weather HVAC equipment became one of the critical equipment in any building or facilities. 
HVAC systems is Saudi Arabia are running around the clock most of the year. The impact of equipment’s 
availability which is a function of reliability and maintainability depends on the criticality of the facility (Gulati 
2013). For example, a failure in the HVAC System for a hospital is not like a failure that could happen at recreation 
facility. Moreover, HVAC system downtime also plays major role in the failure impacts. These days, maintenance 
has become essential for the operation of complex production systems. Moreover, lack of maintenance due to 
missing spare parts could result in breakdown that has major negative impacts on the operation (Espíndola et al. 
2012) 
 
The majority of the HVAC Systems’ spare parts are imported from outside the kingdom of Saudi Arabia where the 
delivery time and cost play the major role in the spart parts availability. Spare parts inventory is commonly used by 
the large firms to secure their need of their HVAC Systems. The case that was address in this paper is a large 
maintenance services firm that has many contracted facilities scattered all over the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 
firm’s contracted facilities have different level of the criticality of their HVAC Systems. The HVAC System in hot 
country like Saudi Arabia is very essential; however, the criticality in these facilities is measured based on the impact 
of the safety and the facilities’ production and operations.   
 
Moreover, the firm is currently facing space issue in its warehouses. Every department at the firm has its own stores 
and inventory strategies with no lateral movement between the departments’ stores. Also, these warehouses are 
geographically scattered based on the operation’s locations. Figure 1 and 2 demonstrate the organization’s chart and 
warehouses’ locations distribution. Also, spare parts value plays major roles where the inventory value has a limitation 
that covers different operation and maintenance requirement rather than HVAC system.

3259","Maintaining good spare parts inventory is important to achieve excellence in maintenance performance. To 
accomplish this target more attention is required by the literature to inventory management and forecasting methods 
to ensure the availability of spare parts and to optimize the inventory. Moreover, it is not an easy task to forecast the 
required spare parts for the breakdown maintenance activities.  
 
The objective of this project is to optimize the cost and storing spaces of the inventory of the Firms’ HVAC spare 
parts without affecting the minimum required quantity of spare parts as it specify in the equipment critical spare parts 
best practices. Three models were introduced and simulated to calculate the required spare parts and their cost. The 
results of each model were evaluated and compared against the base case and the other proposed model. The best 
model was found that model 2 gives the lowest cost, less parts to be store and the shortest travel distance between 
locations. In this model, warehouse will be grouped on three groups based on their geographical locations. All the 
spare parts required for all locations in each group will be consolidated and the lateral movement will be allowed 
between group’s locations. Model 2 will reduce the cost by 28 percent, and the number of parts will be less by 25 
percent. The average traveling distance between locations for the lateral moves is 371 kilometers. Moreover, the 
method and the proposed solution that were used in this project can be applied for all type of equipment’s spare parts 
optimization.

1. Introduction  
 
Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineering (IISE) is considered as the world’s largest 
professional society dedicated solely to support industrial engineering education.  IISE defines industrial 
engineering as a field that is concerned with the design, improvement, and installation of integrated systems 
of men, materials, equipment, and energy (Zandin, 2001). It draws upon specialized knowledge and skill in 
the mathematical, physical, and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering 
analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems. (Zandin, 
2001).  
 
The industrial engineering programs outside the United States have largely adopted the practice 
and curriculum from the US (Zandin, 2001). In the Philippines, the Commission of Higher Education 
(CHED) through CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 96 Series of 2017, specifies the Policies, 
Standards and Guidelines for the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering program.  This CMO 
specifies the core competencies expected of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering graduates 
regardless of the type of higher education institutions they graduate from.  To further enhance the industrial 
engineering practice, the Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers (PIIE) is a professional society devoted 
to serving the needs of industrial and systems engineering professionals and institutions.  
Despite the advancement of industrial engineering in the world, there is a limited study related to 
the assessment of industrial engineering education. Kádárová et al., (2014) described the industrial 
engineering education in Slovakia particularly describing the history, study & research activities, and 
graduate profiles. Similarly, Palma et al., (2012) also analyzed industrial engineering in Peru. Finally,

business world and the improvement of the economic capability of the community. Insurance is considered important 
as one way to minimize the risk of loss that may occur. PT. Bosowa Ternate Insurance Branch as one of the general 
insurance companies that already have various insurance products, where one of them is surety bond insurance 
product. As an insurance company, the main income is derived from insurance premiums while the main expense is 
claims expense. This study aims to analyze the application of premium income and claims expense based on PSAK 
No.28 at PT. Bosowa Insurance Branch Ternate. The method used in this research is quantitative descriptive. The 
results of this study indicate that insurance transactions become relatively complicated because the income comes 
from premiums that are known and occur first, while the main load is the burden of claims has not occurred and 
covered by uncertainty both time and number. Revenue and claims claims recognition base accrual basis. Revenue is 
recognized at the time of the transaction even if cash has not been received. In this case income is recorded and 
recognized at the time of policy issurance. Claims expenses are recognized upon an obligation to fulfill the claim.

1. Introduction 
PT. Bosowa Insurance Ternate Branch is one of the companies engaged in the insurance of losses, where the 
product offered is surety bond. Surety bond is a form of Guarantee that usually the obligee party (project owner) asks 
for warranty or surety bond from the principal (contractor) with a view to express the seriousness of the principal in 
carrying out its work in accordance with the agreed contract/agreement. The guarantee is provided by a surety issued 
by a Non-Bank Financial Institution, an Insurance Company which has a bond surety program (Simanjuntak 1986; 
Abbas 2007; Darmawi 2008; Djojosoedarso 2008). 
Financial Accounting Standards Number 28 is a guideline for loss insurance companies in preparing, and 
presenting financial statements related to surety bond in the form of premium income and claim costs. Where premium 
income is recognized during the contract period and the estimated premium amount is adjusted per period to reflect 
the actual premium amount. While the premium amount cannot be estimated properly, the premium is treated using 
the deposit method until the premium amount can be reasonably estimated (IAI 2012: 28). 
In addition to the premium income that is the obligation of the customer, the company also has responsibility 
to fulfill the burden of insurance claim by the customer as their right. Where the claims expense relating to the 
occurrence of any eventual loss to the insured object includes settled claims, outstanding claims, claims incurred but 
not yet reported, and claims settlement expenses, as claims expense at the time of the obligation to fulfill the claim 
(IAI 2012: 28).

1.  Introduction 
Inclusive education is one of the special services for children with special needs. According to Sunaryo and 
Surtikanti (2011: 3) Inclusive education is a learning process for addressing educational issues for children with special 
needs in regular schools, using existing resources to create opportunities for their preparation of life in society. One 
of the resources is teachers. A teacher is required to be able to master the various skills, one of which is a skill in class 
management or class management. Classroom management is an activity that aims to organize learners so that their 
behavior leads to good things and eliminates misbehavior, develops positive interpersonal and socio-emotional climate 
and develops and maintains effective and productive class organizations (Mulyadi, 2009: 4). 
A teacher at an inclusion school is very important to have the skills to manage the class because the 
characteristics and conditions of each student are certainly different. According to Sunaryo and Surtikanti (2011: 1) 
children with special needs are aimed at a group of children who have such abnormalities or differences from the 
normal average child in terms of physical, mental, emotional, social or a combination of these characteristics and 
cause them to experience obstacles to achieve optimal development so that they need special education services to

3273","control techniques is a technique in which the discipline of learners should be controlled from outside students. 
Learners should continue to be monitored and controlled so as not to get carried away to destructive things. Learners 
should continue to be disciplined by punishment and reward. (2) Internal control technique is to try the students in 
order to discipline themselves in the classroom. The key to success of this technique is exemplary teacher in the 
discipline. (3) Cooperative control technique that is between teachers and learners work together in upholding 
discipline in the classroom. Teachers and learners make contractual agreements containing disciplinary rules that must 
be obeyed together. The use of punishment and reward techniques to teach discipline to students is also in accordance 
with Adeyemo's (2012) opinion that punishment or rewards should be given to motivate, and to address disciplinary 
situations in the classroom and school. 
Interest and passion of learning is very important because it will affect the attitude of students during learning. 
Based on the interviews, the way the teacher in improving the interest and passion of student learning is by using 
varied learning media and providing continuous motivation to autistic students. The use of learning media to increase 
student interest in accordance with Hamalik's opinion in Arsyad (2013: 19) which says that the use of learning media 
in the learning process can generate new desires and interests. The use of media by teachers makes autistic students 
feel attracted to the images and songs they produce. This interest is shown by the autistic student's attention to the 
screen image and the participation in singing together. Autistic student's interest in the lesson will reduce the deviant 
behavior that has become the character of his disability so that he can pay attention to the teacher's explanation in an 
orderly manner. Based on the results of interviews and observations, teachers also provide motivation to increase the 
passion of learning according to Karwati and Donni (2014: 165) who said that learning motivation plays an important 
role in giving passion, passion and pleasure in learning. 
Based on observations, teachers have also created a fun classroom atmosphere to increase interest and passion 
for learning. This is shown by teachers who are humorous, friendly and always smiling to the students. The effort of 
the teacher is in accordance with the principles of class management that is warm and enthusiastic. According to 
Wiyani (2016: 73) the warm and enthusiastic attitude of the teacher is an important factor to foster the spirit of learning 
and motivation to learn students in the classroom. Can be concluded that the attitude of the teacher who is humorous, 
friendly, and always smiling is very important to foster the spirit of learning of students, especially students with 
autism. 
Teachers also do the principle of variation that is varying the movement of limbs and intonation of sound when 
explaining the learning materials. Variation of teaching style will increase the passion of learning because it can reduce 
boredom. It is in the opinion Wiyani (2013: 81) that the variation of teacher teaching style is needed because it can 
avoid boredom and boredom. Variations in movement of limbs performed by the teacher are also very useful especially 
for autistic students because it can help clarify the purpose that is being discussed by the teacher. 
 
4.   Conclusions 
Based on the results of research and discussion, this study can be summarized as follows: Activities to 
familiarize orderly in low class in autistic students in the inclusive school of SD Al Firdaus Surakarta teachers make 
class rules and additional rules for autistic students as a precautionary measure of behavior disorderly. In addition, 
teachers also provide reprimands, advice, direction and therapy to roll with a sponge for autistic students who do not 
perform well. The disciplinary arrangements by the teacher to familiarize order are to impose penalties and rewards. 
Teachers also always remind all students to maintain discipline. Teacher also gives exemplary attitude discipline for 
all students. Teacher SD Al Firdaus uses a variety of learning media, providing direct motivation, praise, and drawing. 
Teachers also apply some principles of classroom management to increase students' interest and passion for autism so 
that autistic students can carry out their duties in an orderly manner.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia as the largest archipelagic state should have an infrastructure that connects all people, natural 
resources, raw materials, and various other networks. This can all be a whole network or a seamless network. 
Various data can be taken as a result of every point of activity. This is called Big Data1. Now the era of network 
development that we should have passed together consciously or unconsciously we walk along with the needs of 
nation and state. 
Today citizens of the world have many opportunities and facilities to connect with mobile devices, the 
discovery of byte byte data processing speeds of internet, the development of hard drive data storage capacity has 
increased the capacity of human knowledge beyond the conventional system obtained by children in school , how 
access to science is so openly real, unlimited and unprecedented. All this is no longer a dream, but has become a 
new technological breakthrough in the field of robotics, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D based 
printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing2. 
The various realities of the existing technological innovations are obviously happening not without cause. 
This is in line with the existence of technology and informatics that have an enormous impact on the changes and 
innovations that we feel. The need for effective and successful results enables producers to innovate and 
breakthrough into the lives of consumers, so that markets in the current sense of the place become conventional, 
characterized by a low level of relationship among principals, that agents act strategically to form a competitive 
advantage in such a way that the interaction between the two agents is facilitated by the third actor (Granovetter 
1973, Burt 1992, Uzzi 1997)3.  
If we look in detail did not rule out, the innovations made by old business actors who utilize online media 
raises the factor of horizontal conflict with other manufacturers located in the conventional comfort zone4. Where 
the use of technology makes it easier for consumers to access the production of goods or services of the maximum 
service with an efficient cost almost indefinitely space and time. This may affect transaction norms and relationships

Building awareness of community law, can be seen from the presence or absence of a person's willingness subject to 
obey the law, obedience to the law, it is determined by his consciousness, that is what is in the sociology of legal 
literature called Legal awareness56. The meaning of legal awareness here is the mental condition of a subject when 
must face up an imperative normative to determine the choice of behavior, which is complete two-dimensional. The 
first dimension of his cognitive demension, his knowledge of the laws governing certain behaviors he performs 
(whether forbid, whether ordered). Meanwhile the so-called second dimension is its effective dimension, namely its 
insistence that the law it knows is actually to be obeyed57. Soetandyo Wignjosoebroto asserted, there are actually 
two obedience, namely the outward fidelity and the obedience that permeates to the inner58. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The development of national legal awareness in the perspective of the disruftive era, must pay attention to the 
procedure of the law of the law, all institutions of society both internal and external cultivate legal awareness with 
empathy attitude in doing online activities both verbal and narative, convey information wisely and wisely, holders 
of sovereignty in accordance with its function of social control of government institutions in organizing the state 
dimension of solidarity and justice as an effort to revitalize legal awareness and reflect in the life of nation and state. 
With the infradiscipline it can be drawn to the thread that law has some convergence, since both embrace the 
positiveness, mere peculiarity and axiology, the law can be established with a real moral norm based on an 
empathetic attitude that implies beyond the principles of justice. In addition, psychologically it can be argued that 
the biological nature of man is a stepping stone in every case to define the overall purpose of the law. Besides the 
nature of human biology is the source of sociolitas, the psychic attachment, which makes the emotional union of the 
individual into a possible group. However, in the specific elaboration of human biology we can see from the 
beginning of space and time in building legal awareness in interacting generally and online specifically. 
In the life of the nation and the state of the legal consciousness of the Indonesian nation has been thinned 
from the nature, personality and identity of the Indonesian nation. The depletion of legal awareness of the 
Indonesian nation is influenced by internal and external factors. The internal faculty deals with the empathy and the 
understanding of the Indonesian nation in carrying out the law, while the external factor is related to the 
development of information and technology, the ideas or the influence of thought from the foreign culture so quickly 
absorbed by society. The condition of legal awareness in Indonesia is one of the factor that resulted in the state of 
life of the nation and state is mentally ill, because the metobolism of public legal consciousness is being disturbed, 
according to the author of legal awareness is one of the elements in the process of law development that is very 
influential, as well as in law enforcement. The formation of law and law enforcement is a manifestation of the 
development of legal awareness, it can be said that the legal awareness of the law will be negative in the process of 
law development. 
Based on the above conclusions, the things that need to be suggested are as follows: First, Need to improve 
the model of higher education law that has only studied the law alone, now and in the future need sociological and 
psychological approach with emphasis on increased legal awareness. Second, the establishment of legislation refers 
to the soiological and philosophical values that underlie the life of the people of the archipelago, so that the people 
do notapathetic in the implementation of legislation.

1. Introduction 
In general, parents would want their baby to grow into a healthy child, intelligent, creative, independent, 
faithful and cautious to God Almighty. Parents must be aware that in such a way our children miss the togetherness 
and communication with their parents who have been lost in need, the Son is a gift. Any religious view of the world, 
a child is a heir as well as a savior for parents and ancestors. Once the importance of the role and position of a child, 
then each family would expect the birth of a child who suputra, a child with character and good character, devoted to 
parents and ancestors and obedient to the teachings of religion nation and state. Character and character of a child 
can actually be formed through education. Like a clean white paper, then that is the parable of a newborn child; 
color, style and character depending on educational scratches given, in this case education by parents and the 
environment. Therefore, we as parents should use the golden age of children to provide a good character education 
for children. So that children can achieve success and success in life in the future. As parents sometimes do not 
realize, mother's attitude to the child will actually drop the child. For example, by hitting and putting pressure that 
ultimately makes the child behave negatively, inferior, inferior, fearful, and dare not take risks, which eventually the 
characters will be brought to adult. 
Some of the key considerations that should be followed by the government of West Nusa Tenggara, in order 
to achieve the beautiful dreams of West Nusa Tenggara are: (1) to prepare human resources quality, (2) to accelerate 
economic turnover and low social cost due to high work productivity and 3) improving equity in the life of the 
community, (4) helping the elderly and children of early childhood with low standard of living.

3289","The world has acknowledged that the role of teachers conducted at an early age plays a very important role. 
The development and improvement of one's thinking power at an early age will have an impact on adulthood. That 
is why, early education needs to get serious attention for all parties in order to improve the quality of our nation's 
children later. In the framework of providing guidance on the form of early childhood education formal and non-
formal channels that provide education for children aged four years to enter basic education, organized in an effort 
to help lay the foundation of development of all aspects of growth and development for children aged before 
entering primary school, the demand to improve the quality of superior human resources. In these conditions it is 
certainly difficult for students to be able to compete with other students. Human resource development implemented 
in other provinces in general and in particular NTB begins with early childhood development that includes care, care 
and education as a whole and is implemented in an integrated manner. Understanding the importance of early child 
development as a basic step for the development of healthy human resources, smart, and berkulitas. 
In NTB PAUD implementation still seems exclusive and reaching only a small part of society. Although 
various care and education programs for early childhood (0-6 years) have been implemented in NTB for a long time, 
but until 2017, children aged 3-4 years who have received low education and care services are still low. 
 
3.5. Parenting Parenting Patterns in communicating with 3-4 year olds 
From the results of data analysis and findings get some things about the role of parents is the embodiment of 
love to children who are ready or not to become parents. Having a child, ready or not, changes many things in life, 
and ultimately wants or not the child is required to be ready to understand the meaning of modesty that should be 
able to prepare the children in order to live their future well. Knowing, knowing, understanding the world of 
children is not something easy. A colorful world, a world of everything beautiful, easy, cheerful, loving, full of 
wonder and full of surprises. The world that every child should have but in its ownership depends a lot on the role of 
parents (Montessori, M. 2008). 
Why do parents need to improve the intellect of children to prepare them for school? The answer is, the 
school is currently asking for a high enough requirement of a student's quality. There are still students who enter the 
elementary school has been introduced with various kinds of lessons and science from an early age. Children have to 
have high creativity since childhood. Therefore, children who have high intellectuality will be more receptive to all 
that is taught. They will have high confidence, more adaptability, more readily accept new things, or a child's 
intellect can be developed long before they enter school. Such conditions place parents as the first and foremost 
teachers for their children in informal education programs that occur in the family environment. In fact, educating 
children is more difficult than childbearing. Therefore, as prospective parents or who have become parents, should 
be equipped with adequate knowledge about children's education. At the present time there have been many books 
published about children's education. It's just that, maybe the prospective parents and parents have not had time to 
read it (Nash, M. J., 1997. 
The result of this research is teacher communication in early childhood is very important, especially at PAUD 
level, teacher not only as pentransfer concept of science only, but teacher is more on guidance for the formation of 
behavior, character to character. The development of moral values as the basis for building the character of a child 
must take into account the nature of the child. The child communicates most easily at the age of 3-4 years and learns 
something when seeing and doing on their own. This is because children are still learning to use their sensory 
organs, rather than the feelings commonly used by adults. From the above findings teachers should get concrete 
examples of communication in the form of concepts of speech, attitude, and behavior. These three elements can not 
be separated and taught separately. Each gives the concept of communicating, the teacher also shows attitude and 
behave according to the concept of communication taught. 
Giving the concept of communicating as part of language practice in early childhood is mostly done through 
the activities of story telling, field trips, singing, and poetry. Through stories, educators can develop cultural values, 
social, religious, work ethic, and other moral concepts to become attitudes that can be realized in the child's 
behavior. Field trips are an activity to show the real world in order for a child to acquire a form of moral concepts 
that he gets. Singing and poetry or poetry are two things that many children live. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The results above can be concluded that the pattern of teacher communication in raising children ages 3-4 in 
the development of education in early childhood in the city of Mataram. Teachers in making the concept of 
communicating in early childhood that is domiciled as a catalyst or role model, inspirator, motivator, dynamicator, 
and evaluator. Teachers are said to be the catalysts, because the teacher as the exemplary for the child. Teachers are 
also an absolute factor in the development of effective communication, because the position of the teacher as a

educator should be able to inspire the learner learners to advance develop their potential. Teachers as motivators, 
meaning that every teacher should be able to generate spirit, work ethic and the potential of extraordinary in the 
learners themselves. 
The teacher is said to be a dynamicator, meaning every teacher has the ability to encourage early childhood 
toward the achievement of goals with full of wisdom, patience, nimble, intelligent and uphold spirituality. While the 
teacher pattern communicates as an evaluator, it means that every teacher is required to be able to and always 
evaluate the attitude or self-behavior, and the learning method used in building verbal communication in early child, 
so can know the level of effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity of the program. Building a pattern of 
communication by teachers in early childhood is the identity of communication, therefore need to be planted as early 
as possible to take root in one's life as a citizen. Provide identity as a communication pattern in children that can be 
seen by naked eye.

Abstract 
Flipped classroom is a technique or model that plays an important role in promoting student’s learning and 
achievement, this could create opportunities for active learning that could improve their performance and increase 
student engagement. The study aimed to examine the level of the  influence of flipped classroom model, to test the 
fit of flipped classroom and student school engagement, student’s participation and learning achievement, and 
school engagement and learning achievement. To analyze of student school engagement to learning achievement 
with flipped model by using SEM analyze. The research finding can be summarized as follows; The flipped model 
had a high level of student school engagement (M= 3, 438). The flipped classroom model had a good fit to the data. 
All hypothesized paths were supported, all p< 0,05, there was a direct and significant effect of flipped model on 
achievement, standardized estimate = 0,373 (p < ,05). This study also shows that, for flipped classroom model to 
occur, student engagement is one the important factors on learning achievement. 
Keywords: flipped model, student school engagement, learning achievement, and SEM analyze 
 
1. Introduction 
Education is a lifelong process in which people learn to negotiate with their world although others lay 
significant role in this process, education is essentially something people must do for themselves [Mangier, 1984]. 
School of the primary arena for the manifestation of students’ school engagement, its ways of promoting it are 
influenced by a student’s individual propensities and the quality of his or her interpersonal relationships with 
significant others at school and home[You & Sharkey, 2009].  On the other hand, students’ school engagement 
refers to a student’s investment in learning, experience of belonging, goals, participation and values. 
Education engagement and school membership comprise the central concept, in spite of these emphasis 
efforts to define and study the constructs represented by these formally. It’s to improve learning achievement is the 
application of learning models that provide enough space for students to develop the potential and skills possessed, 
that is able to influence student school engagement is a flipped classroom model (FC). Flipped classroom is as a set 
of pedagogical approaches that move most information-transmission teaching out of class, uses class time for 
learning activities that are active and social, and requires students to complete pre-and/or-post class activities to fully 
benefit from in-class work [Dawson, 2014]. According to Bergmann [2012] basically the concept of a flipped class 
is this: that which is traditionally done in class is now done at home, and that which is traditionally done as 
homework is now completed in class. Flipped classroom approach is designed to utilize in-class time to encourage 
students to be active participants, hence, may be more likely to facilitate student need for autonomy and 
competence. Furthermore, by being active participants, students are more likely to experience greater levels of 
relatedness between them and the instructor as well as between them-selves [Abeysekara et al, 2014].  
In this study we present empirical analyze of student school engagement on learning achievement through 
flipped classroom models. The study aimed to examine the level of the influence of flipped classroom model, to test 
the fit of flipped classroom and student school engagement, student’s participation and learning achievement, and

Abstract 
Ikan kering kayu is a diversified product of processed fish that looks and tastes almost the same as rendang but has a 
difference in raw materials used ie fish. The people of North Maluku generally make ikan tuna kering kayu as one of 
the business activities to improve the welfare, where this product has a low shelf life or less than two days so it can 
also affect the wide scope of marketing. To be able to increase shelf life and wide scope of marketing hence need to 
utilize correct processing technology, handling and canning and based on result of research so that ikan tuna kering 
kayu product that produced can have wide storey and wide scope of marketing. Fish canning is a handling and 
packing treatment technique by heating fish in closed, tin containers to deactivate enzymes, kill microorganisms, 
and turn fish in raw form into ready-to-eat products. Furthermore, the proximate test results show that the nutritional 
content of ikan tuna kering kayu  is water content 65.2%, crude protein 23.3 g / 100g, total fat 3.93 g / 100g, total 
carbohydrate 6.13 g / 100g, total ash 1.43 g / 100g, dietary fiber 1.49 g / 100g, total sugar 2.02 g / 100g, sodium

1. Introduction
Yellowfin tuna and skip jack tuna or better known as madidihang and skipjack is one of the big pelagic fish and 
superior commodities in North Maluku, with production value reaching 50% of total fish production in North 
Maluku Province. As a commodity of high economic value and has a large market share, the exploitation of 
madidihang and skipjack fish has a role in the economic development of Indonesia, especially in North Maluku 
Province, therefore, it is reasonable to use the resources of the fish and the skipjack is increasing (Tangke and Deni, 
2014; Tangke et al, 2018).

labeling. Washing is done by using soap water this is in accordance with the opinion of Adawiyah (2007), on good 
process cans washed with warm water tube then rinsed with clean water. 
 
The last stage of canning porses is labeling. Labeling is intended to know the product used and to know when the 
production time so that it can determine the expiration period, and of course with the labeling of products will be 
more easily recognized by the public. 
 
3.3. Nutrient Content 
Tuna is the scombriade family, where this type of marine fish is one of the most consumed fish in the world in the 
form of diversified and fresh products. Tuna fish can be processed into various kinds of processed products 
(Haryanto and Rauf, 2017; Tangke et al, 2020; Tangke, 2020), one of which is ikan tuna kering kayu which is a 
typical product of the people of North Maluku. As a commercially processed product, of course, ikan tuna kering 
kayu must have good nutritional value to maintain body functions. Based on the results of laboratory tests, it can be 
seen that the nutritional content of wood dried tuna is shown in Table 1.

In Table 1, it can be seen that the content number of ikan tuna kering kayu is very good from its nutritional value 
components, which in turn is useful information for consideration by consumers and also the information listed is 
very useful for someone with certain medical conditions or someone who is limiting the amount of calorie intake. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Ikan tuna kering kayu is a processed product typical of the people of north maluku that has a very short storing 
capacity at room temperature so that it affects the wide scope of the marketing area, by utilizing the results of 
research, technology and processing methods and a good canning then ikan tuna kering kayu products can have an 
intersection very well that can reach 1.8 years and will certainly greatly affect the wide scope of marketing area. 
Furthermore, the proximate test results show that the nutritional content of ikan tuna kering kayu  is water content 
65.2%, crude protein 23.3 g / 100g, total fat 3.93 g / 100g, total carbohydrate 6.13 g / 100g, total ash 1.43 g / 100g,

Abstract 
The research was conducted in Galela and North Galela, North Halmahera. The aims of this research were to know 
1) the existence of Momoa bird and form of local wisdom to protect its existence; and 2) how the society protects 
the Momoa bird as a conservation effort. The respondents were divided into 3 groups as follows: the location 
owners, the egg`s diggers and the local community. The owner`s location and the egg diggers determined by the 
snow ball method, meanwhile for the local community using simple random method. Local wisdom information was 
collected by focus group discuss method and other data were collected by structured interviews using 
questionnaires. The results showed that local wisdom for Momoa bird protection has been known since 1910, but is 
disappeared. The results showed that 67.69% of the respondents did not know that the Momoa bird is endangered 
animal; even 73.86% of the respondents did not know that there was local wisdom to protect the Momoa bird; and 
there are 80% of respondents initiated to support if local wisdom is rearranged to protect the Momoa bird. 
Meanwhile, the egg`s diggers and village leadership apparatus should be involved in local wisdom arrangement of 
preservation of the Momoa bird.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is a tropical country that has natural biodiversity of fauna species, especially for bird species diversity. 
Indonesia has about 1.500 species of the world’s 8700 species of birds; it puts Indonesia on the third rank after 
Colombia and Brazil who has 1.531 bird species. However, the bird`s life was threatened by human activities like 
hunting and destruction on their habitat. In North Maluku, Halmahera Island is the main island that covers the 
largest part of wild life, with 210 species of birds. There are 26 species of endemic birds reported in the Maluku 
Islands, 24 of which are located in North Maluku (Sapsuha 2013).  Momoa bird (Eulipoa wallacei) is an endemic 
bird in Maluku and North Maluku, namely Halmahera, Meiti, Ternate, Bacan, Buru, Boano, Seram, Ambon, and

3330","Cooperation among the various parties above, become important for preservation of momoa birds. This is support 
the opinion of Saiya et al. (2016), which states that to preserve those endemic birds, cooperation is needed from 
various parties, but the active role of local community is the most important because of local people are people who 
live side by side with the endemic birds.  
 
To involve the community such as the landowners, the diggers and villagers, need to consider the crucial factors that 
will determine the success of efforts to preserve the momoa bird, some aspects need to be considered such as the 
different level of community education, socioeconomic conditions of society, culture and customs. In dealing with 
those factors above before come to communities’ involvement in society conservation program should be preceded 
by society development related to and dealing with the differences aspects of every social condition at grass root 
level as mention above. Counseling and mentoring programs are two important things in community development, 
by those preceding program various materials of social development can be submitted to the society, in addition, 
mentoring efforts should be done in order to guide the society to formulate rules, programs and plans are needed by 
the village related to their roles and participation in conservation of Momoa bird species will be done by proper 
information risk and compensation 
 
On the economic aspect, the main factor to be dealt is income. Related with conservation efforts, the landowners and 
the egg diggers will certainly lose a percentage of their income that received from selling of Momoa eggs. In this 
case, even though they consented to implement the conservation of Momoa bird species, some respondents, owners 
and diggers have not understood the conservation impact toward their loss from the selling of Momoa eggs. 
 
The results of the interview found that 73.91% of respondent from the landowners and the egg diggers understood 
that the implementation of momoa bird conservation could be impacted to reduce the number of eggs harvested and 
consistent in reducing their income from selling the momoa eggs.  
 
Although number of people who understands that they should reduce the number of eggs is quite large, but about the 
number of eggs and income that should be reduced, some respondent has different opinion. The results also showed 
that 47.83% respondents really understood the benefits and consequences of the momoa bird conservation 
implementation agree to take only half number of eggs of total number they usually found. While respondent who 
approved the reduction of eggs by third part is about 8.70%. Furthermore, 21.74% of respondent agree for quarter of 
the egg reduction, because they did not want to lose the income from the considerable number of eggs. The 
remaining, 21.74% of respondent argued that whatsoever amount of eggs should be reduced they will obey depend 
on the outcome of drafting rules prepared, if the momoa bird conservation efforts are implemented.  The loss income 
risk in the communities due to the conservation efforts of the momoa bird species needs to be concerned by the 
conservation implementers, including the local governments, in doing so when conservation efforts can be 
considered for local governments to grant compensation or incentives to landowners and diggers who will lose their 
usual income. Provision of compensation or incentives may be granted based on Government Regulation Number 8 
of 1999 on the Utilization of Wild Plants and Animals. The regulation has been regulated on the provision of 
incentives for communities in the effort to conserve the types of plants and wildlife that are located around the 
community site. In addition, the responsibility for providing incentives to communities is also emphasized in the 
national strategic conservation directive of 2008 - 2018, states that the government needs to provide awards and 
incentives to members or groups of traditional or local communities that conserve species and maintain traditional 
wisdom (Anonymous 1999). 
 
These incentives can be made by involving landowners and diggers as part of conservation management. 
Landowners and diggers can live with their usual activities as collecting eggs in this case but at the same time 
maintain conservation purposes. The collected eggs will be handed over to conservation site managers, and they get 
an incentive worth of eggs that are delivered at the same price if they sell to the market. Thus, owners and diggers 
involved in conservation do not risk lose their income because of conservation of the Momoa bird species. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The research concluded that the people in Galela and North Galela sub-districts used to have local wisdom about the 
protection of momoa birds, which applied almost identically to all villages surveyed. The community also supports a 
rearrangement that can protect the life of momoa birds, by concerned to the existence of landowners and egg diggers 
who have been trying to protect momoa birds for so long.  To protect the momoa birds, the local government is also

loss of income due to the implementation of the momoa bird conservation efforts.

Abstract  
The process of soil stabilization refers to changing the physical properties of soil in order to improve its strength, 
durability, or other qualities. Typically, this is important for road construction, and other concerns related to the 
building and maintenance of infrastructure. Soil that has been stabilized will have a vastly improved bearing capacity, 
and will also be significantly more resistant to being damaged by water, frost, or inclement conditions soil). This 
research briefly describes the suitability of the gypsum to be used in the stabilized soil. Unconfined compressive 
strength (UCS) used as indicator to the strength development and hence evaluating the performance of gypsum 
stabilized soil. This research focusing on the effect of gypsum as a soil stabilizer. A various mix design at different 
percentage of gypsum (0, 4%, 8%, 10% and 15%) were prepared and cured for 0, 7, 14 21 and 28 days. Then the 
unconfined compressive strength (UCS) was carried out on 38mm diameter x 76mm height specimens. The lowest 
unconfined compressive strength test results were found in the gypsum content of 0% and curing for 0 days of 3.8667 
kg / cm2. While, the largest found in the gypsum content of 8% with 28 days of 14.2 kg / cm2. Curing increases the 
strength of soil. The addition of gypsum is effective for stabilization of clay soil.

1. Introduction   
In indonesia, the development of national road networks has encroached into the areas underlain with very soft soils. 
Generally, clay soil usually living in rural area where the existing soils are weak and more deformative. Clay soil is 
an easy soil to swelling if the soil is wet in the rain season and will shrink if the soil is dry in the dry season (Samer 
Dessouky et al., 2012). Swelling and shrinkage happens because water content in the soil change the volume of soil 
(Rama indera Kusuma, 2017). The characteristics of this soil type have a low strength and high plasticity, so that 
condition also supports the occurrence of landslides (Arwan Priyono, 2009). This condition makes civil engineers and 
geotechnical engineers find a solution that is to strengthen soil through soil stabilization (A V Lazarescu et al., 2017). 
The process of soil stabilization refers to changing the physical properties of soil in order to improve its strength, 
durability, or other qualities. Typically, this is important for road construction, and other concerns related to the 
building and maintenance of infrastructure (Laxmikant Yadu, 2013). The usual soil stabilization is by adding chemical

4. Conclusion 
The results of clay and clay soil testing with gypsum with a percentage of 0%, 4%, 8%, 10% and 15% with curing for 
0 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days can be concluded as follows: 
- 
Based on the results the original soil samples taken on the road of Mangkualam Village, Cimanggu District, 
Pandeglang Regency. The liquid limit (LL) is 62.4% and the plastic limit (PL): 44.82. According to unified soil 
classification system, the soil was classified as clays with high development potential. Whereas, for the soil 
stabilization with gypsum addition of 0%, 4%, 8%, 10% and 15% with curing time of 0 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 
days, and 28 days, it shows that the LL values have decreased with increase in the percentage of gypsum. The 
liquid limit value shows a decrease. 
- 
Based on the results of the specific gravity test (Gs), there was an increase from Gypsum levels 0% with Gs 2.547 
to 2.646 for Gypsum levels 15%. 
- 
The lowest unconfined compressive strength test results were found in the gypsum content of 0% and curing for 
0 days of 3.8667 kg / cm2. While, the largest found in the gypsum content of 8% with 28 days of 14.2 kg / cm2. 
Curing increases the strength of soil. The addition of the percentage of gypsum increases the soil strength, but 
there is a maximum point, if too many specimens dry out, the soil strength will decrease. 
- 
Thus, it can be concluded in general that the percentage of gypsum mixture which is effective for the stabilization 
of clay soil in Mangkualam Village, Cimanggu District-Pandeglang Regency is the addition of gypsum by 8% 
with curing time of 28 days.

1. Introduction 
Bamboo is known as non-wood forest products utilization longstanding. Utilization of conventional bamboo, among 
others for agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, appliances, household  construction of a simple house, a bridge in 
the countryside, to crafts. ""While the use of more modern inter alia for paper, toothpicks, skewer, chopstick, bamboo 
lamina, particle board, and charcoal (Khotimah and Sutiono, 2014).” 
The development of the bamboo industry nationally competitive and sustainable need to be supported by the 
material supply raw-assured in terms of volume, quality, and sustainability in the long term (availability, quality, 
and continuity of supply). Hence it is very necessary to build bamboo stands with bamboo types of high economic 
value and in accordance with a place to grow. Availability of bamboo with a good quality can support the 
development of processing industry of bamboo products of high value and provide economic benefits for farmers 
and society with foreign countries (Khotimah and Sutiono, 2014). 
Skewer as a means of serving food such as beef satay, skewers of fruit and other foods, originally the skewers by 
hand with results that are not optimal and the quality is not meet to penetrate the market of middle and upper class, 
then the process of making a skewer was developed with using a semi-automatic machines to guarantee that more 
optimal results and the quality of marketable products among middle and upper. The products are based on a 
bamboo tree in its development has a promising business prospects with supports availability of raw materials which 
are still abundant in Indonesia (Puspitasari and Hartanti, 2017). This type of business can be run if the place of 
business close to sources of raw materials.

Abstract 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological disorder that affects brain function and occurs 
within the first three years of life and cause disorder in several areas of development including social 
interaction, communication and behavior. Mother, as primary caregiver is the most affected subject during 
nurturing. Mother’s quality of life is very important for mother’s wellbeing. The aim of this study is to 
determine the relationship between caregiver burden with quality of life of mothers with autistic child. This study 
is an analytic cross sectional design using consequtive sampling in psychiatric day care Dr.Soetomo General 
Hospital, Surabaya. Instrument using Caregiver Burden Assessment (CBA) and WHO Qol BREF to assess 
mother's quality of life. The sample for this study consisted of 24 mothers of children with autism spectrum 
disorders. Objective burden showed a significant negative correlation with physical, psychological, and social 
domains quality of life and did not correlate to environmental domain of quality of life. Subjective burden and 
total caregiver burden did not correlate to all domain of quality of life of mother with autism spectrum disorders

1. Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological disorder that affects brain function and usually 
occurs within the first three years of life. ASD cause disruption in some areas of development including social 
interaction, communication, and behaviour. The Center for Disease Control (2012) reported 1 in 88 children 
diagnosed with ASD (Bashir et al., 2014). In 2013, it is estimated more than 112,000 children with autism 
spectrum disorder in the age of 5-19 years in Indonesia (Judarwanto, 2015). Children with ASD show some 
symptoms that can be stressful for the families. Various changes are also experienced by families who daily 
facing and caring for children with ASD. In fact, the family also had to sacrifice for the development and 
growth of their child with ASD (Apostelina, 2012). 
Some parents quit their jobs and could not enjoy daily activities because they have to take care for their 
children with ASD that require special treatment than other children. According to previous research by 
Anjari in 2016, parents who have children with ASD experience various problems due to lack of knowledge about 
autism, economic constraints experienced by parents for having to finance the child, time consumed and 
physical exhaustion (Misquiatti et al., 2015). In addition, parents of children with ASD also experience various 
emotions associated with nurturing that includes frustration, anxiety, helplessness, anger, sadness, financial 
problems, burden, chaos of

caregiver due to the process of caring for children with ASD. 
5. Conclusions 
Objective burden have a negative strong relationship with quality of life of mothers with ASD children in 
psychological, physical health and social relationships domains. A broader study with larger samples is needed to 
determine the overall picture of caregiver conditions of mothers with autism spectrum disorder children to cretae a 
new policy foundation for mother’s wellbeing and  comprehensive therapy needed to caregiver, especially mother 
with ASD children.

Abstract 
There are several stages before the birth of the welfare state concept, some authors mention the following stages, 
namely Police State (Polizei Staat), Formal Law State (Liberal), The Materiel Law State (Welvaarstaat/welfare 
state). Type of Police State and the Welfare State referred to as the extreme form of law state, because the Police 
State is regarded as an early form of Law State, while the Welfare State is a type of law state is considered 
applicable today, being The General Principles of Good Governance born during the development of the Welfare 
State. General Principles of Good Governance, they are rarely found. The first term may be found in Presidential 
Decree Number 15 of 1983, Indonesian Act Number 28 of 1999, Indonesian Act Number 9 of 2004, Indonesian Act 
Number 25 of 2009, and Indonesian Act Number 30 of 2014.

1. Introduction 
The foundation of the concept of a constitutional state can be traced to the time of Plato and Aristotle, about five 
century BC. Plato put forward the concept nomoi which can regard as a forerunner of the idea of law state. Nomoi 
(Law) is the third written works created in his old age, while in the two previous issues, Politeia (State) and politicos 
(Politicians) is not the term the rule of law. Plato (429-347 BC) suggested that the implementation of sound State is 
based on regulation (law) is good. The idea of Plato's law state is increasingly assertive when supported by his 
student, Aristoteles, who wrote in the book Politica. According to Aristotle (384-322 BC), a country which is the 
well-governed state with a constitution and sovereign law (Bodin, 1992).  
For Aristotle, who ruled the state is not human, but good thinking and ethics that determine the merits of the 
proposal. People need to be educated as good citizens, who have good morals, which eventually will embody human 
being fair. If these circumstances had been realized, it creates a ""Rule of Law.""    
The idea of a legal state according to Aristotle seems to be very close to the ""justice,"" even a state would say as a 
state law if justice has been achieved. This way of thinking leads to a form of the rule of law in the sense of ""ethical"" 
and narrow because the purpose of the state solely to achieve justice (Dicey, 2013). The theories teach that called

8. The principle of good service. 
 
Finally the Indonesian people should not hesitate anymore to apply the General Principles of Good Governance in 
protecting themselves from the action lawlessness, attitude goes beyond the authority of, and attitudes arbitrarily by 
officials of the state administration, because those principles are no longer only from the expert opinion (doctrine), 
court decisions that have permanent legal force (jurisprudence), but also written law. 
 
4. Conclusions 
There are stages of development of civilization to arrive at the concept of a modern constitutional state, namely: 1 / 
Police State (polizei taat); 2/Night Guard State (nachwakerstaat); 3 / Welfare State (welvaarstaat). 
Their freedom of action (Freis ermessen) for reasons of public services (bestuurzorg) that do officials of state 
administration in the countries are welfare, then there are growing concerns in the Netherlands regarding the lack of 
protection of the public for the actions of officials of the State administration who perform unlawful acts 
(onrechmatig overheidsdaad), abuse of authority (detournement de pouvoir), and arbitrary (willeker / abus de droit), 
then in 1946 was led by de Monchy duty to think about and examine several alternatives of enhanced legal 
protection for the people of the state administration actions that deviate (Verhoogde Rechtsbescherming). In 1950 
the Commission de Monchy then report the results of research on verhoogde rechtscherming in the form of 
""Algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur"" which translates to the general principles of good government. The 
results of the study commission is not fully approved by the government or there are some things that cause 
disagreements between commission de Monchy with the government, which led to the commission was disbanded 
by the government. Then came the commissions van de Greenten, which was also formed by the government with 
the same task with the de Monchy, but the second commission have also suffered the same fate, namely because 
there are several opinions obtained from the research was not approved by the government, and the commission 
even this was dissolved without producing results. 
General Principles of Good Government in Indonesia is now accepted not only as a legal opinion of experts 
(doctrine) or court decisions that have permanent legal force, but already masuh in written law, as in Indonesian Act 
Number 28 of 1999 on the state operating in clean and Free from corruption, collusion and nepotism, and also can 
be found in the explanation of article 53 paragraph 2 letter b Indonesian Act Number 9 of 2004, concerning the 
Amendment to Indonesian Act Number 5 of 1986 on Administrative Courts Country. In Article 4 of Indonesian Act 
Number 25 of 2009 on Public Service, and Article 10 of Indonesian Act Number 30 of 2014 concerning 
Government Administration, which states expressly with the term of Good Governance Principle.

Abstract 
Dairy farm is how to develop the potential of the animals to be used either as meat, milk and skin. The Central 
Bureau of Statistics explained that Indonesia has a population of as many as 533 860 head of dairy cattle in 2016 
from across the province. One of them is a dairy farm in the area Plaosan Wonoayu subdistrict, Sidoarjo. The 
problems most frequently encountered is the declining productivity of dairy cows. There are many factors that affect 
the productivity of dairy cows. Based on research conducted over 3 months of March, April and May. Found several 
factors that affect the productivity of dairy cows, ie feed, lactation and age. In this study using multiple linear 
regression method 3 factors. The results showed the feed is the biggest factor with a value of 29.37%, then age with 
the value of 8.12%, and lactation with a value of 2.34%.

Abstract  
In an effort to curb the potential losses associated with the event of security bridge, admitting the uneven bandwidth 
support that characterizes most developing smart cities, we propose a neural inspired Multimodal Security 
Management System (MSMS) that is bandwidth-tolerant. The proposed system leverages on a Next-Generation 
Network (NGN) architecture in catering for the challenges associated with the provisioning of ubiquitous broadband 
access for IoT support in a heterogeneous morphological network environment. In order to evaluate the MSMS, we 
simulated the proposed cloud-based system on a Next Generation Network (NGN) architecture which utilizes Internet 
Protocol/Multi-Protocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) as transport technique in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) 
backbone infrastructure. We then compare its performance over a competitive alternative transport technique: 
""Internet Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode (IP/ATM)"". Thus, we further evaluated the MEMS on the latter 
architecture. While, our proposed system is able to capture both textual, aural, and visual information of individuals 
in security vulnerable environments via installed smart microphones and cameras, it is also able to integrate this 
information's in predicting security threats. When compared with the popular Security Management System (SMS) 
""ShotSpotter"", results show that our proposed system outperforms the ShotSpotter system by 0.87 and 0.45 in terms 
of efficiency and response time respectively. Finally, simulation of our proposed system on an IP/MPLS transport 
schemes shows that the former outperforms the latter with respect to overall network bandwidth utilization and average 
traffic loss in the ratio of 0.098 and 0.087 respectively.

1. Introduction  
There is currently an alarming upsurge of people from all works of life to urban cities mostly in search for better living 
condition. According to the United Nations, by 2050, over sixty-eight percent of the world’s population will be urban 
dwellers [1, 2]. Currently, concerted efforts are geared towards ensuring that many of these urban centers are furnished 
with technologies that support for improved day to day engagement of persons via provisioning of digitized services 
such as: online bill payments and banking, apps for services like transport management, health care provisioning and 
online communities for welfare of individuals. Many of these cities leverage on Internet of Things (IoT) to connect 
operational technology, such as smart meters, sensors while utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to make sense of all 
the data for improved service delivery to residence. However, little effort has been geared toward the physical safety 
of persons and things in these environments amidst the growing rate of crime and suicide bombings in many of these 
cities [3, 4]. 
Disaster outburst are characterized by a total or partial disruption of the normal functionality of any society within 
a short-time. They are usually marked by extensive human, economic, material and environmental losses, with a 
resultant decapitation of the affected community and hampering of its ability to cope with its own resources [5, 6].

1","4.1. Integrated Network Analysis for MSMs 
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the adopted NGN integrated architecture for the support of the proposed 
MSMs. In this regard, we modeled an unvarying arrival and continuous service process flow for the backbone network. 
Traffics were modeled as Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) in MATLAB/Simulink environment with set 
parameters for supported class of traffic generated by typical Users in Urban center and in particular the proposed 
MSMs. This is to account for bustiness of the envisioned future multimedia services to be supported in the networks. 
 
 
 
We further evaluated the performance of the core network in terms of two fundamental metrics: overall utilization of 
the back-end resource (bandwidth) and traffic drop across the entire network. The results are shown in fig.9-10. The 
evaluation was done on two backbone transport techniques (IP/MPLS and IP/ATM) as discussed in section 3.2. 
Results from the analysis show that IP/ATM offers a strong competitive edge over the former when utilized as core 
transport technique. 
5. Conclusion  
We have been able to establish in this study that Next Generation Network (NGN) which aims at completely reshaping 
the current model of communication systems and ingress to the Internet also has the capacity to argument for the 
bandwidth deficiencies that characterize earlier generations of mobile networks. It is intended to transform the existing 
structure of vertically independent, but integrated networks into a horizontal form of networks established on IP. This 
central platform architecture brings existing networks with varying transport and control technologies into a distinct, 
coalesce and multi-service structure formed on IP. Similarly, we show that though IP/MPLS is currently the currently 
the adopted transport technique in this architecture, IP/ATM offers a competitive alternative transport technique in

surveillance information through intelligent video analysis can enhance policing in public sphere. We establish that 
the fusion of extracted information from back-end real-time video resource of crime scene can help improve the current 
policing architecture in most developing counties. Finally, in other to encourage further research in this domain, would 
be looking at building a more robust multimedia crime base corpus that would be made publicly available to encourage 
studies and technological innovation that are AI based for a better and safer public sphere in most developing third

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to study, analyse tea industry and areca nut market - A case study on enhancing the 
possible strategies to increase sales and spread brand awareness for areca market in Karnataka, India. Here the 
researcher has applied exploratory and descriptive research design by constructing the structured questionnaire and 
subjected the structured questionnaire to 100 Areca tea users and tea consuming consumers, by using convenience 
and random sampling for data collection from Karnataka, India. The collected data has been analysed using simple 
tools such as averages, percentages and measurement scales and SPSS software (One-Sample Statistics, One-Sample 
Test) were used to arrive at desired results. The analysis resulted that Though people in Karnataka, India are found 
to be health conscious and they do consume healthy products, here due to high price and low brand awareness Areca 
tea could not position itself strongly into the market hence a study was carried out to know the reasons behind it and 
possible solutions were given to increase the sales and brand awareness through various promotional media, free 
samples, sponsorship, tying up with health clubs, creative innovative ads and new flavoured based tasty drink to 
attract kids segment etc. in the interest of family. The Originality/value of the study is that the research is carried to 
establish a strategic and organizational marketing strategic plan by mystic aromatic company (ARECA) to promote 
the Areca tea drink to different segments. In order to overcome this challenge a study was carried out to test the 
response of customers before and after the usage of product and provided suggestive strategies to increase sales and 
expand brand awareness. Research implications are that the study is restricted to Karnataka, India. 
Keywords: Karnataka, India, Tea industry, ArecaNut, Brand awareness, Sales.

11","higher compared to other brands hence to make it feasible it is advised to reduce their price based on the market 
demand and affordability. They should try to highlight the information of herbal contents used for making areca tea 
because the consumers are interested in consuming herbal drinks, which acts as a booster. When we discuss about 
promotional aspects traditional and social media based brand awareness is very low hence it’s very important to 
create areca tea advertisements through these modes of communications and tying up with some health fitness 
centers/clubs or sponsoring it on some events or bringing these products as a welcome drink in the malls etc. may be 
essential. Areca tea is not very aggressively used in domestic market, so an aggressive promotional strategy to 
penetrate deeper into the market has to be launched.    
 
Providing a customized combination of areca drink, tasty new drink combo for influencing kids would influence the 
consumers along with the quality of product. Due to Health consciousness today’s consumers are becoming very 
much interested in consuming health drink, so areca can concentrate on positioning itself as a health drink than 
regular tea /drink. Areca tea should majorly focus on urban market rather than rural area due to its high price. They 
can launch a product suitable for rural market both in terms of price and usage. Maintaining effective CRM with 
customers and maintaining good relationship with channel partner is mandatory for Areca. Also, creative ads to be 
show cased with remarketing and theme based ads which should be an eye opener for consumers.  
 
10. Conclusion: 
  
Based on study carried out researcher was successful in terms of increasing the demand and interest of consumers 
towards areca tea product and parallelly an increase in sales was found during the pilot testing phase. It also helped 
to render a strategic plan to raise revenue and create market recognition, advertising is the most critical aspect that 
allows every product or service to lift brand recognition, due to lack of awareness and promotion in the market 
Areca tea had lost its presence identity in the market area later when new initiatives were taken to expose it into the 
market, customers showed real interest in purchasing the product and also appreciated it. Understanding the 
demographics of the consumer, their affordability, their needs, wants, preferences, priorities are necessity and need 
of the hour,  which can help us to succeed in the market and reach out the right customer at the right time in the 
given situation and still compete with other alternative or supplement products. It also helps in client retainment by 
providing a high service to consumer. 
 
As the working folks, students, housewives, senior citizens etc. consider coffee and tea as a stimulating, driving 
boosters which makes them actively perform their daily routines and it also acts as a refreshing agent similarly even 
Area tea is placed in a market not just as a refresher or booster but also as a health drink meant for maintaining their 
physique as well as a healthy lifestyle.

ABSTRACT 
 
The Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement Programme (MCEP) scheme was specifically designed and 
developed in order to incentivise industry with various components, ranging from capital investment, green 
technology, and enterprise level of competitiveness. During the tenure of the incentive programme, there were 
challenges pertaining to over-commitment, poor turnaround times, and poor customer service management and 
customer relations management leading to poor project and programme management. These challenges resulted 
into long turnaround times and over-commitment. There was a lack of a logical relationship between the 
scheduling and budgetary and scoping analysis, thereby impacting adversely on the industrialists and the economy 
at large. The study was conducted on how the application of project and programme management could ameliorate 
the challenges incurred by the scheme. Based on the outcome of the study, there was a general agreement that 
there was a dearth of project and programme management in the MCEP, and its implementation which would 
ultimately resolve the inefficiencies in the programme. The study concluded that it is important to designed and 
developed a programme in order to incentivise the manufacturing industry in South Africa, the core objective of 
which is to embrace competitiveness enhancement, global competitiveness and export-driven economy, as well 
as to protect industry during turbulent and volatile economic conditions.

1. Introduction 
 
The Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement Programme (MCEP) is an incentive scheme managed within 
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and was developed in response to the government’s National 
Development Plan (NDP) and Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP). This scheme was specifically designed and 
developed in order to incentivise industry with various components, ranging from capital investment, green 
technology, and enterprise level of competitiveness.  
 
The purpose of the MCEP is to raise confidence to invest in a period where there is short- and medium-term 
uncertainty and turbulence in the South African economy. The MCEP will significantly strengthen a range of 
sector-specific and transversal interventions, which include employment creation and industrial financing 
packages to distressed companies via Development Finance Institutions (DFI), (DTI, 2015;2016: Online). 
 
The IPAP forms a key pillar of the New Growth Path (NGP) which was launched by the Minister of Economic 
Development in November 2010. Government’s National Development Plan Vision 2030 seeks to ensure that 
critical steps in support of restructuring the economy are secured, to add a more value-adding and labour-intensive 
growth path, Van Ransburg,(2016).  
 
To support value adding and labour-intensive growth, manufacturing plays a critical role in driving income growth 
and employment, with substantial direct employment potential. Manufacturing is also the core production sector 
that can raise incomes and increase the level and sustainability of employment growth in consumption-driven 
services sectors (DTI, 2013:Online).

Based on the findings from the research, in relation to the investigative question, the following is recommended: 
  
• 
In-house programmes should be developed to draw the linkages between the role of project and 
programme management and industrial and economic development. Furthermore, the DTI scenario, 
together with the related economic and industrial incentive programmes, should be factored in.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In light of the research question of the study, which enquired how the MCEP programme can be successfully 
managed, measured, monitored and appraised, the findings of the research ascertained that project and programme 
management principles, along with methodologies, in collaboration with economic theories and practices, 
monitoring and evaluation systems be adopted by the programme and future incentive programmes. This will 
provide an efficient and effective MCEP incentive programme, thereby ameliorating the backlog, over-
commitment, and project constraint synchronisation challenges, and, furthermore, be an enabler of improved 
benefits realisation management and economic impact analysis.

Abstract  
The environmental impact of the cement production has been beckoning for attention in recent time. Different 
literatures have different things to say on these environmental impacts, at different production phase. This study 
applied Life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluation tool to evaluate Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in establishing the 
environmental implication of cement production using the midpoint approach of LCIA method. Result of assessment 
shows that clinker production phase has the highest contribution to global warming which brings about climatic change 
due to high CO2 emission which affects both human health and ecosystem. Crude oil, coal and natural gas are expended 
maximally to bring about fossil resource scarcity and terrestrial toxicity, which affects both human and ecosystem 
because of high copper deposited from the clinker production phase alongside other phases of production.

1. Introduction 
The construction sector has in recent time been recorded to produce large environmental impact which is of continuous 
concern to the society (Moretti & Caro, 2017). Cement is the major constituent of concrete used in the construction 
sector. Different environmental impacts such as resources scarcity, emissions, and energy consumption spans through 
its entire production cycle (Miccoli, Finucci, & Murro, 2014a, 2014b). The major constituents of Ordinary Portland 
cement (OPC) are calcium (limestone, marl or chalk) Silica, alumina and sometimes iron ore. OPC is about 95% 
clinker and 5% gypsum. These raw materials are placed into the large kiln of over 1400oC it has been crushed and 
pulverized. After cooling, the heat is trapped and gypsum is added to improve cement workability (Barcelo, Kline, 
Walenta, & Gartner, 2014). Different authors have different things to say about the clinker production phase 
(calcination) i.e. breaking limestone down to give Cao and CO2. Cement industry is said to account for about 12-15% 
of total industrial energy and 5-7% of total Greenhouse gas (GHG), but literatures have it that a good percentage of 
this energy is consumed at clinker production phase and also the highest GHG (CO2) is emitted at this phase 
(Summerbell, Khripko, Barlow, & Hesselbach, 2017) (Hendriks, Worrell, De Jager, Blok, & Riemer, 1998). About a 
decade ago, over 2.6gigatone of CO2 gas emission was from cement production globally whereas half was from 
combustion of fuels, the other half was from calcination (Gursel, 2014; Madlool, Saidur, Hossain, & Rahim, 2011; 
Policy & Policy, 1999). 
International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme documented that over 800g of CO2 is emitted 
for every 1000g of cement produced (Xu, Fleiter, Fan, & Eichhammer, 2014). Meyer (Meyer, 2009) in his work 
showed that about 1ton of cement produced emit almost 1ton of  CO2 gas. Every human being needs about 1 ton of 
cement every year (Cembureau, 2012), hence the need for continuous production of cement been its major component 
(Ali, Saidur, & Hossain, 2011; Van Oss & Padovani, 2003). Seeing that these environmental impacts run through the 
entire production process, it is therefore important to understand the entire cycle of the cement production and knowing 
the actual impacts as well as their contribution to the environment changes. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCA) is 
a multiple-issue tool used in evaluating and assessing potential impacts in the entire cycle of a product or process. It

30","FFS impact is as a result of 0.078kg of oil used in producing 1kg of OPC. The StS in Table 6 shows that crude oil, 
coal and natural gas are substances that are used up that result into scarcity; the StP in Table 7 show the same result. 
Table 6: StS of FRS 
 
 
Table 7: StP of FRS 
 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
The analysis was done on 1kg of OPC. Global Warming brings about climate change, which affects both human health 
and ecosystem. Note that whatsoever affects ecosystem will of surety affect human beings general. The effect of global 
warming therefore has major effect on human being. GW is as a result of 97.1% of CO2 emission and 85.6% or this 
emission is from the clinker production stage. This is in-line with literature and particularly with Meyer’s submission 
in his work that almost 1ton of cement produced emits almost 1 ton of CO2. However, kilogram is the unit of measure 
used in this study. As seen above, Fossil resource scarcity results to unavailability of fuel resources such as crude oil 
(43.7%), coal energy (43.21%) and natural gas (13.1%) of 0.083kg (mineral resource scarcity and fossil resource 
scarcity) for every 1kg of OPC produced.  The unavailability of resources thereby increases the cost of the available 
ones. In addition, Terrestrial ecotoxicity affects both human health and ecosystem as 61.5% of 0.438kg of this impact 
is from copper deposited at clinker production phase and other phases. This study concluded that 0.91kg of CO2 is 
emitted for every 1kg of OPC produced and 0.756kg of this 0.91kg is from the calcination process alone. Global 
warming has the highest impact and makes the most prominent environmental impact of the cement industry. This 
therefore calls for attention as the effect of impact is seen in changes in climatic condition which affects both human 
and ecosystem. The calcination phase is the highest contributor because of the chemical decomposition of CaCO3. 
One of the ways to reduce CO2 emission in this phase is to reduce the amount of clinker and replace it with other 
supplementary cement materials like natural pozzolana: fly ash, slag, etc.

Abstract 
 
Lean six-sigma as quality improvement tool is widely gaining attention in the optimization of production 
process in manufacturing industries as it helps to trim down waste. The work aimed at improving down time 
as manufacturing waste in a Paper Company. The analysis of the production process was done using Pareto 
analysis, Overall Equipment Effectiveness indicator and cause and effect analysis which revealed the down 
time problem, traceable to high rate of setup time and changeover of order due to incessant ink wetting, plate 
misalignment of the printing machines and other factors related to work organization. Lean six sigma tools of 
Single Minutes Exchange of Die and 5S techniques were implemented and these reduced the down time from 
32. 6 to 11% and therefore increase customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
 
Maintaining quality and reliable performance have become priorities to production industries in order to gain 
customer satisfaction, as demand for the products increases (Gupta et al., 2018). Companies have to define, 
measure, analyze, make improvement and effect control on their existing manufacturing systems to comply 
with market competition (Gupta et al., 2018). Different methods, approaches and tools are being used for 
continuous productivity and quality improvements (Gupta et al., 2018). Aside these, each company or 
production sector requires to use a proper selection or combination of different approaches or tools in its 
implementation process (Sokovic et al., 2010). Down time and variations are inevitable in the course of 
production of any product, but the main goal of process management or process capability analysis in any 
organization is to investigate the courses of the down time during the production process of the product (Pearn 
and Chen, 1999). This aids manufacturing organizations to monitor and measure the potential of process (Wu 
et al., 2004).  
Continuous improvement of process is a key concept of total quality management (Chem et al., 2015), but 
other methodologies like re-engineering or automation, lean manufacturing will also give similar results of 
improved performance (Gupta et al., 2018). Lean Manufacturing, a multidimensional production optimization 
approach that captures various management practices, aimed at waste reduction and improving operational 
effectiveness (Roriz, 2017). The evidence of implementation of the approach in the manufacturing sector is 
not limited to quality and productivity improvement, but also considers non-tangible change factors such as 
initiation of supportive learning environment and developing leadership in the organization (Gupta et al., 
2018). To this effect, companies now trend strategy for continuous improvement on quality of their 
products/services to retain customers in order to gain market share (Chen et al., 2015). Immediately after the 
inception of TQM, lean six-sigma appear in the model as element of TQM, viewed as present state of 
evolution in quality management (Gupta et al., 2012). The claim that lean and Six Sigma have a 
complementary relationship is widely accepted today and more companies are establishing lean Six Sigma 
(LSS) programs, especially after the proven capability of lean and Six Sigma in leading companies like GE 
and Toyota (Salah et al., 2018). LSS can be described as a methodology that focuses on the elimination of 
waste and variation, following the DMAIC structure, to achieve customer satisfaction with regards to quality, 
delivery and cost (Crawford, 2004). It focuses on improving processes, satisfying customers and achieving

Abstract 
 
IoT technology can be used to improve the overall management of hospital infrastructure. This paper 
presents a case study whereby IoT technology is used to monitor and manage a cluster of AIIRs (Airborne 
Infectious Isolation Rooms) in a live environment.  The remote management of alarms and room 
functionality reduces the unnecessary exposure of healthcare workers and provides an improved response 
time compared to a human resource. The results of real-time live testing during the COVID-19 Pandemic 
are discussed in this paper. We were able to reduce the exposure of human resources during the pandemic 
by providing remote monitoring and control of healthcare infrastructure.

1. Introduction 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a host of challenges and obstacles. The increased burden on the health care 
system meant that innovative methods of dealing with these challenges and managing the human resource component 
which was adversely diminished by the high incidence of infection amongst health care works. Management of health 
infrastructure is a pivotal factor in maintaining a high uptime of hospitals and health infrastructure. Supervisory control 
and data acquisition systems and IoT technology is a technology platform that has been used to manage health 
infrastructure and improve the performance of health care systems. 
 
2. Methods 
 
A monitoring and control system was set up using a combined network of smart devices, PLCs, and a central 
server. Information from this network was processed via a local server to manage isolation rooms and other 
infrastructures such as medical gases and electrical reticulation back up from generators and uninterrupted 
electrical supplies. The following infrastructure for 12 isolation wards was connected via the network to 
manage pressure differentials, equipment failure temperatures, and humidity. Figure 1 illustrates some of the 
parameters measures across the 12 rooms.

Another significant result was the decrease in the failure of compressors and refrigeration plants leading to an 
improved cold chain. Maintaining the cold chain by reducing the system failures in refrigeration led to a 
reduction in wastage of stock both in the food and beverage department but also in the pharmaceutical arena. 
 
 
 
 
4.  Conclusion 
 
This study showed that a SCADA system and IoT can be used to improve the performance of hospital 
infrastructure. A cluster of AIIRs was used as a case study and we were able to reduce the exposure of a human 
resource to an infectious environment by substituting the human sensor and tactile sensors with an automated 
system for remote plant diagnosis.  The change over of a room from Positive to negative pressure could also 
be done remotely which then frees up resources of having to use a human resource.  
 
The study also provided valuable information and data which was used to fine-tune the plant and improve 
overall performance and energy consumption. We were able to compare electrical data gathered from various 
power meters and power analyzers. Data from this study was also used to better understand the realistic 
uninterrupted power requirements and draw a comparison against the calculated data.  
 
We were also able to use Raspberry pi technology to substitute otherwise expensive controllers and provide a 
cost-effective solution to local alarms and noncritical control. The PLC was also able to assist in the 
management of a backup system for fan failure and door control in the Clustered Isolation rooms. This backup 
system provided an n+1 design solution that further protected health care workers and visitors in the event of 
fan failure in the airborne infectious isolation rooms.

Abstract 
 
The performance of an extruder is critical to the success of an additive manufacturing process. This study presents a 
framework for the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of an extruder for additive manufacturing. Aluminum based on its 
lightweight and stainless steel due to its hot hardness property were selected as the extruder component and its heating 
band respectively with adequate insulation. The thermal modelling and simulation of the extruder were carried out in 
the ANSYS R19.0 environment. The indicators for the evaluation of the modelled parts were the total heat flux, 
temperature distribution and the direction heat flux. The results show that there is an increase in the magnitude of the 
heat flux around the region occupied by the heating barrel where plastic deformation takes place as a result of heating. 
The heat flux input however was sufficient to plastically deform the polymeric material. The effect of the insulation 
around the heating barrel shows capacity for temperature reduction. Hence, this work will assist manufacturers who 
employs additive manufacturing technology for product development in the optimal design of an extruder. The FEA 
module can be incorporated into the overall framework for the extruder development to permit an iterative process.

1. Introduction  
Additive Manufacturing deals with the creation of 3D objects with precise geometric shapes via Computer Aided 
Design (CAD) and subsequent deposition layer by layer which is in contrast to the traditional manufacturing which 
often requires machining (Manghnani, et al., 2015; Regina et al., 2018). Prominent among the additive manufacturing

Figure 5 shows the directional heat flux of the extruder. This is a function of the change in temperature, thermal 
conductivity as well as the direction of the heat transfer.  The magnitude of the directional heat flux of the extruder 
ranges between a minimum value of -6851.8 W/m2 and a  maximum value of 564662 W/m2 respectively.

4. Conclusion 
The discussion above focused on a specific product application amounting to a framework for the development of an 
extruder for an additive manufacturing technology as presented. The thermal modelling as well as the finite element 
analysis of a screw type extruder for additive manufacturing were carried out in the ANSYS R19.0 environment. The 
results show effective heat distribution within the heating and the magnitude of the heat flux around the region 
occupied by the heating barrel which indicate evidence of plastic deformation of material without burn out of the 
polymeric material due to heating. Hence, this work will assist manufacturers who employ additive manufacturing 
technology for product development in the optimal design of extruder. The Finite Element Analysis module (FEA 
module) could be incorporated into the development framework to permit an iterative process for the determination 
of the optimum range of temperature based on the required service requirements and the material’s properties. Future 
works can consider the use of physical experimentations in order to validate the results obtained numerically before 
advancing to the prototyping stage.

Abstract 
 
The challenge of the economic performance is becoming more and more heavy on the companies in a context of 
diversified constraints imposed by their macro-system, indeed, by their environment. It is obvious that the performance 
of production systems is directly proportional to the level of safety of their resources. In this perimeter, our work aims 
to improve one of attributes of the dependability of production systems, which is the safety, during all phases of a 
system's life, by using a system approach developed and applied to the safety, we have called it ""The Production 
System Safety Approach"". It allows to harmonize the safety to the different processes of the company in general, and 
to harmonize it to the production process in particular. It is based on our hypothesis of safety of classes of subsystems 
and interactions according to the general hierarchical diagram of a system, making reference to our development of a 
new tool called ""Plan of Microscopic Analysis of Risks related to Classes of Subsystems (or MARCS Plan)"".

1. Introduction 
 
The systemic (the system approach) fixed the principles characterizing the natural character that ensures the 
equilibrium for any system, whatever its nature and structure. It has given to the concept of system its deserved value, 
by taking it out of the cage from the closure designed by the reductionists (the Cartesians) towards the opening on its 
environment (Hallioui and Herrou, 2020). As early as 1951, the Austrian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, in a major 
article published in the journal Human Biology under the title ""General Systems Theory"", formulated an innovative 
concept of complex of interacting elements (Institut Numérique, 2014). He said ""A system can be defined as complex 
of interacting elements (Bertalanffy, 1968) "", which developed and popularized the concept of system. The Systemic 
constitutes, according to the Bertalanffy's own words, ""a new philosophy of nature"" (Turchany, 2020). For a system, 
the complexity, the criticality of tasks to be accomplished and the environmental realities are all constraints that justify 
the need for irreproachable safety in continuous improvement. 
The process or production improvement and safety are two important factors to any successful manufacturing 
company (Boudinot et al., 2017). At first, the implementation of ergonomics in manufacturing to reduce injuries and 
improve efficiencies requires communication between safety, quality and production professionals (Schwerha et al., 
2020), so, in the frame of the process approach which is the application of the system approach for the company, by 
considering this latter as a system, but the system according to its paradigm provided by the systemic! In fact, it is the 
application of the systemic in the optic of the organization in general: We can define the safety as an immersed and 
active part or process with others (as production and all process) within a larger whole which is the company.  
One concept that has developed recently is the concept of safety/ production compatibility (Boudinot et al., 2017; 
McLain and Jarrell, 2007). Although an integrated approach is thought to be very important to bringing safety and 
productivity together, companies may struggle finding compatibility between working safely and being productive!

2017 ; Westgaard and Winkel, 2011). For the production systems safety, we have recently thought to establish a 
""Production System Safety Approach"", based on our hypothesis of safety of classes of subsystems and interactions for 
a studied system, based on a system analysis enveloping its safety. The deployment of this new system approach

This work is carried out with a view of our contribution to the development of approaches for improving the 
production system performance, and allowing companies from all industries around the world to be more robust and 
easily adapted to changes in their environment in terms of dependability in general, and safety in particular. This is 
thanks to a dynamic vision attached to a system approach in the area of production systems safety. 
The Production System Safety Approach, as a systemic approach applied to the safety attribute in the context of 
dependability of a production system, requires a common commitment and responsibility between the entire 
hierarchical line of operation or production and that of safety (or quality, depending to the structure) of the 
organization. By fusing the work instructions and the risk assessment in the same company item, we obtain the 
MARCS Plan, which unlike other safety tools, it allows a risk score reduction and a very considerable time saving 
through its special risk assessment procedures (Fig. 4 and Fig.5), as well as the staff involvement through the safety 
and the improvement of their know-how, and consequently an irreproachable optimization of the safety and the 
productivity of a production system in the industrial area. 
Our research perspective in the context of the approach we have established in this article (the Production System 
Safety Approach) is the realization of a case study of the Production System Safety Approach in the chemical industry. 
At this point we recall thanks to our experience in the chemical industry with the OCP Group and according to the 
Newspaper Le Site Info (2018), that this international phosphate leader obtained the gold medal of the International 
Fertilizer Association (IFA) on Wednesday, November 14, 2018, on the sidelines of the IFA Strategic Forum in 
Beijing, China, and it is for its commitment in HSE at the level of its industrial complexes: it can optimize its 
performance in terms of safety and productivity by applying the Production System Safety Approach. In this 
perspective, we can estimate the results of the application of our approach at the level of OCP Group's industrial sites: 
• 
The fusion of the work instructions and risk assessment in a single item (document) called the MARCS plan 
for the company, which reinforces the coordination between the safety hierarchical line and the other 
hierarchical lines at the level of the production divisions of OCP Group. This is the result of the application 
of the process approach with the aim of optimizing safety, which is (the process approach) only the system 
approach applied to the company. Indeed, the fusion is the result of our direct execution of the teleology 
postulate which was the basis of the systems theory which is one of the foundations of the system approach; 
• 
The transformation of a significant percentage of the total critical risks to preliminary risks, by reducing the 
threshold making the transition from preliminary to critical risk. In fact, risks with a score (SR) equal to 20 
must also be considered critical risks (currently they are considered acceptable at OCP Group sites!); 
• 
Acceleration of action plans and time savings of 6 to 12 months for the prevention or even elimination of a 
very considerable percentage of all critical risks. Indeed, thanks to our system approach applied to the safety 
of production systems, critical risks with a score (SR) between 66 and 70 are also to be included in a plan of 
measures to be taken immediately and no longer in 6 to 12 months (currently risks of 20<=SR<=70 require 
measures to be taken in the short term, i.e., to be taken in 6 to 12 months).

Abstract 
Various problems interconnected with traditional procurement methods have generated more pressure to the 
stakeholders and end user in the construction sector to seek for new and latest operational procurement methods. 
Project alliance is one of the acceptable methods of procurement, this is an incentive based relationship contracts 
where parties agree to work together as one integrated team in a relationship. So therefore, this study aimed to 
quantitatively assess the benefits of project alliance among contractors in Nigerian construction industry. This study 
is a survey research that used questionnaires to gathered information from selected contractors. Mean Item Score 
(MIS) and Standard Deviation (SD) were used in analyzing data retrieved from the respondents. Results indicated that 
achieving synergy and competitive advantage, risk- sharing, ease entry of new environment, reduction in the threat of 
competition among contractors were the top benefits of a successful project alliance among construction contractors 
in Nigeria. The study therefore recommended that contractors in the construction industry need to be well enlightened 
through conferences, seminars and workshops on how to fully embrace project alliance within and outside the industry, 
strong contractual mechanism/legal backing should be made when entering into project alliance, the Nigerian 
government should develop policies that will encourage the formation of project alliances by given one main project 
to three or more construction firms which are ready to form an alliance. Recommendations from the study can also be 
applicable to other developing countries with similar way, method and style of project execution as Nigeria.

Abstract 
Strategic Alliance is a collaborative agreement between two or more companies to develop a joint strategy on certain 
operation, in which all sides take a win-win attitude. Since the implementation of strategic alliances in the construction 
industry, there has been a great significant impact on financial performance in any approach this procurement model 
takes. In line with the development, this study contributed to the research field within the strategic alliance 
procurement in the construction industry by focusing on the impact of the strategic alliance on Nigerian construction 
industry's financial performance in order to enhance awareness of strategic alliance in the Nigerian construction 
industry. The study embraced survey design in gathering information from questionnaires given to construction 
professionals. Mean Item Score (MIS) and Kruskal-Wallis Test (K-W) were used in analyzing data gathered from 
three hundred and sixty-three (363) respondents. Cronbach’s α test was utilized to check the reliability level of the 
instrument used. It was indicted from the paper that ‘open door to new funding opportunities, ability to accrue 
economies of scale and scope in value-added activities, easy cash flow coordination’ are the major effect of strategic 
alliance on the financial performance of Nigerian construction industry. The study also recommended that there should 
be a developed structure and standardized form of sharing formulae for profit and financial report should be given 
when required to ensuring openness with better understanding between both parties in other to prevent rift and lack of 
trust for each other. Although this study was carried in Nigeria, it recommendations can be applicable to other 
developing countries with the same pattern and method of construction.

Abstract 
 
History proves the permanent and incessant change of the competitive environment of the company, putting it in 
a stifling field of competitiveness, which forces the companies around the world to commit to the permanent 
optimization of their economic performance based on the continuous improvement of their production resources, in 
particular their material manufacturing systems, and this is linked to the need for continuous renewal and development 
of approaches to improve their dependability, aiming to manage the manufacturing systems with a multidimensional, 
flexible and crossroads approach of control and optimization, making the optimal dependability and the minimum cost 
of maintenance of the integrity of a material manufacturing system two faces of a same species. In this perimeter, our 
research work aims to improve the reliability and maintainability attributes of a system in all its life phases and within 
a field of maintenance cost constraints of its sub-systems, by establishing a system approach applied to reliability and 
maintainability, making the bridge from the science of failures and breakdowns to the discipline of mathematical 
programming that is part of the science of operations research. It is in view of our dynamic vision allowing us to 
perceive the holistic character of production system.

1. Introduction 
 
As early as 1951, the Austrian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, in a major article published in the journal Human 
Biology under the title ""General Systems Theory"", formulated an innovative concept of complex interacting elements 
(Institut Numérique, 2014). He said ""A system can be defined as complex of interacting elements (Bertalanffy, 1968)"", 
which developed and popularized the concept of system (Hallioui and Herrou, 2020). The Systemic constitutes, 
according to the Bertalanffy's own words, ""a new philosophy of nature"" (Turchany, 2020). For a system, the 
complexity and criticality of the tasks to be accomplished and the environmental realities are constraints that justify 
the need for irreproachable and permanent improvement in terms of reliability and maintainability. According to the 
literature, the 1960s and 1970s were marked by attempts to generalize the probabilistic approach ""reliability theory"", 
which was so successful, to other components such as mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, then software and human 
components, after electronic components in aeronautics, defense and nuclear during the 1940s and 1950s. The 1960s 
and 1970s were also characterized by the extension of the approach to the return to normal, to reliability is added 
Maintainability (Leroy and Signoret, 1992). 
Nowadays, the production systems must be highly competitive (Díaz-Reza and García-Alcaraz, 2019), it is the aim 
for which the system reliability optimization is a living problem, with solutions methodologies that have evolved with 
the advancements of mathematics, development of new engineering technology, and changes in management 
perspectives (Coit and Zio, 2019). Indeed, the optimization of production system reliability, maintainability and 
maintenance cost is one of main objectives for the industrial managers and the researchers since maintainability has 
just been added to reliability, in fact, since the extension of reliability theory. The methodologies of this optimization

72","5.2.3. Solving both Linear Mathematical Problems (LMP.R and LMP.M) & Interpretations 
 
The resolution of linear mathematical programs can generally be done by the Simplex method or other methods 
that require iterations, several lines and even several pages (analytically), which puts the industrial managers under 
the enormous constraint of time, and in view of the need to make quick tests (sometimes in performance meetings) on 
the mathematical models of the problems of optimization of the reliability and maintainability of systems attached to 
a minimization of the maintenance costs of the interacting subsystems of the 1st class for a studied production material 
system. We aim at the ease of the resolution task, proposing the work with the SOLVER Macro in the Excel 
environment, which only requires the introduction of the complete and correct mathematical program, to undertake 
the resolution of our previously formulated canonical form optimization problems. 
The SOLVER is a present function in Excel. It is a very powerful tool that allows both optimization and allocation 
of resources. This tool is often used to solve equations. Indeed, it allows to find the minimum, maximum or closest 
value to a data while respecting the constraints. The solver therefore has the power to give the best solution, i.e. the 
optimum. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The current concept of dependability can be defined as ""the totality of an entity's abilities to achieve the specified 
functional performances, at the right time, for the expected duration, without damage to itself and its environment 
(CNAM, 2001)"". This recent definition of dependability was taken from a technical report carried out in 2001, by the 
French National Observatory of Arts and Crafts. Thanks to: Our dynamic and global vision of the system allowed by 
the systemic, in fact, attached to a systemic thinking opposite to the analytical thinking (classical or Cartesian-
analytical); An exhaustive definition of the new paradigm of system defined by the systemic, which was given by 
Rosnay (1975), who wrote that ""a system is a set of elements in dynamic interaction, organized according to a goal""; 
Our general hierarchical diagram of a system showing the classes of its subsystems and the different interactions (Fig. 
1), indeed, by considering the holistic character of the company and its interacting production resources, especially its 
production material systems. & In the framework of the development of approaches to improve the science of 
breakdowns and failures, in particular its reliability and maintainability components: Our Production System 
Reliability and Maintainability Approach can respond perfectly to the requirements of industrialists in all sectors in 
terms of the maximum functional performance of their production material systems crossed with their lowest possible 
maintenance costs. By allowing the irreproachable mastery of the maintenance costs optimization, the reliability, the 
maintainability and consequently the availability of the interacting sub-systems of the first class of a studied system. 
By consciousness and in view of the complexity of solving linear mathematical programs in addition to the 
considerable amount of time required to do so, we prefer working with the data analysis cell thanks to the SOLVER 
complement of Excel, which is used often and in a diverse field of applications, such as the maximization and the 
minimization of objective functions in the field of economy, the industry in general, the construction industry and 
military in particular.  
Our research perspectives were conceived only during the development of the sections of this paper, in particular, 
the section developing the deployment of our production system reliability and maintainability approach , as well as 
the section describing the pillars of system maintainability, where we thought deeply to integrate the commitment and 
tenacity of the company (from top management to line operators) in a Total Productive Maintenance project, as a 
system approach oriented towards improving the efficiency of the production system and making one of the 
foundations of the company's management philosophy (management culture). In this context, we proclaim that we 
will work on two next research projects that will be the object of two primary works entitled: The Total Productive 
Maintenance, from a System Approach Applied to the Company and making a Principle of Quality Management to 
the Company Culture Regeneration; Optimization of the System Maintainability in a Distributed Context on the 
Company.

Abstract  
 
Despite all the positive contributions of artisanal and small-scale businesses  to a nation’s Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), some of the small-scale businesses failures may be traced back to the lack of proper adequate organizational 
structure, organizational management, organizational governance and lack of proper accounting systems. Even in 
the smallest business key tasks and functions must be performed regularly. Stock must be purchased, bills must be 
paid, customers must be served, and customer queries must be accounted for. Therefore, interdependence of 
functions of organization units are of significance in a successful business. The autonomy of structure units for 
small-scale and artisanal operations are scarce. This paper will discuss the benefits of functions interdependence 
between and autonomy of organization structure in the case of a small-scale processing of sandstone. Accrued 
increased productivity as well as business life span extension will be presented as benefit assuring business 
sustainability.

Abstract  
Existing literature has shown an absence of organizational structure in the case of artisanal and small-scale mineral 
related businesses. Artisanal operators, and small-scale processors have run their businesses without any formal 
procedure, systems or mechanisms of implementing business attributes. Due to the above reasons, small-scale 
entrepreneurial mineral businesses are often short-lived. This paper reports on the current situation of organizational 
structure in the case of artisanal clinker production, small-scale processing of sandstone and small-scale processing 
of slate. A model business organizational structure will be discussed as it will be leveraging on the application of 
engineering management skills. Its recommended implementation, at least to sandstone small scale processors, is 
expected to contribute to an improved productivity, hence a wealthy and attractive bottom line. While being pushed 
for use by existing operators, it will then serve as a reference to uprising minerals businesses entrepreneurs.

Abstract 
It is stated that one is living in the age of information but other argue that it is in fact the age of measurement. The 
information has always been there. Today on is able to measure the surface temperatures of planets on distance 
solar systems. The process and minerals industry need along aside their actual in-situ process conditions (eg 
melting of charge in a smelter or progressing value dissolution during acid leaching in a Pachucas), a simulated 
real-time version of the actual in-situ environmental conditions. This allows the collection of real-time samples 
of the virtual system and experiment with in order to learn how the simulated changes impact the actual outcome. 
A mine or a minerals processing plant should be able to conduct many hundred of tests per day on the sampled 
data in order to effect future outcome. High performance computers can make live continuous research of a virtual 
system possible with the added benefit that multiple scenarios can be researched simultaneously, giving 
opportunity to operations managers and researchers the ability to forecast different outcomes that suit their 
respective needs. This type of continuous research allows for optimisation of different part of the mine or plant. 
This paper sheds light on such live continuous research possibility and opportunity.

Abstract 
While the explosion in data in many of the technology-lead industries seems to grow larger each year unabated, 
other industries are yet to get off the mark altogether. The collaboration of data pipelines could see legacy 
industries begin to make great leaps towards becoming platforms for scientific, financial and other technical 
research. However, a dichotomy exists between the fruitful existence that these industries promise; and the legacy 
that follows the mining and minerals processing industries in South Africa. Confidentiality in mines and minerals 
industry hampers the collaboration between industry, financial and socio-economic researchers.  
The time has come to convert mines and minerals operations into data source platforms from which experts and 
other stakeholders can make meaningful contributions; as is the case with financial data in stock markets. Mines 
and minerals processing plants generate large amounts of data; when the companies withhold this data, they risk 
falling behind the technology bullrun that has seen many industries be disrupted for the better. On the other hand, 
the benefits of making the operations data-bases available is far much greater. From this data, the science 
community can create useful metric that can then be used to measure the actual performance of one mine against 
another.

Abstract 
Addressing todays’ challenges helps in proactively solving tomorrows problems.  Quantum computing is a 
progressive new way of performing computation to fast solve complex classical problems.  This new way is based 
on quantum mechanics principles combined with Boolean logic. Minerals and extractive industries face complex 
problems involving large number of variables; with many of those variables being inter-dependants. The new 
approach to these problems would be the use of quantum computing as it is believed to possess a large advantage 
over classical computation in terms of speed of computerised simulation and optimisation. To simulate the 
optimisation of cobalt recovery during the acid leaching of heterogenite ore, quantum states will be used. A Co 
recovery greater than 70 % in leaching is represented by a logical binary state of |1> where the Co dissolution 
recovery less than 70% is represented by the logical binary state of |0>. Once the logical gates are designed, a 
circuit will be formed and calculated. This paper discusses the results obtained using both quantum and classical 
computation to the problem. Limitations and advantages regarding quantum computing will be discussed as well.

Abstract 
The trivalent cobalt (Co3+), mainly found in the heterogenite [Co(Cu)OOH] has been reported to hardly dissolve 
in conventional acids such as sulphuric acid. The cobalt leaching yield in such cases is as low as less than 10% . 
The dissolution of cobalt bearing minerals in acidic media but in presence of reducing agent like [SO2 ] increased 
the cobalt leaching yield to 90% in some cases. On the other hand, Co often found associated with Cu occurs non 
only in easy to process ores but some in complex ores like mixed sulphides, mixed oxides or mixed sulphides and 
oxides. The increase in cobalt bearing mineralogical complexity hinders the ease for the metal extraction. 
Dispersed attempts to address encountered cases are abundant but a consolidated data base of the process route 
for a sustainable cobalt recovery from its ores is missing.  This paper will discuss an elaboration of an expert 
systems for cobalt and copper recovery by leaching from their complex ores. An expert system is a computer 
program platform designed to mimic human intelligence and decision making skills in a given situation. To 
establish a workable expert system, an appropriate database and optimisation algorithms are required. Secondary 
data showing the observed co and cu recovery yields were collected from literature spanning from 2010 to 2020. 
Parameters as feed grade, types and strengths of reagents used, percentage recovery and the mineralogical 
variability were the targeted inputs. The selection of appropriate optimisation algorithms for the prediction of 
optimal Cobalt and copper recoveries will be discussed.

Abstract 
Coal is a combustible black or brownish rock with high amount of carbon and hydrocarbons. The evidence 
of each coal build-up is controlled by home grown species from which the coal emanated. The fossil resins 
are organic material with polymeric nature, very similar in appearance to artificial or natural plant resin . 
Hence, the fossil resins are often adulterated with the modern resin. Fossil resins are the most valuable 
material associated with coal. Resin has a decorative appearance and is used in jewellery . It is also used as 
a healing agent in folk medicine. According to Market insider the market value of resin is R17.61 per kg and 
coal price is 0.85c per kg. Low recovery of resin from coal has led to resin being discarded with tailing which 
is not economic for the coal industry.  While coal may be recovered as a by-product when coal bearing 
resins is processed with microwaves (in multi- mode as well as in single mode)  through selective heating, 
microwave radiation was used as an effective way of extracting resin from resin bearing coal. The paper 
discusses the dual optimisation of resin and coal recovery.

Abstract 
 
The study reviewed various Asphalt performance modes to identify key failure modes and possible 
mitigation mechanism. The failure modes are analyzed on both high and low weather conditions. The main 
failure modes under discussions are rutting and cracking which arises under two weather conditions hot and 
cold weather respectively. A research site (for the development of instrumented pavement test strips) of 3.4 
m lane road of 0.5km has been identified on two strategic regions to gather data under various traffic 
conditions for both winter and summer. The preliminary laboratory results indicate between 10-15 % 
reductions in Bitumen quantity per ton of Asphalt which approximately equate to 8 – 12% reduction in 
costs.  (0.625 plastic -fly ash ratio)The elastic modulus improves by 5-8% due to Fly Ash enhancing the 
asphalt flexibility, its temperature range and susceptibility to thermal cracking. The plastic increases 
rheological properties of Asphalt. The study focuses on sustainable alternatives or combinations of 
innovative materials which are cost effective and environmentally friendly to improve the performance and 
durability of Asphalt materials for various application i.e. design, construct and maintenance. The 
instrumented pavement test strips are vital for field performance simulation and evaluation.

Abstract  
 
In developing countries as well as in emerging economy countries, mining activities for minerals 
endowed countries contribute in a bigger junk into their GDP. Unfortunately, towns developed around 
mines have been found extinguished as soon as mining activities cease. As the mines closed, towns 
around them or grown around mining activity turn into ghost towns. In South Africa Welkom, far west of 
Johannesburg and many others previously evolved around gold mining have seen their economic values 
and attractiveness decreased. This paper discusses the current situation of mining activities in Kuruman, 
Kathu and Hotazel towns of John Taolo Gaetsewe District Municipality (JTGDM) [Free State, South 
Africa]. Not limited to questionnaires, interviews, surveys and analysis of documents, multiple methods 
in the collection and analysis of data were used. This paper elevates the relationship between the mining 
corporations and other affected stakeholders in those towns and their importance thereof. It is revealed 
that the current situation in JTGDM towns will have a negative outlook beyond mining operations. Thus, 
the paper ends with a discussion of strategies to avoid JTGDM towns to turn into ghost towns after the 
mining of manganese ore and iron ore in those areas will cease; hence strategies for sustainability for 
post-mining operations is the core content of the paper.

Abstract 
 
Galvanising processes consume excessive amount of energy, and hence energy demand forecasting is a vital economic 
index for these plants. This paper discusses the relevant electricity consumption drivers for a galvanising plant for a 
prescribed baseline period. With electricity as the energy source, boundaries conditions were defined over a one year 
baseline period. The galvanised product tonnage, amount of zinc used, number dips per month, and the ambient 
temperature conditions were identified as the relevant consumption drivers. Two approaches that include regression 
analysis and genetic algorithm were used to predict future energy demand for a galvanising plant. The genetic 
algorithm model was found to be less prone to estimation errors when compared to regression method.  
 
Keywords  
Electricity Consumption, Regression Analysis, Genetic Algorithm. 
    
1. Introduction 
Several industrial facilities are facing challenges in implementing methodologies used to establish and document 
energy baselines for improving their energy performance (Kanneganti et al. 2017). It is imperative that industrial 
facilities deploy appropriate energy performance indicators, which underpin energy-related performance monitoring 
and measurement. Galvanising processes are characterised by excessive consumption of energy, be it electricity, 
natural gas or solid fuels, and this driven by several relevant variables such as ambient temperature, production rate, 
and wind speed on the molten zinc surface (Maaß and Peißker 2011). Galvanising processes consume excessive 
amount of energy, and hence energy demand forecasting is a vital economic index for these plants. The focus of this 
paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of regression analysis and Genetic Algorithm and select the best approach 
for predicting the demand for electricity consumption in a galvanising plant.

2.1 Hot dip galvanising process 
The hot dip galvanizing process is a multifarious metallurgical process whereby a steel material is immersed into a 
molten zinc or zinc alloy bath that is typically between 450ºC and 480ºC of temperature (Dewa et al. 2016). Figure 1 
illustrates a typical flow diagram for the hot dip galvanising process.

5. Conclusion 
A multivariate regression analysis was carried out to determine the predictor variables for electricity consumption by 
the galvaniser and the amount of zinc used for the galvanising process was used to derive an energy consumption 
model for the process. A strong correlation between the electricity consumption and amount of zinc used by the 
galvanising process was noted from the scatter plot and a baseline regression model was derived. GA was applied to 
predict energy demand for the galvanizer using the relevant variables stated in the regression model. The results 
demonstrated that the estimations from genetic algorithm were closer to the actual data with less MAPE than that of 
estimated by regression, an indication that GA was more accurate than regression.

Abstract 
 
 In developing countries as well as in emerging economy countries, mining activities for minerals endowed 
countries contribute in a bigger junk into their GDP. Unfortunately, towns developed around mines have 
been found extinguished as soon as mining activities cease as operations downscaling and closure of mines 
often are inevitable due to either depletion of the Run Of Mine (ROM) or lack of appropriate and adequate 
mining technologies for environmentally friendly and safer operations mine or due to a global market price 
decline of the specific commodity. As soon as the mine is closed, towns around them or grown around 
mining activity turn into ghost towns. In South Africa Welkom, far west of Johannesburg and many others 
previously evolved around gold mining have seen their economic values and attractiveness decreased.  
 
This research investigates the current situation of mining activities in Kuruman, Kathu and Hotazel of John 
Taolo Gaetsewe District Municipality (JTGDM) towns. The study will show the relationship between the 
mining corporations and other affected stakeholders in those towns and their importance thereof. The

interviews, surveys and analysis of documents. The study reveals that the current situation in JTGDM towns 
will have a negative outlook beyond mining operations. Thus, the paper will discuss strategies to avoid 
JTGDM towns to turn into ghost towns after the mining of manganese ore and iron ore in those areas will 
cease. Strategies for sustainability for post-mining operations will be the core of the paper.

Abstract  
Diesel engines have significant application in transport, agriculture and power generation as prime movers for both 
medium and heavy-duty machinery including electric generators in power plants. However, the engines convert less 
than 40% of fuel power to useful work with the rest being lost through the exhaust and cooling systems. Through 
waste heat recovery technology, the low grade heat in the cooling system can be recovered effectively with the organic 
Rankine cycle.   The objective of this study is to increase the efficiency of a diesel engine for fuel economy and reduce 
CO2 emissions through waste heat recovery from both the cooling and exhaust systems.  Heat exchangers were 
proposed and designed for optimum heat recovery from both the exhaust and the coolant for a low temperature 
application in cereal drying. Shell and tube heat exchangers are designed and modelled using computer software. The 
amount of energy extracted from the exhaust is 90.5 KW while that from the coolant is 95 KW with the heat exchangers 
having an effectiveness of 0.68 and 0.58 respectively. The recovered energy is used to heat air up to 55ºC, which is 
directed into a cereal dryer which is designed for maize drying, but can be used for other  cereals. At a drying cycle 
of 10 minutes, 58 kg of maize can be dried effectively.

1. Introduction 
There is a global commitment by the world community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and mitigate against 
global warming and related consequences (Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2020b). Engines loose significant recoverable 
quantity of energy in fuel through exhaust gases and the cooling system which can be recovered and put to useful 
application (Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2020c, 2020d). There is also need to reduce fuel consumption because of polluting 
emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion  that include SO2, CO2, NOx, particulates, and CO through efficiency 
measures and heat recovery techniques  ( Ravi, Vijayakumar, Kumar & Gunaseelan, 2015).   Significant amount of 
diesel fuel power used in diesel engines is released to the environment as heat in the exhaust and cooling system 
(Kabeyi, 2019; Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2020a). According to Talib, et al (2017) there is need to use technology to 
improve engine fuel economy without increasing fuel related carbon emissions. For an internal combustion engine, as 
much as 34% of waste energy in the exhaust can be utilized.  
 
 In gasoline engines up to 21 % of fuel energy lost through the exhaust can be utilized. Of the total energy in fuel 
supplied to an engine, 30 to 40% can be converted to useful mechanical power output (Tiwari, Vasnami, Kumar & 
Labana, 2017).   Generally, an internal combustion engine releases 30-40% of the fuel energy from combustion 
through the exhaust to the environment and an almost equal amount through the engine coolant (Wilson John M. R., 
et al., 2017).  This energy is just sufficient for recovery and for use in many thermal applications with minimal heat 
losses in the designed waste heat recovery system (Milkov, Evtimov & Punov, 2012). Recovery of this heat would 
greatly reduce the overall amount of fuel required for both primary and auxiliary uses resulting in cost saving and in 
less production of pollutants like NOX and SO2 while producing the same power (Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2020b, 2020c). 
Ultimately, waste heat recovery from engines is a strategy in mitigating against excessive use of fossil fuels which 
cause environmental degradation and can also be used in reduction of process heating costs and fuel energy costs. Bari 
& Hossan (2013) observed that the exhaust of a diesel engine can be used to supply extra mechanical power using the 
Rankine cycle with water as a working fluid with about 38% extra power potential with optimum pressure of about 
30 bars. Figure 1 below shows the distribution of fuel energy in an internal combustion engine.

119","5.0 Waste Heat Cereal Dryer  
      Cereals can be defined as edible grain of grass family e.g. maize, wheat, rice, sorghum, millet, and oats. An 
important step before storage of grains for future use is drying to remove excess moisture (Mckevith, 2004).    
Food drying or dehydration is the process of removing water from food by circulation of hot air through it. This 
process effectively prohibits growth of enzymes and bacteria which is necessary to preserve cereals. The various 
drying methods available include sun drying, solar drying, freeze drying, and oven drying (Ahmed, et al, 2013).  
In this study, drying is done by hot air with heat extracted from the engine cooling and exhaust systems.   
5.1. Cereal grain dryer design 
To design a cereal dryer, outdoor air temperature of 24oC and the relative humidity (RH) of 69%, which are the 
average values in a typical town are used (FAO, 1983). The air undergoes sensible heating to 55oC. From the 
psychrometric chart, relative humidity of the incoming air is obtained as 12%. With the initial moisture content 
of maize being at 20%, air volume required to remove 1kg of water is 221.71m3/kg vapour which translates to air 
volume flow rate of 1.2937m3/s. For a 10 min discharge, the total volume of air required is 776.22m3. This volume 
removes 4.975kg of water, which translates to 58kg of maize in one drying operation. Taking density of maize to 
be 720kg/m3, the volume of maize, which equals the volume of the dryer, becomes 0.081m3. To accommodate 
for closing lids and a hopper, the total volume is taken as 1m3. This optimized design specifications are presented 
below in Table 5.

From table 5, the specifications of the maize dryer are summarized as capacity 58 kg for a cycle of 10 
minutes. 
5.2. Pump Selection 
Pumps are provided to facilitate fluid flow at the required pressure and flow rates. Water and air pumps are 
selected by use of flow rate-head pump performance curves. R134a has enough pressure when vaporized but 
requires a 220V, 600Wcompressor to boost pressure when it leaves the combined heat exchanger. All the pumps 
will be centrifugal pumps. The water pump required to provide a volumetric flow rate of 3.327 × 10−4𝑚𝑚3/𝑠𝑠 
(1.198𝑚𝑚3/ℎ𝑟𝑟), at a net head of 11.369m, has a power rating of 1.5 kW at 1450rpm. The air pump required to 
provide a volumetric flow rate of  1.2937𝑚𝑚3/𝑠𝑠 at a pressure drop of 2.25 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 has a power rating of 2.2KW at 
2900rpm. 
 
6. 0. Conclusion 
Waste heat recovery can be applied on engine systems with sufficient power output for economic heat recovery 
investment. In this study, recovered energy from the exhaust is 90.5KW while that of the coolant is 95KW with 
the effectiveness of 0.68 and 0.58 respectively. This change with the varying engine load and engine speeds. The 
results are analyzed at 80% load. This is the recommended load, by the engine manufacturer. Cooling medium 
leaving coolant heat exchanger has set temperatures to avoid temperatures dropping beyond the recommended 
engine jacket cooling temperatures, which could otherwise result in ineffective engine cooling because of under 
cooling. The design temperatures are 501.3℃ for the exhaust and 89℃ for the coolant, with the minimum 
temperature of recovery being 177℃ and 24℃ respectively. However, the design temperature for the exhaust is 
only realized at 80% engine load. For the heat exchanger to have a high effectiveness, the design engine load 
range can be set at 70-90%. When the engine is operating under an engine load outside the range, a valve-operated 
by-pass channel will release the exhaust to atmosphere, without passing through the heat exchanger.  The designed 
cereal dryer can dry 58kg of maize in one single operation with a discharge time of 10 min. The inlet temperature 
of air is 550C and the discharge time will vary with the moisture content in the cereals, with a higher discharge 
time for moisture contents above 20%. 
 
7.0. Recommendations 
The use of engine waste heat recovery should be enhance with more research into efficient recovery technologies 
and systems. Investment will remain viable when fuel costs remain high and governments put in place penalties 
and restrictions to CO2 emissions. Therefore policy initiatives are necessary to increase attractiveness and viability

Abstract 
 
The growing demand of cobalt has been influenced by the transition to a fourth industrial revolution which 
requires the use of smartphones, laptops, and electric cars. Cobalt (Co) and copper (Cu) are crucial components 
in the manufacturing of electronic devices. These metals are commonly extracted using hydromellurgical 
techniques through leaching in acidic mediums. The Leach/Solvent extraction/Electrowinning process route is 
commonly used in the extraction of Cu and Co  from complex ores. Atmospheric weathering, metamorphic and 
sedimentary changes undergone by sulphide minerals led to the formation of Cu and Co oxide mineral deposits. 
The mixture of oxide-sulphide minerals forms complex ores in addition to either oxides mixes or sulphide 
mixes. The depletion of surface-rich minerals has led to mining of deep ores with 70% oxidized minerals and 
30% sulphide minerals. This paper gives a critical assessment of the extraction of Cu and Co from complex 
ores. A qualitative research methodology was used in scrutinizing literature from 2010 to 2020. While 
heterogenite (CoO.OH), chrysocolla (Cu₂H₂Si₂O₅(OH)₄), malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2) and pseudomalachite 
(Cu5(PO4)2(OH)4) were the Co and Cu ores found in the literature, this paper will also elaborate on Co and Cu 
extraction from mixed oxides, mixed sulphides and mixed oxide-sulphide Co and Cu ores as the metals are 
finally recovered from their aqueous solution using LIX 63, LIX 64 and LIX 65 prior to their specific 
electrowinning.

Abstract  
The objective of this research is to minimize the environmental impact of municipal solid waste through 
the development of a waste to electricity Rankine cycle power plant to generate steam and electricity from 
municipal solid waste for Nairobi city as a solution to waste management challenges. Quantification of 
solid waste for the City was done to provide design data for sizing and selection of a solid mass burning 
boiler furnace. The study demonstrated that municipal solid waste can be used as fuel directly or as refuse 
derived fuel upon processing which enhances its properties for use in electricity production. The study 
proposes a power plant of capacity 12 MW processing 3000 tonnes of solid waste per day. The main 
elements of the plant are, a multi-fuel boiler, super heater, economizer, turbine, surface condenser and a 
cooling tower. The power plant can generate 72, 751,770 kWhrs of electricity annually. This will lead to 
avoided carbon emissions from fossil fuel power plants and hence make a contribution to the energy 
transition. Additionally waste to energy conversion reduces the weight of solid waste by 60 to 90% of the 
original weight making disposal easier. The electricity will be sold to the grid to generate revenue to 
improve solid waste management and other programs leading to sustainable environmental management 
for the city.

1. Introduction 
Energy recovery from waste or Waste-to-Energy (WtE) is an effective attractive value addition and waste management 
option for many countries. Various WtE technologies offer valuable energy, reduce the burden on the land in form of 
landfill disposal and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding decomposition and substitution of fossil fuel 
generated power (Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2020a, 2020b). Because of these benefits,  the global market for WtE 
technologies has experienced substantial growth (World Energy Council, 2013)  with now  over 1200 operating plants 
across 40 countries (Ghosh, 2014).The Waste-to-energy power plants burn municipal solid waste (MSW) to generate 
steam in a boiler that is used to run a Rankine cycle steam turbine to generate (Qingbin et al., 2020). Municipal Solid 
Waste is a mixture of energy-rich materials like paper, plastics, yard waste, and products made from wood as well as 
noncombustible materials. For every 100 kg of MSW in the United States, about 85 kg can be burned as fuel to 
generate electricity (Barasa, 2020). The  Waste-to-energy power  reduce can reduce 2,000 kg  of MSW  to ash weighing 
about 300 kg to 600 kg,  while the volume of MSW can be reduced  about 87% (US Energy Department, 2020; Yap 
& Nixon, 2015). 
 
The world urban population grew to reach 50% of the global population in 2015 and is expected to reach 70% of the 
world population by the year 2050 with developing countries accounting for most of this growth. Africa’s urban 
population is expected to grow from 470 million in 2015 to 1.2 billion by 2050. This is expected to come along with 
significant challenges of municipal solid waste (MENR, 2017).  According to the World Bank (2012) the rate of 
growth of solid waste will outpace the rate of urbanization. It is projected that municipal solid waste was to grow from 
0.64 kg/person per day in 2002 to 1.2 kg/person per day in 2012 or 1.3 billion tons per year, and 1.42 kg per person 
per day or 2.2 billion tons by the year 2025.

ABSTRACT 
This study is a review of the role of biogas from agricultural biomass in the energy transition in a 
multipurpose application for supply of electricity, heat energy and fertilizer to support agriculture. The 
global concerns and commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the related global warming has 
set in motion effort to identify and promote renewable energy sources like biogas. Biogas can be produced 
from any biodegradable biomass under suitable conditions making it possible for rural based smallholder 
farmers to effectively participate in the global energy transition to renewable and low carbon grid electricity. 
With development of decentralization of grid power generation, smallholder farmers can generate biogas 
and use it to run grid connected electricity generator to earn revenue and reduce the demand on grid s 
electricity. However  many digesters fail and remain idle in developing countries due to lack of adequate 
operation and maintenance knowledge while conversion technologies available remain advanced and 
complex for the smallholder farmers. With proper process management, the digestate will substitute 
chemical fertilizers with additional financial benefits and fertility management. The farmers will also meet 
their entire heating requirements from a well-designed and sized biogas plant.  The overall objective of this 
study was to identify measures and technologies that can be adopted by farmers to generate power for own 
use and export to the power grid while meeting other energy and farming requirements for sustainable 
agriculture. The study showed that biogas from agricultural wastes can play a leading role in the energy 
transition to green and low carbon sources for grid electricity, but a sustainable biogas system has to be 
multipurpose to make social economic sense to smallholder farmers.   The study recommends modifications 
on bio-digesters and the use of the Stirling engine to generate electricity at farm level though other feasible 
conversion technologies are available. For viability of grid supply, state incentives like attractive feed in 
tariffs are necessary.  
Key words: Biogas; Challenges of biogas production; Biogas production process; biogas engine; bio-digesters;

1.0 Introduction 
 
The challenges of heat and electricity generation, its sustainability, cost involved, environmental issues have generated 
interest in in alternative sources of energy and technology globally (Kabeyi & Oludalapo, 2020; Ndereba, 2014).  
Energy plays a critical role for economic growth and development, thus its availability as a key indicator as well as 
ingredient of economic growth of any country. Traditional energy though appropriate face different challenges that 
affect the economic growth and adaptation (Scriba, 1999). Majority of the in developing countries are smallholder 
farmers who rear livestock and undertake mixed farming (Chen et al, 2017). With low electricity penetration and 
poverty, access to grid electricity is limited, yet they still need electricity for several application and heat for cooking 
and other heating applications. As a result they rely on polluting fossil fuels, and wood which accounts for accounts 
for 61% of the total energy sources (Karuiki, 2009). Non-oil producing country also face the challenge of fossil fuel 
price instability and pressure on foreign exchange (Chen et al, 2017). This calls for a sustainable solution to save the 
forests and environment while to the majority rural households through biogas generation and use.

warming.  
8. Conclusion 
This study recommends a multipurpose approach in the design of farm based biogas systems that will address the 
electricity needs, heating requirements, land fertility and waste management at farm level. A Stirling engine is 
proposed although there are several other gas to electricity conversion systems which include fuel cells, micro turbines, 
diesel engines, Otto cycle or petrol engines or the gasification technology with gas turbine. Redesign for improvement 
on available digester designs is recommended for adequate operation and maintenance at farm level especially for 
smallholder farmers.   The normal electrical wiring will be required in the farm and all connected to the generator 
and/or chemical battery for electrical use while allowing for grid connection to facilitate both import and export of 
electricity from the biogas system.  Since the generator will not be running at all time, when the gas produced is in 
excess, the farmer will seek to generate electricity and store it for later use. Biogas can be used for electricity generation 
at household level or grid supply, direct heat application or bio-methanation to enrich and package in containers for 
sale mainly for domestic and industrial heat application.  A Stirling engine is ideal for small scale domestic electricity 
generation from biogas. However other feasible options are the gas turbine, fuel cells, diesel engine, Otto cycle engine

To avoid wastage of excess biogas, the excess will be used to generate electricity for storage or supply to the grid. 
Biogas is effective and efficient as cooking gas with little environmental problems which can be managed like methane 
leakage and risk of fire from leakages exposed to any form of naked flame. Through the costing, the biogas plant has 
proved to be very cost efficient and remarkable source of alternative energy. The amount of raw material needed for 
a continuous biogas digester process has been identified as a minimum of 4 cows producing an average of 14kg of 
fresh dung daily to produce the required biogas for the rural household. Cows were used for the design parameters as 
they are the most common animals in every rural household. However other animals like pigs and chicken are feasible 
alternatives. Biogas production can be improved through better digester design with the stirrer being introduced to 
make it easier to mix the slurry in the digester and hence get the most out of the prepared slurry. Also, the design 
incorporates a top trap door to enable easy servicing of the digester from time to time and avoid silt deposit at the 
bottom of the digester. 
 
The economic feasibility or viability of biogas plants for industrial and domestic applications is dependent on 
opportunities for product and utility diversification. It makes economic sense if biogas installations have can be used 
to supply applications like electricity or mechanical power applications for local and export supply to the grid, biogas 
as a fuel for other domestic and industrial applications, heat, co-generated by the combustion engine to increase cycle 
efficiency. The sanitation effect with COD and BOD (chemical and biological oxygen demand) reduction in the runoff 
from agro-industrial has a significant positive impact on environmental management and pollution control by agro 
based establishments. Application of the slurry in agriculture as farm fertilizer or manure will improve farm 
productivity and revenue for farmers. The multiple application of biogas and attractive feed in tariffs will make it 
possible for stallholder farmers to invest in export based electricity generation from biogas and make agriculture more 
sustainable and profitable.

Abstract  
 
The objective of this study was to increase biogas production from abattoir/slaughterhouse waste and hence minimize 
pollution from slaughterhouses by optimum bio-digestion of available slaughterhouse waste, which is largely 
underutilized while enabling generation of sufficient electricity for slaughterhouse use and export of the excess. The 
study targeted Nyongara, which has biodigester and Kiamaiko slaughterhouse which does not have a bio-digester. 
Biodegradable slaughterhouse waste was quantified for the two slaughterhouses. Data obtained indicated that the 
Nyongara slaughterhouse has the potential of generating 4000.6kgs of solid waste per day while the Kiamaiko 
slaughterhouse generate an approximate amount of 6000kgs per day. A performance review was done for an operating 
biogas plant at Nyongara slaughterhouse analyzed to get a general overview of the process.  The study showed that 
out of about 4,000.6kgs of slaughterhouse waste produced, the biogas plant can only process 300kgs per day, which 
is a paltry 7.5% utilization. The study recommends increase in the digester size to 666.66m3, with extra features such 
as a heating system in order to achieve the optimum temperature of 37°C, and incorporates an agitator for effective 
mixing of the substrate in the digester and biomethanation to increase the value of biogas and generate an additional 
revenue stream for slaughterhouses besides increased power generation for export to the grid. This study demonstrates 
the potential of slaughterhouses to generate grid electricity besides meeting own electricity and heat needs and play 
an important role in the energy transition from fossil fuel dominated energy mix to a green and low carbon sources 
for grid electricity.

 1. Introduction 
An abattoir can generate own power from biogas generator, use biogas for heating cleaning water, and other heat, light 
and electricity applications. One ton of animal waste can produce 100 m3 of biogas with average concentration of 65% 
methane and 35% carbon dioxide (CO2) (UBFCC, 2020). It is possible to produce biogas from abattoir wastes without 
addition of other types of organic substrates. It is however advisable to keep low, the composition of blood in the 
mixture as this can lead to excessive nitrogen which inhibits biogas production (Klintenberg, Jamieson, Kinyaga & 
Odlare, 2014). With advanced and recent technologies, it is practical to develop an eco-friendly process, treatment 
wastewater generated and solids from slaughter houses (Barasa, 2020). The benefit of anaerobic digestion of 
slaughterhouse waste is safe waste management and disposal, as well as the generation of clean electric power and 
fertilizer (Ahmad & Ansari, 2012). To preserve the environment, slaughterhouse waste should not be mixed with the 
municipal drain system before proper pre-treatment to meet sewage standard as per prevailing standards. 
 
Slaughterhouse effluent can be defined as moderate to high strength wastewater with generally 45% soluble and 55% 
coarse suspended organics.  There are various methods of slaughterhouse waste disposal. If not done properly, the 
major deleterious effect on natural water bodies like rivers is deoxygenation. The recommended methods for treatment 
and disposal of slaughter house include landfilling, blood separation, skimming, incineration, screening, primary 
settlement, protein recovery, and biological treatment like composting and biomethanation (Ahmad & Ansari, 2012).

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic brought countries into a lockdown situation. This has been experienced globally, some 
countries earlier than the others, South Africa experienced his from 26 March 2020. The lockdown experiences 
globally rushed the intensive implementation of the online teaching and learning in many institutions of higher 
learning with the natural assessing as corollaries. This study was conducted at a comprehensive institution of 
higher education in South Africa, offering both engineering science and engineering technology programmes. The 
stratified sample was composed of both learners and lecturers while a Delphi structured questionnaires was used 
in addition to observation. A pilot study was conducted prior to extending it to the full-sized sample.  This paper 
discusses the experienced hassles and hardship in teaching online mineral engineering and extractive modules to 
generation Y learners whose majority emanates from communities without prior set connectivity nor related 
information technology infrastructure. It was observed that while both learners and lecturers were faced with 
logistics challenges, technology related difficulties in terms of lack of appropriate device, insufficient connectivity 
and inadequate infrastructure, the online teaching and learning process on its own became a mission. The paper 
characterises and discusses also the socio-economic strains and stress behaviour demonstrated by both learners 
and lecturers.

Abstract  
 
The focus of this paper is the use of an Adaptive Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (ARBFANN) for 
the control of Two-Flexible-Link Robots (TFLR). Flexible links are modeled as Bernoulli beams. The Assumed 
Mode Method (AMM) together with the Lagrangian approach is used to derive the closed-form dynamic. Two 
modes are considered for each link. Singular perturbation method is used to derive a composite control for the 
TFLR. A stable robust two-time scale controller without any data for modeling is developed. The slow subsystem is 
controlled by an ARBFANN based on global approximation while the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller 
stabilizes the fast subsystem and guarantee the closed-loop stability. The ARBFANN with a sliding mode robust 
term is trained on-line to approximate unknown nonlinear system dynamics, suppress errors in the modeling of 
neural network and, guarantee closed-loop stability. To verify the validity of the proposed control strategy, 
simulation results are included. 
Keywords  
Radial basis function, Artificial neural network, flexible links, singular perturbations and, assumed modes. 
 
1. Introduction 
Most studies involving the AMM consider the simplified orthogonality conditions to derive the finite-dimensional 
dynamic models of the multilink flexible robots (De Luca and Siciliano 1991, Subhudi and Morris 2001, Subhudi 
and Morris 2002). In those situations where the simplified orthogonality relations are used for TFLR, the diagonal 
block matrix relative to shoulder deflections elements depend on the assumed mode spatial shapes of shoulder link 
and their spatial derivatives. However, some previous studies considered complete orthogonality relations and their 
companions (Tekweme and Nel 2016, Tekweme 2018a, 2018b, 2018c). The use of the complete orthogonality 
relations and their companions results in simplified diagonal matrix blocks relative to shoulder link and elbow link 
(Tekweme and Nel 2016). In this regard, not only the dynamic model accuracy is improved but also the 
computational burden is reduced as far as the partition of the dynamics of a TFLR is concerned. Adaptive neural 
network control of a TLFR based on local model approximation using singular perturbation was proposed by Gee et 
al. (1997). They considered the assumed modes with one element for each link. However, they observed that a more 
accurate model can be derived using more than one element and the matrix gain for the fast subsystem was 
computed for the final joint configuration. Mehrdad et al. (1997) and Moallem et al. (1996) derived a two-scale 
control system for multilink robots with the singular perturbation technique. In their paper, a two-link planar robot 
manipulator built from a rigid shoulder link and a flexible elbow link was considered. Although numerous research 
based on neural networks without prior knowledge of robot dynamics, Liu (2013) observes that the knowledge of 
the dynamics of the robots can’t be completely discarded. A robot neural network control designed without prior 
knowledge of the dynamics of the robots requires a huge number of nodes and considerable time is required for the 
controller to be trained (Rahimi and Nazemizadeh 2014).  
This paper’s target is to replace the nonlinear robot function with the neural network, track each joint trajectory with 
good robustness properties, and stabilize the fast variables. This paper is divided into sections. Section 1 deals with 
the introduction. In section 2, natural modes for the TLFR are normalized using the generalized orthonormality 
relations, instead of simplified one, on which the majority of studies are focused. And the TFLR closed-form

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, an ARBFANN control for two-flexible–link robots based on global approximation was proposed, 
instead of the partitioned neural network used in many papers. The approach proposed in this paper differs from the 
previous one as the mode shapes are derived and normalized using the generalized orthonormality relations, which 
results in simplified block-diagonal matrices of both links of the TFLR. The ARBFANN control guarantees the 
tracking of the desired trajectory while the optimal control stabilizes the vibration.

Abstract  
 
Fully accessible bus service is a critical element for a good working public transportation system. 
Bus stops are a vital link to this situation. Therefore, accessibility to bus stops must be 
investigated and the bus stops must be located regarding passengers’ demand and their walking 
availability. In this paper, a set covering problem is studied to find the minimum number of bus 
stops to be located within a walking coverage limit. A network including 30 demand points and 
15 alternative bus stop locations are considered in a university campus. Our goal is to conduct 
bus stop site selection problem in order to suggest new locations where reachable for passengers 
within a reasonable walking distance. The proposed 0-1 integer programming model is run under 
different distance limits and the results are discussed. Results demonstrates that all passengers 
can reach to any bus stop under four different distance limits and bus station S1 is reachable for 
whole distance limits. Finally, potential locations for bus stops are suggested.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Walking and transit are the backbone of sustainable mobility. Bus stops not only represent the 
connection between the two, but are also central in dictating the attractiveness of the latter. 
Accessibility of bus stops becomes, then, pivotal in increasing both attractiveness and 
sustainability(Corazza & Favaretto, 2019). To increase the accessibility or usage of bus 
transportation services, the locations of bus stops must be distributed in a proposer way. In 
literature, although there have been some studies which investigate the accessibility of bus stops, 
they usually focused on bus stop layout (Liu et al., 2017) or bus availability/accessibility for 
disable passengers(Wu et al., 2011). The focus of this paper is not on design of stops or bus 
shelters, but rather on evaluation of passengers’ accessibility to bus stops by walking. To do so, a 
model is needed to locate the minimum number of bus stops required to ensure that no passenger 
need walk more than a specified distance to reach a bus stop (Gleason, 1975) (Farahani et al., 
2012). In literature, there have been several studies on bus stop accessibility or location analysis. 
Gleason (1975), which is one of the earliest studies, presented a model which enables the router 
to locate a specified number of bus stops in such a manner that the total distance walked by all 
boarders is minimized. Later on, Murray (2003) and Huang (2014) considered the bus stop

With the application of set covering approach, alternative bus stop locations are determined. The 
results are suggested to the University Administrative. It is hoped that shared results will help 
decision makers on transportation planning within the campus.   
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
As city centres, a good working public transportation system is also essential for a university 
campus. The case (Gaziantep University) of this paper has more than 50,000 students and staff. 
Therefore, the locations of bus stops in the campus must be distributed evenly. The distribution 
of the bus stops depends on walking distance of passengers. To do so, a model based on set 
covering problem is applied. For future studies, routing of buses should be investigated by 
considering the time windows (e.g. course time, shift time). If the problem size becomes larger, a 
meta-heuristic approach should be applied.

Abstract 
 
The challenge of water shortages is affecting a lot of areas in South Africa especially rural areas. The government 
have introduced different strategies to deal with the problem. Amongst the areas in South Africa, Mpumalanga 
Province is one of the areas that struggles with water shortages. An investigation is conducted to address the water 
crisis and present solutions from the System Analysis. The issues of the budget were addressed to assist with the 
allocation of funds that will help the communities.  The effective pumping systems strategic management are also 
addressed in this study to assist management to maintain the leaking and burst pipes. The commercial steel is the 
material of the pipe used for the pumping system. The calculations of the pumping system were carried out to 
help with improving of the system based on the demand that arises with the increase of the population.  The 
pumping system curves were plotted at different length of the system to improve the head while the flow rate is 
kept at constant.

1. Introduction 
The cause of the water supply problem in Mpumalanga is first due to the lack of facilities to accommodate the 
demand of water in communities. Most communities are facing the challenge of being supplied with undrinkable 
water and having to find means of cleaning the water themselves, this is mainly because of poor maintenance of 
the supply systems. Due to poor maintenance of the water supply system water supply does not meet the demand 
for water in the communities [1, 2]. The inability to meet the water demand and population growth in the 
communities has caused some members of the community to make their undocumented pipeline connections for 
their homes from the main supply. This has affected the water pumping system whereby the system is at risk of 
being damaged due to increased load which surpasses the designed system load. For years municipalities have 
been known to mismanage resources from road maintenance to water supply system maintenance lines [3, 4].. 
The lack of resources and capital has led to shortages of water and poor infrastructure. Another budget constrain 
is due to corruption, this illegal act has cost communities their livelihoods whereby awarded tenders are not 
completed in the given time or not completed at all. Cheaper and untested materials are used which leads to a 
collapse of the infrastructure. The facilities are not provided with water cleaning chemical [5]. On heavy rainy 
days the water obtained from boreholes and other sources is brown. For those that cannot afford cleaning 
equipment they have to wait for the dirt to sink before they can use the water. The municipalities employ 
unqualified people to save funds, this has led to the theft of some equipment. The problem being investigated in 
this paper is the water supply shortage caused by the overloading of the pumping system. The investigation aims 
at designing a pumping system that will be able to meet the water supply demand of the communities to prevent 
illegal connection in the mainline.

From the results obtained, the issue of water services in Mpumalanga can be solved and managed through the 
system analysis. The municipalities in the study area should take into consideration the population rate so that the 
water systems can be upgraded accordingly. To meet the requirement of the system, the total dynamic head is 
used.  Dynamic head means there is a change of the pressures, velocities, elevations and friction losses when the 
system and the pump are in operation [8]. The total head was calculated at different length of 35m, 45m, 60m and 
70m of the pumping system to monitor the total head. The results were summarised in tables 1 and 2. The trends 
of the graph in figure 1 was then obtained. It was observed (see figure 1) that the length of the pumping system at 
the same flow rate increases the head of the system. Therefore, the improvement of the system can be obtained 
by increasing the length of the system to meet the demand for water supply.

Abstract 
 
Limpopo is the hottest Province in South Africa and has less percentage of rain to fill up its dams and rivers. There 
is a higher chance for the communities to run short of water because the used water is not recycled. The villages 
use pit toilets, therefore, it becomes difficult to have a water recycling plant. The purpose of this study is to model 
the water supply chain to determine the solution for water delivery in rural areas of the Limpopo Province. A 
system dynamic model is developed using Vensim software. The system is simulated to develop a solution to 
water crises in the province. The systems dynamics modelling is discussed herein. The Vensim Model was to 
capture the interaction between the source of water, water treatment plant, water recycling, potable water 
transmission, commercial and domestic water distribution. The results show that the building of infrastructure for 
portable water without recycling plant, will partially solve the crisis of water shortage in the province. The 
recycling plant is found to be helpful in saving water for future purposes.

1. Introduction 
 
Limpopo is the hottest Province in South Africa. The most recent drought experienced by the country 
consequently caused a drop in rivers flow, which then resulted in dams drying out.  A large amount of the land 
area in the province is occupied by rural settlements. The cause of the water supply problem in Limpopo Province 
is due to lack of facilities to accommodate the demand of water in communities. Most communities are finding it 
difficult to access the resource and the municipalities have not reached the people to provide services. The water 
in the areas is not drinkable. The low income communities in the province rely on pit latrines as their primary 
means of sanitation. The pit latrines cause human and ecological health impacts associated with microbiological 
and chemical contamination of groundwater [1]. It has become difficult to find means of cleaning the water 
themselves, this is mainly because of poor maintenance of the supply systems. The existing infrastructures do not 
meet the water supply demand. The population growth in the communities has caused some members of the 
community to find their source of water, mainly boreholes. There are no proper pumping systems to meet the 
water demands in the communities. The existing pumping system does not supply enough water and members in 
the communities do illegal connections [1, 3]. This has affected the water pumping system whereby the system is 
at risk of being damaged due to increased load which surpasses the designed system load. The pumps used to 
transport water from boreholes to the community are not well maintained [4, 5]. The water does not reach to entire 
communities due to failure of the pumps, elevations and pressure drops in the system [1, 7]. Also, for many years 
municipalities have been known to mismanage resources to water supply systems and slow in providing services. 
The systems dynamic analysis approach is used to assess the challenge of water supply in Limpopo Province.

200","5. Conclusion 
 
In this study, the system dynamic model was developed to solve the challenges of water supply in Limpopo 
Province. The communities in the study areas get water from boreholes and rain in the season of rain. The system 
dynamic model for the current situation was developed, see Figure 1. Figure 2 shows that the communities will 
run short of water in the future should the problem of water not be addressed and solved. The system dynamic 
model helps with analyzing the problem and bringing suitable solution taking in considerations other challenges 
faced by the communities. The proposed solution for the water crisis in Limpopo is addressed in Figure 3. The 
recycling process is introduced to save water for the future and it can be seen in Figures 5 to 8 that the water cycle 
with the recycling process saves water, see the blue trend. The challenges affect the delivery of water services to 
the communities and need to be addressed with the purpose to improve the water delivery [11 - 12]. The health of 
the people is being considered, therefore, the abstracted water needs to be treated to meet the portable quality 
standards for drinkable water before it is distributed to the consumers. The infrastructures must be maintained 
regularly so that they can last for a longer period.

Abstract 
 
Pay later application systems are now starting to be used as a payment method for bailouts from related 
application companies. Pay later is still within the scope of online flights and hotel ticket booking services that 
focus on domestic travel by Traveloka, and GoJek as one of the online transportation companies in Indonesia. 
However, pay later is also offering by OVO as a smart application company that provides us with payment 
service and online transactions. How do customers respond to pay later facilities in two different types of quick 
credit or loans on their transactions, two different generations, and experiences? This study to look for factors 
that influence the acceptance of their customers in Indonesia. Base on the second generation of Unified Theory 
Acceptance and Use of Technology as a theoretical basis to find the factors using SEM Partial Least Square. 
Research model on this study constructs of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, 
facilitating condition as factors of pay later intention.  Multi-Group Analysis applies to the type of companies, 
experience, and type of generation in the model. There are 1.201 urban workers as a sample in Jabodetabek 
(Jakarta Capital City and around it) as a representation of urban features in Indonesia.

Introduction 
Online shopping is a process where consumers directly buy goods, services, and others according to the 
needs of the seller interactively and at the same time without intermediaries and take advantage of the internet 
network (Mujiyana & Elissa, 2013).  These online retail businesses start looking for many opportunities in 
marketing their products, one of which is through e-commerce.  The increase in e-commerce buyers also increased 
to 28.07 million consumers e-commerce in 2017 has made a total expenditure of 7.056 billion USD (22% increase 
over the previous year). ARPU (Annual Revenue Per User of Consumer Goods) of 251 USD per year, where this 
figure has been increased by 8% compared to the previous year (Hootsuite, 2018). Thus, the trend of buying and 
selling through online has lowered market prices and increased turnover and public consumption. Overall, the 
multipliers' impact is very large on income and welfare (Budiono et al., 2020). The indirect impact is a reduction in 
the level of poverty and income inequality in society (Budiono et al., 2020).

Conclusions 
This study proves that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motives 
and habit influence pay later intention, but not social influence. In contrast to Vekantesh's (2012) study, age, gender 
and experiences do not moderate the independent variables in influencing the dependent variable. This study then 
conducts a multi-group analysis in terms of pay later facilities, type of generation and the high and low levels of 
consumer transaction experiences on Traveloka and GoJek. The results show that there are differences in each 
independent variable in influencing the dependent variable for consumer categories using direct pay later facilities 
from Traveloka and GoJek compared to OVO. Millennials have different characteristics compared to generation Z.A 
similar pattern applies to multigroup analysis based on high and low transaction experiences.

Abstract  
 
This is a case study of a multinational that reviewed its parameters for the product replenishment process and 
analyzed the need to keep them in stock. Due to the high costs that accumulated goods generate, it is always 
necessary to reassess whether a product still has regular and sufficient consumption to be available for prompt 
delivery. If this item is justified as a make to stock item, parameters must be calculated to be aware of the right 
moment when a purchase order must be generated to replenish the stock. The criteria used to determine whether the 
item is a make to stock or make to order, are applied by analyzing the consumption history of that product, its 
number of customers and how much its consumption varies over the months. At the end of the process, positive 
results are achieved, such as: increase in the service level, reduction in the amount invested in inventory and a lower 
expense with air freight for emergency replacement. As consumption can change over time, it is concluded that this 
process must be done periodically, to align the stock data with the current demand and make the planner's work 
more assertive.

Introduction 
 
 
Inventories represent one of the most important assets in a company and, for this reason, deserve special treatment, 
mainly because they openly influence production costs. Consequently, it is of utmost importance that they are 
minimized, since the greater the stocking, the higher the amount of capital invested in the sector in question. 
Usually, inventories represent one of the highest investments in the accounts that composes the working capital 
structure in simplified companies. Nowadays, inventory control has become simpler due to the computerized 
systems available and, in many cases, the logistics part includes appointed specialized service (SLACK; 
CHAMBERS; JOHNSTON, 2009).The function of the stock must first of all remain very clear and decisive in the 
concept of the organizations, since the stock encompasses numerous functions, being one of the fundamental factors 
to plan and control within an appropriate management regarding the production process. The multiplicity of 
entrepreneurs is concerned merely with the quantitative and financial problems of the materials, whether they are 
raw materials, accessories, materials in processes or finished product (CORRÊA, 2013)The purpose of stock control 
encompasses the determination of three fundamental decisions: how much and when to order, and the amount of 
safety stock that needs to be kept in order for each product to ensure a satisfactory level of service for the customer. 
Such decisions follow a dynamic that ends up reproducing over time, and become complex due to the fact that there 
are an admirable number of factors involved (SLACK, 2011).Inventories of finished products, raw materials and 
material in process should never be measured as isolated components. Whatever the decision made about one of the 
stock modalities, it will directly influence the other types of storage, but it is worth emphasizing here that the so-

In the case of items which it is necessary to keep in stock, it is noted that the lack of product happens much less 
frequently, so the standard replacement (by sea) is being sufficient to keep the stock aligned. What happens in case 
of a stock item is sold out is the emergency purchase of a lot by air, which makes the process cost much more, since 
the costs of this type of freight are usually higher and may even increase more according to the weight of the goods. 
Once the products turned into make to order are sold out in stock, there is a significant reduction in the inventory 
value, which means the company stopped spending money on products that accumulate on the shelf and run the risk 
of not selling. It is important to remember that tax is paid for items in stock, so money loss can happen if products 
do not sell.As the consumption of these items is uncertain, the fact of not making them available for prompt delivery 
is not necessarily harmful to the company, as in a way there is never 100% certainty as to fulfill the order in its 
entirety, since the stock previously existing could not match that specific demand, so it is necessary for the customer 
to wait for the production and replacement time in any way.This inventory reduction did not significantly change the 
company's revenue. 
It is concluded that after the whole process, with the quantities of each item being properly adjusted to the current 
consumption of this product, the results achieved demonstrate that the improvements are very significant because 
there was a reduction in the amount invested in stock, maintaining the revenue.

Abstract 
The existing disparity between Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) and Department Basic of 
Education (DBE) cannot be neglected. The purpose of the study was to investigate the requirements for passing matric 
in secondary schools and enrolling to engineering bachelor’s degree in higher education. A sample of 400 
learners/students was used to provide their perception on the requirements for passing matric and requirements for 
enrolling to a bachelor’s degree. The data was gathered through questionnaires and interviews. The study provides 
research information on the entities (High school, college, and University) and it therefore quantified the extent to 
which the gap exists. From the survey, Majority of learners are aware of different certificates awarded after meeting 
the requirements for passing matric. However, these learners are not aware that entrance requirements to bachelor’s 
degree in different universities are not the same. Learners are also not aware that a bachelor pass in matric does not 
guarantee them an entrance into a degree course. Many students from rural areas want to pursue engineering education 
but they don’t have enough information about different degrees requirements and duration. The study indicates there 
is a need for information transfer between universities and secondary school. There should be coherence between 
DHET and DBE policy in order not to mislead learners.

227","To obtain a Diploma a learner should obtain at least 40% in four subjects including HL and LOLT together with a 
minimum of 30% on the other three subjects. For learners to obtain bachelor’s degree pass he/she must obtain a 
minimum of 50% in four subjects together with a minimum of 30% on the other two subjects.  
 
Looking at the minimum pass requirements for learners to obtain a NSC it important to also appreciate the minimum 
entrance requirements for engineering education For the purpose of this research, one engineering course was selected 
to investigate the minimum entrance requirements. The following table 4 show the minimum entrance requirements 
for learners to be admitted in Industrial engineering from three different Universities.

The following statement was obtained from the Prospectors of one of the universities attached as part of the 
requirements for admission “Note: Due to the limited number of places available, admission is not guaranteed. 
Selection will be based on final NSC results. Generally, students who achieve at least 70% in Mathematics, Physical 
Science and English stand a greater chance of being accepted.” Looking at this statement and the minimum pass 
requirements for grade 12 the percentage set is too high compared to the minimum pass in grade 12 as signed off by 
Umalusi. 
 
5. Conclusion 
It can be concluded that there is indeed a minimum requirement gap between matric pass requirements and 
engineering education entrance requirements. The gap results in students adding time by upgrading matric results 
then enroll for an engineering education qualification. This gap also leads students becoming demotivated and end 
up enrolling for a qualification they did not intend to study for since they do not qualify to study engineering. 
Higher institutions of learning that are offering engineering education qualifications should be involved in 
addressing this gap as accessibility to engineering education is very important, but it has no value if learners are not 
able to enroll. 
6. Recommendations 
 It is recommended that an intensive career guidance be conducted to provide high school learners with knowledge 
about entrance requirements to engineering education qualifications. The Department of Basic Education and 
Training should meet with the Department of Higher Education and Training and discuss the gap that exist between 
minimum pass requirements in matric and minimum entrance requirements to engineering education and other 
qualifications. 
 
It is also recommended that senior students who are enrolled for engineering education qualifications must be 
encouraged to visit the high schools they attended to share their experience and knowledge about minimum entrance 
requirements to different qualifications in engineering. Higher institutions offering engineering education should 
have dedicated staff member who go to high schools to share information about minimum entrance requirements to 
engineering education and other courses related to engineering.

Abstract 
Lean manufacturing is a method of optimizing industrial performance that allows companies to eliminate waste in 
processes and contributes to the reduction of environmental impact. The green manufacturing concept aims to 
preserve the environment (reduce pollution and waste), in addition to implementing environmentally friendly 
processes in manufacturing. This article talks about the lean-green combination, presenting its advantages such as: 
reducing waste, cost, meeting customer needs and improving productivity, and their implementation, two types of 
implementation have been found: sequentially or simultaneously. Moreover, this article paves the way for further 
research and the adoption of lean-green in the industry. 
Keywords  
Green manufacturing, Lean manufacturing, Lean-green, Implementation, waste. 
1. Introduction  
Only a handful of environmental experts and researchers have so far investigated the relationship between aspects 
of lean and green practices, they found that lean companies which include green practices achieve better lean 
results than those companies which do not (Dües et al. 2013). So why lean green? Lean & green are 
complementary; therefore, each method has the potential to minimize the disadvantages of the others. Together, 
lean & green have the ability to identify waste and evaluate its environmental impact (Banawi and Bilec 2014). 
The corporate environmentalism or green management emerged in 1990s and became popular slogan 
internationally in 2000s (Lee 2009). Green management is the organization-wide process of applying innovation 
to achieve sustainability, waste reduction, social responsibility, and a competitive advantage via continuous 
learning and development and by embracing environmental goals and strategies that are fully integrated with the 
goals and strategies of the organization(Haden et al. 2009). It is a management concept, which demands the 
commitment of all members of the corporation, from senior management down to the shop floor, GM is more than 
just corporate concern about the environment, it is a ‘mind think’  (Taylor 1992). 
The term lean production is associated with the Toyota Production System where it is integrated with just-in-time 
tactics in order to improve quality and delivery time (Hajmohammad et al. 2013). Lean management is the 
reduction of variability at every opportunity, including demand variability, manufacturing variability, and supplier 
variability (Arnheiter and Maleyeff 2005), lean can enhance the benefits of pollution prevention approaches 
(Hallam and Contreras 2016). 
Lean management and green management are two approaches to operations that companies have adopted, 
promoted and implemented in order to create better value through quality, products and services while trying to 
reduce manufacturing and/or environmental wastes (Hallam and Contreras 2016). 
This article examine the different papers on lean-green approach; its definition, objectives and benefits to 
encourage companies to improve productivity, save costs and reduce waste and environmental impacts. 
2. Lean Manufacturing: Definition and Principles 
The word ""Lean"" was used by John Krafcik, to describe the new production techniques introduced by Taiichi Ohno 
at Toyota (Bendell 2006), it is not confined to the activities that take place in the manufacturing function of a 
company, rather it relates to activities ranging from product development, procurement and manufacturing over to 
distribution (Karlsson and Åhlström 1996). It  is a set of practices aimed at reducing waste and non-value-added 
activities in the production (Lasnier 2007) (Yang et al. 2011). In addition, it is unique as it focuses on enabling
