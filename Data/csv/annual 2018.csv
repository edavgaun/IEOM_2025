Abstract 
The measure of ambulance cycle time is of particular interest in the performance of Emergency 
Medical Systems (EMS). Its value determines the ambulance capacity of the operations system 
of an EMS institution. For a given number of ambulances in operation, as the value of the 
average ambulance cycle time increases, total ambulance capacity for the system is reduced. 
Additional impacts resulting from this situation are; an increase on the average ambulance 
response time and patient´s health risk due to the unavailability of ambulances; and a greater 
need of ambulance replacement investment requirements and operating cost. This work suggests 
an improvement approach based on Theory of Constraints (TOC) and elimination of waste for 
reducing ambulance cycle time. The approach is applied to a Mexican EMS institution based on 
metropolitan Monterrey. Results of the application are provided.

Abstract 
Almost all cities and towns in Papua New Guinea are producing tonnes of waste vegetable oils 
annually, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories, 
fast food restaurants and institutional dinning facilities. These waste vegetable oils are directed to 
waterways, rivers and finally into the ocean which destroys the ocean shores and damaging the 
environment. With increasing population, not only the demand for cooking oil will increase but 
also the environmental problems caused by the waste cooking oil. Most brands of cooking oil 
that is used in Papua New Guinea are from locally produced palm oil. Palm oil consists mainly 
of triglycerides made up of a range of fatty acids and contains other minor constituents, such as 
free fatty acids and non-glyceride components. This composition determines the oil’s chemical 
and physical characteristics. This is an attempt to improve the waste vegetable oil’s chemical and 
physical characteristics that will allow the oil to be used as an energy source and at the same time 
reducing the associated environmental problems. It has been observed that the waste cooking oil 
can be converted into a useful energy source using the transesterification process. The converted 
fuel has been tested and found its performance to be equivalent to petroleum diesel.

Introduction 
 
In many cities and towns in Papua New Guinea, there are tonnes of waste vegetable oil that is 
being produced annually from various commercial dinning facilities at the learning institutions, 
industrial deep fryers and fast food restaurants etc. within the major cities and towns. With 
increasing population, not only the demand for cooking oil will increase but also the 
environmental problems caused by the waste cooking oil. In many surveys conducted, 
restaurants may produce more than 1-liter of waste cooking oil per day and most of this oil is 
likely to be discharged into the sewers and water ways that may finally end up in the ocean that 
may destroy the ocean shores and damaging the environment. If discarded oil can be used as an 
energy source, it may not only be an alternative energy source but also assist in reducing the cost 
of wastewater treatments and generally assist in recycling of resources. 
 
When the fresh cooking oil is used for deep frying, the oils are generally heated to 160° - 180°C, 
and several changes occur such as oxidation and lowering of molecular weight due to hydrolytic

curves are compared, it appears that the specific fuel consumption of the 100% waste oil 
biodiesel (B100) is the lowest at maximum load with the 100% diesel fuel being the next lowest 
and blends (B20) having the highest.  
 
The results of the three different fuel types appears to indicate that there is a negligible difference 
at low and high loads but there is a slight difference at loads ranging from 80-N to about 145-N. 
This may be due to the difference in the viscosity and heating value of the three different fuel 
types. Generally, it appears that the biodiesel fuel produced from waste cooking oil is compatible 
with petroleum diesel and it can be used in a diesel engine without any modifications.

Conclusions 
A successful attempt has been made to make use of the waste cooking oil from the student’s 
dinning facilities as an energy source. The results are summarized as follows: 
 
1. The waste cooking oil has been successfully converted as an energy source. 
2. The biodiesel fuel produced from waste cooking oil is comparable with petroleum diesel. 
3. Visual inspection of the exhaust gases indicates clean and environmentally friendly 
emissions being released from the exhaust system without any thick smoke.

Abstract 
Accounting for uncertainties has been a profound feature for a robust simulation study. Various attempts 
have been dedicated to incorporate such uncertainties by means of quantification, reduction, and risk 
mitigation and assess the effectiveness of such attempts in various types of queueing systems representing 
generic models with wide applications. In contrast, this study will focus on exploiting the potential uses 
of input uncertainty quantification in updating the credible confidence interval resulting from the 
Bayesian approach on treating the input uncertainties. More specifically, this study deals with problems 
emerging in supply chain settings where the decisions are highly inter-related representing systems with 
complex interaction in its decision variables. The initial findings suggest that the traditional approach 
which relies either on a naive point estimate or even a conventional frequentist confidence interval that 
assumes perfect input modeling may lead to biased decisions, and hence yielding a sub-optimal result. 
Furthermore, when the data available for input modeling is very limited, therefore constitutes high risks 
and dominant input uncertainties, the frequentist view will likely depart further from the optimality when 
one conducts a simulation optimization. Thus, mechanisms accounting for input uncertainty using 
Bayesian models should be favored as they account well for the associated risk inherited from input 
uncertainty.

ABSTRACT 
Healthcare systems face challenges including diminishing resources and increasing demands. 
The challenges need to be balanced in this complex system of systems to ensure a sustainable 
quality of life. Sustainability considers the needs of future generations without compromising the 
needs of current generations. The social component of sustainability is one of the important areas 
in healthcare sustainability. The social component focuses on considerations such as equity, 
empowerment, accessibility, participation, cultural identity, and institutional stability. Patient 
satisfaction is a key factor in the social element. Patient satisfaction represents patient fulfillment 
in regards to the cost, accessibility to services and resources, and patient wellbeing. It is 
analogous to “customer satisfaction”. A systems thinking approach is applied to analyze the 
social aspect in healthcare systems. This paper explores important factors and factor 
relationships in healthcare social sustainability related to patient satisfaction using a system 
dynamics approach. 
Keywords: healthcare; patient satisfaction; systems thinking; system dynamics; causal model 
1. INTRODUCTION
According to Dey et al. (2006), healthcare is the fastest growing service in both 
developed and developing countries. The primary goal of healthcare is to offer services to people 
that help to improve the quality and health of their daily lives. Patients are the primary focus of 
healthcare systems. They can be considered as customers in this complex system of systems and 
have various expectations. One of the ways to determine if the services are effective is to ensure 
that patients are satisfied. Healthcare needs to be sustainable because it faces increasing demands 
and diminishing resources. The current generations need to be served and future generations 
need to be considered when offering services in healthcare.

Abstract 
The production of biogas from municipal sewage sludge as an alternative source of energy 
has become topical. The healthy, safety and environmental considerations are of utmost 
importance especially the environmental impact assessment for setting up, commissioning, 
operating and decommissioning the biogas plant. Healthy and safety considerations for noise, 
dust emissions as well as gaseous emissions from the process must be minimized. The socio-
economic benefits that come with the setting up of a biogas plant such as employment 
creation must be maximised.  
Keywords: Biogas, energy, environmental impact assessment, safety considerations 
1. INTRODUCTION
Biogas is a renewable type of energy that is produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic 
waste (Ghe and Mare, 2013). During biogas production, the organic waste is converted to 
methane (55-70%), carbon dioxide (30-45%) and trace components which include hydrogen 
sulphide (<2%), water vapour (2-7%), oxygen (<2%) and ammonia (<2%). A solid residue,

6. SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS 
The production of biogas from sewage sludge provides an alternative source of energy for 
communities. Furthermore, the biogas can be sold for upgrading to further uses like 
electricity generation. There is potential for employment creation from the biogas plant 
operation creating livelihoods for people (Rutz et al., 2008).  
7. CONCLUSION 
Biogas production provides an alternative source of energy for communities. However there 
is need to be aware of the health, safety and environmental considerations during the setting 
up, operation and closure of a biogas plant so that the environment and the personnel are 
protected.

Abstract 
In this paper, the potential to harness biogas from municipal waste is investigated and 
possible models that explain the kinetics derived. Municipal waste was anaerobically digested 
over a 60 day period at 37°C in 250 mL digesters. The cumulative biogas produced increased 
with increase in the digestion time. The experimental data was modelled for both linear and 
exponential equations in Excel. The linear equation, y = 15.3 + 1.26 fully described the linear 
behaviour in biogas generation in comparison to the exponential model. This was also shown 
by the R2 value which showed the superiority of the linear model against the exponential 
model.

4. CONCLUSION 
The biodegradable wastes from municipalities offer an attractive raw material for biogas 
generation, an alternative source of renewable energy. Cumulative biogas generation from 
municipal waste can best be modeled by a linear model as opposed to an exponential model.

Abstract 
A techno-economic assessment study was conducted to consider the feasibility of recovering 
biogas in a bio agumentated municipal sewage treatment plant. A sewage plant with a 
capacity of approximately 20 ML/day and a plant operating capacity of 60% for 24 hours 
were considered. The sewage sludge analysis indicated a high total solids and chemical 
oxygen demand content. Biogas generation was monitored over a 30 day period with Hycura 
as the bio augmentation media at 0.05 g/L. Biogas with a methane content of 78% was 
achieved and the digestate collected as bio solids was rich in nitrogen, phosphorous and 
potassium. The plant had the capacity to produce 1 380 KWh of electricity per day and if a 
total investment of 2 million is made, a payback period of 5 years at an in internal rate of 
return of 18% will be realized.

Breakeven refers to the point of balance between making either a profit or a loss and is 
calculated by dividing the fixed costs by the contribution per unit. Whereby the fixed costs 
are a sum of maintenance cost, insurance and electricity for the 20 years this amounts to $ 1 1 
800 000.00. The contribution per unit is the electricity selling minus production cost, all 
divided by the labour cost to give $9.81/KWh. The breakeven point achieved from the study 
was 183 058 KWh which translates to $1 800 000 in sales.  
 
4. CONCLUSION 
The bio augmentation of sewage sludge allows for the production of high methane content 
biogas as high as 78%. An economic assessment for generating electricity from a bio 
augmented municipal sewage plant indicated that it is economically viable to generate biogas 
electricity as well as consider the bio solids for sale as bio fertilizers. A net present value of 
$1 186 000.00 was realised with a payback period of 5 years and internal rate of return of 
18%.

Abstract 
This STEM project is to demonstrate how to play Video Game through STEM approach and learning 
science and statistics.  Kids are playing video games too long and parents do not want kids to play video 
games since most video games are not developing critical thinking.  Hill Climb Car Racing game was 
chosen not based on commercial rating but on potential of applying statistical data-driven methodology. 
The author took STEM approach: Science (Physics, Mechanics), Technology (Car Upgrading), Engineering 
(Failure Mode), and Math (Geometry, Trigonometry and Statistics).   Based on the engineering failure mode 
analysis and scientific understanding, author can develop a systematic car upgrading system through 
statistical modeling to optimize car performance.  Simple linear regression was conducted to quantify the 
ROI return (car travelling distance) of investment (car grading cost).  The regression model accuracy has 
been improved from original 66% (random playing mode) to 92% (systematic playing mode).  The ROI 
slope has been improved from 147.2 to 512.4 meter/upgrade unit.  The clustering analysis grouped the 
similar field stages with common challenges and science which has helped upgrade car to support multiple 
stages.   The BEST car of each stage has matched well with literature research.  It’s a very successful STEM 
project on playing video games.

1. Introduction and Literature Research
Playing video game is becoming a critical portion of social activities for most middle school and high school students.  
However, parents are worrying that kids may play video games too much and most video games may not help develop 
their critical thinking and teamwork concept.  The objective of this STEM project is to convert playing video games 
to become conducting STEM Projects.  Students can learn Physics Science and Statistics while playing video games.  
Authors have searched several video games and picked the Hill Climb Car Racing video game not based on the 
commercial rating (4.4 stars [1]), but based on the potential of applying statistical data-driven and engineering problem-
solving approach due to its embedded database which can record mileage of each run and car technology upgrade 
status. 
The object of this video game is to collect coins while driving through racing stages [2]. Driving consumes gas, which 
players can replenish by picking up gas canisters along the way. The player ""dies"" if they run out of gas or hit the 
avatar's head on the ground. Coins may also be earned by performing ""tricks"", difficult maneuvers in the air, or by 
reaching set distances during given stages. Coins may be spent on vehicle purchases or upgrades, or to unlock new 
stages.  The challenge of this video game is the complexity of 29 different cars and 28 different stages.  There are 
29x28= 812 pairing combinations.  It will be time consuming to play each combination just once if play “hard”.  This 
STEM project is to apply statistics and to play “smart” through STEM approach. 
Video games have enormous mass appeal, reaching audiences in the hundreds of thousands to millions. They also 
embed many pedagogical practices known to be effective in other environments. This article [3] reviews the sparse but 
encouraging data on learning outcomes for video games in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) 
disciplines, then reviews the infrastructural obstacles to wider adoption of this new medium.

6 Conclusions 
This video game car racing project has successfully integrated four STEM elements (Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics) in one STEM Project.  Team has applied the Data Mining Clustering Analysis on 
grouping the similar stages into Cluster Fields.  Each field has higher correlation with particular car technology 
associated field characteristics.  Players can choose the right car and upgrade the right technology within each field to 
shorten the playing time significantly.  By following the systematic data-driven and engineering problem solving 
approach, team has improved both Performance Index and Model Accuracy significantly.  The most excited of this 
STEM project is that our kids can play video games while learning statistics and engineering problem solving (STEM 
approach).

Abstract 
This article aims to illustrate the use of improvement heuristics for solving a vehicle routing problem with 
time constraints. We present, at first, a state-of-the-art about vehicle routing problems (VRP) by zooming 
in the VRP with time windows. We then present the possible methods of resolution proposed in the 
literature. Subsequently, we study the case of the Moroccan post office for postal delivery in the Fes-
Meknes-Oujda region. To cope with the rapid changes in its environment, Moroccan post office is 
engaged in a process of continuous improvement of its transport network. This approach serves both the 
objectives of improving the quality of service and logistical and economic rationalization. It is in this 
context that our work fits in. We have tried to improve the postal routing network by using the 
improvement heuristic based on a set of scenarios in order to arrive at a tactical planning of routing 
network and efficient management of vehicle fleet while respecting in the same time quality, time and 
cost constraints.

1. Introduction
The vehicle routing problems are studied because of the increasing importance of transport of passengers and goods 
today. These problems are generally subject to several types of constraints. We find among them: capacity 
constraints and time constraints. Reducing the cost of transport is a major concern for decision-makers, which makes 
of this domain a fertile field for diverse searches. In this article, we are going to overfly the vehicle routing problems 
by zooming the vehicle routing problem with time windows. We present afterward, the possible methods of 
resolution were proposed in the literature. Subsequently, we will study the case of the Moroccan post office for 
postal delivery in the Fes-Meknes-Oujda region.  
In this context, our work tried to improve the postal routing network by using the improvement heuristic based on a 
set of scenarios in order to achieve an efficient route planning serving all centers in the region by minimizing the 
cost of transportation and adapting their delivery windows, routes to schedule routing to preserve and improve the 
quality of service vehicles.

From the results, we see that the first scenario, even if it achieves the minimum cost, not clenched probably not 
viewed favorably, as the news reached Al Hoceima cell arrive late with respect to time of departure of the vehicle 
ensuring the delivery of national focus. For cons, the second scenario modeled the operation of the network in order 
to satisfy all the constraints of time and availability, so all items will be shipped the same day of their arrival at the 
Fez treatment center. Therefore, it is of interest to choose the second scenario. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
This article has highlighted the different elements of routing problem in the FMO region. It fits within the vehicle 
routing problems with time windows. So in this work, we have presented a state-of-the-art about vehicle routing 
problems (VRP). We then presented the possible methods of resolution proposed in the literature. We have studied 
the case of the Moroccan post office for postal delivery in the Fes-Meknes-Oujda region. We have tried to improve 
the postal routing network by using the improvement heuristic based on a set of scenarios in order to arrive at a 
tactical planning of routing network and efficient management of vehicle fleet while respecting in the same time 
quality, time and cost constraints. 
The main contribution of this work is to provide workable solutions to a real case of distribution. Among other 
things, network optimization product to potential savings in time and distance while promoting efficient use of 
transport vehicles.

Abstract 
The urban freight transport (UFT) plays an important role in the quality of life in urban areas. Previously, 
strategic decisions were taken with a view of economic and functional optimization; they now take the 
""green"" turn, taking also into account the ecological impacts. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to 
focus on the ecological weight of UFT. We first delineate the challenges of green urban freight transport. 
Secondly, we review the approaches to achieving an ecological balance of the urban freight transport. We 
develop the methodology used to measure the carbon footprint of the urban freight transport and energy 
consumption. And then, our case study concerns the flow of goods between all the economic 
establishments of the city of Fez. The analysis of the results obtained makes it possible to draw a number 
of conclusions which we will present in the form of recommendations.

Now, if we analyze in terms of tonnage: a HDV vehicle can carry one we use four pickup trucks to transport a 
quantity of 14 ton, we will result in 28 kg of CO2 emitted instead of the 18 kg emitted by a HDV vehicle. 
As a result, even though LDVs are more likely to be delivered, they are better suited for urban delivery and emit 
more GHGs per ton kilometer than heavy goods vehicles.  
 
Conclusion  
In this article, we studied the situation of the urban freight transport of the city of Fez. We proposed a methodology 
for measuring the ecological footprint of the UFT. We tried, first of all, to delineate the challenges of green urban 
freight transport. Secondly, we presented the approaches using for measuring the ecological footprint of the UFT. 
Then, we presented our proposed methodology. For reasons of efficiency and neutrality and to collect the technical 
data related to our methodology, a mixed survey method was adopted. The technique we used is halfway between 
the qualitative analysis by semi-directive interview and the support of the quantitative analysis. It goes beyond a 
questionnaire survey since the goal is to meet the respondent. The questionnaire submitted to the persons 
interviewed comprises twenty questions. It consists of two parts, respectively, consisting of ten questions. One is the 
categories of vehicles, fuel consumption, tonnage, and so on. The second consists of questions concerning 
companies and their vehicle fleets. The questionnaire was completed directly by interviewees during a half-hour 
interview. Using this data we calculated the CO2 emissions and the energy consumption for different category of 
vehicle of the urban freight transport of the city of Fez. 
As a result, the fuel consumption for the year 2016 is around 26250 tep, for which the for-hire transport accounts for 
almost 62% of the total. Concerning the CO2 emissions, we can conclude that the UFT is a major emitter of GHGs, 
in particular the CO2 emissions. In the city of Fez, which is the subject of our case study, vehicles with a GVW 
between 3.5 and 8 t emit almost 14 kg of CO2. On the other hand, light-duty vehicles (LDV) issue 8 kg in the case 
of for-hire vehicles and 3 kg in the case of own-account vehicles. Thus semi-trailers heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) 
emit almost 18 kg of CO2.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to deploy quality management tools in order to identify and classify the 
difficulties and problems faced by the road transport sector in Morocco. 
Our approach is articulated around three parts. In the first, we have conducted a background research 
about the transport sector in Morocco. The objective is to highlight the importance of the sector in the 
national economy as well as its social role. Also, we have tried to characterize the sector and present its 
main constraints. 
The second part of this work consists in deploying the quality management tools in order to identify the 
problems of the sector and to understand the roots of each difficulty. 
In order to better guide the action of public authorities, we need to carry out a work of hierarchical 
organization/ prioritization of the difficulties identified. This is the objective we have pursued in the third 
part of this work.

Introduction 
The transport sector is vital to any economy. The case of Morocco, raised in this article, is treated with the aim to 
highlight the problems of this sector. We have focused on road transport as it provides 90% of people mobility and 
75% of goods flows except phosphate (DEPF, 2013). 
We have approached the topic by addressing, in the first place, the road transport sector in Morocco. This sector in 
fact, in addition to its importance for the economy and society, is characterized by a multitude of stakeholders and a 
large discrepancy between its components. The parameters and determinants vary considerably from freight 
transport to passenger transport and from urban transport to intercity and international one. 
In the second place, we have tried to structure the elements that make up the area using the Ishikawa diagram. A tool 
that allows the sector components to be classified into six major families: Materials, Mother Nature, Machine, 
Manpower, Method, Measurement (Lannoy, 2009). 
In the third place and to identify the sector problems, we have relied on the 6 W’S tool which allows to formalize the 
description of a problem by asking basic questions such as Who, What, Where, When, How? Why? How much? 
(Durand, 2004), at the level of each component classified by Ishikawa method. 
In the last place, we focused on the prioritization of the problems detected using the affinity diagram which allows 
to model and regroup with clarity the set of problems. 
As perspective, we intend to proceed through a participatory approach in order to deepen the study. Thus, surveys, 
based on the documentary analysis made at the level of this article, will be carried out among stakeholders of the

Abstract 
This STEM project is to use JAVA random simulation to differentiate statistics between Binomial (with 
replacement) and Hypergeometric (without replacement). The author used the Powerball lottery 
probability to determine the Jackpot probability by matching the numbers of five balls and the Mega 
number.  The Mega number of the red ball can be duplicated the same number of any white ball picked 
already.  There is about 12% higher probability for Jackpot if the Mega number cannot duplicate the ball 
of any white ball picked. The author derived the JAVA script to simulate two probability scenarios. 
Binomial Approximation of Hypergeometric Probability by adjusting the sample size in the pool was also 
studied.  When the pool size is larger, the probability difference between whether the Mega number can 
duplicate the white ball number becomes smaller.  The ratio of two probabilities will approach 1 when the 
pool size becomes larger.  JAVA script can demonstrate this Probability Approximation pattern.  This 
STEM project is successful since the author can integrate learning across Statistics, and JAVA as a Data 
Science approach.

1. Introduction
In statistics, binomial distribution allows duplicates, while hypergeometric distribution cannot create duplicates. The 
aim of the project is to find examples of binomial and hypergeometric distribution in real life. The example used 
was the Powerball lottery to calculate the differences between the two distributions. On January 13, 2016, Powerball 
created the largest jackpot in U.S. history of 1.5 billion as shown in Figure 1. The rule of matching with the red ball 
is following the binomial distribution, and the white ball is following hypergeometric distribution.

5. Conclusion 
This project used JAVA random simulation to define the difference between Binomial (with replacement) and 
Hypergeometric (without replacement). The Powerball lottery was used to determine difference between the two 
distributions. A Java program was used to simulate two probability scenarios. The calculations of matching 
probability done by hand also matched the calculations done with java. Different scenarios were also studied by 
varying pool size. There is a 9-20% higher probability of matching if using hypergeometric distribution.  When the 
pool size is larger, the probability difference between binomial and hypergeometric distribution becomes smaller.  
The ratio of two probabilities will approach 1 when the pool size becomes larger. This STEM project is successful 
since the author can integrate learning across Statistics, and JAVA as a Data Science approach.

Abstract 
Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an important but irrational number in math. It is 
a frequently used number which can be used to find the circumference and area of a circle, as well as the 
surface area and volumes of spheres and cylinders. The purpose of this project to find pi with higher 
accuracy. A Java Monte Carlo simulation method is developed to generate random points in the 
coordinate. By counting the number of points inside and outside the circle, we can calculate the Pi. The 
sample size can be controlled in the Java program. For each sample size, it was repeated for twenty times 
see how the relationship between accuracy and the sample size. In the end, the Monte Carlo Method was 
revised to further improve the Pi accuracy. 
Keywords 
Monte Carlo Method, Java 
1. Introduction
The first thing that was done when starting this project was to find why the accuracy of pi is so important. An 
example of this would be in the very place that humans all live on, earth. This planet’s radius is about 3959 miles. 2 
different estimates of pi were used on different accuracy levels(3.14 and 3.1416) to calculate an approximation of 
the earth’s circumference. The two results were 24862.52(about 39 miles difference) and 24875.1888(26 miles 
difference). Just by 4 digits of pi, the accuracy of the circumference is increased. 
2. Objectives
When starting this project, 3 questions were asked. One, is simulating pi by using java possible? Two, what was the 
relationship between the sample size value in the simulation and the result? Three, how many digits of pi do people 
really need? Later on as the project was continued, another goal was added- to shorten the code while increasing the 
accuracy. 
3. Methods
3.1 Overview 
To achieve the goal of using Java to simulate pi, the first step was to find the most effective Method to implement 
into Java while still getting accurate results. After researching, I narrowed my choices down to 2. The first one was 
the traditional Method. This Method involved cutting up a circle into many small(near) triangle pieces. After 
rearranging, the user is left with a(near) trapezoid. Then one side of the trapezoid was divided by the other, leaving 
the result with pi(this ratio was close to that of the circumference of a circle to the diameter). The second Method 
was the Monte Carlo Method, which was later picked because it was easier and faster to implement into java. Later

Figure 5. Pi Digits Impact on Accuracy 
5. Conclusion
When the project was completed, all goals were achieved. Java was used to successfully simulate pi, it was 
concluded that the sample size impacted the result, determined that only needed 6 digits of pi, and the code was 
shortened even though the accuracy improved. For the future, another goal will be added, which is to measure the 
computation time for each of the codes, then compare them. 
The Sphere Method did not work as well as the other two Methods. After some investigating, the root cause of this 
was found. First, the Monte Carlo Method with the Upper Triangle Method were compared. The concentration of 
the dots was higher within the same sample size for the Upper Triangle Method. However, that wasn't the only 
reason. The further away the dots were from the circumference of the circle, the less accurate the value of the data 
was. The Upper Triangle Method took care of these outliers by limiting the location to the upper half. This 
concludes that the accuracy is also dependant on how the data is to the circumference.  
The results from the same sample sizes in the Monte Carlo Method and the Sphere Method were compared. The 
Monte Carlo Method did have the outliers, but the error was exponentially increased after using the Sphere Method. 
It is concluded from these observations that because the dot distribution in the Sphere Method is less concentrated 
than in the Monte Carlo Method, therefore results for Sphere Method are the least accurate. 
In the end, the first few digits of pi were consistently outputted. In the future, I plan to expand the range of numbers 
and increase the consistency of the accurate results by changing the variables that show correlation to accuracy.

Abstract 
Hospital logistics is viewed as a vital part of a hospital that is in charge of purchasing, receiving, stock 
management, etc. It accounts up to 46 % of hospital budget, which is considered as a very substantial 
proportion, especially in the context of budgetary restrictions applied to all organizations including 
hospitals. The literature contains different definitions of hospital logistics as well as its activities, 
which vary depending on authors and studies. This paper tries to meet the need to clarify the logistics 
filed within health care institutions, and covers essentially its activities, their organization and 
management.  
Firstly, we aim to determine logistics manifestations within hospitals and to identify exhaustively its 
activities. Secondly, we will focus on the organization and management of these activities in order to 
point out the department or service that handles them, through a comparison between various 
countries including France, Quebec, the United States and Morocco. The methodology followed is a 
literature review based on the analysis of more than 60 papers, mostly published between 2000 and 
2017. The selected articles cover some topics related to hospital logistics, and deal with the activities 
and the responsibilities of the logistics department. Due to the diversity of hospital logistics activities, 
we observe that different departments are involved in their management and some of them are 
outsourced.  
Key words  
Hospital logistics, logistics activities, logistics management, organization of hospital logistics. 
Introduction 
Hospitals around the world are challenged by the increased pressure in terms of reducing costs and better 
manage their activities, while continuing to meet the needs of an increasingly demanding population. As a 
significant proportion of hospital cost is devoted to logistics activities, which can account for up to 46% of the 
hospital budget (Chow and Heaver, 1994; Bourgeon, Constantin and Karolszyk, 2001), hospital logistics can be 
a key driver for leveraging cost savings (Kidd, 2002; Acton, 2000), and an efficient way to improve hospitals’ 
services (Landry and Philippe, 2004). 
The literature in hospital logistics raises a wide range of activities which do not represent the core mission of 
hospitals, but they are necessary to provide health care to patients and take part into the definition of the service 
level. The aim of this article is to provide a global view of hospital logistics activities and their management

Abstract 
Here a capacitated lot sizing problem is formulated differently (by using the formulation given by Vimal 
(2012 in a totally different context of warehouse location distribution problem); and it leads to new 
formulation of CLSP with set up, production and inventory costs; and hence valid inequalities given in 
Miller et. al. (2000) are applicable with few modifications. It opens up new area of research, and we give 
an additional valid in equality CLSP in this paper (see (9) below). It is to be noted that the model 
proposed here has additional inequality (apart from less number of variables as in Sharma et. al (2017)), 
and it would lead to further computational advantage.   
Keywords 
Reformulation of general CLSP; Promising valid inequalities for CLSP with no shortages allowed 
1. Introduction
Capacitated single item lot sizing problem (CLSP) with setup, production, and inventory is a well-studied problem 
(see Miller et al. (2000) for a detailed literature review). They give several valid inequalities of CLSP which resulted 
in a reformulation that can be solved much more easily, as shortage variables are eliminated and we have a model 
that has less numbers of variables which leads to computational advantage (compared to effort required to solve the 
0-1 mixed integer programming formulation of CLSP with set up, production, inventory and shortage costs). We
pose capacitated single item lot sizing problem (CLSP) with setup, production, backorders and inventory as CLSP
with set up, production and inventory costs by using a new formulation given by Vimal (2012). We can then use
valid inequality given in Miller et al. (2000) with few alterations. Additional valid inequality is given in this paper
(see (9).

Thus we give model A4 which is Model A3 + (9). We note that equation (9) is not used frequently in literature.  
Sharma et.al (2017) have shown that Model A3 will offer computational advantages. It is to be noted that equations 
(9) is given not in Miller et. al. (2000); Nadjib  et al. (2006); Karimi et al. (2003) and Wolsey (2002). It is hoped that 
we may get better results by solving A4 (due to additional constraint (9)) and that these are not considered in Miller 
(2000)). This ensures that ‘feasibility’ of vector of yj (in Model A4) that is considered in solution method and that it 
reduces search space.  
 
 
3. Conclusion 
 
We note that Sharma et. al (2017) posed capacitated lot sizing problem (CLSP) with set up, production, inventory 
and shortage can be reduced to CLSP with production, set up, and inventory costs using the ideas given in Vimal 
(2012) (as this eliminated shortage variables and offered computational advantages). We are in a process of 
empirically validating usefulness of inequality (9) (over the results shown in Sharma et. al (2017)) in Model A4 (not 
considered in Miller (2000), which was found to be effective in the context of warehouse location problems (Sharma, 
1991)and (Sharma and Berry, 2017).

Abstract 
The objective of this work is to measure the impact of the freeway construction on the accessibility of the 
city of Fez. Accessibility was measured in order to search for better logistics connectivity of the Moroccan 
economy with international markets. To reach our goal, we have organized this work into two parts. The 
first was accessibility’s concept approach taking into account its potential and geographical dimensions and 
the second consisted of an application to the city of Fez from several regions of Morocco. 
As for the methodological side, we used Shimbel index to measure geographic accessibility, the graph 
theory to model and assess the road network and Hansen model to measure the potential accessibility. 
As a result, we estimate that Fez geographical and potential accessibilities were improved by 18% and 1% 
respectively after the Fez-Oujda freeway startup. We also note that a potential gain of 30% is possible if the 
Fez-Tetouan freeway project is achieved.

1. Introduction
Generally, the level of service in the transportation system is related to the accessibility of a site or a city. This 
accessibility varies from one city to another depending on the means put in place for serving these sites. Thus, by 
limiting itself to the study of the infrastructure that is part of the transportation system, accessibility is a measure that 
estimates the performance of this infrastructure. Also, accessibility allows us to measure the spatial impact of existing 
or planned transport networks. 
The objective of this work is to present the notion of accessibility and the indicators used, to measure the impact of 
the Fez-Oujda motorway infrastructure on the accessibility of the city of Fez and finally to measure the potential 
impact of the project construction of the Fez Tetouan highway.

Taking into account the employed and unemployed who have already worked, there is a clear improvement in terms 
of potential accessibility for the city of Fez. Indeed, we have + 0.37% in emissivity and + 0.88% in attractiveness. On 
the other hand, the maximum of the surplus is 3.19% in emissivity for the city of Jerada and 1.62% in attractiveness 
for the city of Taza. 
 
4. Conclusion  
 
At the beginning of this work, we defined the concept of the transport system and the accessibility as well as the tools 
used. A transportation system is a combination of three elements; the transportation industry, transportation services 
and infrastructure. Accessibility is considered to be the greater or lesser ease with which a place can be reached from 
one or more other places. 
In this context, the objective of our study is to measure the contribution of the motorway infrastructure on the 
accessibility of the city of Fez, by comparing the before and after opening of the motorway infrastructure .

To achieve this objective, we used the Shimbel index to measure geographic accessibility, graph theory to model and 
evaluate the road network, and Hansen's approach to measuring accessibility. 
The measurement of the indicators reveals several conclusions. The commissioning of the Fez Oujda highway has 
resulted in a positive gain in terms of geographical and potential accessibility. On the other hand, a potential gain is 
possible if the project of the Fez Tetouan highway is realized. 
It is important to note that accessibility is essential for infrastructure planning. It helps determine in advance the utility 
of building a new infrastructure or not, by measuring its potential impact on road network connectivity. 
In addition, other research could be done, such as the study of transit accessibility or the transportation of goods. In 
addition, accessibility indicators can be improved by taking into account other criteria, in addition to travel time or 
distance, for example transport costs, coefficients reflecting the difficulty of the journey, can be determined from 
interviews and surveys.

Abstract 
Assembly line design has direct influence on manufacturing productivity. Poor assembly line design will 
increase the cost of production. The aim of this project was to remodel the production assembly line for 
cost reduction while not decreasing the productivity by conducting process flow evaluation and developing 
an improved model of the assembly line. The weight-distance method was applied to determine the score 
of current shop-floor layout of the metal division assembly line. Using the same method, a proposed shop 
floor layout is developed. Using the precedence diagram, manufacturing critical path for the current and 
proposed layout was identified and reviewed using a discrete event simulation software.  Total weight-
distance of the current layout was calculated and valued at 10584.822. Ranking of each department base on 
the total closeness factor was used to justify the development of the layout design. Layout design A has a 
weight-distance score of 7708.842 whereas layout design B has a weight distance score of 8564.902. 
Through a discrete event simulation software, process flow for hood was simulated with batch size of 100, 
150 and 200. Future research can focus on machining line balancing and methods of implementing 
ergonomic standards and automation for repetitive processes.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of Study 
In manufacturing industries, the quality and quantity of product depends mostly on the design of the assembly line. 
There are various problems that are associated with assembly line which can affect the overall productivity of a 
manufacturing company. Poor line balancing cause increase in idle time and lead time. Having excessive process steps 
in an assembly line requires more capital investment for machineries, equipment and workstations. Furthermore, poor 
utilization of machines and equipment can cause inefficient utilization of available floor space and bottleneck is more 
likely to occur in the assembly line. All these problems contribute by increasing the production cost of assembly line. 
In order to improve the productivity without incurring additional cost, there is a need to carefully study the assembly 
line in order to develop a solution to these problems.

Abstract 
In recent years, the atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based techniques have gained popularity in biomedical 
applications. Different modes such as contact, no-contact, and nanoindentaiton of an AFM can be very useful to 
understand nanoscale phenomena of cancerous cells. In particular, morphological and phase contrast images, and 
nanomechanical data obtained from an AFM can provide a better understanding on the nature, strength and 
progression these cells, and treatment measures can be adopted based on the diagnoses results. This paper provides 
an overview of different AFM-based scanning modes and its prospects in biomedical applications based on an 
extensive review of existing literature available in public domain. Outcomes of this study are expected to be 
beneficial for researchers and medical professionals in getting familiarized with the AFM technologies and their 
applications as novel diagnostic tools.

Abstract 
We propose a Commercialization Model incorporating decision analysis where the value created 
by the owner/s of the SME is subjected for assessment from different angles. This assessment includes the 
feasibility study, which considers all the uncertainties surrounding SME sustainability. These 
uncertainties involve uncertainties at the development phase of the business idea. Many SMEs in Oman 
face uncertain demand for example and the feasibility study conducted at the early phase of the business 
does not do simulation or scenario analysis. We suggest the use of the Decision Analysis (DA) science in 
Engineering to help the SMEs study their market carefully and take calculated risk. The application of the 
field Decision Analysis fits very well and yet helps them make “good” decision.  The current feasibility 
study for example used by Riyada-Public Authority for SME Development is static and never perform 
sensitivity analysis for the SME owner. According to the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), one critical 
challenge faced by SMEs in Oman include high costs of conducting professional feasibility studies which 
may be the case in other part of the world.  In brief, we are going to develop a decision analysis assistive 
tool that is going to give a decision quality score at each stage of the innovation process.  
Keywords 
Innovation, SME sustainability, Decision Analysis. 
1. Rationale and Motivation
Innovation and entrepreneurship are critical elements in diversification of economy worldwide 
and the engines for economic growth and job creation. The role of innovation in SMEs creation and 
sustainability is critical. SMEs depend heavily on new ideas or novel research outcome, which leads to 
the definition of Innovation as, is the useful exploitation of an idea. The innovation process stats in 
general with an idea that can be translated into product or services which has a value. The value can take 
different shapes such as knowledge, economic, social…etc. Innovation is viewed as an engineering 
process where ideas and research outputs can be seen as input entities to the process. The process output 
should be the number of ideas that was able to generate values. The effective process is the one that 
maximize the output by transforming 100% of all input ideas and business models. But in reality this is 
ideal because the transformation process from idea to value involve enabling factors that help create this

4. Significance of the DA Model
The planned goal of this paper is to provide a DA model that can assess any innovative idea or
research in advance for SMEs. The short term will be by analyzing the current innovation strategy 
decisions in Oman and identify different stakeholders and their interrelations. However, the long term will 
be a sustainable decision analysis tool that will be available to them.  This tool will guide the decision 
maker who can be the innovator himself . Therefore, this DA model tries to answer the following 
questions: 
•
Do we invest on this idea given that there is chance it may lead to no value?
Our research will develop a decision analysis tool that take into account all the enabling factors or
uncertainties that help the decision maker (individuals, universities, companies) “how” to make a
“good” decision at this initial stage. For example, to assess the probability for success, which is
different form one innovation type to another, one may accept a low chance success given that
this research is a breakthrough one.
•
If we attain the expected research or idea value, then shall we developed or invest on value
scaling given the chance we might fail to scale?
At this stage many research outputs are at lab scale level where some might think to scale the
value up by further development given the initial investment in the idea. Again, the tool should be
able to identify the enabling factor at any unique environment and give an advice to the decision
maker.
•
If we are able to scale or further develop the value, can we attain the intellectual property and
what type of IP given the chance of not attaining the IP?
The legal aspect of the IP makes it difficult to assess since at this level consist of many out-of-
control factors where the decision maker should be aware of. In general, lawyers and legal party’s
advice the decision maker.
•
If we receive the IP rights, shall we commercialize?
The final stage is the commercialization decisions where we will build a framework that starts
first will identifying the enabling factors and let the decision maker assess them.
5. Conclusion
The architecture model of commercialization for innovative scientific research is very critical to 
help bridging the gap between the innovative scientific research and commercialization. The high 
uncertainty of innovative academic scientific research and the long-term involvement and commitments 
required for these research makes it very difficult to create a market value for them to attract investors. 
Creating industry and investors interest in the early stage of the innovative academic scientific research is 
challenging because of the uncertainty with the outcomes expected from them. Thus, proper assessment is 
needed and a commercialization model that takes into consideration different factors that should be 
imbedded in the national innovation system will help to bridge the financial gap for the 
commercialization of innovative academic scientific research.  This paper provides a concept on how to 
assess innovation for SME sustainability using Decision Analysis tools and concepts.  
6. Future Works and Research
This is preliminary concept paper to illustrate how to utilize concepts of decision analysis 
into assessment of innovation to help SME sustainability. The next phase will be building the 
model that supports the hypothetical model developed by the authors.

Intuitively having more ideas (inputs) into your system will maximize the expected output or the 
surviving ideas. Therefore, one crucial element in any innovation process is the number of input to the 
system and that is why they always say “Crazy ideas are all welcomed”. These “crazy” ideas may not 
proceed to the next step and yet they will be filtered out immediately. Moreover, the interrelationships 
between the numbers of inputs are the process makes it essential to design “best innovation” model for 
unique environment that takes into considerations the types of inputs, types of outputs, and “process 
gearing” factors that translate the inputs to valid outputs. Typically, the time taken to translate an idea into 
product or services is a dependent variable on the idea maturity level, level of market readiness, level of 
funding, availability of IP legislations, etc. Each of these independent variables have several layers within 
themselves. Moreover, the self-motivation and creative thinking of individuals, universities, and 
companies will drive the process for transforming ideas to useful values. However, this motivation 
decline by time spent in this process and as a result of market’s change and the pace of innovation, the 
idea value may decline as well.  
For Planning the process of innovation and developing a successful innovation model, we 
propose to measure it based on the number and value of outputs. We plan to create a model that can help 
reduce the amount of the resources that might be spent to create this value. Thus, the innovator 
(individual, universities, companies) will have a decision tool for the assessment of the innovation 
process. For example, a faculty member may provide a research proposal where the stated value is to 
create novel methodology that can be patented and later licensed and requested a fund. The funder may 
accept the proposal and assign a chance for the risk to fail and no novel methodology is created and the 
maximum benefit is a publication with acknowledgment to the funder. The decision tool will assist both 
the faculty and the funder to make “good” decision where all alternatives are listed with the surrounding 
uncertainties and the preferences for the value created. Individuals may have different preferences than 
companies or universities. Many times technology development and funding decisions are made without 
any consideration of IP early in the process. This may result in an innovation with limited protect ability 
leading to limited opportunity for commercialization. This research will consider these factors very early 
in the process which will have impact the overall process. There is ample evidence of technology and 
innovation where IP was an afterthought. Consequently, the inventors and developers are unable to reap 
the full benefits of their innovations. This research will address these challenges and create a 
comprehensive analysis and decision-support tool. The tool that we propose to create will be illustrated in 
the next sections.   
 
 
3. Decision Analysis (DA) Model in Innovation 
The need for decision analysis is crucial in SME sustainability and it leads to apply the decision 
based design concepts.  “Decision-based design (DBD) is an approach to engineering design that 
recognizes the substantial role that decisions play in design and in other engineering activities, largely 
characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, risk, and trade-offs. This research will combine two fields: 
Engineering Decision Analysis and Economical Assessments. The aggressive nature of competition in 
today’s markets makes innovation in SME a central point of contest. The benefit goes to the companies 
that are able to efficiently introduce products (price and performance) into the market. SMEs in Oman 
must guide their development effort toward three main objectives: low price, high quality, and long 
marketing window. The low cost Feasibility Study available in Oman are guiding them by applying a one 
single scenario profit i.e. profit is the margin between cost and selling price. The marginal profit must be 
sufficient in order to sustain SMEs and help them to grow. But we all know that high performance comes 
with high price and as a result a low demand. Having competitive edge in price and performance makes it 
a challenge for SMEs. While these objectives are often clashing or conflicting, they must be compromised 
using a normative approach by applying decision analysis.  Balancing these conflicting objectives using a 
normative approach helps to make SMEs efficient and business strategies effective.

Abstract 
The development of several ambulance location models have been discussed in the academic 
literature. Most of these models have been further extended to consider more realistic situations 
into account and the use of different assessment criteria. However, there is not an exhaustive 
literature that takes the existing standard models to compare them according to the criteria used 
in practice. In this work, we undertake the task of comparing the performance of several 
ambulance location models on coverage and response time criteria. The results of this work are 
important to help emergency medical organizations to define their most adequate model for 
defining their ambulance base structure. The comparison of the models is carried out on two 
Mexican emergency operations of the Red Cross located in the cities of Tijuana and Monterrey.

Abstract 
The nurse scheduling problem is among the most widely studied problem in literature. Nurse scheduling is 
concerned about allocating nurses to conduct specific tasks. The various objectives and constraints of this 
problem that changes from country to country and from hospital to hospital makes it very hard to solve. 
Furthermore, lack of resources makes this scheduling task very challenging. Many hospitals are still 
executing nurses scheduling manually, which is indeed a cumbersome and time consuming task. This, 
however, may lead to high chances and risks of not fulfilling all rules set by the hospital. Therefore, this 
article presents a goal programming framework model to scheduling nurses working at the emergency 
department with the objective to increase fairness in shifts distribution. The experimental results highlights 
the importance of developing heuristic or meta-heuristic approaches to solve such NP-hard problem.

I. INTRODUCTION
Due to its complexity, the nurse scheduling problem has been a widely studied topic in the last few decades. Nurse 
scheduling is the procedure of developing rosters or timetables for nurses working at the hospital or at a specific ward 
in such a way that these rosters fulfil the staff requirements according to the number of patients, and respect the 
workplace regulations and policies. The schedules assign nurses to different shifts within a given time horizon such as 
a week or a month. Scheduling can greatly affect the performance and efficiency of the work and healthcare services. 
Nurse scheduling is usually done manually in many hospitals. However, it is cumbersome task to manually develop a

Lastly, Equations (17-18) are the non-negativity constraint for the deviational variables (d1- k , d1+k, d12- k , d2+k, d3- k , 
d3+k) and the non-negativity constraint for the deviational variables (f1-j,k , f1+j,k , f2-i,k , f2+i,k, f3-s,k – f3+s,k), 
respectively. Equation (19) defines the variables as binary variables. 
V. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS 
The nurse scheduling problem was proven to be NP-hard problem. Nevertheless, to test the efficiency of the proposed 
model a small scale test case problem was randomly generated. Details of the test case problem is as follows:  
 
Number of senior nurses = 12 
 
Number of intermediate nurses = 12 
 
Number of junior nurses = 12 
 
Number of scheduling horizon days = 14 
 
Minimum days off per nurse per schedule = 5 
 
Maximum night shifts per nurse per schedule = 6 
 
Maximum consecutive working days = 5 
 
Average number of shifts per nurse per schedule = 10 
 
Required number of nurses per shift = 8 
 
Minimum number of senior nurses per shift = 1 
 
Minimum number of intermediate nurses per shift = 3 
 
Minimum number of senior nurses per shift = 2 
 
The test case problem was solved by implementing the mathematical model using LINGO version 13.0. However, 
LINGO was unable to handle this size. The infeasibility was due to the constraint of having integer and binary 
deviational variables. When the integer deviational variables constraint was relaxed, a feasible solution was found, 
however, it makes no sense to have number of nurses in real numbers. 
This finding emphasis on the importance of developing heuristic or meta-heuristic approaches to solve such NP-hard 
problem. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK  
This paper developed a mathematical model to solve the nurse scheduling problem. The mathematical model 
considered nurses working at an emergency department where there is three level of nurses’ skills. The objective of 
the model is to minimize the shortages of nurses in a given shift while minimizing the variation in workload 
distribution between them during the scheduling horizon. The constraints of the model were designed based on the 
regulations that are considered at the Emergency Department at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital.  
This problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. The developed mathematical model can be used to solve only small 
size problem. It is necessary to develop some intelligent method such as heuristic or meta-heurist to deal with medium 
to large size real problem. Therefore, in the near future, some intelligent methods will be developed and extensive 
numerical analysis will be conducted to compare them with mathematical model developed in this research.

Abstract 
This paper investigates the adoption status of lean manufacturing (LM) in the transport and logistics 
sector of Thailand. A survey questionnaire was design, validated and distributed among Thai transport 
and logistics companies. In total, 120 useable responses were received and analysed using descriptive 
statistics. The results of the study indicate that the implementation of LM is relatively high, with PDCA, 
5S and root cause analysis being the most implemented LM approaches and tools. However, the LM’s 
implementation was found to be mainly contained within individual departments or improvement 
projects, rather than being a company’s wide strategy. Main challenges to LM implementation included: 
organisational structure of companies, misalignment between goals of individuals and their companies, 
and lack of sustainment of a lean culture. Main benefits were the ability to identify and reduce waste, 
increased productivity and better organisation of workstations. On the other hand, lack of understanding, 
knowledge and expertise in LM were the main reasons for not implementing it, plus the use of 
technology-based tools instead of LM. Non-LM companies showed interest in adopting LM in the future, 
with JIT, Kaizen and Six Sigma being the most likely to implement. This study is among the very first of 
its kind. It offers academics, researchers and practitioners interested in LM and/or the transport and 
logistics sector with some initial evidence of the adoption of LM in this industrial sector of Thailand.

Abstract 
This paper studies the relationship between innovation and the level of growth in family-owned small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this is done within the context of Mexico. The conceptual framework 
of analysis is based on the hypothesis that innovation in products, processes and management systems 
contribute to the achievement of growth in family-owned SMEs. To test this hypothesis, a model of 
structural equation of second order was developed with data collected from 206 family-owned SMEs 
located in the state of Aguascalientes, Mexico. The empirical evidence provided by the analysis supports 
the hypothesis, showing that family-owned SMEs that increase their innovation activities will also 
significantly increase their opportunities for growth. This finding can be used to inform the business

the questionnaire was only administrated to the managers of family-owned SMEs. This created the assumption that 
they had significant knowledge regarding innovation activities and business growth. Future research can also apply 
the same questionnaire to employees, customers and suppliers in order to validate the results obtained.

Abstract 
Facing fierce competition in the marketplace, companies should try to determine the optimal settings of 
new products design. Human perception becomes the main objective in product development. This is 
related to consumer taste and preferences. In order to realize a well-designed product that appeals to 
costumers, the product not only should meet the physical requirements of consumers but also has to satisfy 
their affective needs. Thus, in a diverse and highly competitive market, successful products may not those 
with desirable product form. This study proposes Bayesian Rough Set model to deal some uncertainties and 
incomplete data in classification data. Bayesian Rough Set method has the strength to solve vagueness in 
human sensory data with the probabilistic approximation to identify the relation rules between human 
perception and product exterior design. This is also useful to handle heterogeneous population, 
contradictive between generalization versus customization, and uncertainty – inconsistency in market 
segmentation. At the final result, the proposed method get the better result than conventional method 
(Rough Set) as followed: The proposed method get accuracy improvement rather than conventional method 
(Rough Set), i.e. 12.07%, and confidence level as big as 10.61%.

1. Introduction
The issue of heterogeneity in order to determine settings of new product design is critical and has been noticed by
many researchers. If not carefully taken into account, heterogeneity may lead to erroneous data interpretations or 
biased coefﬁcient estimates. Heterogeneity can be roughly divided into two kinds: the observed and the unobserved 
(Washington et al., 2003; Cameron and Trivedi, 2005). Observed heterogeneity refers to inter-individual differences 
that are controlled or measured by explanatory variables; on the other hand (Do. Bagus, et. al., 2016), unobserved 
heterogeneity refers to all other differences. While unobserved heterogeneity is difﬁcult to deal with due mostly to 
data limitations, researchers have put a lot of effort into reducing possible heterogeneity in on-hand data. 
In the past, one of the many approaches that marketing researchers did to reducing heterogeneity is to select 
relatively homogeneous data. Some have considered adoption at the aggregate level, as the result of a diffusion process 
to which the concept of innovativeness is central. Related studies purport to capture inherent differences between 
earlier and later adopters on the basis of demographic, socio-economic or psychological factors, individual perceptions 
of the product and features, or the degree of innovativeness and interpersonal communication (Do. Bagus, et. al., 
2017).  
Innovativeness and interpersonal communication have been largely reported as major determinants of adopter 
categories. Innovators have been identified as newness seekers, sensitive to the time elapsed since product 
introduction. Laggards are known to seek reassurance through interpersonal communication word-of-mouth before 
making a purchase decision; intermediate adopter categories lie somewhere between the two extremes. Specific 
combinations of these factors, time elapsed since product introduction (from here-on referred to as introduction time) 
and an amount of interpersonal communication (from here-on referred to as word-of-mouth), make up what can be 
called product-specific diffusion-related situations.

in figure 2. In figure 2, we can see the convergence's speed different between rough set and Bayesian rough set. As in 
this experiment, we don't use threshold, so we were using generation or iteration as stopping criteria in order to 
optimize the best fitness. Thus, we set stopping criteria with the condition, i.e. if there are 50 generation or iteration 
that have same best fitness value then we assumed the data has convergences and the computational time will stop. 
The final result of this experiment, we found that the data is convergence at 168’s generation or iteration for the rough 
set. And for the Bayesian rough set model, the data convergence at 287’s generation or iteration. 
 
5. Discussion and Conclusion 
5.1 Discussion 
The results from table 5 and 6 may suggest that the consumers purchasing decision with strong pattern, i.e. high 
rules strength, are most likely related to the prize and the product packaging itself. Although, the prize of the products 
is the highest factor which reflection of consumer desire, yet product packaging or product exterior design also should 
be considered as supporting primary factor as consumers want. The characteristic of product packaging such as bright 
colors and large sizes is more preferable to consumers – even there are many combination of conditional attribute that 
becoming consumers purchasing factor. 
In the proposed method to extract uncertain probabilistic, decision rule should be determined two aspects i.e. 
certain decision rules and evaluation factor rules. Those factors are bounded with parameters of probabilistic of the 
rough set theory, which is shown in Equation 8 and 9. Such probabilities are experientially acceptable in human 
evaluation data. If the larger the conditional probability is, the larger the information gain is too. Which means The 
definition of information gain by 1 corresponds with our intuition that the large increment of P(Dj|Ei) being more than 
P(Dj) should take larger information gain when P(Dj) is low, while the same increment of P(Dj|Ei) should take smaller 
information gain when P(Dj) is high. Since the information gain enables to evaluate the influence of the set of 
conditional attributes on decision class relative to its prior probability. We conducted comparison parameters of 
probabilistic for variety of clustered consumer desires. It should be noted that β ≤ 1−P(Dj). In other words, β should 
be less than the residual of the prior probability P(Dj). if it is taken  = 0, POSβ(Dj), NEGβ(Dj) and BNDβ(Dj) are 
characterized by P(Dj|Ei) ≥ P(Dj), P(Dj|Ei) ≤ P(Dj), and P(Dj|Ei)= P(Dj) , respectively. As the value of β increases up 
to min (1−P(Dj),P(Dj)), the positive and negative regions decrease, and boundary region increases. Furthermore, as 
the value of β increases, the information associated with Dj is strongly relevant to Ei.

Abstract 
Periodontal diseases are of the common oral infectious diseases that early diagnosis is very important. 
This study aims to evaluate the artificial neural network role in the periodontal disease diagnosis. The 
Diagnostic Study were performed from periodontal disease cases in Zahedan Dentistry School in the 
period of time between 2015 and 2016. Clinical Indices were evaluated in these people. The feed forward 
artificial neural network model with propagation algorithm of Levenberg-Marquardet training function 
was used. Periodontal patients were divided into two groups of train (160 people), and test (30 people). 
The results showed that Levenberg-Marquardet algorithm with fewer iterations and a minimum mean 
square error and low time can used to diagnosis of periodontal disease. Therefore, artificial neural 
network is a good tool for diagnosing a periodontal disease

Abstract 
The main objective of this study is to assess the work-related musculoskeletal discomforts (WMSDs) 
among college teachers. The study was a descriptive research. Survey questionnaire and modified Nordic 
Musculoskeletal Questionnaire were used as a research instrument to gather information from full time 
college teachers with a lecture method of teaching. The proponents surveyed 109 college teachers using 
purposive non-random sampling. The percentage formula, weighted mean, and Pearson’s chi-square were 
the statistical treatment used in the study and the significant relationship between the level of physical 
discomforts and the respondent’s demographic profile, and teaching-related factors were determined. 
Demographic profile includes age, gender, height, weight, type of school, and teaching experience. 
Working condition has been identified in terms of teaching hours, preparations per week, average class 
size length of standing and sitting per day, and the commonly used teaching technique. As a result, the top 
three body parts which experienced discomforts were lower back (x̄  = 2.55; 2.72), shoulders (x̄  = 2.46; 
2.61), and ankles/ feet (x̄  = 2.44; 2.58), respectively, for both left and right side, and interpreted as having 
mild to moderate pain. This showed that college teachers are also having physical discomforts that may 
contribute in developing musculoskeletal disorders.

Abstract 
This study aims to explore and analyse the organisation and performance evaluation of the new product in 
285 manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The methods in this study using the survey through a 
questionnaire that already created and modified according to the manufacturing sector in Indonesia. The 
respondents are manager level in the various departments such as marketing, product planning, product 
development, and R&D. The results stated that marketing department has a significant role in providing 
and determining the idea of new product while R&D department is implementing that idea to be feasible. 
The initiative to develop new products come from the direction of the top-level management and from 
external. Around 61% of companies have formal procedures in the development of new products but does 
not have a special unit to deal with this activity. Out of all, 74% stated that another party holds the 
activity. Regarding the performance of new products, the implementation of the development of new 
products provides benefits to the company, both internally and externally. In the future, this study should 
be extending the coverage area and subsector of manufacturing industry.

Abstract 
    Accurate diagnosis of diseases and their level of intensity is a key aspect of health. A minor error in 
medical diagnosis, besides diverting the course of treatment and increasing the duration of therapy, raises 
the cost of services, leads to psychological trauma, and most importantly jeopardizes patient safety. The 
shorter the time of diagnosis, the easier it is to prevent, fight, treat and control the disease at lower 
intensity levels. Thus, it is essential to provide a model to deal with the possible errors of diagnosis in 
healthcare system. The present article introduces an engineering method for detecting and diagnosing 
faults in patient treatment. In the first phase, the factors affecting the emergence of the disease are 
predicted using Perceptron neural network. In the second stage residual values are produced; and in the 
third stage, in case there is a fault, the sources and causes of the fault are examined with the help of 
statistical quality control charts. Validation of the proposed model is evaluated by providing a numerical 
example.

1. Introduction
Patient safety is one of the basic concepts in the healthcare systems. This issue requires maintaining and
increasing system reliability in terms of industrial elements. One way to increase system reliability in the industry is 
removing and preventing faults to reduce the number and intensity of faults. A means of accomplishing this 
important task is identifying the sources and causes of faults. In recent years, with advances in technology and 
complexity of control systems, improving the reliability of these systems has been one of the most important issues 
for researchers. Nowadays, it is important to design controllers to detect system faults and their resources. Statistical 
quality control charts are widely used in industry to control the quality of products. These charts are used to explore 
the process fluctuations, identify the source of changes and efficiency improvement and to maintain the desired 
quality level. If there is a correlation between the data, among the statistical quality control charts the residual chart 
will be chosen to reduce false alarms. The residual is defined as the difference between the observed amount of 
quality characteristics and its estimated value by a model. [1]. 
    Nowadays, with presence of medical errors and application of industrial devices in healthcare systems, it is 
possible to improve the healthcare system reliability by increasing patient safety. One of the frequent medical errors 
is failure in diagnosis, which in some cases has severe consequences and plays a prominent role in patient safety [2-
4]. According to IOM, patient safety is defined as “preventing damage to the patient” and one of the points it 
emphasizes is preventing faults. [5, 6] Researches conducted in 2016 in America have revealed that errors in 
medical diagnosis of heart disease are between the third to the eighth causes of death in America. More than 225

5. Discussion and Results 
    In order to discover and diagnose medical errors, it is possible to utilize statistical quality control charts. These 
charts are mostly used in industry. With the help of control charts, three levels of intensity for heart failure can be 
defined. Furthermore, if any point falls outside the control limits, the course of treatment for patients will be 
regarded to be out of control and the reasons for the exacerbation of the disease will be examined. It facilitates the 
diagnosis process and takes the treatment of the disease under control. In addition to psychological comfort and 
enhancing patient safety, the diagnosis and control of treatment optimizes a large part of the costs of health services 
for the patients.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of internal driver to the successful of 
implementation of GSCM practice by SMEs of furniture industry.  Thirty-five items were selected to test 
those relationship and ninety SMEs of furniture in Semarang, Kudus, and Jepara was chosen as a sample 
of this study.  Data was collected using self-administered questionnaire and personal interviews. The data 
collected was analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS) with help of SmartPLS software. The result of 
hypothesis testing indicated that all of internal driver have significant positive effect on the implementation of 
GSCM practices by SMEs of furniture in Semarang, Kudus, and Pekalongan. The effect of knowledge on the 
implementation of GSCM practices is higher compare to the other factors (involvement and support from top 
management and employee, technology, and financial).

1. Introduction  
 
Green supply chain management (GSCM) is developed from traditional supply chain management (SCM). The 
increased awareness of green practices in 1990s has triggered the enterprises to act an ethically and socially 
responsible manner in their supply chain (Diabat and Govindan, 2011). The concept of GSCM differ from 
traditional SCM, in that GSCM is integrated the environmental  thinking  into the whole  process of  supply  chain  
management including design of the product, sourcing and selection of the material, process of manufacturing, 
delivery of  the final product to the customer as well as end -of life  management  of  the  product  after  its  useful  
life (Srivastava, 2007). The concept of GSCM attracted the intention of scholarly in the beginning of 1995 and, in 
2010, this concept received the highest intention of scholarly (Luthra et al, 2014). There are so many definition of 
GSCM since this concept is developed. The  definition  of  green  supply  chain  management  varies  as  researchers  
stand  at  different  angles. One of definition of GSCM is revealed by Patrick in 2010. According to Patrick,  GSCM 
can be define as the process of using environmentally friendly inputs and transforming these inputs into outputs that 
can be reclaimed and re-used at the end of their lifecycle thus, creating a sustainable supply chain (Gardas and 
Narkhede, 2013).  The other researchers have own definition.  
 
Moreover, there is also lack of a single consensus about the emphasis of the implementation of GSCM practices 
(Murphy and Poist, 2003). It can be happen because the emphasis of the implementation of GSCM will be depends 
on the character of supply chain and the enterprise (Zhu et al., 2007). According to Zhu and Sarkis (2004) and Zhu 
et al (2005), the practices of implementation of GSCM can be differentiated into five dimensions, namely internal 
environmental management (IEM), green purchasing (GP), customer cooperation (CC), eco-design (ECO), and 
investment recovery (IR).Then, the phase of implementation of five dimensions of GSCM practice of each 
enterprise is measured using five-level Likert Scale, whereas 1= not considering it, 2 = planning to consider it, 3 = 
considering it currently, 4 = initiate implementation, 5 = implementing successfully (Zhu et al, 2005; Zhu et al, 
2013) Using a sample of 396 Chinese manufacturers, study conducted by Zhu et al (2013) revealed that the 
implementation of GSCM practices by those manufactures were varies. On the average, the implementation of","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

The result of hypothesis testing in Table 4 indicated that involvement and support from management and employee, 
technology, knowledge, and financial were significantly associated with the successful of the implementation of 
GSCM practices.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of involvement and support from management and employee, 
technology, knowledge, and financial- on the implementation of GSCM practices. It emerged that all of internal 
driver have significant positive effect on the implementation of GSCM practices by SMEs of furniture in Semarang, 
Kudus, and Pekalongan. The effect of knowledge on the implementation of GSCM practices is higher compare to 
the other factors (involvement and support from top management and employee, technology, and financial)

Abstract 
We consider the bicriteria scheduling problem of minimizing the total tardiness and total flowtime on a 
single machine. This problem, which is known to be NP-hard, is important in practice, as the former 
criterion conveys the customer’s position, and the latter reflects the manufacturer’s perspective for optimal 
resources utilization. The simultaneous optimization approach was explored. Two heuristics to minimize 
the Linear Composite Objective Function (LCOF) of the two objectives were proposed. The utility of the 
proposed models was demonstrated through computational experiments and comparative analyses against 
existing solution methods and the Branch and Bound (BB) method. The results show that the proposed 
models yield efficient and near optimal schedules in most cases and perform better than the existing 
heuristics in the literature. 
Keywords 
Linear Composite Objective Function, Bi-criteria, Total Tardiness, Total Flowtime. 
1. Introduction
A scheduling problem with only one criterion to be optimized is a single criterion problem. When more than one 
objective is to be optimized, it is called a multi-criteria problem. The simplest form of multi-criteria scheduling 
problems is the bi-criteria problem (M’Hallah, 2007; Oyetunji and Oluleye 2012). The advantages of implementing 
multi-criteria scheduling approaches over its single criteria constituents are enormous as they are preponderant in 
practice. For instance, exploring a schedule that minimizes only the total flowtime will ensure proper inventory 
management, reduction in production cost and profit maximization but offers no solution to late delivery of goods and 
services. Thus the firm may incur tardiness penalty or loses its goodwill. On the other hand, scheduling approaches 
for minimizing only the total tardiness will ensure prompt delivery of goods and services but with no consideration to 
profit variables. Therefore, combining the two criteria to form a bi-criteria problem will ensure the aggregation of the 
benefit of each component. In this regard, this paper considers the scheduling problem of minimizing the composite 
function of total flowtime and total tardiness.

8. Conclusion and recommendation 
 This paper proposed two heuristics for minimizing the LCOF of total tardiness and total flowtime on single machine 
with zero release dates.  Result of simulation shows that for the considered problem sizes; 5 ≤⁡n ≤ 1000, the 
implemented GAlg and the two proposed heuristics performed significantly better than the HeuA and HeuB from the 
literature. The implemented GAlg and the two proposed heuristics produced results that are not significantly different 
from each other. Also in terms of efficiency, though HeuA and HeuB have lower execution time, their execution time 
are not statistically different from the proposed effective solution methods.

Abstract 
This paper aims to explore the relationship between innovation process and different types of hotel 
innovation. Building on qualitative data through the case study from the hotel industry ranging from three 
to five stars. This study revealed that hotel that had relatively exist innovation capability in all three areas 
(creative-abrasion, agility, and resolution) seem to produce innovations that combine their existing skills 
with either the service or the process dimension. Correspondingly, hotels with a combination of the three 
capabilities in their service process seem to produce more intensive innovations requiring both new 
market, new services, and new technological applications. Therefore, this study provides an empirical 
contribution to the emerging work on dynamic capabilities through its in-depth investigation of the 
capacity of the seven case firms, and by mapping the patterns between the enterprise’s innovation 
capability and outcomes.

Abstract 
The growing studies that focused on the topic of linking green human resource management (GHRM) 
with green supply chain management (GSCM) has necessitate the writing of this study. Recently, 
academics and practitioners have increasingly paying attention to environmental management systems 
and policies to improve a full spectrum of manufacturing sustainable performance through adopting 
environmental management system (EMS) in two major functions in the firm such as human resource 
(HR) and supply chain (SC) departments (i.e. GHRM and GSCM practices). The integration between 
these practices can help the manufacturing organizations to achieve green corporate culture and 
enhancement their sustainable performance in order to balance the environmental, economic, and social 
performance toward community which is considered the main responsibility for manufacturing firms. The 
aim of this study is to review the various literatures on the relationship between GHRM practices, GSCM 
practices and sustainability performance. Furthermore, this study aims to propose a reasonable conceptual 
model to clarify the relationship between these three variables in the context of Palestinian manufacturing 
sector. The research findings will be specifically imperative for manufacturing organizations with the aim 
of improving their sustainability.

Assessing the Impact of Input Model Misspecification on 
Integrated Supply Chain Decisions

Abstract 
In simulation optimization, the validity of the optimal solution relies profoundly on the accuracy of the 
input model that is used to drive the uncertainty in the simulation model. However, determining the exact 
input model that perfectly mimics the underlying input processes that generate the true uncertainty in the 
real system is impracticable, because of the frequently limited available data. In practices, hypothesis testing 
imbued in the goodness-of-fit (GOF) test and validity test is often used to justify whether a certain input 
model is ‘close enough’ to represent the true input processes. The results of these tests, however, are likely 
that we fail to reject several input models, which then raise the likelihood of misspecifying the input model. 
We examine the optimality of the solutions obtained by relying on misspecified input models in optimizing 
integrated supply chain decisions, i.e. when operational, tactical, and strategic decisions are simultaneously 
optimized in terms of service level and operating cost. The results suggest that in such integrated setting, 
while the optimal scenarios obtained from each input model may likely vary, the corresponding objective 
function values do not significantly differ, especially when we account for the trade-off between service 
level and cost. Furthermore, our result also shows that the input uncertainty inherited by a certain input 
model does affect the interactions among various decision levels. Hence, the importance of obtaining a 
sufficiently accurate input model becomes more crucial in optimizing an integrated supply chain system 
via simulation optimization.

Abstract 
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) is a well-recognized performance excellence 
model or program integrated into a seven categories framework: leadership, strategy, customers, 
measurement, analysis, and knowledge management, workforce, operations, and results. Several studies 
have been performed about MBNQA such as reliability between evaluators, the difference between the 
type of industries, and validation of MBNQA model paths.  However, there is a lack of publications 
focused to increase the body of knowledge related to “Are we making progress?” the self-assessment tool 
that MBNQA created in order to any organization be able to conduct an auto-evaluation at any time. 
Therefore, this investigation has two purposes: (i) show how an organization could use the self-
assessment tool to identify opportunities for improvement and (ii) evaluate the construction of the self-
assessment tool.  In order to achieve these goals, in 2010 the self-assessment tool was applied in a 500-
bed U.S. hospital (single case study).

1. Introduction
The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) is a Performance Excellence model conferred to 
manufacturing and service organizations since 1987.  The primary goal of the MBNQA is to increase the 
competitiveness of U.S. companies.  Some of the most relevant changes that MBNQA has undergone (Collier, 
Goldstein, & Wilson, 2002) are the inclusion of education and healthcare organizations in 1999 and nonprofit or 
government organizations in 2005.  Also, MBNQA criteria have been updated over time.  Figure 1 shows the last 
three MBNQA models. 
The application for the MBNQA is three stage processes.  First, organizations require writing an extensive report.  
The leaders in the organization have to describe all the process in the organization according to the MBNQA Model. 
Second, a group of different external evaluators (2 or more) read the extensive report and assign a score.  Third, 
evaluators visit the organization to clarify some points in the report and elaborate a feedback report.  These three 
stages demand time and financial resources from organizations; however, the probability of receiving the MBNQA 
is small.  Since 1987, more than 1,100 organizations have submitted award applications (Krzykowski, 2010) and 
only 86 organizations have received the Baldrige award (NIST, 2011).  Many organizations applied multiple years 
before to receive the MBNQA from the hands of the President of the United States of America.  For example, Mercy 
Health Systems applied five times before becoming an award recipient (Thrall, 2008) and AtlantiCare did not 
qualify for a site visit in its first application (Krzykowski, 2010).  Organizations that applied to the MBNQA and did 
not win will receive evaluators report highlighting opportunities for improvement in some or each of the seven 
categories that integrate the MBNQA model: leadership, strategy, customers, measurement, analysis, and knowledge 
management, workforce, operations, and results.  This is probably the most important outcome that any organization 
receives from this process.  MBNQA is awarded for the effort that each organization has to do; therefore, this is not 
a process that all organizations are able to conclude.  For this reason, MBNQA create two standardize self-
assessment tools “Are we making progress?” and “Are we making progress as leaders?” that organizations could

In order to review how these new categories were grouped, an internal consistency test was conducted, obtaining 
Cronbach  values higher than 0.6 (see Table 4), satisfying the initial requirement (Hair et al., 2013). 
 
4. Conclusions 
Although this paper describes results from the application of “Are we making progress?” available on 2010, findings 
still could be significantly important to practitioners and researchers.  Contrasting the self-assessment tool used in 
this investigation vs. the currently available, there are only four changes observed in the self-assessment tool items 
(see Table 5).  The self-assessment tool “Are we making progress?” was useful to identify opportunities for 
improvement.  In this investigation (single case study), hospital frontline responses identified hospital strategy as an 
opportunity for improvement as well as the lack of communication about the financial status of the hospital.  On the 
other hand, the exploratory factor analysis suggested that items used in “Are we making progress?” are not well 
grouped in the initial set of seven categories.  Future work should be focused in this research line to support or reject 
this particular finding.

Abstract 
More than two-thirds of oil discovered around the world still remains unrecovered, 40 – 70% of the 
original oil is still left in place after using the conventional production technique, namely, primary and 
secondary recovery techniques (J.A. Boon, 1984). 
The world demand for petroleum has been steadily on the increase with the International Energy Agency 
(IEA) projecting that the world petroleum consumption will rise from 3564 MTOE in 2007 to as much 
5471 MTOE in 2015 and 6301 MTOE in 2030. 
Implementation of EOR methods is a must for maximizing production and recovery from Sudan’s oil 
fields. These methods must be studied carefully to assure proper selection and implementation. 
There are Six EOR Projects in Sudanese Oil Fields Namely Three Thermal EOR (two CSS and one steam 
flooding) and two chemical EOR projects and one gas/N2 injection projects, the thermal projects are 
under implementation phase meanwhile the other Chemical /Gas projects are under Designing and 
Evaluation. 
In this Paper there will be an overview of Thermal EOR Projects in Sudanese Oil Fields, illustrate and 
analyze the CSS Concerns and Challenges in Sudanese oil fields such as Depth limitation (more than 
1400m), Conventional completion wells, Comingle Injection & Production. 
The Result show that the thermal EOR projects are very successful and almost gave double production 
from 130 bbl/day to 300 bbl/day in FNE Oil Field and from 280 bbl/day to 440 bbl/day in Bamboo Oil 
Field. 
In order to get maximum recovery from the wells it’s highly recommended to select shallow depth, 
thermal completion and to avoid comingle layer injection or to use special technique for separate layer 
injection.

Abstract 
A descriptive research whose purpose is to study the saving behaviors and the factors related to the saving 
behaviors for government officers who aged 50 and above. The sample size was selected through 
purposive random sampling, 261 officers, from 7 colleges nationwide. Descriptive statistics was then 
used to analyze the data which includes 95 respondents. Data was collected using mailed questionnaires 
whose face validity and reliability =0.78. The findings with regards to saving behavior revealed that 
females had an efficient amount of savings, various types of saving money and saving purpose more than 
males. Those from the age range of 53-55 years has better saving behavior than other groups like using 
types of savings to acquire real estate  and the saving purpose for emergency use . The single group and 
the instructors group had less than 5,000 baht/month of savings, using forms of saving money in buying 
real estate more than other groups. The married group had more saving for emergency use compared to 
the other groups. For the economic factors (income and expenditures) and saving behavior, in relation to 
income/month and type of savings, most groups chose to buy real estate and savings through bank 
accounts and cooperatives more than the other groups.  
Keywords: Saving behavior, retirement of the government officers 
1. Introduction
As the proportion of senior citizen is increasing, Thailand is indeed heading towards a complete aged society by 
2020 which means a society where 20% of the entire population is 60-year-old or older. As for governmental 
officers, within the span of 5 and 10 years, the proportion of those older than 60 will have accounted for 7.29% and 
21.95% of the entire governmental officers by Nontagorn Kajanajittra (2016:45). Therefore, preparation for aged 
society is needed, along with sound financial management (including reasonable management of incomes, expenses 
and savings). This is essential that these government officers are able to have a sufficient amount of saving for daily 
expenses and healthcare in order to ensure a comfortable retirement although they only have their pension to rely on. 
According to a study of a titled “the impacts of changes in demographic composition in relation to saving patterns in 
the future” by Pudsorn  Simanong : (2009:Abstract), it was revealed that senior female governmental officers are 
better than their male counterparts when it comes to saving and managing their savings. Concerning the purposes of 
saving, the most common reason for saving among government officers is their offspring education while the 
secondary reason being expenses after retirement. Moreover, a study carried out in a titled “incomes and saving 
types for retirement among population aged between 30 to 40-year-olds in the district of Rangsit, Bangkok” by 
Saravee  Budbumrung (2012:Abstract) which found that those with highest propensity to save are compelled to do 
because of the concern about their financial stability after retirement (𝑥̅ = 4.54), savings for retirement (𝑥̅ =4.61) and 
saving for their offspring (𝑥̅ =4.42). Furthermore, a study by Kritipas Lerdsonkarm (2012 :Abstract) about saving 
behaviors  and factors affecting saving behaviors  among employees in a real estate company who earns less than 
142 $  per month (which account for 29.37% of the total number of employees) revealed that saving for emergency 
and long term are the main reasons for saving among employees.

addition, females tend to think before spending and females that have less than 142 $/month saving for emergency, 
especially those females who are married (15.78%). This is because they tend to think about families before 
spending and are mindful about spending in the case of emergency. Granted, the subjects in the age group of 53-55 
year-old tend to have the greatest propensity to save. As for the subjects with academic position  earning less than 
142 $/ month, the non-risk types of saving were used such as purchasing real estate while those saving more than 
142 $ (dentists, pharmacists or professional nurses) tend to have riskier savings such as governmental funds, bonds 
or stocks for greater return profits. 
 For factors affecting saving behaviors, It was revealed that for subjects with less than 714 $/month income, 
the savings per month tend to reach less than 142 $/ month. Also, it was found that as the subjects have greater 
savings, they tend to have greater amount of savings.  
As for the types of savings, it was revealed that those who earn less than 714 $/ month tend to have low risk 
investment such as purchase of gold and real estate and cash deposit in commercial banks. Whereas for those 
learning more than 1,285 $/month, the high risks of saving. The same is for those with lower expenses who tend to 
have higher amount of savings than other groups in the same category.  
4. Recommendations
For policy; 
Because saving among governmental officers is important yet it remains a topic in which many lack proper 
understanding of the various types of saving, despite the fact that most want good return profits for future expenses. 
Therefore, executives at governmental agencies should encourage greater and more in-depth knowledge about 
savings before safe and comfortable retirement among all governmental officers, be they junior or senior.   
For research; 
Suggestion is to study saving types and behaviors among governmental officers working for 10 or more as 
there is a need for greater in knowledge in saving.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the problem of mechanical vibrations induced in the cutting process of stone and 
marble in stone cutting machines. The study shows that the main source for these vibrations is the lateral 
motion of the saw blade causing friction between the side body of the blade and the stone. This periodic 
force induced in the cutting area is reduced passively by using elastomeric pad that isolates the base of the 
machine from the head and the table. Adding less than 3% of passive damping ratio to the isolator could 
significantly reduce the level of vibration on the saw blade and on the table. To reduce the propagation of 
these vibrations through the base into the floor, another elastomeric pad is mounted under the machine. 
This pad reduces the immigration of oscillations through the floor to the other places in the factory.

Abstract 
In this article, we propose a novel formulation of Multi Item Capacitated lot sizing problem considering set up, 
Inventory and shortage cost. This Formulation is motivated from the work by Vimal (2012) and Sharma (2018).  We 
extend the results developed by Sharma (2018) to multi item lot sizing problem. The new formulation has less 
number of variables as shortage variables are removed and hence offers computational advantage.

1. Introduction
The standard formulation of the CLSP, which is available in the literature, is extended to include the variables and 
the situations which we propose to study, and model. Capacitated single item lot sizing problem (CLSP) with setup, 
production, and inventory is a well-studied problem (see Miller et al. (2000) for a detailed literature review. They 
give several valid inequalities of CLSP which resulted in a reformulation that can be solved much more easily 
(compared to effort required to solve the 0-1 mixed integer programming formulation of CLSP).The assumed model 
is a single level, multi-item, multi-period case of a capacitated lot size problem, with backorders and setup time 
considerations included. These considerations have received little attention in the literature as noted by (Karimi et. al 
2003). The formulations shown below is an extension of the classical model given in our recent work (Verma and 
Sharma, 2009). 
2. Problem Formulation
Indices Used 
t:  Set of Time period from 1..T 
i:  Product type  
Constants: 
CPit :     Unit cost of producing item ‘i’ in period ‘t’. 
CSit  :     Unit cost of setup, for item ‘i’ in period ‘t’. 
CINVit:  Unit cost of holding inventory of item ‘i’ for 1 period. 
CBOit:   Unit cost of backordering item ‘i’, which was demanded during the period ‘t’. 
CAPit:   Capacity available to produce item ‘i’ during the period ‘t’. 
CAPTt : Capacity available in time units, in a period ‘t’.

Equation (1) and equation (15) gives the objective function of the problem, which intends to minimize the 
production cost, setup cost, inventory cost and the backlogging cost, summed over all items and time periods. (2) is 
the inventory balance constraint which is for each item and for each period considering backorder quantity carried 
over next period. (3) is the time capacity limit constraint, which ensures that the total time utilized in doing a 
production of all items added to the time used to do the setup is always less than or equal the maximum time 
available in any period. (4) is quite similar to (3), it ensures that the demand of particular item in a period can be 
fully satisfied by the available processing time. (5) is the physical capacity constraint of all the plants and restricts 
the production from a facility with its stated capacity. (6) and (7) are different from (3) and (4) in a sense that while  
(3) and (4) restricts the production quantity of all items with available processing time in a particular period, (6) and 
(7) restricts the production of all items with total processing time over all the periods. (8) ensures that demand is 
satisfied at least by production in all the periods. (9) – (12) sets the initial and final conditions by substituting 
inventory and backordered quantity to be 0. (13) and (14) are integer (0,1) and non-negativity constraints for the 
variables. Problem A2 has similar constraints with similar implications with the elimination of backordered 
quantities. It is to be noted that left hand side of equation (16) is the value of XBOit1.  
 
3. Conclusion 
 
We have proposed a novel model for multi item lot sizing problem. This modelhas less number of variables and 
extra constraints which provides us with computational advantage. Therefore it enables us to develop 
computationally attractive methods for solving CSLP_BS which is known to be a NP complete problem (Maes et al. 
1991)

Abstract 
Lean enterprise and simulation techniques have been applied in many service sectors, however the 
application of lean enterprise and simulation techniques in government department service centers leaves 
a lot to be desired. This paper intends to demonstrate how process chart (used as a lean tool) and system 
simulation model were used to identify and measure the wastes and service disruptions (bottlenecks) 
present within the service center as well as suggest possible strategies capable of eliminating them. Action 
research was conducted in a service center, as a result, data was collected and analyzed. The result of the 
process chart analysis of the service center operations revealed that customer excessive movements and 
high customer queue time are the wastes present within the process. The simulation results of the service 
center revealed that the Payment and FLO stations are the bottlenecked stations. Merging of the 
Information Line Center and Meeter Greeter work stations as well as Payment and FLO work stations, 
were foreseen as suitable strategies capable of eliminating the wastes and bottlenecks in the service 
center. Furthermore, increase in staff capacity of these amalgamated work stations were anticipated as 
another strategy capable of catapulting customer service delivery rate in this service center.

1. Introduction
Lean serves as a potential technique that can be used  to improve service efficiency in the public sectors. The 
pressure of its usage in public sector is increasing daily as a result of clamour for optimal service delivery by 
political oppositions. This forces government agencies in public sectors to look at ways to improve service delivery 
in order to be re-elected  during the local elections. Politicians and legislators aims at improving the people’s 
(community) satisfaction when receiving services from public sector and at the same time they are challenged to be 
innovative. In order to make this possible, public sectors are espected to standadize processess, provide services 
online and to streamline as many process as possible.  
Lean enterprise can assist the public sectors to realise this requirement if applied effectively. Studies by[1]and [2] 
indicate that lean can be applied in service sector whether it is in public space or cooperate space. Tools like 5S and 
7 wastes can be used to achieve basic stability and line balancing can be used to streamline processes and reduce 
cycle time and queueing time.

To exploit and alleviate these bottlenecks as well as alleviate the different wastes identified in this system, the 
merging of the Information Line Center and Meeter Greeter work stations into a single work station (which service 
the customer for one minute) were suggested by the authors as a possible strategy to reduce the over-all queue time 
of the customer and eliminate underutilization of the Meeter Greeter work station. Furthermore, the merging of the 
Payment and FLO work stations into a single work station (which service the customer for 35 minutes) serve as a 
potential strategy that could improve the overall throughput of this system from 8 serviced customers per hour to 
about 12 serviced customers per hour. In addition to this, the addition of more workers to this merged work station 
could drive the serviced customers per hour to the optimum level (which is the exact number of customers that 
arrived to be served). 5S was also implemented in the South African Service Center ABC to sort out the needed files 
from irrelevant files, neatly arrange this work environment and establish schedules and methods of cleaning and 
sorting files in this work environment. Furthermore, the development of sustainable customer service process 
monitoring and measurement system as well as an effective customer complaint resolution system were also 
foreseen as other strategies that could be used to expedite customer service delivery and satisfaction in this service 
center. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
In this study, we investigated how Lean techniques could be applied to improve customer service delivery in a South 
African Service Center ABC. During the course of the study, excessive movements of customers from one work 
station to another work station (i.e. excessive transport), high waiting time, and underutilization of Meeter Greeter 
and Photo Booth work stations were the current wastes and bottlenecks present in South African Service Center 
ABC. In addition to this, the bottlenecked work stations in South African Service Center ABC are the Payment and 
FLO service stations.  Based on these results, the merging of the Information Line Center and the Meeter Greeter 
stations as well as the merging of the Payment and FLO stations; with an increase number of servicing staffs were 
proposed by the authors as suitable strategies capable of optimizing customer service delivery in South African 
Service Center ABC. Furthermore, 5S was also implemented in Service Center ABC in order to ensure the use of 
good housekeeping practices in this system.

Abstract 
Events during last two decades have shown that railways have become the primary interest of terrorist 
activities.  But, planning for protection against these threats on railways is challenging because of their 
geographical extensiveness, open and easily accessible infrastructures. Hence, identification and 
protection of only the critical components of railway infrastructures are very essential. In this paper, we 
present an optimization model to allocate the protective resources among the components of the railway 
systems optimally to minimize the impact of worst-case disruptions. The main focus is to enhance the 
applicability of the model by capturing additional realism and complexities of railway systems. We 
formulate the problem as a tri-level mixed-integer program. Then, we simplify it a bi-level problem and 
solve it by super valid inequalities based decomposition algorithm. Computational results of a case study 
on South East Coast Indian railways are analyzed for efficient protection decisions.

Abstract 
Abstract— IT project management is a combination of traditional project management concepts with a 
working cycle of information technology systems. The success of an IT project requires strong 
cooperation and communication between members of the project team. Variables that can affect 
teamwork quality (TWQ) should be applied to obtain effective teamwork. The variables are 
communication, coordination, equal contribution of members, mutual support, effort, and team cohesion. 
Teamwork quality dimensions will be used as a reference for making questionnaires that will be 
distributed to respondents. In this study, the questionnaires were distributed to two software development 
companies. The questionnaires are processed by applying Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. 
The finding is mutual support has the biggest Eigen factor that influence Teamwork quality. Mutual 
support means an ability and willingness of team members to assist each other in carrying out their duties. 
Having the same goals and good team bonding and relationship.

1. Introduction
Project is a complex process that always produce something new and not repetitive. Project is limited by the time, 
budget, resources which also known as triple constraints, and designed to satisfy customer specification/needs 
(Larson & Gray, 2016). The successful project always represented by the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
resource used in the project. However, many project especially on IT project overwhelmed by the failure. Most of 
the IT project are not capable enough to meet the deadline because of doing massive rework (Marr, 2016). Survey 
from Innotas said that more than half of IT project struggle of succeeding the project (Florentine, 2016). All this 
failure will lead to loss profit and customer loyalty.  Many studies investigate the reason to overcome this situation. 
Marr stated that poor management is supporting 50% of the failure and only 3% is technical problem. from Innotas 
said that most IT project has a problem to resource allocation and aligning to the business objective (Florentine,

a) 
Scope meeting, every activity/task that should be done in one sprint is already known by the member then 
proceed to the scope meeting held at the beginning of the sprint. This meeting aims to know the scope of 
work in the project. Owner of the project explain to Project Manager about the specification / 
requirements of the work or high-level information about the project such as product scope, project scope, 
milestone, duration, risk, stakeholders, budget and many more.  
b) 
Stand up meeting/daily scrum is held every day and aim to report daily progress of the project. Each 
developer must report to the Project Manager what they have done and what is upcoming task to 
accomplish the project. If something problem happened, then session for solving the problem is directly 
done in this meeting. This meeting used whiteboard and “post-it” to aid reporting information of the 
project. All the members include the PM prefer stand-up meeting rather than sit-down meeting. 
c) 
Retrospective is held at the end of the sprint and aims to evaluate the implementation of the sprint.  This 
stage is very useful for acknowledge any changes happened in the project. Every changes are being 
investigated what are the impact of the changes toward triple constraints.  
 
3. Leadership 
Project manager plays important role in the TWQ. Every cycle in the project can’t be separated to his/her roles. 
Many studies reveal style of the leadership of PM support the critical success factor. According to company X and Y 
the leadership style now shifts to supporting leadership. PM is more flexible when interacts to the team and other 
stakeholder. PM can adapt easily the style of his/her communication style. 
 
The project manager / product owner must have the ability to motivate team members. According to Butkus & 
Green (1999), ""motivate"", means to move, encourage or influence to fulfil the needs. Many theories about 
encouraging motivation to create higher productivity. At the end, PM who can identify earlier and know the 
character of their team assign them to the right role will give best result and productivity of the project. PM who can 
give empathy to their team while communicating can distinguish the average PM and the best PM. Schwalbe (2013) 
report that PM has responsibility to solve every problem and engage themselves to conflict although conflict in 
inevitable to the project. Many conflict rise when using Agile then PM plays vital role to solve the conflict. 
Company Y suggest that PM can use informal communication to the team. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Company X and Y is a software developer who use Agile as a method. Several studies confirm that team may arise 
when adopting Agile. Many researchers suggest framework, critical success factor to create better TWQ in project 
especially in software development project. However, study who use deep interview to the object and examine the 
maturity TWQ level is interesting to investigate further and possible to fill the research gap. From the maturity test, 
both the companies belong to norming and performing stages which indicates good teamwork in their project. 
 
Best practice from company Y to strengthen the TWQ such as doing task faster in executing stage but never neglect 
great planning stage in project lifecycle. Company Y has a culture that everybody in the team has their voice which 
beneficial to the project. Every team’s voice is being listened whenever is relevant to the project, informal meeting 
always performs to build team bonding and sometime is used to solve the problem in the office.  This informal 
approach works to create closer atmosphere among project team. 
 
Company Y also suggest that target team should identify acceptance project criteria, target milestone, ground rule at 
the very beginning work. It is also better to create situation that boost confidence level of the team. Room for 
research open for examine the effect of each dimension toward the project success. More sample would be better as 
the representative data of Indonesian software developers. Based on the literature study, questionnaire analysis, and 
interviews form both companies, creating collaborative teamwork will make the team members enjoy their 
responsibility in the project.

Abstract 
The paper provides a Delphi study to verify the framework to implement sustainability initiatives in the 
business processes. The Delphi technique seeks to obtain consensus on the opinions of experts, termed 
panel members, through a series of questionnaires. As part of the process, the responses from each round 
are fed back in summarized form to the participants who are then given an opportunity to respond again to 
the emerging data. The study successfully obtained a consensus in the phases and steps of the conceptual 
framework and provided feedback from the specialists. According to them, leadership, people and cost were 
identified as the main challenges related to the sustainability adoption by the organisations and key 
performance indicators (KPIs), Lifecycle assessment (LCA) and triple bottom line (TBL) were identified 
as the main methods to assess al the sustainability dimensions in terms of business processes.

1. Introduction
Previous studies have developed a framework to implement sustainability initiatives (Gallotta et al 2016 and Gallotta 
et al 2017). The framework aims to support the business transformation by applying Business Process Management 
(BPM) techniques to the implementation of sustainability initiatives. The framework thus considers the 
implementation of sustainability as a multi-departmental and multi-functional activity with an end-to-end process view 
and contains four (4) phases: Analyse, Design, Implement and Monitor & Control (Gallotta et al 2016). Figure 1 
represents the framework.

Abstract 
Supply chain management interested in the selection of suppliers against multiple criteria rather than the 
single criterion as a cost only. These criteria may be quantitative, qualitative or both. To choose the best 
supplier, the criteria are being measured or weighted for ranking. The supplier selection problem is 
considered as a multi-decision problem and it can be solved by the Analytical Hierarchical Process. It 
allows the decision maker to structure such complex problems in the form of a hierarchy, or a set of 
integrated levels. In this paper, a mathematical model is combined with an analytical hierarchical process 
in two phases, the first phase starts by the weighted mathematical model from an exciting example, and 
the second phase makes the check and refines the result from the first phase by checking the consistency. 
And finally, a new ranking of the suppliers are obtained.

1. Introduction
As the role of purchasing in supply management is important, the purchasing process consolidates the efficiency of 
the supply chain and it is an essential issue to select the best suppliers. There are many factors that affect the 
selection process as a firm’s ability to choose the right supplier. There is a need to understanding of the supplier 
selection criteria. Firms consider some of the factors; such as a commitment and trust, quality, adequate finance, 
reliable delivery times, adequate logistic technological capabilities (Cox, 1999). However, the other criteria are ISO 
certification, credibility, reliability, good references and product development. So the focus isn’t only on the 
quantitative factors but also to include the qualitative criteria (Harps, 2000). (Vera and Pullman, 1998) coincided 
that the supplier selection is a complex decision-making problem with the following factors (a) multiple criteria, (b) 
Conflicting among criteria, the (c) involvement of many alternatives (d) internal and external constraints imposed on 
the buying process.  
2. Literature Review
During recent years supply chain management and supplier selection process have received considerable attention in 
the literature. The objective of supplier selection is to choose suppliers with the respect to a firm’s needs and an 
acceptable cost. Comparison of suppliers to select the best one is by using a common set of measures and criteria. 
Supplier selection is a multi-criteria problem and there are not a lot of efficient techniques or algorithms that address 
this problem. There are two major groups of methods in the literature; mathematical programming models cost-
based models and categorical models. Since supplier selection problems always have many objectives such as 
maximization of quality or minimization of cost, the mathematical programming can be used to model the problem. 
(Weber and Current, 1993) proposed a multi-objective approach to supplier selection which minimizes the price, 
maximize the quality and on-time delivery using systems’ constraints and policy constraints in a mixed integer 
model.

So the best suppliers are supplier10, supplier15, supplier17, supplier5, supplier1, supplier12, supplier 11. 
 
 
Conclusion 
In this paper, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are considered and an approach is introduced, composed of 
two phases, phase 1 is a weighted mathematical model at which the criteria are ranked in descending order and with 
these weights, the final score for each supplier is obtained and from it the order of best suppliers, then the advantage 
of AHP in phase 2, a strategic approach to evaluate alternatives. AHP is a very useful for managerial decision 
making because it is flexible enough to accommodate a large set of evaluation criteria. The selection of suppliers is 
improved by composing the  two phases that give the final ranking of suppliers as supplier 10 is the best one, and the 
rest of suppliers are supplier 15, supplier 17,supplier 5,supplier 1,supplier 12, and finally, the worst one is supplier 
11.

Abstract 
Reverse Supply Chain is described as an initiative that plays an important role in the global supply chain 
for those who seek environmentally responsible solutions for their end-of-life products. The relative 
economic and environmental benefits of reverse supply chain are influenced by costs and emissions 
during collection, transportation, recovery facilities, disassembly, recycling, remanufacturing, and 
disposal of unrecoverable components. The design of reverse supply chain network takes into account 
social, economic and environmental objectives. This research addresses the design of reverse supply 
chain that is also sensitive to the carbon policies under the three common regulatory policies, strict carbon 
caps, carbon tax, and carbon cap-and-trade. CO2 emissions and total profit are integrated using a multi-
criteria decision making model. In this research, a mixed integer linear programming model of reverse 
supply chain with full valuation of emissions is considered to determine the optimal flow of parts among 
multiple remanufacturing centers that will maximize the total profit with less CO2 emissions, based on 
actual sites in the Boston area. Numerical example illustrates different policies and their impact on the 
costs and the effectiveness of emission reduction.

1. Introduction and Related Work
The number of products discarded by consumers has been gradually growing, which has led to legislations in 
various countries that hold the original equipment manufacturers (OEM) responsible for the end-of-life processing 
of products. In addition, the field of supply chain has also been influenced by consumer awareness of environmental 
issues (Vadde, Kamarthi, & Gupta, 2006) & (Ilgin & Gupta, 2010).

increasing emissions, and rising energy prices have motivated both corporations and academics to develop strategies 
based on corporate social responsibilities and sustainable supply chains (Carter, 2008), (Nagurney, Zugang, & 
Trisha, 2007), & (Paul, Kalyan, & Luk, 2005). While the concept of integrating sustainability into supply chain is 
relatively new, its implementation is however increasing continuously (Seuring, Joseph, Martin, & Purba, 2008). 
Nowadays, although the products are still moving in the direction of the end customer the reverse flow of 
products is also taking place. This movement is obviously pronounced in most of the industrial sectors, especially in 
automobiles, beverages, electronic products, and pharmaceuticals. The automobile industry, for example, has 
included the changes in the supply chain to smooth the end-of-life vehicles recovery and the US vehicle recycling 
infrastructure (Boon, Isaacs, & Gupta, 2000) & (Ferguson & Browne, 2001). 
Reverse Supply Chain (RSC) is an initiative that plays an important role in the global supply chain for 
those who seek environmentally responsible solutions for their end-of-life (EOL) products. The relative economic 
and environmental benefits of RSC are influenced by costs and emissions during collection, transportation, recovery

The optimal remanufacturing cost is $218 per unit, which shows that this model is $70 per unit less than the current 
refurbished market price. The emission quantity is 0.018 tCO2e per unit. Comparing this result to the deflated 
refurbished market price using a consumer price index expressed in 2002 dollars and analyzing that result using the 
economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) model a technique for estimating the materials and energy 
resources required for environmental emissions resulting from economic activities (Carnegie Mellon University 
Green Design Institute, 2016). The EIO-LCA sector chosen was the U.S. 2002 Benchmark for air conditioning, 
refrigeration, and warm air heating equipment manufacturing.  This shows that the emission quantities are 0.109 
tCO2e per unit less than refurbished manufacturing. The valuation of emissions for the optimal result was done by 
using the values according to ranges proposed at the 21st Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, therefore 
existing approaches used different carbon policies and applications. Using the carbon price of $40/ton CO2 
equivalent (tCO2e), our model gives a profit margin of 19.1%. 
6. Conclusion
This paper has presented a reverse supply chain optimization model designed to take into account the influence of 
both strategic and operational activities of the supply chain on the environment. A case study based on actual sites 
was considered to illustrate performance of the model and to determine how the proposed policies would influence 
profit margins on remanufactured goods. The results indicated that the carbon price ranges that were used in this 
study will control the amount of GHG emissions generated in reverse supply chain operations. The results also 
indicated that the carbon tax policy forces a strict constraint on the amount of carbon emissions generated in supply 
chain operations. It shows that the RSC is sensitive to the carbon price. The work herein advances the theoretical 
modeling of optimal RSC systems while presenting an empirical case study of remanufactured appliances, an 
understudied facet of current industrial literature.

Abstract  
The management of the costly and limited healthcare resources such as operating rooms, doctors, nurses, 
and beds is challenged by the uncertainty of the arrival patients and the service rate for each type of them 
depending on the available resources. Therefore, healthcare units encounter unbalanced utilization of such 
resources and unnecessary long patient’s waiting time before admission and operating rooms. A system 
dynamics model simulating a typical medium-sized hospital, where different types of patients are severed 
using the same limited resources, is developed to implement the theory of constraints philosophy. The 
model is used to identify the system bottleneck resource, then to exploit and to subordinate the system 
around this resource. The number of served patients (throughput) is increased by 6% without any resource 
elevation. Furthermore, the model is used to determine the proper capacity needed to elevate the bottleneck 
resource.

Abstract 
Energy efficiency projects are often executed by specialized entities, namely energy service companies 
(ESCOs). A typical ESCO's core business is conducted using performance-based contracts, whereby 
payment terms depend on the energy savings achieved. Despite their success in public, commercial, and 
industrial sectors, ESCOs in the residential sector are involved in fewer projects and face several 
challenges. First, an energy efficiency project often leads to changed consumption behavior; hence it is 
more difficult to evaluate the energy savings that are due to the project itself. The second challenge is 
that residential clients are more risk averse and, thus, less willing to contract for projects whose 
outcomes are uncertain. Third, a lack of monitoring protocols leads to ESCO's moral hazard problems. 
This paper studies ESCO contract design issues, focusing primarily on the residential market for energy 
efficiency. As opposed to other sectors, coordinating contracts do not exist. We show, however, that 
simple piecewise linear contracts work reasonably well. To improve their profitability, ESCOs can 
reduce uncertainty about the technology employed and/or develop ways of verifying post-project energy 
efficiency. Since policy makers are understandably keen to promote energy efficiency, we show also 
how regulations and monetary incentives can reduce inefficiencies in ESCOs' relationships and thereby 
maximize environmental benefits.

Abstract 
Lean Manufacturing and Lean Thinking are theoretical-practical approaches that have been consolidating 
over the last 25 years extending throughout the world with different emphases and ways of applying their 
most common tools. This article presents the first findings and conclusions about an investigation that 
seeks the theoretical analysis and re-construction of conceptual nuclei that revolve around these 
approaches within the framework of the tendencies of change associated with what has been called the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), ie the revolution of cyber-physical systems of production and 
delivery, high interconnectivity and artificial cognition, biotechnologies and additive manufacturing, as 
well as integrated ecosystems. The research follows the Grounded Theory method with hermeneutical 
analysis of qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews and theoretical saturation in different 
lean manufacturing contexts in transnational industries located in Costa Rica, Central America. We 
conclude that lean thinking must evolve according to the technological tendencies of Industry 4.0, 
especially in the conceptualization of value, value stream and MUDA (waste); as well as the need to more 
aggressively integrate human-robot collaborative techniques in their implementation. As a future line of 
research is the theoretical modeling of integration ""lean-cyber-physical systems"" and its implications in 
service sectors.

Abstract 
The main purpose of manufacturing industry is to produce goods economically in order to gain profit and 
be able to deliver products on time. Ineffective and efficient production processes lead to non-current 
production. Lean production systems help companies to be competitive, especially in terms of reducing 
waste (waste) that occurs in their operations. This study aims to reduce production waste in one automotive 
company by using Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM), Waste Assessment Questionnaire (WAQ) and Value 
Stream Mapping (VSM). Activities in the automotive Industry is to design, develop, manufacture, market 
and sell motor vehicles in the world. The three methods are intended to identify and analyze the waste 
(waste) that occurred and make improvements to eliminate waste. From the research results obtained type 
of waste ""form"" is waiting and motion. While the type of waste ""to"" the inventory. The three types of waste 
is the greatest procession to occur in the process of assembly trimming on the production line of Daihatsu 
SIGRA 1.5 L 3NR-Ve, DOHC Dual VVT-i at PT. Astra Daihastu Motor. Then performed the improvement 
implementation by using WRM and VSM method obtained the results of waste efficiency that occurs in the 
type of waste from the motion from 17.65% to 15.75%, waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and lead time down 
from 14.202 minutes to 12.322 minutes in one assembly process trimming. Some suggestions for 
improvements made are the implementation of the FIFO system (First in First Out), Improving changes in 
movement and movement of workers, and line balancing on the assembly line trimming process lines of 
automobile production processes.

process in AT-07 is also done by one worker. Especially for waiting in the area of AT-02 and AT-06 where waiting 
to be processed on AT-03 and AT-07 authors do their own analysis to provide input to the production. The analysis is 
to measure the cycle time between the three work stations (AT-02, AT-03, AT-04) and (AT-06, AT-07, AT-08) to 
determine the actual cycle time of the three operations. From the measurement found that the average CT for AT-02: 
is equal to 0.571 minutes, AT-03: 2,506 minutes and AT-04: 1.125 minutes. The work area of AT-03 and AT-04 is 
done by the same operator so that it works sequence (sequential) from AT-03 process after that just doing assembly 
on AT-04.  
When measuring the time of this cycle the material resulted from the work by the AT-02 process operator must 
wait for AT-03 to complete assembly. Because in fact the standard time for this process is only 2.05 minutes (standard 
time specified by PT Astra Daihatsu Motor). While the CT on AT-06 is 1013 minutes, AT-07: 2.134 minutes, and 
AT-08: 0.673 minutes. AT-07 and AT-08 are performed by one operator so that it is sequenced sequentially. This 
results in waste from one point causing another waste at another point. The AT-07 is still more than the standard time 
set by the company. The conclusion is the work of the operators in all three WIPs at point (AT-06, AT-03, AT-04) 
and (AT-06, AT-07, AT- 08) is not balanced. For that to balance the work of the operator so there is no waiting time 
the authors suggest to combine these three machines with the concept of first in first out or FIFO and Line Balancing 
for the division of workload on each operator so that the system works will be balanced in one line prduksi assembly 
electronic components This car. From the implementation results applied to PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor Training 
Center, the result of the repair of the original waste waiting 15.88% decreased to 13.12%. From the results of these 
improvements on waste reduction and waiting waste impact on the total lead time of this car trimming assembly 
process. Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the 
car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate 
the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 becomes 
the time for 11 assembly process that is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 
4. Conclusions
Based on the results of research with the method of Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM) and Value Stream 
Mapping (VSM) can be drawn the following conclusions: 
1. Waste identification result using WRM (Waste Realtionship Matrix) and VSM (Vakue Stream Mapping) method
on assembly trimming process resulted 3 biggest waste that happened that is Inventory, Motion, and Waiting.
2. Waste type ""from"" that is Motion and Waiting has the largest percentage of 17.65% and 15.88% which means that
waste Motion and Waiting if it happens then have a large enough effect to cause other waste that will increase the
production lead time.
3. Waste type ""to"" the Inventory has the largest percentage of 18.24% this indicates that waste inventory is the waste
that most affected other waste.
4. From the improvements made to eliminate waste motion & waiting is by improving the FIFO system (First in First
Out), Improving changes in the movement of workers, and Line Balancing in the assembly trimming process
produces some efficiency such as:
Reduced Motion waste from 17.65% to 15.75%, and
Waste Waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and
Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car
production process.
In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub 
process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 into the time for 11 assembly 
process is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 
5. Recommendations
For future research related to the current research, the authors provide some suggestions as follows: 
1. Preferably the object of research is not only limited to the area of assembly trimming course because this area is
only one of the whole 5 line car production process.
2. Conducted an overall analysis with regard to factors in other production lines because there is a possibility in the
process of production of the car there is another waste that occurs therein.
3. Created simulations with software with several production process scenarios to determine the impact or benefit of
any repair recommendations and for the purpose of saving the cost of checking the improvements made.

4. Cost analysis is required in terms of whether the improvements made have a significant cost impact so that it can 
be seen that the improvements made provide measurable benefits from the previous. So it can be seen whether 
worth it enough to be repaired or not.

Abstract 
We present a model and algorithm of Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Buffer Allocation Problem 
(BAP) for complex production lines. The BAP has been a critical part of the production line design and 
inventory policy construction. It determines the buffer size within the production line to achieve the 
highest production rate considering the uncertainty of the production line such as machine failures and 
repairs. The existing BAP models are designed to optimize buffers for highly simplified production lines. 
However, it is still a challenge to evaluate an optimization buffers for actual complex production lines 
with the existing approaches and algorithms. In this study, we present a model and algorithm to find the 
optimal buffer space for complex production lines using simulation based Reinforcement Learning (RL). 
Here, we build a complex production line model with a simulator and integrate the model with the RL 
based algorithm, seeking an optimal buffer allocation policy. The preliminary results show that the 
proposed model reliably fines an optimal buffer size for complex production lines.

Abstract 
Managing today’s world is about directing in times of speedy revolution. The need to develop 
effective leaders is getting increasingly crucial in all organizations. The target of this paper is to 
scrutinize if there is a liaison linking the transactional leadership style, employees’ satisfaction and the 
employees’ job performance. There appears to be an ever increasing number of studies supporting that 
satisfied employees play vital role in the employees’ performance and the company’s performance. 
Job satisfaction is one of the major individual mechanisms that directly affect the job performance. A 
good number of researchers have state that if the employee is more satisfied with his or her work and 
experience positive emotions through the work, there is big chance that they may do better job and 
choose to remain committed. Meanwhile, many researchers in the field of organizational psychology 
focused on the relationship joining job performance and satisfaction (Yahaya et al., 2012). It was find 
out that the employees’ performance depends on employees’ satisfaction; this shows that the higher 
the level of job satisfaction, the better is the performance of the worker (Insan et al., 2013). The 
author Jason A et al., (2015) said that unfortunately, workplace surveys suggest that satisfied 
employees are getting rarer. Our main aim was to study the effect of transactional leadership on 
employees’ performance and the mediating role of employees' satisfaction between transactional 
leadership style and employees’ performance. Quantitative research method has been utilized in this 
research. The questionnaire, 5 point Likert scale has been used to collect the data. Structural Equation 
Modelling (PLS-SEM) is used as a technique of analysis in this research. A total of 450 
questionnaires were delivered to the respondents from telecommunication sector in Malaysia, out of 
which 330 questionnaires were usable. The research reveals that employee's satisfaction mediated the 
transactional leadership style and the job performance. This work shows as well that there is strong

productivity in assembly line for reduced cycle time. Study to be conducted at PHN Industry Sdn. Bhd. 
Methodology for this study is using qualitative data such as observation method using stopwatch to 
calculate the process of cycle time have been using by manpower at work station. The result is cycle time 
reducing as much as 11.11% at each work station with new standard time 
Keywords : cycle time, assembly line, productivity, time study 
1. Introduction
Manufacturing industry is really focused on reducing cycle time. Cycle time is defined as the time it takes to 
do a process (Kazuhiro, 2004). Cycle time reduction is identifying and implementing more efficient ways to do 
things. Reducing cycle time requires eliminating or reducing non-value-added activity, which is defined as any 
activity that does not add value to the product. For examples of the non-value added activity in which cycle time can 
be reduced or eliminated include repair due to defects, machine set-up, inspection, test and schedule delays. 
Reducing cycle time will have a significant impact on a company's bottom line when implemented. Cycle time 
reduction is provides great benefit to a company. From the cycle time reduction the non-value added activity will be 
reduced or eliminated. Therefore, the situation of this production line and improvement of the cycle time using time 
study method is the main problem of this real case study research. An assembly line is a cycle of workstations at 
which task related to assembly of a product are performed (Becker and Scholl, 2006). It is because the company get 
a high demand of customer, cycle time reduction is important role to a high productivity towards customer 
satisfaction. Manpower in production line also play important role in order to make a production run as usual and to 
back up the production line that have robot.

Literature Review
Time is important in the manufacturing industry because it is used in the manufacturing process. 
It measured process derived from the start made to delivery to the customer. The time it takes to make a product will 
affect customers who have made a deal to the company. That will ensure the productivity produce by manpower will

Conclusions 
By making simple changes to the process, it can reduce the time taken for each work sequence to improve the 
process flow and speed it up the process flow. However, important of use time study method because the importance 
and uses of stop watch time study can be stated as under all this, determining schedules and planning work. 
Moreover, influential standard costs and as support in preparing budgets. Such information is of value in preparing 
offers and determining selling price. Other than that, determining machine effectiveness, the number of machines 
which one person can operate, and as an assistance in balancing assembly lines and work done on a conveyor. 
Furthermore, time standards to be used as a basis for labor cost control. Besides that, helps to know the labor 
productivity, labor efficiency, labor performance and overall time required to perform the task. Lastly its can helps 
to improve the process of operation. For the conclusion, cycle time is a key indicator of a process in manufacturing 
industry and equipment performance. Besides that, machining operations depends on consistent cycle times to 
schedule the production and allocated the workers.

Abstract 
A company produces hospital beds for global market with tight delivery schedules. On the production line 
is often constrained by the uncertainty of inventory and work in process (WIP) availability and has been 
used excessive resources which is losing company competitiveness. To achieve on time delivery (OTD) 
applied D Minus 1 production scenario with process sequences are welding, painting and assembly 
scheduled respectively on D-2, D-1 and D0 day. D minus 1 is activity to provide the WIP buffer 
downstream as a supply of materials for the upstream process which is carried out periodically with a 
one-day cycle so that the demand for product delivery can be completed. This scenario modelled as 
dynamic system which is set as cyclic process with period one day to shipping time. Use production 
dynamic factors can be simulated production control which is able to achieve OTD. Those factors are 
function of inventory adjustment time (IAT), Finish inventory adjustment time (FAT) and WIP 
adjustment time (WAT).Using those factors in the production line can be shown effect of the IAT, FAT, 
WAT to the level of accurate and precision of the process to the production target, which is can be used 
for achieve OTD succeed.

Abstract 
Discussions regarding social media have dominated research in recent years as well as the use 
of electronic marketing that utilizes social media. One of the preferred social media is 
Facebook. Facebook’s feature which has commonly used in online marketing is Facebook 
Ads. However, SMEs in Indonesia have not exerted it effectively. This study aims to 
determine the utilization of Facebook Ads by SMEs and its influenced factors. The model 
applied in this research is AMO (Ability, Motivation, and Opportunity) Development Model. 
Stages of model development from prior literatures achieved an adoption model with nine 
hypotheses. The next stages of this study is to conduct a survey using the method that is 
accordance with research object and research method. 
Keywords 
facebook ads, SMEs, AMO theory, adoption 
1. Introduction
Internet is a technology that has advanced rapidly and profitable both for companies and 
individuals. Internet has been used as a means for companies to be able to enhance competence and 
new business development (Mathews, et al. 2015). Prior research generally confirm the role of the 
internet, one of them is as means to promote the company products (Felix, et al. 2017; Hadining, et al. 
2016; Mathews, et al. 2015; Sulistyo and Siyamtinah 2016; Dahnil, et al. 2014). One of media in the 
internet marketing is the social media (Hadining, et al. 2016). Social media is one of the effective ways 
of marketing when compared to the traditional ways (Hadining, et al. 2016). 
Facebook is one of the social media that has enough users. According to Ramo et.al (2014), 
Facebook is most widely used by the user at the age of 18-29 years, with the access every day as much 
as 70%. Moreover, Facebook is one of the right means in online buying and selling activities or online 
marketing (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 2017). Facebook through Facebook Ads 
feature is the low-cost online marketing instrument that could be utilized by SMEs (Hadining, et.al. 
2016). It can be concluded that Facebook through Facebook Ads is the right and low-cost instrument 
for online marketing (Hadining, et.al. 2016). 
Although the benefits of Facebook Ads have been widely proven through prior research, not 
many SMEs are using Facebook Ads (Govindaraju, et al. 2013; Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-
Santos 2017). This study aims to build a model that can be used to determine the influenced factor of 
Facebook Ads by SMEs.

2. Model Development
Govindaraju et.al (2013) used Ability, Motivation, and Opportunity (AMO) theory to build an 
EMR adoption model by physicians. AMO is also used to identify factors that affect the purchase of 
airline tickets online (Bigné, et al. 2010). AMO model identifies information that obtained by 
individuals based on Ability, Motivation, and Opportunity (Bigné, et al. 2010). MacInnis and Jaworski 
(1989) revealed that Motivation is a driving force, driving someone to utilize an information system 
(Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Ability is anything that can be used to expedite someone in the adoption 
process and Opportunity is a conditional factor that would be able to encourage the adoption process 
(Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Motivation, Opportunity and Ability in this study that adapted to the 
purpose of research is to determine the factors that play a role in the Facebook Ads adoption by SMEs.  
Motivation, Opportunity and Ability in AMO theory can influence one's behavior 
(Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Therefore, Behavior that becomes essential to be considered, to be achieved 
in the behavioral study is the Facebook Ads adoption by SMEs. Behavior can be achieved through 
intention that controlled by Motivation (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Intention is one's attempt to shape 
the expected behavior (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Intention is added to the intermediary between the 
motivation and adoption behavior of Facebook Ads. This prompted the following conclusions: 
H1: SMEs intention to use Facebook Ads positively influences their Facebook Ads Adoption. 
AMO theory has three groups of variables. The first variable is Motivation. Motivation Factor 
focused on prior research on adopted Ads (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 2017). 
Liebana-Cabanilas (2017) revealed that factor social image influence on adoption of Facebook-
commerce. Social image is a perception of the utilization of an innovation that can enhance position in 
social system (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 2017). Therefore, in this study, social 
image has included in the category of variable motivation group. Liébana-Cabanillas (2017) and 
Govindaraju (2013) revealed that perceived usefulness is included in the Motivation category and may 
influence intention in adoption. Perceived usefulness is a person's perception that using an innovation 
could elevate work performance within an organization (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 
2017). According to those exposures, it can be concluded that: 
H2: Social image has a positive effect on SMEs intention to use Facebook ads 
H3: perceived usefulness has a positive effect on SMEs intention to use Facebook Ads. 
SMEs intention to use Facebook ads must be supported by the ability and opportunity to be 
able to establish behavior in the form of Facebook Ads adoption (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). 
Govindaraju (2013) revealed that variable ability group consists of infrastructure, past experience, and 
self-efficacy. Infrastructure could be categorized as the condition of aptitude used to encourage the 
utilization of Facebook Ads by SMEs (Ouirdi, et al. 2016). Infrastructure that associated with the 
Facebook Ads adoption is such as hardware and software. Hardware can be a computer, pc, mobile 
phone, and others, whilst the software can be a web explorer and its kind. Past experience is a variable 
that states whether someone has experience or at least ever used an information technology in the past 
(Govindaraju, et al. 2013). In this study past experiences focused on prior experience or knowledge 
about the utilization of information technology related to Facebook Ads by SMEs. Self-efficacy is the 
ability of someone to achieve certain activities in this case is activity related to Facebook Ads. The 
higher the self-efficacy, the higher the expectation to be able to obtain a result is (Bright, et al. 2015). 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the higher the self-efficacy of SMEs while using Facebook Ads in 
online marketing, the more intention to adopt Facebook Ads. This prompted the following conclusion: 
H4: Infrastructure positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook ads on 
Facebook ads adoption. 
H5: SMEs past experiences positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook 
ads on Facebook ads adoption. 
H6: SMEs self-efficacy positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook ads 
on Facebook ads adoption. 
The next variable group in AMO theory is Opportunity. Govindaraju (2013) revealed that the 
opportunity variable group comprises opportunity for Facebook Ads trial, and opportunity to adjust 
Facebook ads. Opportunity for Facebook ads trial is an opportunity for SMEs to be able to use 
305","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bandung, Indonesia, March 6-8, 2018 
© IEOM Society International
Facebook Ads that could be known and perceived benefits from the use of such features (Govindaraju, 
et al. 2013). Access to information is an opportunity that SMEs could apply to draw information related 
to Facebook Ads feature (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Facebook Ads system adaptability is the ability of 
Facebook Ads to be able to adjust to the needs of each SME (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). This prompted 
the following conclusion: 
 
H7: Opportunity for Facebook ads trial positively moderates the influence of intention to use 
Facebook ads on Facebook ads adoption. 
H8: Access to information positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook ads 
on Facebook ads adoption. 
H9: Facebook ads system adaptability positively moderates the influence of intention to use 
Facebook ads on Facebook ads adoption. 
 
There are nine hypotheses in the study contend in Figure 1.

3. Research Methodology 
 
This paper explained about the development of Facebook Ads adoption model by SMEs. The 
next stage is to test the hypotheses that have been built. Prior to data collection, the model was 
developed based on former research literature to define research variables. There are nine hypotheses 
consisting of several research variables used in the model.  Data collection would be done by 
distributing research questionnaires using research variables in the model. Questionnaire to SMEs will 
be done after the generation of questions that represent all variables of the adoption model. The 
obtained data would be processed quantitatively using Partial Least Square along Structural Equation 
Modeling method. Sampling of research using purposive sampling method would adjust the research 
objectives. This study aims to determine the influenced factors of the Facebook Ads adoption. The 
object of this study is SMEs so that the research questionnaire would be disseminated to SMEs.

Abstract 
We focus on a problem maximizing the total weight of just-in-time jobs under multi-slot conditions. In 
just-in-time scheduling, each job has to be completed exactly on its due date. Since just-in-time 
scheduling has applications to both manufacturing and computer systems, a number of research papers on 
such scheduling problems exist. Under multi-slot conditions, each job has one due date per time slot and 
has to be completed just-in-time on one of its due dates. We assume that each job has a certain weight per 
time slot, and the weight is non-increasing with increasing completion time for each job. This problem 
maximizing the total weight of just-in-time jobs under multi-slot conditions was recently proven to be 
NP-hard. Our research presents two heuristics for this problem. The first is a simple greedy algorithm, in 
which each job is scheduled in the order of largest to smallest on weight for each time slot. The second 
applies a well-known algorithm for a weighted interval scheduling problem to this problem. We 
implement the two heuristics, and compare their performances from computational experimentation.

Abstract 
A preliminary study involving school students aged 12-18 years attempted to test whether there is difference 
in attitudes towards road safety between Arab and non-Arab respondents. The sampled participants were 
categorized according to age group, ethnicity and type of school they attend. Responses on their perceived 
driving ability, basic road safety knowledge and their willingness to participate in a common road safety 
campaign were analyzed. The results show that Arab students of pre-driving age tend to perceive that they 
have the skills to drive and showed poorer attitude towards road safety than non-Arab students. Older 
students of Arab origin and in public schools are more likely not to participate in road safety campaigns as 
compared to the younger age group of non-Arab origin and in private schools. Attitude change interventions 
that is appealing to pre-drivers of Arab origin studying in public school could be more effective strategy to 
raise the road safety awareness in par with the rest of the residents. Carefully designed contents for driving 
simulators that convey interactive road safety lessons and Variable Message Signs (VMS) can be 
considered and maximize effectiveness of road safety campaigns.

1. Introduction
Fatalities from road crashes are tragic events that cause enormous emotional grief and economic loss to societies. 
Globally about 1.25 million people lose their lives due to road traffic crashes and another 20-50 million suffer from 
injuries related to the crashes. According to WHO, road traffic injuries are the leading causes of preventable death 
among young people, aged 15-29 years (WHO 2015). Qatar is a growing country driven by diverse population. It is 
natural for global trends in road traffic crashes to also be manifested in Qatar. It is estimated that, in Qatar, one in eight 
deaths from all causes is due to road traffic injury in 2013 (Qatarliving.com 2013). Socio-economic status, age and sex 
have been listed as main risk factors of road traffic injury. Road users from lower socio-economic backgrounds are 
more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes, a little less than half of all road crash deaths are between 15-44 years 
and ¾ of all road traffic deaths happen on men (Consunji et al. 2014). 
It comes to no surprise then that Qatar experiences high rate of road crash injuries and fatalities. In Qatar, the 
demographic factors are uniquely different from the rest of the world. Qatar is the richest country in the world with its 
citizens making up less than 15% of total number of residents. The majority of Qatar’s residents are male-dominated 
labourers of specific nationalities earning low income. In between these two population groups are those from different 
parts of the world, living with their families and earning attractive incomes. These population groups make up Qatar’s 
diverse multi-national society with distinct features. The influx of foreign nationals for work purposes and the 
prescriptive nature of the Qatari immigration law created the world’s highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/females. The 
15-44 age group make up 70% of the total population, whereas on average such age group make up only 49% of the
Western Asian countries (Consunji et al 2014).

The other half of the students are interested in participating in road safety campaigns only if rewarded or as volunteers. 
Volunteering for road safety campaigns tends to appeal to Arab students (37%) than others (28%).  
3. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
In general, Arab students in public schools of Qatar show higher perception of driving ability coupled with lower 
attitudes towards basic road safety elements. The product of such combination underestimates the risks involved in 
driving and could be the reason for the prevalence of under-age driving on the roads of Qatar.  
This paper can be considered a preliminary research on male students of pre-driving age and highlights the dire need 
for attitude change intervention. Road safety education program is commonly employed on pre-driving age students 
with the intention to inform the development of their attitudes and beliefs related to driving. However there is lack of 
evaluation of such programs making it difficult to assess their effectiveness. 
Tailoring road safety education program based on what appeals to the target audience would be beneficial. This research 
work found that it would be more effective to target Arab students in primarily public schools. Active participation, and 
use of personal experiences are more likely to be successful if included in road safety education program. Despite the 
lack of evidence that support use of ITS to deliver road safety message in pre-driving age, interactive and creative tools 
that is engaging may be worthwhile. One of the techniques to increase road safety awareness is the usage of driving 
simulators to convey interactive road safety lessons and Variable Message Signs (VMS), which are electronic boards 
placed along arterials and highways, to deliver awareness messages as well as traffic information. These messages 
should consider the characteristics of the targeted audience to maximize effectiveness and compliance.

Abstract 
Inventory management is one of the essential functions of a company to perform efficiently and 
effectively. Efficient inventory medicines management in pharmacies require close attention to assure availability 
of the right drugs in the right quantities, at reasonable prices, and at recognized standards of quality throughout the 
year without any stock-out periods in between. This paper develops a novel dynamic inventory model through 
integrating multiple approaches to optimize inventory while minimizing inventory cost and assuring 
medicines availability. Also, the developed model is able to measures the effectiveness of inventory 
systems of pharmacies. The case study reviews and analysis a current inventory management method of a 
local pharmacy in Jeddah, KSA. The findings compared currant applied method and developed model. 
The developed inventory model helps the pharmacy to reduce cost by 14.38% while satisfying 100% 
service level rate.

1. Introduction
Inventory management is very important to handle products or goods so as to meet the customers’ demand 
whenever required according to the season or as per requirements of people. There is limited research focuses on 
developing methods for evaluating inventory management systems. Alsaadi, Almaktoom, And Krishnan (2016) 
introduced a method to evaluate the reliability of each task of an inventory system, as well as overall reliability of an 
inventory management system. Almaktoom (2017) a novel, design optimizations model is being developed to most 
effectively allocate resources and schedule time, giving consideration to the uncertainty associated with inventory 
movement. Resurreccion and Santos (2012) developed multiobjective prioritization methodologies for inventory 
system evaluation. Inventory management in the pharmaceutical industry is crucial to meet the fluctuation in 
demands of not only medicine but medical products and services demanded by patients, hospitals, clinics, etc. The 
strategies to maintain these products and services are highly effective because of the competition and globalization 
in the health and medical industry. 
Shah (2004) in his article said, “The pharmaceutical industry can be defined as a complex of processes, 
operations and organisations involved in the discovery, development and manufacture of drugs and medications.” 
This industry is very complicated because of the functions and the methods involved in the manufacturing and 
handling medicines. Many medical companies have come up with a variety of products and services that are similar 
in functions, chemical formulas registered under different names and dosages. Every disease has different medicine 
to which the physician recommends to use when required. For this, the company has to have a set of medicines 
stacked up in the warehouse after manufacturing it in the excess. The inventory management in the pharmaceuticals 
help every stakeholder of the company due to the unpredictable demand fluctuations that can arise due to untreatable 
diseases, seasonal changes that leads to weakening of immune system or other causes. With this come many 
problems that are associated with managing the inventory system and ensuring if the products are available to meet 
the needs of the people. There are lots of constraints with the supply chain of the medical products due to the nature 
of these products and the related industry (Booth, 1999).  
This research will focus on the factors that help inventory system to be improved and also look into how 
optimizing inventory management helps in the availability of the products and services. This research will also

4. Conclusion 
Pharmaceutical industry is one such industry where the inventory needs to be managed effectively in order 
to meet the unpredictable demands of the people. Everything needs to be put in order and stock as the demand is not 
fixed and it keeps on fluctuating. A part from that, licensing is an issue which the pharmacies need to check every 
now and then from their stock. This research has helped the pharmacy to understand the importance of maintaining 
and optimizing the inventory system. Developed approached been applied to a local pharmacy to test its efficacy. 
Result showed that the pharmacy could save 78864.8 SAR and assure 100% service level rate by optimizing re-
order point. This research focused on limited number of drug. Thus authors recommend further study that cover a 
wide array of other medicines that could have been in the market.

Abstract 
Researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between overall positive course ratings of results 
in students evaluations of teaching (SET) at higher education and grades received. This study focuses on 
other educational factors that influence students’ decisions to evaluate teaching such as calling on 
students and administering pop up quizzes. Multivariate statistical analysis is used to group students into 
clusters based on the closeness of their decision to rate the instructor according to the selected factors. 
This research is conducted in a developed country and the results may differ if the same approach is used 
elsewhere.

Students Evaluation of Teaching, Multivariate statistical analysis 
1. INTRODUCTION
The concept of using student evaluation of teaching, SET to evaluate instructors at the higher education level is an 
important and controversial concept. Its effectiveness is an important issue for the faculty members and 
administrators.  Using SET is controversial as it plays an important role in faculty promotions, tenure and merit 
processes (Wallace and Wallace, 1998). Part of the engineering accreditation is the usage of this vital feedback from 
students and at what capacity it was used.  Researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between overall 
positive course ratings and grades received. (Bauer, 1996; Crumbly, 1995).  Haskell (1997) has found that faculty 
member’s overemphasis on the numerical results may be contributing to an erosion of quality of teaching and 
scholarship, to a lower level of respect for teachers, and to weakening of faculty positions.  Centra and Creech 
(1976) used a sample of 14,023 students have found a moderately strong, statistically significant relationship 
between student grade expectation and student evaluation of the instructor. They found that; students expecting an A 
grade, evaluate the instructor with a mean of 3.95 on 5 point scale. While students expecting a D grade, evaluate the 
instructor with a mean of 3.02.  York (2009) argued that if the instructor inflates his grades, he or she more likely to 
get more positive evaluations.  It is clear that researches used analytical analysis to come up with their conclusions, 
such as mean analysis, standard deviations analysis, analysis of variances, ANOVA or test of hypothesis. This 
research will use new approach to analyze the correlations between several factors influences student’s evaluation’s 
of   their instructor’s (Crumbley, et al, 2001). It will work by grouping students onto clusters according to the 
closeness level of their evaluations similarities of their instructor’s evaluations. Multivariate statistical analysis will 
be used to achieve that. Then rank the developed clusters based on the highest similarities of student’s perceptions of 
the considered factors to come up with the conclusion.

5. CONCLUSION
This research illustrate the need to accommodate students needs during class lecturing since they are shown to be  an 
important factors from students point of view when they evaluate courses at the end of the semester. Factors 
influence students decisions were formed into clusters based on their importance using multivariate statistical 
analysis.  Also, clusters of students were formed using the same concept based on their evaluations of the 
importance of the stated factors. The established students’ clusters can be studied more such as studying the gender 
composition of some clusters having extremely preferences toward certain factors.

Abstract 
This research discusses forecasting disputes that many companies face while setting a new strategic plan. 
Jeddah Paints Factory is one of the manufacturing companies in Saudi Arabia in which its top 
management decided to change and improve their strategic plan to be aligned with the new Saudi vision 
of 2030. Data of one product line (water-based paints) of three sizes were collected using four different 
forecasting methodologies. Simple Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, and Trend 
Projection and multiplicative method were used to predict the production in the next 5 years. The 
accuracy was measured by Mean Absolute Deviation where the 5-Moving average method is found as the 
best and more accurate than exponential smoothing, Trend projection or multiplicative method.  
Keywords 
Mean Absolute Deviation, Paint, Simple Moving Average. 
2. Introduction
Recently, Saudi Arabia announced its 2030 vision, which expresses the long-term goals and expectations, 
and reflects the country’s strengths and capabilities. According to (Alsharq Alawsat) electronic newspaper, ""in 2030 
vision, the Ministry of housing announced the plan of delivering more than 100 thousands of Residential products"". 
Therefore, most of the companies should pay attention and try to predict the future that goes with 2030 vision.  
It is expected that paints industry will continue to grow due to general growth in the economy. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that there is a link between the construction industry and the economy, the fluctuations in 
construction output has an adverse effect on the construction industry and the economy due to its strong linkage 
(Lam, Ka Chi, 2015). Knowing that Coatings provide two primary functions: decoration and protection, which has 
an important impact on economy. Bickle (2006), conducted a research that investigates the buyer decision conduct 
utilizing home stylistic layout retail channels to investigate uniqueness as a help of retail channel utilization.  
Research has shown that customer's choice to shop among physical stores, indexes, and e-retailers as a result of 
inclination or need is tended to. The significance of home stylistic theme retailers getting to be multi-channel 
operations. It makes opportunity for shoppers to pick items from assortment of retailers and retail channels reducing 
the probability that others have a similar collection.  
One of the tools that used to predict demand is Forecasting. It has a great role in setting a goal for any 
company. There are many previous research studied forecasting and its implementations, but they have different 
conclusions because every company environments and needs is different (Krishnan et al., 2016).A short-term 
forecast is more accurate than a long-term forecast, because the further into the future you project the forecast, the 
more variables can affect the forecast. However, it depends on the company's field.  
Unsurprisingly, a limited number of local factories are using scientific methods to forecast their production. 
They usually produce different kind of products based on their expectations and long-term experiences. This 
problem mostly affects inventory systems in factories as well as customers because the demand is undefined or 
inaccurate (Almaktoom, 2017; Alsaadi et al., 2016). Therefore, local factories would face under or over production 
problem, which will affect its reputation and quality of service. Even though forecasting methods are available and 
anyone can use them; however, companies use traditional ways (unscientific methods) to plan their manufacturing.  
Recently, forecasting has been used in different fields, for example, stock, risk investment, economics and 
finance. In 1995, Mentzer wonders if a sales forecasting practice changed over the time. Mentzer did a research to 
measure the sales forecasting changes over the past ten years. A survey distributed via email of 207 forecasting 
executives was investigated this important question. Findings revealed both discrepancies and similarities between

From Table 1 the lowest MAD is the five period moving average method for all the sizes. By implementing 
the four forecasting methods and check the forecasting accuracy for each one. We found that the Moving average is 
the best method to apply in Jeddah Paints Factory for the three sizes. Moving average method is slightly more 
accurate than the other three methods for the studied data. The error is less in Moving average and the MAD are 
41.68 in the Small size, 386.733 in the Medium size and 279.561 in the Large size. Therefore, we recommend the 
factory to use moving average method to forecast the next 5 years.  
4. Conclusion
After announcing the 2030 vision of Saudi Arabia, many industries decided to put a goal for its company. 
Especially paint industry, it is expected to continue to grow due to general growth in the economy. Jeddah Paints 
Factory is a manufacturing company that manufacture and export paints since 1975. Their problem is that they are 
using traditional ways that lead to many problems. After I examine the production and sales data over 5 years for 
JPF, I applied four different forecasting methods to predict the future that goes with 2030 vision. The methods are 
(Simple moving average, simple exponential smoothing and Trend projection (regression)) they consider 
quantitative method. After that, I checked the accuracy by using one of the forecasting accuracy measurement. I 
found that Moving average is the best method to apply in Jeddah Paints Factory. Moving average method gives 
slightly more accurate forecasts than the other three methods for the studied data. The error is less in Moving 
average and the MAD is 41.68 in the Small size, 386.733 in the Medium size and 279.561 in the large size. 
Forecasting is very important for any company, especially with occurring changes you need predict your future and 
put a new goal.

Abstract 
Quality Management System (QMS) internal audit is one the requirements of ISO9001:2015. In 2016, it 
was estimated that more than 1.6 million organizations certified to ISO9001. Each organization that is 
certified to ISO9001 has to undergo internal audit process. However there are critiques that internal audit 
does not provide value added to the organization. The objectives of research are to determine issues in 
implementation of internal audit and to determine the improvement opportunities in implementation of 
QMS internal audit. Survey questionnaires were distributed to 71 practitioners, managers, executives, and 
consultants during the seven sessions of internal audit trainings and workshops conducted in 2016 and 
early 2017. The main issues determine from the surveys are: 1) Time consuming; 2) No rewards and 
recognition for the auditor; 3) No value added audit findings. The findings of study also indicated that 
effective internal audit improvement should be based on issues determine above. It believed that the 
implementation of improvement opportunities in QMS audit can provided value added to organization 
performance improvement and exciting QMS internal audit.

1. Introduction
For the organization to maintain their quality management system based on ISO9001 standard, the organization is 
required to undergo internal audits. Internal audit is one of the approaches that have been found useful to determine 
the opportunities for improvement for organization. Rationale of internal audit is to assist organizations in enhancing 
customer satisfaction through extensive internal and external audit (Psomas & Fotopoulos, 2009). Since, internal 
audit have been in the market for almost thirty years, the standard of auditing have undergo several phase of 
improvement. The first standards was developed by American Society for Quality Control in 1984, followed by 
guideline published by ISO in 1991. Following that, the standard guideline for quality auditing such as ISO10011 
(ISO, 1991), ASQ Quality Audit Handbook published in 1997 and recent update in 2012 (Smith, 1997; Russell, 
337","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bandung, Indonesia, March 6-8, 2018 
© IEOM Society International 
Hence the recommendation for improvement can be prioritized as followed: 1) Effective audit planning and 
procedure; 2) Top Management support and 3) Evaluation and reward for effectives finding.  
 
The audit planning and procedure should include the method to plan, conduct and reporting of audit. The method to 
plan should include the auditor selection process that highlights the thorough requirements to become the auditor 
and their reward and recognition as internal auditor either full time of part time auditor. The procedure to conduct 
internal audit has to include method to determine the risk and performance related to audit criteria to provide value 
added finding. The procedure should include method to deal with the audit finding such as recommendation for 
small group activities projects, improvements techniques and analysis. Secondly, the top management support 
should include performance evaluation of internal audit and provide resources, reward and recognition.  Finally 
method to determine the effectiveness of audit and type of reward and recognition should be determined by 
organization. 
5. Conclusions 
Management system internal audit is one of the approaches that is useful to determine the improvement 
opportunities for organization. This study provided the list of issues faced by both the auditor and auditee with the 
degree of agreement of each issue. The main issues determine from the surveys are: 1) Time consuming; 2) No 
rewards and recognition for the auditor; 3) No value added to audit findings. The issues can be minimized through 
effective implementation of internal audit. This study provided and prioritized the contribution factors for effectives 
audit as followed: 1) Effective audit planning and procedure; 2) Top Management support and 3) Evaluation and 
reward for effectives finding. Further action based research is recommended in application of the recommendations 
for internal audit improvements

Abstract 
The Automotive Quality Management System of IATF16949:20016 required the organization to establish 
and maintain the PFMEA to support the implementation a risk based thinking for achieving effective 
quality management system and defect prevention. Even there are several guidelines to develop the 
PFMEA, there are inconsistency in development of FMEA and determining the elements in PFMEA. 
Hence PFMEA fail to deliver the intended results to prevent product defect origins from manufacturing 
process. This paper explores the common issues in FMEA through case study and proposed the 
countermeasure to develop an effective PFMEA through series of workshops. The output of this paper is 
guideline to develop effective PFMEA. 
Keywords: Quality Management System, FMEA, Risk Management, Risk Assessment, Risk Analysis, 
Decision support tools. 
1. Introduction
The latest updates to the IATF16949: 2016 Automotive Quality management system standard required product risk 
assessment. Although the standard does not explicitly indicated the used of FMEA for product or process risk 
assessment, the standard recommended the used of FMEA and previous standard of ISO/TS16949:2009 (ISO 2009) 
does indicated the need of FMEA.  Potential Failure Modes and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly 
Processes (PFMEA) is an important preventive method for quality assurance, and through it the decisions based on 
the severity levels and probabilities of occurrences and detection of the failure modes can be planned and prioritized, 
seeking to improve the quality of the manufactured products  (Mikos et al, 2011). FMEA is one potential tool with 
extended use in reliability engineering for the electrical and electronic components production field as well as in 
complicated assemblies (aerospace and automotive industries). The FMEA technique can be applied in the design 
stage of a system or product (DFMEA) as well as in the manufacturing process (PFMEA) (Pantazopoulos and 
Tsinopoulos 2005). The Potential Failure Modes and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes 
(PFMEA) represents an important preventive method for quality assurance, including method in the investigation of 
all the causes and effects (Mikosa & Ferreira, 2007; Dunkle, 2005; Ştirbu et al, 2011; Neshkov et al, 2012). 
Johnson & Khan (2003) indicated that the concerns of as a problem prevention technique. The sharing and reuse of 
this knowledge is a challenge and depends on the understanding of the specialists involved (Mikos et al, 2011). ISO 
31000 standards is intended to assist the organization to develop the framework to manage the risk (ISO Technical 
Management Board Working Group 2009). Although the ISO 31000 standard has effectively integrated the

first, the occurrence Second and the detection third, the action cannot be take if the severity score is 10, while 
occurrence is 2 and detection is 2. It is because the occurrence and detection are already considered as low as 
practicable.  
 
 
4.0 CONCLUSION 
 
PFMEA is proven risk assessment methodology to prevent defects. However there are seven issues that face by the 
organization and the team that develop the PFMEA for their manufacturing process. The issues include determining 
whether to develop the design FMEA or process FMEA, setting up the objectives of PFMEA, determining the 
processes, determining the severity score, listing the causes, determining occurrence score, determining control and 
prioritizing the improvement. Each of the issue have the solution as discussed in this paper. The future research 
should focus on linking the PFMEA and other quality improvement tools such as cause and effect diagram, control 
plan and application of PFMEA in quality improvement initiatives such as six sigma and lean manufacturing.

Abstract 
At a worldwide level, the outsourcing has become crucial Nowadays.  In logistics, we mostly found 
outsourcing that demands flexible contractual devices that deal with the continuous relationship between 
the customer-provider. Whereas, most of the outsourcing logistics researches ignore the relationship 
between outsourcing logistics and the contractual agreements that govern the performance taking into 
account that those contracts are structured to improve the performance of the companies. The objective of 
this paper is to question about the objective of the contract to succeed the outsourcing logistics relationship 
and to synthesize the contractual devices that mostly promote the success and the continuous progress. We 
will be using afterwards, the transaction cost theory, the resources theory and agency theory, in terms of 
the contractual complexity, so as we can demonstrate that this relationship is moderated by specific nature 
of the assets used to perform the outsourced activity within the uncertainties surrounding, the strategic 
aspect and the performance expectation.

Abstract 
This paper presents an application of risk matrix model in the field of logistics outsourcing. This application 
addresses organizational risks assessment in the logistics outsourcing process and allow their prevention.   
The objective of this paper is to contribute to the development of a decision-making tool in measure to take 
into account the various parameters of the projects of outsourcing. This tool proposes an approach allowing 
to model the various phases of the process of outsourcing of the logistics while integrating the risk 
management. In a very pragmatic way, this work aims to model the reality of the outsourcing of the logistic 
activities. Our purpose will be thus no to propose new modes of piloting of supply chains, but a frame of 
analysis and modelling capable of explaining better the industrial reality regarding the risks of outsourcing 
of the logistic activities.  The relevance matrix model is applied to promote risk analysis and management.  
Its aim is risk prioritization through the determination of an organization's critical risks. A case study of 
this application was developed using real data from the mass-market retailing to show that this model has 
a strong practical and provides a basis for risk management.

Abstract 
Open innovation is a paradigm suggesting that firms should seek external pathways, knowledge and 
capabilities in their product development process. Several companies have benefited from open 
innovation giving the concept high attention from the academia and businesses.  However, despite 
service sector’s high economic contributions, open innovation in the sector is still under-researched. 
This study focuses on how service companies implement open innovation for new product 
development. The study is in terms of the process types, networks, steps, outcomes and barriers 
involved in the open innovation process. Because open innovation process is affected by the industrial 
characteristics, only selected industries, which include financial institutions, telecommunications and 
knowledge-intensive industries, were studied. The study closes the gap in the academic area as well as 
provides managerial insights for firms in service sector. To answer the research questions, interviews 
were conducted with service companies in Thailand and responses were analyzed resulting in new 
findings about open innovation.

1. Introduction
Open innovation refers to a paradigm suggesting that firms should go beyond their boundaries and that ideas do 
not have to be originated or further developed only within the firms’ boundaries. In other words, companies 
should open their innovation management by integrating external knowledge or by bringing the ideas developed 
internally outside. Open innovation involves utilizing the business models that integrate the external and internal 
knowledge to create value while define the mechanism to capture that value. (Chesbrough, 2003) 
Studies on open innovation are mostly done within the context of manufacturing sector. However, no study has 
been done particularly on how open innovation is practiced in service sector, which in today’s industrialized 
world, exhibits the highest contribution towards the economy. Whilst there are evidences that companies in the 
sector have practiced open innovation, the implementation process has not been sufficiently studied and 
documented.(Mention, 2011; Mention & Asikainen, 2012; Patrick Schueffel1, 2015) Therefore, because of the 
rising significance of service sector, it is worthwhile to investigate how service firms practice open innovation. 
This study answers the question: how has open innovation been implemented in service sector –particularly 
companies in financial institutions, telecommunications and knowledge-intensive industries? The selected 
industries generated rapid growth in gross domestic product (GDP) shares in the last two decades. (Eichengreen 
& Gupta, 2013) The question covers five areas of interest including 1) type of processes used, 2) roles and types 
of partners, 3) steps companies took, 4) short and long-term outcomes and 5) internal and external barriers. This 
study begins with the literature review and research question. Next is the methodology, followed by interview 
results. The study ends with the conclusion which includes managerial implications, limitations and future work.

beneficial to conduct studies in this area. More studies can be created to develop further understanding of how 
these processes are done for example, how criteria were set in the idea and partner selection and how knowledge 
is transferred. Moreover, this study focuses on three industries of the service sector which are grouped in the 
modern category. (Buera & Kaboski, 2012) Similar studies can be done on the other two categories of service 
sector.

Abstract 
The goal of sugar mill management is to decrease total cost of supply chain while provided high 
percent of service level to customers. The transportation cost is an important effect to the total cost of the 
supply chain. The number of cane fields are rapidly grown in the Thailand which resulting in increasing 
the transportation cost. This paper introduces a policy which allocating the vehicles and cane fields to 
each district for managing transportation system of raw material to sugar mill. The decision of which unit 
of cane fields and unit of vehicles to allocate to each district is complicated. We develop the previous 
districting problem when the transportation system considers multiple types of vehicles; six-wheel trucks 
and ten-wheel trucks. We determine the optimal policy for allocating cane fields and vehicles to district as 
minimize the total cost of transportation cost. Randomly samples of small real world problems to be used 
as an input data for verifying our mathematical model and used a heuristic approach to near-optimal in 
reason of a computer running time. The results of this paper show that the heuristic answer provides more 
efficiency than traditional policy for managing transportation system of sugar mill.

Abstract 
Foam has been proposed as a mobility control agent in gas-based enhanced oil recovery. However, 
surfactant-based foam stability deteriorates at higher temperature. Currently, nanoparticles have been 
widely tested in foamability and foam stability. Hence, this paper is aimed to investigate the stability of 
nanoparticles-foam at different temperatures using 5,000 ppm anionic alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant in 
3.0 wt% sodium chloride, and 1.0 wt% of sodium hydroxide to control the system pH. Silicon dioxide and 
aluminium oxide nanoparticles were used to examine the effect of nanoparticles in stabilizing foam. Foam 
stability was measured based on foam half-life in static condition. The performance of the nanoparticles 
were analysed at 25°C, 40°C, 60°C and 90°C. It was found that aluminium oxide nanoparticles enhanced 
foam better compared to silicon dioxide nanoparticles. These results were supported with the microscopic 
observation of foam structure and lamellae inside the glass tube. These findings contributed to the 
understanding of the effects of nanoparticles in enhancing foam stability.

1. Introduction
Gas flooding is widely applied in the field due to its efficient oil viscosity reduction but poor sweeping effect is 
notable as gas fingering occurred in the porous media. This is due to the significant viscosity difference between gas 
and residual oil as well as high gas mobility. Therefore, foam is one of the methods proposed to minimize gas 
mobility and viscous channelling, thus improving sweeping effect. Foam is a two-phase medium that gas is trapped 
in liquid lamellae where lamellae serve as a barrier to control gas movement. The low surface tension favours the 
foamability of a solution. Talebian et al. (2013) mentioned that foam can improve recovery efficiency by reducing 
viscous instability and mobility depending on reservoir condition with proper injection strategies. Nevertheless, 
foam is sensitive to the presence of oil, water salinity, pressure and temperature. Foam lamella breaks or coalesces 
easily at higher temperature and thus higher amount of surfactant would be required to yield stronger lamellae.  
However, one of the considerations is the cost implied on excessive surfactant usage to generate stable foam at high 
temperature condition (Emrani & Nasr-El-Din, 2015). Hence, adding nanoparticles in the foam is an option to foam 
additive which believed offer better stability. For instance, a study by Singh & Mohanty (2014) showed that the 
presence of 0.1 wt% of silicon dioxide (SiO2) in 0.5 wt% alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant (AOS) could increase the 
static foam half-life from 48 hours to 68 hours in a confined system, also, further increase in concentration of SiO2 
could stabilize foam with durable foam half-life for more than 4 days. Besides that, Eftekhari et al. (2015) found that 
adding nano-ash (which consists of mostly SiO2) in the foam could reduce surfactant usage to achieve the same 
foam viscosity. Furthermore, Guo et al. (2017) showed that nano-ash and iron (III) oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles 
promotes better foamability and stability in the combination of AOS and lauramidopropyl betaine (LAPB) 
surfactants as the foam half-life increased from 83 minutes to 238 minutes and 118 minutes respectively. Therefore, 
the main purpose of this study is to investigate nanoparticles-foam stability at different temperatures with respective 
concentrations of nanoparticles, brine, and surfactant. Two types of nanoparticles were used to determine its effect

5. Conclusion 
 
Generally, the presence of nanoparticles does not significantly enhance the foamability in both neutral and alkaline 
base fluids with increasing temperature. However, the foamability by CO2 gas sparging seems behaves differently at 
temperature below and at 90°C. In agreement with most of the previous literatures, while foam half-life degraded 
with increasing temperature, the presence of nanoparticles did enhance its half-life at that temperature. Based on 
results obtained from this experiment, aluminium oxide possessed better stabilizing effect than silicon dioxide at all 
temperature regardless the system pH. From the microscopic foam images, adding nanoparticles in foam do not 
change the shape of bubble at any time and any condition. Nevertheless, the presence of nanoparticles in foam could 
retard its liquid drainage rate and thus slowing down the bubble coalescence process that will eventually increase 
foam half-life and stability at any temperature.

Abstract 
Routing of vehicles is a common application in logistics. Given rising complexity when the number of 
nodes is increasing, exact solutions are hard to find and researchers turn their attention more to heuristics 
or metaheuristics for large-scale problems. These approaches are usually based on certain assumptions 
and satisfying the assumptions is often the key to effective and efficient implementation of the approach. 
One typical assumption in routing problems is called triangular inequality which states that the sum of 
distances between two connecting arcs should be larger or at least the same with the distance between the 
outer nodes of those arcs. In Euclidean setting, this assumption will not be violated. However, in real-life 
applications, we depend on external tool such as Google Maps to obtain distances between locations. In 
so doing, it is possible to violate the inequality assumption. This paper aims to rectify that problem by 
proposing a simple algorithm that can adjust and validate the triangular inequality assumption on a given 
dataset of distances. The algorithm will be tested on a case study in a distributor company and sensitivity 
analysis will be outlined to find the relationship between the number of nodes and algorithm complexity.

Abstract 
The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, metaheuristics are 
often more suitable for practical applications. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve 
the problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on different sets of benchmark 
instances. The computational results indicate that the algorithm has a satisfactory performance in solving 
the problem.

1. Introduction
The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), introduced by [1], is one of the most attractive topics in operation 
research, communications, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, and logistics. It is of paramount importance 
to thousands of companies and organizations engaged in the delivery and collection of goods or people. The CVRP 
can be formally defined as follows [2]–[4]. it consists of designing a set of routes for a fleet of identical vehicles 
with overall minimum route cost which service all the demands such that (1) all vehicles should begin and terminate 
at the central depot, (2) each customer should be visited exactly once, by exactly one route, (3) the total demand of 
each route does not exceed capacity of vehicle, (4) the traveling distance of each vehicle cannot exceed and the 
maximum traveling distance of vehicle, and (5) the split deliveries are not allowed. For details about the variants of 
the vehicle routing problem and their solution procedures, we refer the reader to several surveys and taxonomies by 
[5], [6] and in many books or book chapters by [7], [8].  
 It is known that the CVRP is an NP-hard problem in which its real-life applications are considerably large in scale 
and finding the optimal solution of an instance is very hard and requires very long computational time. Therefore, 
metaheuristics are often more suitable for practical applications and have been applied for CVRP to find a near 
optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time, for example: tabu search [9], [10], an adaptive memory 
programming method [11], simulated annealing [12], [13], variable neighborhood search [14], [15], large 
neighborhood search [16], [17], ant colony optimization [16], [18], particle swarm optimization [19]–[21], a genetic 
algorithm [22]–[24], and a hybrid genetic algorithm [4], [25]–[27] and other metaheuristics [28]–[30]. For details 
about descriptions of these algorithms, we refer the reader to the survey papers [31], [32]. 
The main purpose of this paper is to present an effective genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the CVRP problem. The 
remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The notation and model formulation of CVRP is given in Section 2. 
A brief review has been conducted on the different GA algorithms used to solve the problem in Section 3. Section 4

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of a stevedores’ port strike on logistics service providers. 
It aims to analyze the negative effects caused by this disruption, and the strategies logistics service 
providers may implement to sustain their performance levels and quickly recover from disruption. With 
this objective, a case study comprising three logistics service providers is developed. There are evidence 
that ""Handling and management cargo delay"", ""Delay in deliver of orders"" and ""Incapacity to fulfill 
orders"" are the stevedores’ port strike negative effects with high impact and frequency. Because of these 
negative effects the logistics service providers’ key performance indicators related to reputation, loss of 
capacity and operation stoppage are diminished.

4. Conclusions 
The purpose of this study was to understand better how logistics service providers can be more resilient when facing 
a port strike, using as a case study the recurrent strikes in the port of Lisbon from 2012 to 2014. Using the case study 
empirical data it is possible to conclude that a stevedores’ strike triggers several negative effects in logistics service 
providers that will eventually severely impair the whole SC. The most critical negative effect, regarding impact, is 
the ""Loss of access to Hinterland,"" since it leads to loss of service in the companies under study. However, this 
negative effect has a low occurrence frequency, which makes it more manageable by the logistics service providers. 
The analysis of the negative effects severity (impact versus frequency) allows to identify the ""Delay in cargo 
handling and management,"" ""Delay in deliver of orders,"" and ""Incapacity to fulfill orders"" as the ones that have 
aggravated consequence on the logistics service providers operations. These negative effects reflect the material 
flow disruption that occurs on the SC during the stevedore's strike. Therefore, a stevedores strike will have a high 
impact in port activities, and the worst case scenario can cause a port clogging. These results are in line with 
previous researchers where the stevedore's strike is identified as one of the disruption with high impact in all port 
operations. 
 
The negative effects were spread along the SC; the logistics service providers role is to minimize or avoid the 
propagation of the material flow disruption along the SC; they act as ""buffers"" and deploy a set of resilient strategies 
to assure the cargo delivery on time or to reduce the delay. All the companies under study consider that the 
anticipated communication with the port authorities is essential to prevent the strike negative effects. The freight 
forwarders deploy resilient strategies such as reroute cargo to other ports, so their customers receive the product on 
time or resort to outsourcing. The shipping companies tend to analyze other options, especially if they have other 
ports nearby that can ""replace"" the one in question or adapt their partnership strategies in areas such as geographic 
positioning, possible alliances, level of integration in their customers’ services, among others. The port operators 
rely mostly on the negotiations with the stevedores' unions, and if necessary it resorts to outsourcing since during the 
strike period the available resources are depleted.  
 
This study contributes to highlight the necessity of the logistics service providers to work with contingency plans 
and be prepared to adopt a set of resilient strategies to mitigate the negative effects that come from a disruption, 
which can be motivated by for example a stevedores’ port strike. It would be very interesting if, to better understand 
the magnitude of this problem, future research about port strikes could present more quantitative data, instead of 
mainly qualitative. In particular, studies analyzing the impact of resilience strategies on KPIs would be useful in 
assessing the effectiveness of these strategies. Also, future studies should take into account the end customer, who 
will bring a new perspective to this issue.

Abstract 
Wind power is a renewable energy source, which is relatively evenly distributed over many regions of the 
world. Wind power plant requires no fuel input to produce electricity, thus, wind energy is emission free 
during its conversion process. However, manufacturing of wind power plant components such as turbine 
requires several materials, processes, energy, transports, natural resources, and disposal stages during its 
whole life cycle stages. For a complete understanding of impacts of electric energy generation using wind 
turbine, it is necessary to analyze the emissions and other impacts over the entire life cycle stages of a 
wind turbine. This study makes a complete Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of wind energy to determine the 
impacts for each functional unit (i.e. 1kWh of electric energy) over the entire life cycle of a wind turbine. 
LCA tool SimaPro has been employed to define the scopes and goals of the analysis and to perform 
inventory and impact assessment. Data has been collected from Ecoinvent database sources. This study 
found that overall negative impacts for electric energy generation are 1.58 Pt (Pt is a unit for 
environmental loading) and 339.8 Pt for wind source and energy mix in Malaysia, respectively. This 
study results mean that electric energy generation using wind turbine has much less negative impacts than 
fossil based energy mix.

1. Introduction
The burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation releases greenhouse gases (GHG) into the environment. 
Electricity generation from fossil fuels accounts for major part (more than 50%) of CO2 emissions (Bravi et al., 
2007). It has also been appeared in the literatures that energy sector has a huge contribution to the total 
anthropogenic activities (Rahman et al., 2014). Wind, photovoltaic, and biomass are the predominant renewable 
energy resources in the world accounted for 95% of the renewable based electricity generation (excluding hydro) 
(REN21, 2015). However, electricity costs from renewables are generally high owing to their higher capital 
investments (ESMAP, 2007). Among these three major sources, interests in wind is particularly high due to their 
availability and huge potential (Dolan and Heath, 2012). Despite wind resource is relatively evenly distributed all 
over the world and have capabilities to counteract environmental challenges, its dissemination is still limited 
primarily due to the lack of life cycle consideration (Saidur et al., 2011).  
Several studies assessed life cycle emissions and water consumptions for different fossil and renewable energy 
sources for power generation(Cameron and van der Zwaan, 2015; Frondel et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Rajaei and 
Tinjum, 2014; Saidur et al., 2011; Simas and Pacca, 2014; Warlick, 2009; WNA, 2011). These mentioned studies

3.4 Damage Results in Normalized Unit 
The Table 4 shows the damage results for each of the four damage categories namely Climate change, Resource 
depletion, ecosystem quality and human health. The results means that total impact is much lower for wind based 
electricity (i.e. only 1.58 μPt) than current energy mix (i.e. 339.8 μPt.  The damage results also mean the level of 
severity for a damage category compared to other categories.  For instance, human health damage category is much 
severe with 191.47161 μPt than other categories for energy mix option.

4. Conclusions
This study evaluates the life cycle impacts for electricity production from renewable wind source and electricity 
from Malaysian energy mix. Life cycle impacts provide a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the 
product (i.e. electricity) and a more accurate picture of the true environmental trade-offs in selecting resources. LCA 
enables the estimation of the cumulative environmental impacts resulting from all stages in the product’s whole life 
cycle (e.g. raw material extraction, material transportation, ultimate product disposal etc.). This study first 
determined characterization results against 15 different impact categories for electricity generation from both wind 
and energy mix. All the impact categories are found to have much lower negative impact for wind based electricity 
than energy mix. The resultant damages for these impacts are consequently lower for wind electricity. For example, 
damage to human health is 2.52E-09   DALY for wind based electricity whereas this damage for electricity mix is 
1.36E-06 DALY. We have also normalized the impacts into a single unit, for a comparison. Total environmental 
impacts for wind based electricity are 1.58 Pt whereas it is 339.8 Pt for energy mix. Among the damages, climate 
change has the major impacts with 82 Pt for energy mix and 0.64 Pt for wind electricity. This analysis will help 
decision-makers select the resources or their mixes that results in the least impact to the human health and 
environment with same amount of output.

Abstract 
Learning factories allow both, students and professionals, to learn new approaches in production technology 
in practice. The transition from manual assembly to hybrid assembly towards an almost fully automated 
assembly can be arranged in learning factories in a practical way. Hybrid assembly specially shows a lot of 
potential, as it is designed to be adopted in situations with an increasing number of variants or customized 
products as well as the need for a scalable production system. In the modern view of the fourth industrial 
revolution (Industry 4.0) in hybrid assembly systems, machines or robots are operating hand in hand with 
the human worker. This paper provides an approach to human-machine centered design of assembly 
systems and describes their implementation on a case study in the mini-factory laboratory of the Free 
University of Bolzano. The paper describes a case study, where a previously only manually produced 
product is produced in a hybrid assembly system in combination with a lightweight robot. As part of the 
man-machine interaction this work analyses risks for the safety of the human worker and provides 
appropriate measures. The work finally concludes with a summary and an outlook for the future.

1. Introduction
Over the past few years, more and more learning factory laboratories were established in universities to promote 
practical teaching, that supports a direct transfer of know-how from research into industrial practice. The development 
of Industry 4.0 will be accompanied by changing tasks and demands for the human in the factory. As the most flexible 
entity in cyber-physical production systems, workers will be faced with a large variety of jobs ranging from 
specification and monitoring to verification of production strategies, while machines assist them. The Industry 4.0 
paradigm, does not only affect M2M (machine to machine) communication, but will also have far-reaching 
consequences for the interplay of humans and technology. In the factory of the future, people should be integrated 
into the cyber-physical structure in such a way that their individual skills and talents can be fully realized [1]. Learning 
factories provide a wide range of possibilities to develop such new methods and innovative technical solutions in a 
risk-free and close-to-reality factory environment. Examples for such Industry 4.0 technologies for a cyber-physical 
production system (CPPS) are decentralized planning, control and monitoring methods and systems, human-machine-

new and extended learning factory aims to study SME-specific concepts, solutions and technologies. The integration 
of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with production, logistics 
and services in the current industrial practices, would transform today’s SME-factories into an Industry 4.0 factory 
with significant economic potential [9]. An objective for further research should be to point out specific entry points 
for Industry 4.0, that allow SMEs in particular to see direct and transparent benefits for themselves [10]. To achieve 
this goal the Free University of Bolzano makes part and coordinates an international research project funded by the 
European Union and titled “SME 4.0 – Industry 4.0 for SMEs”. The results of this research project can then be 
implemented and tested in a dedicated laboratory environment. 
The new smart mini factory lab will be extended to 300 m². The aim is to create a learning factory for the development 
of Industry 4.0 solutions and technologies in a multidisciplinary engineering approach with a focus on cyber-physical 
production systems, automation and the needs of local SMEs and SMEs in general. The laboratory will be a platform 
for research and teaching bringing together researchers, students and professionals from SME industry. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
With regard to the development towards smart factories of the future, new challenges arise for companies as well as 
for young engineers. The increasing sales volumes of lightweight robots and their increased use in industry forces 
both universities and companies to train their students and employees in human-machine interaction. In this context, 
a hybrid station for the human-machine interaction was developed in the learning factory “smart mini-factory” of the 
Free University of Bolzano. In addition to the manual assembly according to Lean principles, students can also test a 
safe integration of automated tasks into common assembly processes in the lab environment. In order to ensure a safe 
cooperation between humans and the robot, an analysis of the safety functions of the robot as well as a subsequent 
risk analysis and derivation of design requirements for the assembly station were carried out. The main goal of this 
case study research was to provide a workstation in a realistic industrial lab environment, where students can learn, 
practice and test how a safe human-machine workplace should be designed. The approach how to analyze the risk of 
a workstation with man-machine interaction based on the PILZ method can be applied in many situations and 
industries. Especially in situations where assembly tasks should be fulfilled by workers and robots or automated 
stations, this approach helps to evaluate the improvement of a redesigned workstation from the safety viewpoint. There 
are still limitations of the current work in testing the PILZ method in a case study. The main limitations lie in the 
number of case studies itself. Thus, future research should be done by conducting more case studies and by developing 
a software application to do such an analysis in a user-friendly way directly at the workstation.

Abstract ― Understanding resource circulation is vital for addressing environmental problems. In the 
past, resource circulation between the Earth’s natural and societal spaces was balanced. However, due to 
recent mass production, consumption, and disposal in societal space, such resource circulation is no longer 
balanced. In this paper, we further develop the domain transition probability model for resource circulation 
that we proposed previously, and suggest a new five-segment resource circulation model that can consider 
shortcuts between the domains within it. This model can consider a supply chain consisting of 
manufacturers and suppliers in societal space, and can be used to analyze the effects of environmental 
activities on societal space. This model provides several suggestions about the impacts of activities, such 
as artificial waste purification, recycling, and inventory disposal, on resource circulation, which are based 
on the results of simple numerical simulations. This model also indicates towards new directions for 
environmental activities that can improve the Earth’s environment.

INTRODUCTION
There is a deep, underlying connection between resources and environmental problems. Until now, the human 
population has utilized the Earth’s resources for mass production, consumption, and disposal of industrial products 
and food, supporting prosperous civilizations. However, a closer examination of resource circulation reveals that the 
ever-expanding population is putting pressure on the Earth in several ways, leading to environmental problems. Ohno 
et al. previously proposed a conceptual resource circulation model [1]. To quantitatively analyze the model, it was 
further developed into a resource circulation domain transition probability model [2], and was later expanded [3] using 
the 3R matrix and including the 3R activities, i.e., reducing, reusing, and recycling waste. These resource circulation 
models were based on one that describes resource circulation from a macroscopic perspective in natural and societal 
space as transitions between four domains, in which resources transition from the resource to the production domain, 
then to the consumption and waste domains, and then back to the resource domain. Furthermore, Sakai et al. [4] 
proposed a five-segment resource circulation model, in which production is divided into the manufacturer and supplier 
domains. This model enables the supply chain to be described. Yamashita et al. [5] proposed a model that not only 
transitions between neighboring areas, but also enables shortcut transitions between separated areas.

In Table 2, numerical example 1-A (reduce) has the highest resource value and the lowest waste value of the three 
cases. The results show that reducing waste has a positive effect on the natural space. In addition, this example also 
has the lowest inventory value (𝑆𝑆2
∗+𝑆𝑆3
∗), indicating a highly efficient supply chain. These results demonstrate that 
reducing waste is the most effective environmental activity of the three numerical examples, in which resources are 
moved directly to the resource domain. Activities to reduce resource intake by suppliers are more effective than those 
that require manufacturers and consumers to return products to resources by artificial purification. 
In Table 3, numerical example 2-A (reduce the transition from the consumption to the waste domain) has the highest 
resources value and the lowest waste value of the three cases. The results demonstrate that increasing the transition 
from the consumption to the waste domain has a positive effect on the natural space. however, the total inventory 
value (𝑆𝑆2
∗+𝑆𝑆3
∗) is at its highest in this example, indicating that the supply chain is highly inefficient. The lowest total 
inventory value in Table 3 occurs for numerical example 2-B (reduce the transition from the finished product 
production to the waste domain). This result indicates that companies became more efficient when the manufacturers 
moved unsold inventory to the waste domain. Therefore, reduction of unsold food waste, for example, leads to 
inventory reduction throughout the supply chain. 
In Table 4, numerical example 3-A (focus recycling activities on suppliers) has a larger total inventory value. This 
shows that resources remain in the societal space for longer when they are recycled by suppliers, rather than if they 
had been recycled by manufacturers, and that movement of resources to the waste domain is slow. However, numerical 
example 3-B (focus recycling activities on manufacturers) has a smaller total inventory value and larger resource and 
in-use values. This situation is relatively desirable, because, rather than recycling iron from scrapped cars to suppliers, 
recycling good-quality parts to manufacturers will result in favorable results overall. 
 
 
VI.    CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, we added shortcut domain transitions to a five-segment domain transition probability model using 
the 3R matrix, and compared various situations through simple numerical simulation. We verified the relative 
magnitudes of the impacts of different environmental activities on societal space. Based on the model presented here, 
reduction activities by suppliers are more effective than artificial purification conducted by manufacturers and 
consumers, and the reduction of unsold food waste can effectively reduce the inventory of the entire supply chain. It 
was found that recycling iron as parts rather than as scraps would be preferable. As the simulations were based on 
numerical examples set by the authors, they may deviate from actual events in society. From understanding the 
limitations of this research, in the future, we would like to conduct simulations incorporating real data. We hope that 
the results of this research will assist companies in the supply chain during the development of their environmental 
activities.

Abstract 
The importance of the validity and reliability test in measuring the research instrument is to prove that the 
data collection through the survey using questionnaires to obtain the valid data. This pilot study aimed to 
measure the validity and reliability of the questionnaire on the relation of safety climate factors and their 
relationship with personal attributes in the small and medium enterprise (SMEs) furniture industries. The 
object of this study was 100 wood workers taken in the center of SMEs furniture industry in Indonesia 
such as Jepara, Sukoharjo, Sragen and Surakarta. The questionnaire consisted of 36 questions with 8 
variables. Method of taking the data in this research was using judgment sampling. In measuring the test 
of the validity of the questionnaire, Pearson Product Moment test was used, while to measure the 
reliability test Cronbach's Alpha was used. The results of this study showed 36 items of questions were 
valid based on the value of Pearson Product Moment of ≥0.72. This indicated that the questions in this 
questionnaire could represent the object of this study. The reliability test showed Cronbach's Alpha value 
of 0.98. These results showed that the questions in this research questionnaire were able to deliver 
relatively consistent results when repeatedly tested. It could be concluded that the questions in this 
questionnaire were valid and reliable for the use in safety work studies in SMEs furniture industries.

Introduction
Safety climate was an important concept in risk occupational management and an indicator of safety culture
(Tharaldsen et al., 2008). Various definitions of safety climate makes no consensus on the most appropriate 
definition of safety climate. One of the definitions of the safety climate by Neal and Griffin (2002) was the 
perception of safety-related policies, procedures, and practices. This was consistent with many studies showing that 
safety climate can anticipate safety-related outcomes for workers (Yule et al., 2007). That way, research on safety 
climate would be able to provide positive input for industries in order to avoid work accident. 
Different concepts of safety climate allowed the development of safety climate models that have the validity. 
It could make a safety climate assessment based on the characteristics of the research location (Milijic et al., 2013). 
Safety climate was an important requirement in the industry, furniture industry was no exception. Even regulations 
in the furniture industry in the country as well as in various countries required the existence of safety climate. But 
not all business actors in the furniture industry paid attention to the correct safety climate. For that we needed a 
research about safety climate in furniture industry. This study was a pilot project adopted from safety climate

Based on the calculation of validity test, the overall value of items in the research instrument on the safety 
climate had a coefficient of product moment correlation above the value of r table of 0.2324. Coefficient value was 
quite high. This was in accordance with the statement Salmiaty and Handayani (2015) that if the value of product 
moment correlation coefficient was higher than r table then the instrument was said to be valid. This validity test 
used significance level of 0.01. The test results of validity of this safety climate indicated that all question items in 
questionnaire were valid.  
This safety climate questionnaire consisted of 36 items of questions with 8 variables. The highest product 
moment correlation coefficient value was the equality variable in the work environment of 0.859. This value 
indicated that the variables in work environment had the highest level of validity among other variables. While the 
value of the lowest product moment correlation coefficient was the commitment and management measures on 
safety of 0.724. This indicated that the variable of commitment and management action on safety had the lowest 
value among other variables. Overall, of the 36 items of questionnaire question of safety climate in the furniture 
industry UMKM expressed valid. Thus the safety climate research instrument was valid and could be used as an 
accurate research instrument. 
 
3.2. Reliability Test 
The reliability test on the safety climate instrument was done after testing the validity. Reliability test was 
done to know the consistency or stability of the measurement result of an instrument if the instrument would be 
reused as a measuring instrument of an object. Here was the result of reliability analysis test instrument safety 
climate:

The result of reliability instrument test of safety climate at SMEs furniture industry center in this research 
was equal to 0.98. The reliability test results were included in very high category. The reliability value indicate that 
all questions in the questionnaire of this study were reliable or consistent. A consistent questionnaire could be 
defined as a questionnaire that had results that tend not to change when used repeatedly on an object..  
Cronbach Alpha instrument of climate climate in SMEs furniture industry center had a value above 0.6. 
These values indicated that the safety climate instrument consisting of 8 variables with 36 items of questions reliable 
or consistent. This was supported by Hullin et.al., (2001), the most common rule in reliability with Cronbach Alpha 
was 0.6-0.7, indicating acceptable reliability levels and 0.8 or more indicating excellent levels of reliability. Thus the 
instrument of safety climate research was declared reliable and could be used as the next research instrument.

Instrument was a tool used to collect data in a study. The data collected could show the quality of a study. A 
good research was a valid and reliable or consistent study. Therefore it took validity and reliability testing on 
research instruments to obtain valid and reliable data. The result of research of safety climate instrument at SMEs 
furniture industry center showed that the validity value of 36 questions with 8 variables were above r table. It could 
be interpreted that the instrument of safety climate in SMEs furniture industry center was valid. Similarly, the 
reliability of safety climate instrument test resuleds on SMEs furniture industry center including high category. The 
result of the high reliability test showed that the instrument of safety climate research at SMEs was reliable to 
furniture industry center. This meant that the instrument of this study could be used repeatedly by producing the 
same results, accurate and could be used in further research.

Abstract 
A case study from company that involved in the electrical and electronic manufacturing industry is 
presented in this paper. The manufacturing operation consists of several workstations that form an 
assembly line to make magnetic electronic products. Excess work in process inventory, unnecessary 
movement, over processing, and waiting time are identified as non-value-added activities across the 
process value stream. Meanwhile process cycle time, pieces per man hour, and manufacturing lead time 
are selected as a performance measures. A comprehensive discrete event simulation model was developed 
to replicate the existing assembly process. It then been utilized to optimize the interactions among the 
elements by focusing on minimizing the mentioned waste, to analyze improvement opportunities, and to 
quantify the possible benefits of the proposed actions. The information obtained from the computer 
simulation experiments, allows the management of the case study company, a real time perspective of 
how lean manufacturing implementation affect the performance measures. Besides, it may also reducing 
the risks associated with making decision in tweaking the current process through improvement activities.

Abstract 
We consider a Stackelberg mixed market in which a state-owned welfare-maximizing (domestic) public 
firm competes against a profit-maximizing (foreign) private firm. We suppose that the domestic firm is 
less efficient than the foreign private firm. However, the domestic firm can lower its marginal costs by 
conducting cost-reducing R&D investment. We examine the impacts of privatization on decisions upon 
cost-reducing R&D investment by the domestic firm and how these affect the domestic welfare. We show 
that privatization lowers productive efficiency of the domestic firm, regardless of whether the domestic 
firm is leader or follower. Furthermore, we also show that privatization of the domestic public firm 
deteriorates the domestic social welfare, regardless of whether the domestic firm is leader or follower.

1. Introduction
Competition between public and private firms exists in a range of industries like telecommunications, electricity, 
natural gas, airlines industries, as well as services including hospitals, banking and education. Some authors studied 
mixed oligopolies under Cournot competition (firms move simultaneously) and some others considered Stackelberg 
models (firms move sequentially). Pal (1998) studied a Stackelberg mixed duopoly with homogenous goods, and 
Matsumura (2003) studied a Stackelberg mixed duopoly where a public firm competes with a foreign private firm. 
Many studies about international mixed markets assume that all the firms have identical technologies (see, for 
instance, Fjell and Heywood (2002) Nishimori and Ogawa (2002), using a mixed oligopoly model, investigate the 
effects of deregulation on the cost-reducing incentives of a public firm. Lin and Ogawa (2005) show that while a 
private firm carries out the cost-reducing investment, a public firm does not have an incentive to reduce its costs as 
long as the market share of the private firm is sufficiently large. 
There are many other papers on the field of international mixed models (see, for example, Ferreira and Ferreira 
(2013, 2014) and Fjell and Pal (1996) among others). Tomaru (2007) analyzed, in a Cournot model, how decision-
making upon cost-reducing R&D investment by a domestic public firm is affected by privatization when competing 
in the domestic market with a foreign private firm. He shows that privatization of the domestic public firm lowers 
productive efficiency and deteriorates domestic social welfare. In this paper, we examine the same question but in a 
Stackelberg formulation instead of Cournot. We show that the results are qualitatively similar, if the firms take their

5. Comparisons 
 
In this section, we are going to compare the levels of cost-reducing R&D investment and the domestic social welfare 
in the different models previously analysed. In particular, we focus our attention on the effects of privatization of a 
domestic firm in the international Stackelberg models considered. Here, for our analysis, we assume that

6. Conclusions 
 
We have analysed the effects of trade with a foreign firm and privatization of the domestic public firm on an 
incentive for the domestic firm to reduce costs by undertaking R&D investment, when the firms move sequentially 
(Stackelberg model). We stated that the domestic privatized firm lose its incentive to raise the level of R&D 
investment, regardless of whether the domestic firm is leader or follower. Furthermore, this privatization leads to 
deterioration of the domestic social welfare, regardless of whether the domestic firm is leader or follower.

Abstract 
Today’s society is technologically advanced, the world is just a click away and our companies’ customers 
have easy access to all the information. Therefore, they are increasingly demanding, wanting more and 
better at a lower cost. Using as a case study a shipping company, a system of Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) was analysed to verify what reasons led to its abandonment and to realise what to do 
to reverse such situation. In this industry product differentiation is practically null, so the customer’s choice 
comes down to price. However, customers are paying more attention to customer service, therefore 
companies are developing stronger relationships with them. The construction of such relationships implies 
data collection on the client, from which one can offer services of greater value. This may lead to 
partnerships and competitive advantages. Thus, the use of CRM tools is being promoted for CRM tools 
present themselves as a valuable asset. In the end, suggestions are presented, ranging from improvements 
to the existing system, to more complex suggestions, costlier or breaking with the existing mode of 
relationship and dialogue between company and customers, but that, in the future, will certainly translate 
into advantages over competing companies.

1. Introduction
The shipping industry has recently grown and evolved a lot. It is true that there was greater investment in 
reconstructing and improving land transport infrastructures (road and rail), but maritime transport presents itself as an 
alternative for it allows a reduction of the number of vehicles that daily congest the international road network (Douet 
and Cappuccilli, 2011). In fact, according to the European Commission, maritime transport, namely Short Sea 
Shipping (SSS), is the only ""mode"" that has proved to be able to keep up with the growth in road transport (Douet 
and Cappuccilli, 2011).  
Freight transport is a vital component in any economy. It is an economic indicator on the contribution to the economic

Abstract 
This study predicted the bankruptcy companies listed in Japanese Stock Markets for the entire 
industry and individual industries using Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA), artificial neural 
networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVMs), and compared the method which is the 
best method to predict the bankruptcy companies more precisely. The financial statements of the 
listed companies in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange, and other stock 
exchanges in Japanese stock markets were used as data.  The data of 244 bankrupt companies 
that went bankrupt between 1991 and 2014 are used. On the other hand, data of 64708 non-
bankrupt companies that did not go bankrupt between 1991 and 2014 for 24 years are used. The 
data is acquired from Nikkei NEEDS database. In MDA and ANN analysis, only for some 
industries bankruptcy prediction could be made accurately. On the other hand, SVM could 
predict bankruptcy in companies almost perfectly for each industry.

1. Introduction
In recent years, Japanese companies are improving their corporate performance and financial structure because of 
the yen depreciation and gradual recovery of the economy. Though the number of bankruptcies has decreased, even 
today it is a highly important management subject to determine whether a company will become bankrupt. The 
causes of bankruptcy are diverse, and they can be qualitative and quantitative factors. In this research, we use 
financial indicators as the quantitative factors to explain the reason for bankruptcy in the industry. This research 
deals with 224 bankrupt companies that went bankrupt from 1992 to 2015. To be specific, the financial statements 
of the listed companies in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange, and other stock exchanges in 
Japanese stock markets were used as data in this study.  The data of 244 bankrupt companies that went bankrupt 
between 1992 and 2015 are used. On the other hand, data of 64708 non-bankrupt companies that did not go bankrupt

5. Conclusion 
This study predicted the bankruptcy companies listed in Japanese Stock Markets for the entire industry and 
individual industries using Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA), artificial neural networks (ANN) and support 
vector machines (SVMs), and compared the method which is the best method to predict the bankruptcy companies 
more precisely. From empirical analysis result described above, we may conclude that SVM is more accurate than 
the other models in predicting bankrupt companies. In MDA and ANN analysis, only for some industries bankruptcy 
prediction could be made accurately. On the other hand, SVM could predict bankruptcy in companies almost 
perfectly for the entire industry and each industry. It can be derived the following conclusions from the results of 
this study. This bankruptcy predicting model helps for customers, investors and financiers to prevent losses by 
focusing on the information of these financial indicators before finalizing the transaction. In future research, I would 
like to use different methods like xgboost and logistic regression and compare with the method which is the best 
method to predict the bankruptcy companies more precisely..

Abstract 
Performance metric is one of the components of a continuous improvement to achieve and maintain the 
performance of the machine or process.  Setup and changeover losses are one of the losses that increase 
the lead time and reduce the available time for the operation of machine. Despite of work study that used 
widely in industry to reduce the losses, there is no effective measurement tool to monitor the setup and 
changeover losses. Furthermore, excessive working time and idle time are the main focus of the people to 
improve, but they may miss out the other important element, the frequency of setup process in a period of 
time. The objective of this study is to visualize the setup losses through performance metric. Therefore, 
Usability and Human Factor are introduced to measure the frequency of the setup process in a period of 
time and highlight the excessive working time to be further streamlined. Real data was examined by using 
the performance metric and it showed that the performance metric able to visualize the setup losses. It is 
expected to visualize the setup and changeover losses in the industry and assist the user to tackle the issue 
correctly.

1. Introduction
In the manufacturing sector, various types of wastes that available in the production are dragging down the 
utilization and performance level of the machine or process. As mentioned by Bokrantz et al. (2016), there are 
eleven major losses that exist in the production. To overcome this issue, manufacturers are trying their best to 
eliminate wastes through tools and techniques. Although these tools and techniques are effective in elimination of 
wastes, but it is meaningless if it is not tackled on the correct waste. Therefore, visualization of wastes is important 
to identify the correct problem and tackle it to achieve better performance of the machine or process. The 
elimination of the waste is a long journey and it is not going to stop until zero waste is achieved. In this long 
journey, performance metric is relatively important to allow manufacturers to monitor and measure the current 
performance level of the machine or process. Furthermore, performance metric also used to gather the information 
for the production team to identify the area of improvement should be made.   
In the perspective of Overall Equipment Effectiveness, setup losses are one of the six big losses that bring impact to 
the production. It is categorized in the availability factor along with the breakdown losses. As claimed by Mohamed 
Esa et al. (2015), there are non- value added operations that involved in the setup and changeover process, which 
classified as waste for the company. The non-value added activities are improper working procedure, work delay, 
tool searching, unnecessary motion and transportation. In fact, high setup time is one of the setup losses that should

The human factor is mainly affected by the human behavior and also the location of the tools and materials. As 
mentioned by the Puvanasvaran et al. (2016), for the semi-automated or manually industries, the impact of the 
performance of the manpower is crucial. The lack of monitoring might cause the workers perform their work 
inefficiently. Furthermore, the lack of standard operating procedure and improper orientation of the tools also 
increase the unnecessary setup operations and time.

Figure 5. Comparison between Usability and Human Factor 
 
As shown in the Figure 5, the usability is compared with the human factor. The usability percentage over the five 
quarters shown stable and the range is just 0.80 percent. However, the human factor percentage is up and down over 
the five quarters. This showed that the increases of the frequency of the setup and changeover process are not the 
main factor to the human factor. For the fifth quarter, the usability percentage is 98.93 percent, which is the highest 
among the other quarters. However, the human factor percentage is only 89.25 percent, which is the second lowest 
among the other quarters. This showed the relationship between usability and human factor is not strong and the 
problems that lead to low human factor rate is not affecting the usability rate.  
 
Based on the percentage of the usability and human factor, operation team able to identify and monitor the setup 
losses that available in the production line. They may develop plans to improve the setup and changeover process to 
increase the flexibility and respond quickly to the changes to the customer demand. The performance level of the 
setup and changeover process is visualized by the two metrics. If the usability percentage is lower than usual, it 
means the problem might be the orientation of the setup and changeover process. It may be the repeat or corrective 
changeover process due to the improper set up that cause machine to produce low quality products. In addition, if 
the human factor percentage has not achieved 100 percent, it means that excessive working time exists during the 
production. The operators have performed their task with a longer time than the ideal setup time. It is necessary for 
the operation team to monitor the performance of the manpower and also the frequency of the setup and changeover 
process to prevent the waste of the manufacturing cost, manufacturing time and resources. This is supported by the 
Puvanasvaran et al. (2016a) with the statement, the guidance is useful to control or monitor the operational time of 
operators. This could reduce the problem in scheduling, utilization of manpower and also the coordination between 
men and machines. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Setup loss is one of the factors that reduce the flexibility of the production time. High setup losses in the production 
might lengthen the time for the industry to respond to the changes of the customer demand. The usability and human 
factor can be the performance metric used to quantify the setup losses and allow the production team to identify the 
area of improvement effectively. Furthermore, these two performance metrics allow users to monitor and measure 
the setup and changeover process regarding the process scheduling and performance of the manpower. As shown in 
the result, the high setup time might not only caused by the excessive setup time, but also the frequency of the setup 
and changeover process. This is necessary for the production team to identify to tackle on the correct waste in an 
efficient way. These performance metrics are expected to give a better picture to the companies in quantifying the 
setup losses and assist companies in identification of area of improvement. In future, it can be implemented with 
other tools and techniques to improve the performance of the manpower.

Abstract 
For years, manufacturing industry faced challenges in conserving high cost and efficiency in research and 
development of products especially in relation to welding structure. To handle this problem, this research 
conducts an effort to develop methods to determine tensile strength properties of Friction Stir Welding 
(FSW) in Aluminum alloy using prediction model. An artificial intelligent technique, i.e. Artificial Neural 
Network (ANNs) is used to develop the prediction model. Initial work involves FSW welding experiment 
and testing of subsequent result to analyze the tensile strength properties of the welding structure based on 
process parameter input. Prediction model is developed based on Back Propagation (BP) of error to 
predict tensile strength of the FSW structure. Input parameters for the model is tool rotational speed and 
travel speed while output of the model is the tensile strength of FSW welded structures. Proposed 
prediction model is then trained with experiment data. Testing of the proposed prediction model was then 
conducted using unused experiment data from the training. Research result shows that proposed 
prediction model is aligned with experiment data. This shows that average error value from the training 
and testing is 0.010286 or very small (close to zero) which means that the desired output of the prediction 
model for the training and testing is close to each other. Result from regression graph for training and 
testing shows matching linear regression between output and target when compared to dash line of the 
ideal result. This shows an absolute linear relationship where R equals to 0.9 or close to 1. This proves 
good compatibility the prediction model.

1. Introduction
Friction stir welding as a welding technique has been applied for the past several years in the engineering field 
especially in manufacturing. Compared with conventional welding technique especially for lower melting material 
such as Aluminium alloys which is normally susceptible to hot cracking, FSW promises high quality welding with 
high durability as well as some other advantages due to its nature of not reaching the melting temperature during 
welding. Introduced by The Welding Institute (TWI) in 1991, FSW is considered as a green technology that 
emphasizes on environmentally friendly process that does not need material filler. FSW is known as one of solid 
state welding processes that relies on heat energy produced from mechanical friction. Technically, this welding 
technique works based on a combination of two main processes associated by parameter to tool motion, i.e. 
rotational speed and travel speed respectively [Nandan]. As described in Figure 1, the tool rotates in a specific speed 
in Revolutions Per-Minute (RPM) and this tool moves in a specific speed along the welding path in millimetre per 
minute (mm / min) speed unit. 
This technique has the advantage to be able to join similar and dissimilar materials which are not normally 
considered bondable (or ""incompatible""), like Aluminum with Steel, Copper with Aluminum, Titanium with Copper 
and Titanium with Stainless Steel and nickel alloy to be Steel [Huseyin]. Other significant advantage from this 
technique is shorter welding time with small amount of heat energy thus it is an efficient energy usage. Currently 
FSW welding is a more popular option especially for manufacturing industry like automotive, plane, train and ship 
as well as spaceship and space station, oil and gas and construction.

As shown by figure 6, the final mean-square error is small. Both training and testing network with their linear 
regression between output network and corresponding target show similar graph. The figure shows that the Mean 
Square Error (MSE) of ANNs model declines. Well trained ANNs have to have very low MSE at the end of the 
training which, in this research, equals to 0.010286. This result shows that the MSE is very small (close to zero) 
where desired ANNs output and resulting ANNs output for the training set are close.  
According to the result obtained from the regression graphs of training and testing (Figure 7), the best fit of 
linear regression line between output and target shows the right linear relationship when compared with the dash line 
of ideal result. This is based on the R value that is equal to 0.9 or very close to 1 which indicates a good fit. 
5. Conclusion
In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) is used to predict FSW welding parameter in Aluminum 6061-
T6 alloy. Rotational speed and travel speed tools are considered to be ANN’s model inputs. An effective parameter 
from the FSW process for tensile strength is modelled. MSE value from training and testing is 0.010286 or very 
small (close to zero) which means that the desired output and ANN’s output for training set and testing become very 
close to each other. On the other hand, results derived from the regression graphs of training and testing show that 
the linear regression line between output and target compared to dash line of perfect result (ideal condition) have the 
right linear relationship where the R value equals to 0.9 or very close to 1. This shows a good fit.

Abstract 
To improve the airport’s operation, we use Monte Carlo simulation to determine the optimal number of 
check-in counters required for a single flight with 200 scheduled passengers in a 2-hour check-in period. 
Our analysis of the passenger arrival pattern supported that the inter-arrival time can be approximated 
using an exponential distribution. By using the Monte Carlo Simulation model with increasing number of 
check-in counters, we were able to conclude that three check-in counters were optimal to satisfy the 
service level requirement that at least 90% of the passengers must be served within 10 minutes upon 
arrival at the check-in queue. In additional, we further extend our analysis to cater for different passenger 
loads from 50 to 550 and determine the linear relationship between the number of counters required and 
passenger load.

1. Introduction
The airline industry has been growing very rapidly during the past decade. An ever growing industry that needs to 
improve the infrastructure to meet the needs of the passengers.  In the meantime, low-cost carriers are also entering 
into this lucrative market and capturing a lot of the market share. Modern airports need substantial infrastructure 
investment for their long runways, taxiways, airport operational equipment, passenger terminal areas and expensive 
ground handling equipment.  An airport serves either as a transit point or terminal point for the passengers during a 
trip. Airport operation can be roughly divided into airside and landside. Most of the Asian airport are very complex 
and requires proper coordination and effort to facilitate the daily operations. Some of the core processes in the 
airport are: handling of passengers and baggage, servicing, maintenance and engineering of the aircraft, ground 
handling activities, leasing of rental spaces for retail shops, aviation support facility (air traffic control) and finally 
custom and immigration for the passengers. Airport operators do not operate alone. They normally form partnership 
with various partners such as ground handlers to handle the passengers and baggage, catering companies to be in-
charge the meals on board, and engineering companies to take care of aircraft maintenance.  
Airlines are the major customers to the airport operators and the main objectives are to ensure the on-time departure 
of the aircraft and improve the passengers experience and convenience at the airport.  One of the criteria for judging 
the efficiency of an airport is the availability of operational facilities such as runways, check-in counters, people 
movers, baggage handling system, aerobridges, and gate-hold rooms and so on.  The arrival and departure processes 
of aircraft at the airport are two major operations which trigger various subsequent activities at the airport.  After the 
aircraft arrives at the airport, it will move from the runway to taxi way, and park at the designated gate. The

slowly until mid-night. The counters requirement will also form the basis for manpower allocation to handle the 
departing passengers during check-in process.

7. Conclusion & future work 
 
In this paper, we are concerned with the optimal number of check-in counter required in an airport to service the 
passengers within 10 minutes after their arrival for a single flight. Due to the randomness of passenger arrival and 
service time, we have employed Monte Carlo Simulation method using Excel spreadsheet to solve the problem. Our 
analysis of the passenger arrival pattern supported that the inter-arrival time can be approximated to follow an 
exponential distribution, with the maximum absolute deviation (a measure of goodness of fit) between the 
Cumulative Relative Frequency of the sample data and the Cumulative Distribution Function of the fitted 
distribution to be 0.02.  Our simulation template allowed us to perform the simulation and collect performance 
indicators such as average total system time, average waiting time, average queue length and the 90th percentile of 
480","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

the total system time. In our simulated example with 200 scheduled passengers in a 2-hour check-in period, we were 
able to conclude that 3 check-in counters were optimal to satisfy the service level requirement. Any increase in the 
number of check-in counters will not improve the service level significantly and instead it will result in wastage of 
check-in counters which would be under-utilized. We have also determined the linear relationship between the 
number of counters and passenger load to assist Terminal Managers to make quick decision. We have also 
developed the daily counter requirements for the airport looking at each individual flight, passengers load and STD. 
 
A possible extension of this model is to explore shared check-in counters where several check-in counters are shared 
across several flights belonging to the same airline. This proposed extension will be useful for the airline-specific 
check-in-counters with the objective of reducing the total number of check-in counters assigned to a particular 
airline instead of to a single flight. In the most recent development, airports are also looking at self check-in kiosk to 
reduce the operational cost. Nevertheless, the methodology developed in this paper, can also be used with 
modification to estimate the number of self check-in kiosk counters requirement at the modern airport.

Abstract 
This study examines the perceptions of students and alumni of Australian engineering schools regarding 
Self-Responsibility (SR) in their employability competencies development process.  It employed 
quantitative methods using a web-based self-report questionnaire to collect data.  We found that SR consists 
of four underlying factors: (1) Autonomy and Self-Initiation (ASI), (2) Sense of Agency (SA), (3) Self-
Awareness and Evaluation (SAE), and (4) Self-Management (SM).  These factors were further analysed 
using Factor Analysis (FA) to determine the multidimensionality of SR.  The results of this analysis showed 
the appropriateness of considering SR as a multidimensional concept.  The findings have positive 
implications in helping learners to effectively manage their development process by increasing their level 
of awareness in four areas: namely (1) Motivation, (2) Control, (3) Human agency and (4) Perspective, with 
the outcome of enabling educators to assist students enhance their career and advancement prospects.

1. Introduction
The concept of employability has been viewed as the key to increase possibilities for gaining a job, particularly related 
to the capability of an individual to “gain initial employment, maintain employment and obtain new employment if 
required” (Hillage, Pollard, & Britain, 1998, p. 1).   Correspondingly, this concept strongly affected by the personal 
qualities possessed to meet the needs of the potential employers and contribute successfully within enterprises to a 
context of on-going change (Bridgstock, 2009).  So, we defined employability as the essential capability of an 
individual to gain and perform a given job, facilitated by the available development process.  By doing so, we highlight 
the efforts of an individual in developing a set of appropriate competencies needed by potential employers or the broader 
labour market.   
Our interest in this subject arises from a number of sources including the International Labour Organization (ILO) Annual 
Report (ILO, 2013), which showed that the number of people unemployed globally, in 2012, was 197.3 million, and 
75 million of them were young people under 25 years and not in education, employment or training (NEET).  In 
association with this unemployment issue, graduate unemployment has remained high.  Graduate unemployment 
refers to the unemployed young people who have graduated from a university or polytechnic college, the latter being 
similar to Technical and Further Education [TAFE] in Australia.  For example, Taiwanese unemployed graduates in 
2009 were 5.86% of the total national unemployment (Wu, 2011).  In 2011 in Tunisia 56% of the unemployed were 
holders of higher education degrees (Premand, Brodmann, Almeida, Grun, & Barouni, 2012).

The other type of investigation that should follow from this work is educational methods which will promote and 
enable the development of student SR for employability competency development. It is plausible that the appropriate 
educational methods may differ according to characteristics of students, whether demographic background factors or 
personality, or something else which could be correlated with the SRS scale measures.

Abstract 
As the competencies demanded by the labour market has changed, engineering graduates have to 
proactively be self-responsible by participating in competency-enhancing activities to possess 
competencies needed by the labour market.  Without any learners’ sense of self-responsibility (SR), 
competency development only creates low quality engineering graduates.  Therefore, this study examines 
the perceptions of 1056 students and alumni of Australian engineering schools regarding SR in their 
employability competencies development process.  Findings show that the engagements of both participants 
were extrinsically motivated.  However, the alumni participants had internalised their extrinsic motivations 
into positive behaviours, including self-initiation, persistence, motivation and independency.  As a 
consequence, the alumni participants felt a greater sense that SR is an integral part of themselves, expressed 
through their capability to be self-initiated, highly persistent, motivated and independent in navigating their 
competency development without relying on their friends, families or instructors.  In relation to the external 
circumstances affecting the perceptions of SR, the participants did not associate their perspective of SR 
with their prior development experience in high schools but rather they associated it with their recent 
experiences within the engineering school environments.  This finding has implications for how SR could 
help learners at university level to internalise their external motivations.  
Keywords – Self-Responsibility, employability, competencies development, engineering graduates, Australian

1. Introduction
When we talk about Self-Responsibility, several similar terms have been used within the educational context 
explaining the idea the personal responsibility of an individual to his/her actions.  Allan (2006), for instance, conducted 
a quantitative study with a sample of 286 Australian students to measure their understanding about personal 
responsibility for learning.  He found that responsibility is related with a capability of an individual to be autonomous 
and to self-control the learning process.  In this regard, Mergler (2007) developed a construct which help adolescents 
and teachers comprehend the concept of personal responsibility.  She argued that personal responsibility is related to 
one’s awareness and control over four components, namely: 1. Thoughts and feelings, 2. The choices, 3. The outcomes 
and 4. The impacts.  Comprehensively, personal responsibility has been defined as “[the] readiness to account for 
oneself and one’s interiorized social judgment, not only for one’s own actions, but also and above all for what one is, 
and so for one’s personal qualities and dispositions. It is expressed in a constant readiness of the person to bear the 
social consequences of their actions” (Ciechanowska, 2014, p. 4).  Through her definition, Ciechanowska linked 
student’s personal responsibility with his/her readiness for deeply integrating new construed information with the 
existing concepts.   
Despite of these studies, less attention is given by experts and scholars in the field of employability in to the research 
on SR.  “Supporting students in their development seems to be marginalized in recent years … [because most people 
see] universities as a place to build economic capital … [where it] has become important only in the perspective of its 
usefulness and measurable financial and economic accountability (Ciechanowska, 2014, p. 2).    This argumentation

Australian high schools (M = 69.11, SD = 10.69) and non-Australian high schools (M = 68.91, SD = 10.69; 
t(1054) = 0.29 p = 0.77).  Therefore, H4 was also rejected. 
(6) The results of the ANOVA test reveal no significant differences on the mother’s education background [F(5,1055)
= 1.67, p = 0.14] or father’s education background [F(5,1055) = 5.05, p = 0.10] at the probability level of 0.05 in
the perceptions of SR.  Thus, H6 was rejected and the finding was interpreted as the capacity for accepting SR is
driven by learners’ own willingness, not their parents.
The results of the comparative analyses provide evidence that the opinions of students and alumni related to SR are 
not influenced by their gender, age, level of education, prior development experience or parent’s educational 
background differences.  This means that older and more experienced respondents may have a higher awareness of 
SR, but this kind of awareness does not make them automatically develop SR during the process of developing 
appropriate competencies.  Indeed, the different interests of individuals in accepting SR are not related to their gender, 
age or levels of education, but to learners’ current experience in the competency development process.  When Candy 
(2004) examined the effect of learning environments on learners’ capability to construe knowledge, he emphasised 
the transformation of knowledge from one domain to other domains.  Therefore, when a learner experiences a new 
event, the new obtained knowledge may support or oppose his/her previous understanding of a particular subject.  In 
several cases, this new knowledge may provide a new motivation or willingness (Oliveira, Silva, Guglielmino, & 
Guglielmino, 2010).  Therefore Brookfield (2012) argues that the structures of understanding are obtained from how 
well learners construe the events.  For those who are experiencing Australian engineering schools as new places to 
develop their competencies, the new understanding of SR in their current development environment, depending on 
their interpretation, may become a support or barrier for them to possess appropriate competencies. 
5. Conclusion
This study has outlined the perceptions of the Australian engineering student and alumni about the role of SR in their 
employability competencies development process.  The results of statistical analyses positively support the importance 
of SR and its four factors in the process of assisting students to find their own approaches in managing their own 
competencies development.  With respect to this capability, the participants also have a common perspective about 
the freedom to manage their own development process along with the consequences.  This sense of freedom is easier 
to be conceptualised than to be implemented in real development situations.  For learners who come completed high 
school overseas, the freedom to self-manage the development process is probably a new concept.  For years, they have 
depended on teachers/instructors in managing their personal development where all learning decisions were made by 
other persons.  Therefore, learners’ role was to passively wait to be directed by the others and fail to effectively engage 
in competency-enhancing activities.     
This failure was shown by some student participants, particularly those who were new to the engineering school 
environment.  Unless they could less-depend on their friends, instructors and institutions, they could not fully exercise 
the concept of SR in their own development process and may easily give up when confronted by perceived barriers.  
In contrast, self-responsible learners could develop their own approaches for effectively managing their own 
development process.  This capability was demonstrated by the alumni participants who had internalised/integrated 
their external motivations into positive behaviours associated with being self-responsible learners, such as: self-
organise, self-control, self-regulate, self-confidence and self-reflective.  At this stage, the alumni participants 
understood the importance of SR for their competencies development process and transformed the concept of SR into 
their own development philosophy.  As a consequence, the alumni participants felt a greater sense that SR is an integral 
part of themselves, expressed through their capability to be self-initiated, highly persistent, motivated and independent 
in navigating their competency development without relying on their friends, families or instructors.   
This finding has implications for how SR could help learners at university level to internalise their external 
motivations.  Like the process of constructing knowledge, SR is not something that is teachable or that automatically 
appears during the development process.  Rather, SR is a self-determined process, guided by learners’ consciousness, 
reflected in their awareness to self-examine their own structure of their development, including their competencies 
weaknesses.  Therefore, when an engineering school provides an effective design of constructivist instructional 
environments, the perceived experiences may support learners’ previous experiences and, in a positive way, become 
a stimulus for learners to accept SR for their own development process.  On the micro level of instructional design, 
the effect of recent experiences in the development process also point to the creation of supportive environments that 
enrich their prior development experiences.

Abstract 
Manufacturing productivity is one of the most significant element that determines the position of a 
manufacturing company. The efficiency of an assembly line directly affects the productivity. A case study 
of lamp production assembly line was conducted in order to develop an improved version of assembly line 
with greater efficiency. This study was carried out by theoretically analyzing the various studies conducted 
previously on assembly line optimization. Process and time study of the current assembly line were 
conducted. Sequel to the data collected, root cause analysis was conducted to identify the cause of the 
problem in the assembly lines. FlexSim was used to simulate current assembly line and the performance 
result was generated. The result was analyzed using lean production review. A Karakuri system was 
implemented to eliminate the non-value added operations. Subsequently, assembly line balancing was 
applied by using 4 different heuristics methods. As a result, 4 versions of improved assembly line were 
developed. Furthermore, 4 versions of improved simulations on assembly line were conducted and the result 
of performance were generated. Lastly, comparison between the current assembly line and 4 versions of 
improved assembly line was conducted and the most productive assembly line was proposed.

1. Introduction
Assembly line is component of a manufacturing plant where succession of identical products is progressively 
assembled. It was first introduced by Henry Ford in 1913 for mass production of automobiles. With high 
manufacturing efficiency and productivity, it completely replaced the traditional manufacturing methods and brought 
an industrial revolution in 19th century. A basic assembly line consists of workstations connected by material handling 
devices. Workstation is a point on an assembly line where a certain amount of the total assembly work is performed. 
Each workstation in an assembly line is assigned with different task(s) or operation(s) and is set up with all necessary 
materials, machines, operators or even robotic arms. The basic process of an assembly line begins with a part being 
fed into the first workstation. After the parts have been received, the first workstation will perform the assigned 
operation(s). Once the operation is completed, the part will be sent to the next station by material handling device and 
the next station will perform assigned operation(s) (Grzechca and Foulds 2015). These processes are repeated until 
the end product is achieved. The time needed to complete an operation at a workstation is called as operation time 
while the time required to complete all operations at the workstation is known as cycle time.  
2. Literature review
2.1 Assembly Line Balancing Problem 
The idea of line balancing was first introduced by Brython (1954). However, the first published work on 
assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) was presented by Salveson (1955). The intention of assembly line balancing 
was to ensure that an assembly line has a satisfied precedence relations and optimized measurements of effectiveness 
(for example, balance delay minimization, line efficiency enhancement, productivity increment and reduction of idle 
time). In the case study of Jamil and Razali (2016), two assembly line improvement layouts have been successfully 
proposed in order to improve the production rate and efficiency.

7. Conclusion and Recommendations  
By implementing the methodology, three objectives of this study were met and achieved. First of all, a root cause 
analysis of the current lamp product assembly line was conducted. It was found that, the assembly line was having 
imbalance workstation time among the workstations. Furthermore, the operators were having uneven work load. These 
are the causes of bottlenecks, idles, blockages, non-processing and low utilization which eventually led to poor 
smoothness index of 108.25 and low line efficiency of 66.56%.  
 
An improved version of assembly line was developed based on the assembly line balancing. Number of 
Predecessor (NOP) improved version assembly line which gained the highest score in Table 4.25 had been selected 
as the proposed assembly line among all the versions. This assembly line consists of three Kakaruri Flow Racks which 
eliminate non value added motion, transportation and waiting.  
 
Lastly, a simulation model of Number of Predecessor (NOP) improved version assembly line was developed 
and simulation had been conducted using FlexSim. The proposed assembly line consists only 6 operators and 
workstations while current assembly line consists of 7 operators and workstations. Furthermore, the assembly line 
performance has been improved. The overall tasks processing and operators’ utilization have been improved by 0.49% 
and 14.41% respectively. On the other hand, the tasks blockage and operators idle percentage have been reduced by 
17% and 13.73% respectively. Besides that, the tasks had been evenly distributed to every operator in every 
workstation after assembly line balancing and results in the overall tasks idle percentage is increased by 7.43%. 
Moreover, the line efficiency is improved by 19.11% (from 66.56% to 85.67%) and the smoothness index has been 
reduced from 108.25 to 46.60. Lastly, the production rate is increased from 32.25 unit per hour to 36.38 unit per hour. 
Therefore, the proposed assembly line is capable of producing 291 units of headlamp in one day of operation. 
 Throughout the research, it was found that there are several studies can be done in the future to further improve the 
assembly line. Firstly, research on cost analysis can be conducted in order to provide an even better and more concrete 
validation of assembly line improvement. This can be done through comparison of expenditures including materials, 
labor and overhead costs between the current and improved version of assembly line. 
 
Furthermore, manufacturing process is one of the most significant element in providing high manufacturing 
efficiency. A well designed manufacturing process is beneficial in several aspects including time, costs and resources 
reduction and ensure high quality of assembly and fabrication. Hence, research on process optimization is highly 
recommended to be conducted. 
Lastly, with the advancement of technology, research on technology 
implementation can be conducted. Technologies such as robotic assembly arm, automated conveying systems, 
automated packing systems, computer-integrated manufacturing or even Artificial Intelligence are capable of being 
adopted in the assembly line as a means of improving the performance of assembly line.

Abstract 
In India, the distribution of warehousing strategies was tax oriented which resulted in underutilization of 
available resources.  With the implementation of the recent uniform and easy to implement Goods and 
Services Tax (GST) policy by the government of India, the country has been transformed into an 
integrated market. Due to this, now the companies are reducing the number of warehouses by 
consolidating their supply chain operations by leasing bigger warehouses which might locate at a central 
location to serve multiple states. The larger warehouses accommodate more varieties of orders that 
needed to be shipped across numerous locations. Storage of this inventories and its correct functioning 
has a significant effect in achieving a higher level of customer satisfaction. The warehouse space 
utilization and method/speed of order picking is one of the most important areas in warehouses operations 
that leads to cost reduction. This study uses Flexsim Simulation software to optimize the transport 
distances of order picking processes in a warehouse located at southern part of India.

Abstract 
Due to high importance of supplier selection in supply chain management issues and also taking into 
consideration the fact that organizations are giving more and more attention to their responsibilities in the 
society; this paper considers supplier selection as a multi-objective decision making problem. It inserts 
social responsibility (SR) parameter into the model and ensures that specification of each supplier’s 
allocated quota from a total order uses such criterion. In supplier selection problem, objectives such as 
cost minimization, quality maximization and on-time delivery maximization have been generally studied. 
In order to effectively consider SR, we also take note of other objectives such as suppliers’ SR 
maximization, distance minimization, etc. Due to its linear dependency property, SR observance by the 
suppliers can lead to higher quality level (products and services) and on-time delivery. Thus the proposed 
approach also incorporates quality and on-time delivery objectives into SR parameter. Furthermore, it 
uses a triangular fuzzy number regarding uncertainty and ambiguity in the SR observance level at the end 
of each period. On top of a mathematical model for a multi-product structure, numerical examples that 
employ fuzzy multi objective decision making method, are presented so as to justify the approach as well 
as its values. 
Keywords: Supply Chain Management, Social Responsibility, Supplier Selection, fuzzy multi objective

1. Introduction
In recent years the concept of SR has been given a significant attention and the issue that for whom or what 
organizations are responsible has become very important. Based on ISO26000 international standard (2010), the 
seven principles of SR can be expressed as: Accountability, Transparency, Ethical behavior, Respect for stakeholder 
interests, Respect for the rule of law, Respect for international norms of behavior and Respect for human rights. The 
core components of SR in this international standard consist of: Organizational governance, Human rights, Labor 
practices, The Environment, Fair operating practices, Consumer issues and Community involvement and 
development. In order to abide by SR, organizations have now social, economical, legal and environmental 
responsibilities on top of their traditional responsibility for their stakeholders. Nowadays supply chain management 
makes a fundamental basis for constitution of businesses in the world. In the global competition, various products 
should be available to customers in terms of their requirements, which are high quality of products and services, on-
time delivery, fair price, observing environmental issues and being respectful to social subjects. This matter now 
leads to more pressure on organizations, something which was less felt in the past, if ever. Considering the complex 
nature of the issue, organizations are now forced to conduct surveillance and management tasks on external 
resources and external partner’s production in addition to their own production and internal resources. It should,

5.2. Solving by Fuzzy Approach Method 
In this approach, equations (19) to (26) are utilized to transform the problem into a multi-objective crisp one and 
solve the problem by min-max method. To carry out the process, each of the objective function is solved by 
LINGO8 without taking other objective functions into consideration. Table (5) shows obtained value of each 
objective function.

Conclusion
In the recent years, supplier selection and evaluation has become one of the most important issues in supply chain 
management and organizations have great concerns about CSR observance. This paper proposed a mathematical 
model that incorporates SR on top of other traditional parameters such as cost minimization, quality maximization, 
on-time delivery maximization, etc. A multi-objective model having six objective functions of cost, quality, on-time 
delivery, utility, SR and distance for suppliers, developed as a linear and integer programming, was presented. 
Selection of suppliers were carried out by minimizing their cost and distance objective functions and maximizing 
their quality, on-time delivery, utility and SR objective functions. Considering the mathematical complexity of the 
proposed model, we also demonstrated the selection process via numerical examples using our two different 
approaches for converting fuzzy numbers into non-fuzzy numbers. Although each conversion approach resulted in a 
different answer, something which is related to the fuzzy nature of the problem, both approaches selected suppliers 
that had higher SR under various states. In summary, this research not only integrated a very important social 
concept for supplier selection and evaluation, i.e., SR observance according ISO26000 standard, but also showed 
that such activity can even help organizations to achieve and maintain their competitive advantage in the market.

Abstract 
Multiattribute control charts have been widely found to be more effective process control than separate 
uniattribute control charts in different applications. Based on an available statistical model which was 
developed for designing multiattribute np (Mnp) chart, in this study we proposed a multiattribute 
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) chart. We also compared the MEWMA chart with 
the optimal version of the (Mnp) chart. The comparison results indicate that the proposed MEWMA chart 
outperforms the Mnp chart by about 65% in terms of the average number of defectives. 
Keywords 
Control chart, Statistical Process Control, Multiattribute EWMA chart, Average number of defectives 
1. Introduction
In most multiattribute processes, it is required to simultaneously control several attribute quality characteristics as 
the quality of a product depends on all of them. The practice is to maintain a separate uniattribute control chart for 
each characteristic. Unfortunately, this practice is neither efficient nor effective. It is more practical and economical 
to use a single multiattribute control chart for such applications. The multiattribute chart provides a summary 
measure of all characteristics and more effective process control than separate uniattribute control charts. Moreover, 
it reduces errors that may result from the testing procedure of the separate uniattribute charts. 
In the literature, while a lot of attention has been paid to multivariate control charts for variables, little work has 
been reported on multiattribute control charts. Lowry and Montgomery (1995) gave a review on control charts for 
multivariate quality control. It is found that a multivariate control chart is more effective in monitoring a 
multivariate process than separate univariate control charts. Moreover, they discussed some topics such as the use of 
principal components and the regression adjustment of variables in multivariate quality control. Lu et al. (1998) 
developed a multiattribute np chart to deal with multiattribute processes. This chart uses the weighted sum of all the 
quality characteristics as the plotted statistics. Jolayemi (1999) developed a multiattribute np chart (abbreviated as 
the Mnp chart in this article) for monitoring independent attribute characteristics. His study revealed that the Mnp 
chart is more cost-effective and more efficient than the ordinary np charts. The dependency between attributes was 
considered in developing some other multiattribute control charts. For example, Limam and Taleb (2003) applied 
Hotelling’s T2 control chart to multiattribute processes. Gadre and Rattihalli (2005) proposed some multiattribute 
control charts based on group inspection to identify process deterioration. Niaki and Abbasi (2007) proposed a 
methodology to monitor high-quality multiattribute processes. Stefatos and Hamza (2008) developed a multivariate 
control chart for fault detection using robust statistics and principal component analysis. Niaki and Abbasi (2008) 
designed a neural network to monitor either the proportions of several types of product nonconformities (instead of 
using several np charts) or the number of different types of defects (instead of using several c charts). Chiu and Kuo 
(2008) constructed a control chart to monitor multivariate Poisson count data. Mukhopadhyay (2008) proposed a 
multiattribute control chart by expanding the concept of “Mahalanobis Distance” and compared its sensitivity with

Figure 1: Normalized ATS of the two Charts in the Example 
 
In this example, in terms of AND, the MEWMA chart reduces the average number of defectives by 65% compared 
with the Mnp chart. The values of the in-control ATS0 (where δ = 1) and out-of-control ATS (where 1 < δ ≤ 8) of the 
two charts are shown in Table 1. The curves of the normalized ATS (i.e., ATS/ATSMEWMA) of the two charts are 
illustrated in Figure 1. It can be observed that the MEWMA chart significantly outperforms the Mnp chart when δ ≤ 
5, while the later slightly outdoes the former for detecting large shifts (when δ > 5).  
 
6. Conclusion 
Due to the fast advancement in technology and high competition in industry, monitoring only one quality 
characteristic is no longer practical. It is required to simultaneously control multiple quality characteristics. There is 
currently an urgent need for the multattribute control charts to provide a summary measure of all quality 
characteristics in a multiattribute process and achieve more effective process control than the separate uniattribute 
charts.  
This article presents a new MEWMA chart for monitoring the multiattribute processes. The MEWMA chart is 
found to outperform the Mnp chart proposed by Jolayemi (1999) in terms of AND. It is more effective than the Mnp 
chart by 65%. The implementation of the MEWMA chart is simple and its optimal charting parameters can be 
straightforwardly determined using a computer program. 
In this article, the studies are conducted based on some assumptions, such as the independency of the attribute 
defects, and the known in-control fraction nonconforming. It is interesting to make a further study in the future to 
see how the MEWMA chart will perform when the attribute characteristics are dependent and there is a correlation 
between them. It is also worthwhile to evaluate the performance of the MEWMA chart when p0 is estimated and d 
follows other distributions rather than the binomial distribution.

Abstract 
In this study, we present an integrated single vendor-buyer inventory model considering deterioration and 
carbon emission simultaneously. We focus on the emissions from warehousing, transport activity as well 
as emission from the disposal of the deteriorated items. A numerical example is developed to illustrate the 
proposed solution procedure. Computational results indicate that by incorporating carbon emissions into 
the integrated inventory model, we can reduce the total carbon emission and slightly reduce the total 
supply chain cost. We also show that the integrated inventory model has significantly reduced the total 
cost and total carbon emissions as compared to the result when the decision is made solely from the 
buyer’s perspective.

1. Introduction
Sustainability is a global issue and has received much attention in supply chain management. Carter & Rodgers 
(2008) examined the relationship among environmental, social, and economic performance in a supply chain. A 
sustainable supply chain is advantageous and lead to economic sustainability. Researchers have investigated many 
aspects of sustainable supply chain, such as sustainable supply chain network design, sustainable supply chain 
planning, sustainable sourcing, etc. As part of sustainable supply chain management, researchers have also studied 
the sustainable inventory management. 
This study developed a new single vendor-buyer integrated inventory model considering deterioration and 
carbon emission simultaneously and examined how the integrated vendor-buyer inventory model reduces the carbon 
emission. We incorporated carbon emission cost into the model based on carbon emission tax mechanism. Carbon 
emission tax is one mechanism commonly used to promote energy efficiency and the reduction of fossil fuel 
combustion (Wahab et al., 2011; Bouchery et al., 2012; Benjaafar et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Hovelaque & 
Bironneau, 2015; Hua et al., 2016). Some countries have implemented this policy and seen some benefits.

5. Conclusion 
 
In this study, we extend the single vendor-buyer integrated inventory model to consider deterioration and carbon 
emission cost. The model extends previous studies by considering carbon emission from warehousing as well as 
transport activities and from the disposal of deteriorated items. The numerical example shows that in an integrated 
supply chain decision, the delivery frequency (n) is smaller and the delivery quantity (Q) is bigger when compared 
with the decision made solely from the buyer’s perspective. The integrated inventory model has significantly 
reduced the total cost and the total carbon emissions. It is also shown that by incorporating emission cost into the 
inventory model decreases the delivery frequency and increases the quantity. Incorporating carbon emission into the 
integrated inventory model will reduce the total carbon emissions and slightly reduce the total supply chain cost. 
Further research can be considered for different backordering situation and different emission control policies.

Abstract 
The objective of this paper is to study the impact of seasonal demand parameters and the lead time of the 
retailer on the variables like order quantity, bullwhip effect and on-hand inventory to elaborate the supply 
chain dynamics. The objectives are achieved through analysis of a simple two echelon supply chain with 
retailer at the lower level and the supplier at the upper level. The time series of the end customer demand 
data exhibit a non-stationary SARIMA process. Through expression of bullwhip effect we show an 
increase in their value due to the presence of seasonal effect and non-stationary in the end customer 
demand. Our results show an increase in the variance of the expressions of both order quantity and on-
hand inventory due to the presence of seasonality in the demand. Further with an increase in the retailer’s 
lead time the bullwhip effect increases with a constant rate till the lead time crosses one season. As the 
lead time crosses one season, the slope suddenly increases. Further when the value of seasonal moving 
average parameter changes from positive to negative value, the bullwhip effect decreases.

1. Introduction
1.1 Overview 
Supply chain of a product consists of manufacturer, retailer and customers called as end customers. These end 
customers place demands of various products to the retailer. The retailer in turn satisfies their demand which varies 
based upon the type of product and the customers in the target market. There are supply chains of some products in 
which the end customer’s demand is seasonal. According to Baron [1] and Hartman [2], the seasonality in demand 
of the product is due to two main factors: natural and institutional. Butler [3] mentions three causes of seasonality as 
social pressure or fashion, sporting season, and inertia or tradition. Due to the seasonal nature of demand, several 
products get deteriorate due to the fact that in some period the sale of these products is low in comparison to other 
time periods. For the case of apparel products, Al-Zubaidi and Tyler [4] describes the following two basic reasons 
for deterioration of the above stated demand. (1) The decreasing shelf life of apparel: the supply system has been 
built around basic goods, i.e. merchandise sold the year round, and (2) the long lead-time: clothing lead-times are 
traditionally long (Mattila et al. [5]).

Abstract 
In recent past, selection of professional institute in India is becoming a strategic issue for a student to get 
higher education in professional courses. Selection of the right institution should be based on multi-
criteria decision-making methods for smart decisions. Five to ten years back, the selection of the 
professional institutions was less strategic in the absence of ordinal data because of less number of 
professional institutes were in India. In this work, for selection of best professional institute among a large 
number of alternatives, we applied multi-criteria decision-making technique with a group of decision 
makers along with ordinal data of given alternatives. Initially, we aggregated the ordinal data of different 
choices with each criterion from the binary programming tool. After that, we have the final rankings of 
various alternatives derived from their group rankings by binary programming along with the criteria 
weights. With an illustrative case of having five decision makers, five professional institutes and three 
criteria named as Placement, Infrastructure and faculty profile we have shown the effectiveness of this 
model.

5. Conclusion 
Recently taking evaluation and selection of professional institute in India is one of the most critical activities for 
students. With the complication and importance of the problem, professional institute selection is a typical MCGDM 
problem, and the group of decision-makers usually give their ordinal preferences of the different alternatives. We 
used an MCGDM methodology based on 0-1 programming for professional institute selection with ordinal data and 
decision makers weights on each criterion. With an illustrative case of a problem, we simulated and found the result 
of the problem, which shows the proposed method is rational, effective and easy to compute.

Abstract 
In the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) collection, the manufacturer can select reverse 
channel strategies between third-party-managed collection (Model 3P) and retailer-managed collection 
(Model R). However, he has to face up with collector’s collection cost information asymmetry (IA), and 
the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies. We first derive, in closed forms, 
the optimal contracts for Model R and 3P, in joint consideration of EPR and IA. Meantime, we find 
complementary effect between IA and EPR. Our subsequent model comparison illustrates how to 
optimally select the mode of business, i.e. Retailer collection or collection by 3rd Party. The former is 
preferred if the manufacturer faces up with stricter EPR policies. If the magnitude of IA is higher, the 
latter would be a better option, because third party collection is less sensitive to IA but more sensitive to 
the EPR policies. Moreover, the presence of IA boosts the retail price and lower the demand due to the 
decrease of collection rate, while the EPR policies have just opposite effects on price and demand. Hence, 
the price, demand and collection rate all depend on the comparison between the magnitude of IA and 
EPR.

1. Introduction
Rapid development of information society and steadily growing consumption of electrical and electronic 
equipment (EEE) worldwide lead to increasing amounts of wasted electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). 
Collection, recycling and remanufacturering for WEEE play a central role in sustain environmental-friendly 
industries. In different regions of the world, e.g., Europe, US, regulations, policies, and collection and recovery 
systems based on extended producer responsibility (EPR) have been implemented. In 2010, China’s National 
Development and Reform Commission (CNDRC) announced that Chinese government will pay special attention to 
the development of remanufacturing industry [1]. Later, China has enacted similar legislations known as China 
WEEE and China RoHS to further direct WEEE collection and remanufacturing [2]. Recently, two types of EPR 
laws has been compared, collective producer responsibility (CPR) or individual producer responsibility (IPR) [3]. Li 
et.al. [4] make a comparison between the two from the perspective of whole supply chain governance.  
In current practice, we find a variety of reverse channel strategies being deployed by manufacturers. A 
commonly seen scenario is that the majority of collecting operations are performed by others. As a representative 
case, Kodak receives single-use cameras returned from its retailers and recycles 76% of them in the manufacturing 
of new ones [5]. Meanwhile, it is also common industry practice to subcontract with a third-party in the operation of 
collection programs. For instance, in Europe, specialized firms are subcontracted by Dell Corporation to collect used 
computer equipment [6]. In China, Apple sponsors an independent recycling firm, named Li Tong Recycle, for 
collecting the used Apple branded electronic products and equipment [7]. The Kodak case could be referred as 
retailer-managed collection, while the practices of Dell and Apple can be termed as third-party managed collection. 
To make collection more accessible, traditional offline-recycling channel has been transformed into online recycling 
channel (refer to www.aihuishou.com) [8]. In practice, Changhong Green Group Company Limited has collected

In addition, IA and EPR have the strong complementary effect. Actually, there exist the threshold of both IA and 
EPR to be referred when the manufacturer chooses the reverse channel strategy. For instance, the line in Figure 4(a) 
is the EPR threshold which divides the figure into two parts. Above the line, retailer-managed collection is dominant; 
otherwise, 3P-managed collection is preferred. Figure 4(a) shows the effect of IA on the EPR threshold. In some 
range, EPR threshold,
0
, increases in . It implies that retailer-managed collection could be preferred under the 
stricter EPR policies with the increase of information uncertainty. This indirectly indicates higher information 
uncertainty is beneficial to 3P-managed collection. Likewise, as is shown in Figure 4(b), IA threshold,
0
, also 
increases in.  
 
5. Conclusions 
    
 To investigate how to collect the used products in the reverse channel, this paper studies mode selection 
problems between 3P-managed collection (Model 3P) and retailer-managed collection (Model R) under both 
extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies and information asymmetry (IA). The main drivers for mode 
selection include: (i) EPR policies, which sets a minimum collection rate for the used product, and (ii) IA regarding 
the collection cost, in which the precise collection cost is not known by the manufacturer. More specifically, our 
model yields the following conclusions. 
First, information asymmetry would boost the retail price and lower the demand due to the decrease of 
collection rate, while the EPR policies have exactly inverse effects on price and demand with increasing collection 
rate. Hence, the price, demand and collection rate all depend on the comparison between the magnitude of IA and 
EPR. Specifically, if IA exceeds some critical level, retailer-managed collection is no longer preferred from the 
aspect of collection rate. 
    Second, both IA and EPR help collectors cumulate higher information rent. Note that retailer’s information rent 
is always higher than that of 3P without the EPR policies. Meanwhile, both information rent can be identical under 
EPR policies. As such, the presence of EPR policies adds advantage to Model 3P. 
Third, on the contrary, from the manufacturer’s standpoint, if he faces up with stricter EPR policies, Model R is 
preferred; on the other hand, if he has to bear higher risk due to asymmetric information, 3P-managed collection 
should be a better option. This stems from the fact that 3P-managed collection is less sensitive to IA while being 
more sensitive to the EPR policies. Compared to Model 3P, Model R, when selected by the manufacturer, lowers the 
retail price and raises the demand. 
Finally, EPR policies and IA have complementary effect. Consequently, if the manufacturer faces up with a 
stricter EPR policy, he has to pick a more familiar collector, since lower magnitude of IA could save his more profit. 
Similarly, if the manufacturer is obliged to bear higher risk of information asymmetry, he has to seek for 
environments with weaker EPR policy for his business. Second, When IA scales up, it requires more EPR regulation 
for a manufacturer to switch to retailer-managed collection mode. When the EPR policy becomes tougher, the 
critical level of IA that shifts the business mode from retailer-managed to 3P-managed collection becomes increased 
    Three extensions to our research are worth investigation. First, the manufacturer can utilize the newly emerged 
collective producer responsibility (CPR) to support its collectors. Second, another extension could consider different 
cost settings (for example, 3P-managed collection has a cost advantage to retailer collection), or different proximity 
to the consumer (for example, retailer has more knowledge of the end market). At last, apart from the profits of 
supply chain entities (information rent and manufacturer’s profit), the environmental impact (e.g. measured by 
carbon emission) caused by the two business modes (namely, retailer collection and 3rd party collection) can also be 
studied in contrast.

Abstract 
A diversity of sources of literature concerning the supply chain management strategies necessitates a 
systematic procedure in food processing industry. As such, when scoping out a concept, the structured 
literature review (SLR) can be considered as a means of highlighting the key principles, bottlenecks and 
management strategies being followed by leading organizations. This paper reports an SLR of food supply 
chain (FSC) practices. Authors selected the relevant literature of the food processing industry with reference 
to supply chain subjects such as performance analysis, food safety, logistics and transportation practices, 
traceability, information system and decision-making strategies. An SLR methodology has been employed in 
this paper to find out the relations, conflict and research gaps in literature concerning FSC practices. Findings 
of paper show that the higher competence in FSC can be achieved through food safety and security, high 
product quality, on-time delivery of products, and better order-fill-rate.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management (SCM) is an integrated approach for managing the product flow of a distribution channel from 
producer to end consumer, whereas, the food supply chain (FSC) is considered as a composite network of many entities 
linked from ‘farm to fork’. Nahmias (1982) described the perishable food supply chain as those that undergo change in 
storage so that in time and become partially or entirely unfit for consumption. Perishable products makes a unique 
situation for how a supply chain needs to be designed so as to properly schedule and deliver the products in a timely 
manner. Shortening lead times has shown to reduce work in progress and inventory as well as to improve responsiveness 
and flexibility in logistics (Persson, 1991). Strategically, rather than competing within the low-cost market segment, 
many food producers are working on different marketing strategies to target the rural market. This has led the industries 
to implement a range of sustainable practices like local sourcing, reuse, recycling, and green purchasing (Mor et al., 
2016). Thus, the industries competing and cooperating in such supply chain practices have to deal with several risk 
sources that have to be properly managed when planning their activities. Food processing industries in such case have 
observed vast changes in their structures like market globalization, technology improvement, smaller lifetime of products 
and diversification of customer demand (Lindgreen and Hingley, 2003; Fattahi et al., 2013). Dairy industry needs 
significant development in their competitiveness status so as to meet the high quality, consistency and safety standards of 
the export market (Bhardwaj et al., 2016). 
   The growing concern over food security, growing interest in traceability, freshness and quality combined with 
highly perishable nature of products require attention when choosing SC strategy. The Juran’s problem solving technique 
and lean tools can help in the eradication of the causes of poor-productivity irrespective of the type of industry (Rahul 
and Kaler, 2013). Food processing sector have to deal with the government policies, customer demands & shareholders’ 
interests and reduced costs, wastage reduction and integration in all processes are the fundamentals of their success. Each 
stakeholder in SC must intend to turn out in a dynamic and competitive way for sustainable business operations (Mor et 
al., 2015). On the other hand, perishable food industries need to provide products as fast as they can to maintain their 
competitive advantages. Varied characteristics of this type of industry including the need for short time distribution 
between producer and retailer makes it challenging to establish a unique way of managing supply chains in this context 
(Bourlakis and Weightman, 2004). Quality management appears to be the most important factor in dairy industry 
followed by inventory management, supplier management and technological innovations (Mor et al., 2017). 
Thus, first aim of this paper to explore the key supply chain management strategies in food industry. Second, 
aim of this paper is to fill the research gap in literature. The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the

4. Discussion
This paper provides a summary of studies published recently in the area of SCM practices in food processing sector. One 
of the qualities of this paper is the theoretical framework used. The reviewed articles present a sound hypothesis base for 
various SCM subjects. The conceptual framework established to classify the selected articles show that about 46% 
articles framed SCM as a process, 20% as a system approach, 8% as a management activity, and rest as a business 
strategy. Out of the reviewed articles, about 95% articles are related to food processing industry. Further, the researchers 
like Mor et al. (2015; 2016; 2017), Bhardwaj et al. (2016), Sharma et al. (2017) etc. have explored the issues of high 
wastages and inefficiencies in food processing sector. 
5. Conclusions
This paper starts with filling the gap in literature by considering the articles published in various database in the research 
area of supply chain management practices in food processing industry. The reviewed articles were analyzed through a 
structured literature review approach. Studies are reviewed for objective(s), year of publication, findings, conclusion, and 
research gap for respective article. The comprehensive literature review show that the the higher competence in food 
supply chain can be achieved through food safety and security, high product quality, on-time delivery of products, and 
better order-fill-rate. In conclusion, the research methods revealed in the reviewed articles can also assist the dairy 
industry sector to achieve a high level of competitiveness and leanness. 
5.1 Limitations and Future Scope 
The current paper has some limitations that authors might want to recognize. The principal restriction is the arrangement 
of selected papers. Authors recognize that there can be numerous different approaches to sort the articles. Such an 
examination can be applied to other organizations so as to bring out the key supply chain management strategies 
irrespective of the types or sector.

Abstract 
The global trend of urbanization has important consequences on society and the environment in urban areas. 
Growing population, scarcity of resources and rising freight transport in urban areas result in completely 
overloaded infrastructures. The ""last-mile"" delivery in the city is considered to be particularly complex and 
occurs in most cases not comprehensively structured. The consequences are far-reaching environmental 
problems, noise pollution and a general reduction in the quality of life in the city. Therefore, in the field of 
urban logistics is a great potential for optimization. The subject of this article is a logistics shared-resources 
approach for a structured, organized and bundled supply in urban areas.

1. Introduction
The problems caused by an increasing urbanization in connection with the increasing freight traffic require new 
models of intervention and of city logistics. Innovative and modern logistical approaches for urban logistics have to 
be developed in order to be able to handle the supply and disposal processes in the urban areas more efficiently. One 
way to do that is through bundled logistics, whereby an urban space is supplied by holistically planned delivery and 
disposal processes. In doing so, the widely accepted principle of small individual deliveries is to be substituted and 
replaced by bundling of orders by type of goods and delivery zone combined with environmentally friendly means of 
transport. Through the integration and development of such new structures, economic aspects for the individual as 
well as social characteristics have to be considered in addition to environmental benefits for society as a whole. The 
presented concepts are intended to contribute to possible efficiency improvements in all these areas. In order to 
maintain the sustainable prosperity of the urban areas, it will be important in the future to drive existing and innovative 
technologies together with a more intensive cooperation between the city and companies [1]. 
This article first describes in a short theoretical background the current trends and challenges of urban logistics in 
order to give an overview of the actual state of art. Further it describes the actual problems in urban supply and disposal 
logistics. In the main part of this paper, the concept of shared resources for city logistics is presented in order to 
increase sustainability of transport in urban areas. Traditional and shared resource approaches in city logistics are 
compared showing typically unstructured and chaotic flows of goods in the city and introducing new and innovative 
shared resource approaches for city logistics. After this introduction into the concept of shared resources the authors

and the use of vehicles with low emissions. The privately operated transshipment warehouse did not require continuous 
investment from the public sector paying for itself.  
The measures for the initial implementation were the following: 
 
Selection process (tendering) of an operator for the operation of the warehouse 
 
Location analysis with main criteria (i) space and (ii) connection to the city transport network 
 
Measures to show the attractiveness of the transshipment warehouse for customers 
 
After a careful selection process, the project was carried out in cooperation with the logistics service provider ""Foulger 
Transport"". Goods suppliers to the urban area now have the option to supply the transshipment warehouse instead of 
their end customers in the city center and thereby saving not only time, but also a considerable effort for coordination 
for urban supply. The service provider tries to bundle deliveries to the city center and thus increases the efficiency of 
the last-mile traffic. Initially, it was difficult to convince suppliers of the concept, but this could be overcome through 
an experienced satisfaction with the service provided. The delivery process has been converted over time to smaller 
means of transport. A high increase of efficiency could be achieved being allowed to use the bus lane now for freight 
traffic. In an initial test phase, all environmentally friendly vehicles that supplied the city with goods were allowed to 
use the prioritized lane. Later this was limited to transport vehicles from the transshipment warehouse in order to 
provide the desired time savings and fluidity in traffic. Attractiveness of working with the suppliers' transshipment 
warehouse increased and the prioritized lane achieved significant time savings (average 4 minutes per 25 minutes of 
transport) and reduced fuel consumption as well as emissions in delivery due to smoother traffic.

5. Conclusion and outlook 
 
The global megatrend of urbanization is advancing persistently. The consequences of the strong increase of population 
in urban areas are manifold, and especially the steeply rising traffic volume is a major problem. First and foremost, 
the quality of life of urban residents suffers from these problems. The currently chaotic situation of urban supply and 
disposal should be regarded as an opportunity for the development of urban logistics. Various constraints and the 
enormous variety of influencing factors and actors make the logistic planning on the ""last mile"" a complex undertaking. 
The focus is usually not on the overall system ""city"". The prerequisite for the implementation of the presented 
structural forms is the fulfillment of sustainability in all its three dimensions. The efficiency of the shared resource 
approach is positively influenced by scale effects, better utilization of the means of transport and better coordination 
of the flow of goods. In addition to a reduction in the consumption of resources as well as transport costs, the quality 
of life for residents in the city should also increase. In the future, the planning of urban logistics will play a key role 
in urban development in order to combine goals such as economic growth, environmental protection and quality of 
life. We will look at the entire system, which requires close cooperation between the parties involved. The 
development of society, increased energy costs, stricter environmental conditions and the growing spread of 
innovative information and communication technology will contribute to the city's improvement in all areas.

Abstract 
This paper explores several aspects of municipal water utilities (MWUs) operations across regions and 
economies of scale. It involves a case study consisting of 60 MWUs from all over Indonesia. The 
modeling is done to explain the influence of the region and a large number of customers on the operating 
indicators covering efficiency, water loss rate, tariff, employee expense, and non-operational cost, and 
financial indicator in the form of company's profit. The first and second models simulate the conditions 
between Java and outside Java, and Western Indonesia and Eastern Indonesia. The third to six models 
accommodate the economies of scale by the number of customers of less than 20,000, between 20,001 
and 50,000, between 50,001 and 100,000, and above 100,000. The parametric statistical test is also 
performed to support the modeling. Impressive things can be found from the characteristics and problems 
of each model. The results are MWUs in Java and which have a number of customers above 100,000 are 
the best example.

Abstract 
Supplier selection becomes an important factor in the supply chain in a company. Basically, the supplier 
selection process is choosing the best supplier alternative among other suppliers. By choosing the right 
supplier will provide added value for the company than the competitor company, because the needs of the 
company are met well. Companies with good supplier selection and evaluation systems will influence the 
credibility of the selected suppliers. In this research, supplier selection process focused on supplier 
selection for spare part of technical goods. The criteria used for supplier selection not only consider 
quantitative and qualitative factors, but also subjective and objective factors. This factor is used to help 
the procurement department overcome the problems that have been faced, namely the uncertainty of 
inventory of goods from suppliers. Analytic Hierarchy Process Method (AHP) is used to help decision 
makers choose the best suppliers among other suppliers. Based on the results of tests conducted, AHP 
method can perform a fairly good calculation in choosing the best supplier alternative.

1. Introduction
Today, industry competition is very tight with many new companies emerging and growing consumer 
demands. According to Kilincci & Onal (2011), SCM (Supply Chain Management) is a process for integrating 
material procurement activities, converting materials into semi-finished goods and finished goods, to delivering 
finished goods to consumers. One of the most important SCM processes is procurement. 
Procurement is the process of obtaining goods or services that are useful to ensure the smoothness of 
production and logistics processes in a company. The procurement process is a vital process in SCM because it is 
the spearhead of the whole process. The purpose of procurement activities is to help identify products and 
services that can be obtained externally. In addition, other objectives of the procurement activities are to develop, 
evaluate, and determine the best supplier, price, quality and delivery for the goods or services. In conducting the 
procurement process, very often the problem occurs in supplier selection activities. This is because the supplier 
selection process spends a lot of time and resources on collecting data and conducting careful analysis of the 
various positive and negative factors that will affect all decision alternatives (Avila et.al., 2012). Therefore, 
methods that can be used to assist the supplier selection process are needed. Supplier selection needs to take into 
account many criteria, therefore the supplier evaluation process requires a multi-criteria approach in the analysis 
and solution search (Buyukozkan & Cifci, 2011).

5. Conclusion
Based on the processing and data analysis that has been done in the previous section then the conclusion that can
be taken is to determine supplier B as the best supplier. It can be known with the highest end value in the final
calculation of AHP is the value of 0.3986. The next priority is supplier A with a weight value of 0.3172 and the
last priority is supplier C with a weight value of 0.2842.
For further research, researchers can use other criteria that are in accordance with the policy by considering the
case at hand. In addition, to reduce the subjective subjectivity of respondents, especially to reduce the
uncertainty of respondents in mapping their perceptions into numerical numbers, researchers can use the AHP
fuzzy method.

Abstract 
The perceived risk is found to be a barrier for e-commerce application. It has been widely demonstrated in 
previous studies that the e-commerce is closely related with risk assessment. With regard to the rapid 
growth of e-commerce, there is no formal model which shows supply chain risk in the e-commerce 
system, regarded as the research gap. This study is conducted to develop a framework about SCRM in the 
e-commerce area. The SCRM framework is developed incorporating 8 perceived risk model in e-
commerce: such as financial, social, time, performance, physical, privacy, security, and psychological risk
into the performance indicator model in e-commerce: such as competence, integrity, and benevolence.
The expected contribution in theory is discussed.

1. Introduction
At the moment, global competition is tight and supply chain be continues to be long and more complex 
(Tummala & Schoenherr, 2011). Not achieving the desired supply chain performance is expected to increase, 
especially because the risks. Supply chain risk can be defined as an explanation in terms of the causes of 
abnormality that affect the management of the supply chain efficiently (Ghadge et al., 2012 ).Companies are 
important to adapt the strategy of abnormalities especially on their network. Risk involved in supply chain as well as 
the relative the damage can be seen from the recalls and lawsuits for car toy (Story, 2007 ), animal food (FDA, 
2008), and recently withdrawal one of the Samsung’s products in 2016.  
According Djojosoedarso (2003) risk management is the implementation of management functions in risk 
reduction, especially the risks faced by organizations / companies, family and social. Its management functions 
include planning, organizing, composing, leading, and overseeing (including evaluating) risk reduction programs. 
Risk management identifies processes, establishes risks, and shapes strategies for managing them through existing 
resources. Strategies that can be used include: transferring risk to others, avoiding risks, mitigating adverse effects of 
risk, and accepting some or all consequences of certain risks. Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is an 
integrated concept between supply chain and risk management where collaboration between supply chain partners in

5. Conclusions and Further research 
This study shows how perceived risk as e-commerce barrier can have an effect on e-commerce 
performance. E-commerce performance is assess from consumer trust. It is obvious that consumers would have to 
look for evidence of the quality in means other than the physical inspection of the goods on offer to gain trust. In this 
aspect, perceived risk as e-commerce barrier is given particular attention. E-commerce Performance Indicators 
consist of 3 constructs: competence, integrity, and benevolence and there are 9 indicators for measuring those 
constructs; 3 indicators to measure competence constructs, 3 indicators to measure integrity contructs, and 3 
indicators to measure benevolence constructs. For future research suggestion, the model should be tested empirically 
in case study. The empirical can be done by spreading the questionnaire to customer ask factors within the model 
and relate the construction through SEM analysis. Variety of methodologies and development on the relationship 
between SCRM and e-commerce is expected.

Abstract 
In Japan, administrative divisions are classified in 47 prefectures. Among them, there are 8 prefectures 
with “inland prefecture” that isn’t facing the sea. These inland prefectures are considered to have different 
properties from “coastal prefecture” that is facing the sea. Therefore, in this study, we quantitatively 
analyze the influence of the following factors on value of manufactured goods shipments of “inland 
prefecture” and “coastal prefecture”, based on our previous studies. These factors are population, area, 
value of forestry goods shipments, value of fishery goods shipments, presence of ordinance designated 
city, before and after the collapse of the bubble, before and after the Lehman shock, and so on. This 
analysis model is characterized by handling time series quantitative data and qualitative data. 
In this study, we validate the model by conducting empirical analysis model using time series data. 
Furthermore, we will try to quantitatively grasp the common points and differences of the industrial 
structure between inland prefecture and coastal prefecture based on estimates of parameters obtained from 
such empirical analysis. Furthermore, we will consider expanding application of our analysis model not 
only to domestic data but also to overseas data.

population, also have the ordinance designated cities, and the values of the parameters of this proposed model are in 
conformity with the reality. 
On the other hand, the area parameter a2 has a negative influence on the industrial shipment value. In Japan, the 
prefecture with a large area such as Iwate prefecture, Fukushima prefecture, Nagano prefecture, Niigata prefecture 
and Kagoshima prefecture has a relatively high reliance on primary industries such as agriculture and forestry, 
compared to other prefectures with small area. The proposed model seems to reflect these points. Also, the largest 
area Hokkaido has large industrial shipment value with primary industry. In other words, Hokkaido is also popular 
in Sapporo city, the ordinance designated city, and secondary industries are also popular and have different 
characteristics from other prefectures with a large area. 
Next, parameters a4 before a collapse of the bubble economy and before the Lehman shock are negative, and a5 is 
a positive value. This proposed model shows interesting results that the price, price decline of the stock price and 
land price had a bad influence on the Japanese economy before and after the collapse of the bubble economy. But 
the fluctuation of industrial shipment value is small (stock price collapsed about 50% decline was recorded one year 
after). 
   Parameters b61 and b62 that are the weight of agricultural shipment value in inland prefectures and coastal 
prefectures are positive values. It seems that this result seems to be caused by the fact that agriculture is actively 
performed even in many coastal prefectures. On the other hand, parameter b62, the weight of the forestry shipment 
value is a plus value and the weight of the parameter b72 is a minus value. From this result, it can be seen that in 
inland prefecture, the forestry shipment value is positive relative to the industrial shipment value, and in the coastal 
prefecture, it works minus. In other words, the proposed model suggests a trade-off between forestry and industrial 
in coastal prefecture, which is in line with the reality. In this respect, the proposed model seems to reflect the 
differences between inland prefecture and coastal prefecture.

7. Conclusion
In this research, based on the previous study, the industrial shipment value of “coastal prefecture” and “inland 
prefecture” in Japan is estimated from factors such as population, area, existence of ordinance designated city, 
before and after the collapse of the bubble, before and after the Lehman shock. Furthermore, empirical analysis of 
the proposed model using panel data from 1986 to 2012 was conducted, and multiple correlation coefficient R = 
0.805 could be obtained. In addition, the proposed model has common explanatory variables of all prefectures and 
explanatory variables by inland prefecture and coastal prefecture. In this point as well, we can grasp the common 
point for industrial shipment value and the difference in industrial structure between coastal prefecture and inland 
prefecture, based on the estimated values of parameters obtained from empirical analysis.

Abstract 
Government buildings require repair to extend the life of the building so that services to the community 
can be indirectly met. The budget is issued annually by the government to maintain the building, but in 
carrying out repair there is no Quality Management System which is the basis repair of government 
buildings. This study aims to develop a Quality Management System Risk-Based in the planning process 
on repair in Government Building. Research method used in this research is Delphi method and 
respondent survey. The most dominant risk variables selected using questioner and analyzed SPSS. The 
results of the study is Standard Operation Procedures can improve the quality and performance of 
building function in the management of repair planning in buildings with renewable methods.

Introduction
Based on the Regulation of the Minister of Public Works No. 45 of 2007, the building of the 
state's office shall be the building for the executive office which shall become a state-owned 
property whose financing shall be derived from the State Budget or its lawful entity. Government 
buildings require repair to extend the age of the building so that the service to the community is 
indirectly fulfilled. Based on PERMENPU no 24/2008, the repair of the building is an activity to 
maintain the reliability of the building and its infrastructure and facilities so that the building is 
always functional while The repair of the building is the activity of repairing / replacing parts of 
buildings, components, building materials, and / or the building remains functional. Building 
repair activities are intended to ensure and maintain the condition of the building, along with the 
elements, materials and equipment used in the building in order to function as planned and to 
guard against the damaging effects to reach or exceed the designated age of the plan and to 
provide more value, building quality as well as security for users (Wimala, Mia 2000).

4. Discussion 
4.1  Organizational Forms and Job Descriptions 
This research has the first and second objective to know the organizational form and job description from the Stage 
of Planning Repair at Government Institution X. The form of organization and job description from the 
implementation and supervision of the building of this government building has changed from the form of 
organization and the role of the existing as set forth in Regulation of the General Secretariat No. 6 of 2015. Where 
the main responsible person is at the Bureau of State Property Management of the government institution. In this 
field there is Administration Section which carry out administrative activities related to State Property Management 
Bureau, Building and Garden Section which carries out the management of building and landscaping, Installation 
Section carrying out the operation and repair of installation, and Section of homestead and home office which carries 
out the management of the house and house position. There is also a Building sub-section that manages the building, 
Garden Subdivision that manages landscaping, Mechanical Subdivision that manages the implementation and repair 
of mechanical, Electrical Subdivision that manages the implementation and repair of electrical. 
4.2 Process Busniss 
After knowing the form of organization and jobdesk, the third research objective is to know what business processes 
are done in the phase of planning repair of government building x. The business process is a key element in ensuring 
project outcomes in accordance with specified requirements (Zhang, Waszink, & Wijngaard, 2000). Based on the 
findings, there are 5 (five) business processes in performing repair planning of government buildings. Where 
business process is a collection of activities that produce useful / valuable output (Michael & Champy, 1993). At the 
budget planning stage of repair planning, self-managed planning, planning selection of implementing consultant 
service providers with public auction method for the selection process of contractor executor with auction value 
above 5 billion rupiah, second business process is implementation selection of implementing consultant service 
provider with simple auction method for process selection of contractor with auction value of between 200 million 
and 5 billion rupiah, the third business process is the implementation of selection of implementing consultant 
services providers by direct selection method for the process of selecting contractor services with a value below 200 
million rupiah. 
4.3 The purpose of the fourth study is to know what activities are carried out in each business process. Based on the 
findings, there were 46 (forty six) activities at the Planning stage. In the planning repair of Government Building 
there are 5 (five) business processes, namely (1) Budget planning with 9 (nine) activities that start from making the 
work plan to be the ceiling. (2) Self-managed planning with 11 (eleven) activities starting from the task warrant to 
the inspection of planning results. (3) Selection of Provider of direct procurement consultation services with 5 (five) 
activities starting from the making of KAK to auctioning of documents to ULP, (4) Implementation of Selection of

4.4 Highest Risk Factors 
The purpose of this risk stages research is to know the highest risk factors / events that occur in the Planning Repair 
Building Government Institution X. Therefore it is necessary to identify the risks of the activities that affect the 
quality. Of the 46 activities identified  76 possible risk events. Furthermore the risks of identification results are 
taken to the expert for the Pilot Survey. Then carried out the distribution of questionnaires to respondents to perform 
the assessment of Frequency and Risk Impact. The result is test analysis with SPSS application, and conducted 
qualitative risk analysis. Where the value risko with high risk, moderate risk, and low risk. There were 6 highest risk 
events consisting of 5 high risk and 1 moderate risk. 
4.5 QMS 
After the risk analysis of preventive and corrective actions against the 6 highest risks obtained QMS development is 
the addition of 1 activity and 11 work instructions. So the total of the main data that is there are 47 activities and 106 
work instruction risk-based. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Results from QMS Development in the Government Building Planning Repair stage are SOP and 
WI based on risks by identifying the activities necessary to eliminate events and possible impacts

that may derail the performance objectives of the treatment especially for the related function. 
The activity resulting from the risk response is a risk-prevention measure that could be the basis 
for developing QMS. From the analysis and final validation of experts there are some changes 
and additions from the existing data. In the organizational structure there is a change of structure 
caused by uneven role and responsibility in every function. Then five business processes are 
drawn up based on laws and benchmarks against other government agencies and details of 
related activities. In each activity analyzed the possibility of the occurrence of risk or negative 
impact that can thwart the quality of planning objectives of government building institution X. 
The results of the analysis in the form of responses obtained from expert judgment and then into 
additional activities and the addition of work instructions. Thus, the final result is obtained 5 
SOP with 47 activities and 106 work instructions risk-based that can be implemented into the 
planning of the government building institution X.

Abstract 
Using 128 capital projects and a longitudinal design, this study finds a correlation between performance 
variables in the project-initiating and planning phases and project outcomes in the closing phase. 
Specifically, this study's structural model suggests that team and risk performance prior to project 
execution have a direct positive effect on project outcomes in the closing phase. Subsequent analyses 
show that team and communication performance prior to project execution possess the largest and 
second-largest effects on project outcomes, respectively. Our findings extend the current state of 
knowledge concerning not only the relationships among performance variables prior to project execution, 
but how these performance variables affect project outcomes in the closing phase.

1. Introduction
Successful project management largely depends on identifying the critical determinants of project 
performance (Chen, 2013), and extensive research examines and identifies a wide variety of measures that 
describe or affect performance (e.g., Hoang and Rothaermel, 2005; Keller, 1994; Schippers et al., 2014). 
Some studies focus on the importance of the execution phase on project-management performance and 
identify the critical factors associated with that phase (e.g., Hoegl and Parboteeah, 2007; Keller, 1994; 
Tabassi and Bakar, 2009). Others emphasize the overall project life cycle (e.g., El-Sayegh, 2008; Ling et 
al., 2009; Oke and Idiagbon-Oke, 2010, Scott-Young and Samson, 2008). 
Despite the panoply of studies into which factors affect project performance (e.g., El-Sayegh, 2008; 
Oke and Idiagbon-Oke, 2010; Scott-Young and Samson, 2008), most studies (e.g., Haas, 2006; Keller, 
1994; Ling et al., 2009; Schwab and Anne, 2008) focus on describing project performance and the input 
characteristics that affect the performance. Few investigate structrual causal relationships among 
performance variables and, hence, with project outcomes. 
Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a structural model that provides quantitative 
assessment of project-management performance’ impacts on project outcomes. The rest of the paper is 
organized as follows. “Research background” reviews related studies, “Hypotheses” delineates the test 
hypotheses, “Research methodology” describes the sample collection and presents the research 
methodology, and “Research results” depicts the statistical tests and model building. “Discussions” 
discusses the implications of the research results. “Conclusion” presents the research summary and 
conclusions. 
2. Research Background
A central task in the study of project management is to identify the critical determinants of project 
performance. Questions regarding how to manage critical issues scientifically and thus enhance project 
performance take center stage in the research (Chen, 2013). Not surprisingly, numerous scholars and

Abstract 
Similar to chaos, entropy and anarchy are known phenomenon in industrial engineering and management 
systems sciences. Dealing with those, also has been studied before. The result of this article emphasizes 
on responding to those management shortcomings issues, which are not described by entropy, anarchy or 
chaos theories. Amorphous, however, duly addresses those shortcomings. A process running in the 
amorphous might result in an output, which is different from that originally envisaged by the system. In 
such a case, the output cannot be categorized within entropy, anarchy or chaos theories because the 
output, despite being other than what was expected would be a useful and practical in nature. 
This paper shows how this new phenomenon was studied in training departments of professional 
organizations after training. Therefore, how amorphous can be identified taking into consideration the 
final evaluations of trainees and how, through managing the amorphous output, the training processes and 
outputs can be turned to useful outcome. 
The results of the present research express different standpoints organizations take in treating and 
managing effects of amorphous phenomena in education.  
It is hoped that the current work be the beginning of the forward and positive stream toward recognition 
and managing this new issue and be a help to industrial engineering and management Systems sciences.

1. Literature review:
The theory of anarchy explains a mathematical phenomenon which studies the behaviour of dynamic systems that 
are deeply sensitive to their first conditions [1] and inside them we can’t point to any specific rules. Theories like 
butterfly effect which is a metaphor of a beginning of a storm that the cause of it is a butterfly flapping in faraway 
[2]. Bullwhip effect theory also point to this [3]. 
Although there is no special formulization for this phenomenon, what are mentioned to be used in dynamic systems, 
are sensitivity to the primary conditions of the system and complexity of that. Anarchy in simple words can indicate 
the lacking of rules and laws.  
The theory of entropy is inspired by the laws of nature like other meta-heuristic theories. Entropy theory in general 
means that there is a specific rule or law to do the works and processes, but by any reason they are not followed [4]. 
This issue is precisely like the entropy between atoms in physics. In fact, there is a law to keep atoms together but 
sometimes rules are not persuading by them [5].

According to the Amorphous, there are two points available: 
• 
Recognition of Amorphous gives the chance that in different ways, we review the teaching process and 
evaluate it in order to reach the set goals in the system. 
• 
After recognition of Amorphous, we manage the output in order to use the most of it in the system. 
 
It seems that by recognizing the amorphous in this case, we could consider the correction of process and available 
system, besides we could think of managing it and utilization of it. 
What is clear in organization entropy there is lack of obeying rules. The rules which are set in any way for any 
reason, but are not followed. 
In anarchy the problem is a bit different and the negative point is that there is no rule at all. This means that there is 
no specific rule for the system to follow and reach its goals. 
But in amorphous there are rules and law (so this is different from anarchy) and also there is obeying the law (so this 
is not entropy either). 
Matrix management: 
In organizations in which the management technique is matrix-like and one section simultaneously follows two or 
more managers; because there are possible distinctions inside that organization, amorphous may occur. This is 
possible that the first management section sets some rules which are against rules from the second section. As a 
result, the probability of Amorphous exists.  
4. Conclusion: 
What can be extracted from this research are how to recognize the disfigurement in instruction process and after that 
how to act with that. Therefore, if this event is recognized, it seems that the best way and the cheapest condition for 
the organization is to interact with the problem; so in this way without any reforming, the output can be used in 
some way. Using this viewpoint if we see some situations that some groups are accidentally entered department 
vacancies, we will be able to manage them. Then for the future investigations it is recommended that after 
understanding this event in system and working on the output, review and corrects the process and gives some 
solutions for that.

Abstract 
This paper investigates coordination in a supply chain with contracts under bilateral asymmetric 
information. We study wholesale price, buy-back, revenue share, quantity discount and quantity flexibility 
contracts. Addressing how to allocate the total supply chain profit between retailer and supplier according 
to their advantages of information, we establish the bridge, transfer payment scheme, connecting the 
centralized solution and decentralized solution. In particular, all contracts are shown to coordinate the 
supply chain under bilateral asymmetric information except the wholesale price contract. Results are 
illustrated with numerical examples.

1. Introduction
Supply chain performance might be suboptimal owing to the different and usually conflicting objectives that 
the supply chain members attempt to optimize. Classic double marginalization problem takes place. To improve the 
coordination, designing what kind of contracts such that each member's objective becomes aligned with the supply 
chain's objective is attractive. Clearly, the standard wholesale price contract cannot achieve the coordination.  
     This paper explores supply chain coordination with contracts under two-sided incomplete information. We first 
study the model under complete information as a benchmark. All parties know all parameters and distributions of 
market demand and production cost. Furthermore, they also know that others know this as well. Beyond questions, no 
coordination can be achieved with the contracts based on a single mechanism. Furthermore, the supplier and the 
retailer enter a Stackelberg game in which the supplier acts as the leader and the retailer acts as the follower. We 
assume the following order of events: the suppler offers the retailer a take-it-or-leave-it contract; if the retailer agrees 
with the terms of the contract, the retailer submits an order quantity q to the supplier; the supplier produces and delivers 
to the retailer; demand is realized; transfer payments are made and profits are collected. Otherwise, the game ends and 
each firm earn a default payoff. 
     Our article contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, ours is the first to research on supply chain 
coordination with contracts under bilateral asymmetric information which is commonly observed in practice. Second, 
we have analytically obtained how to allocate the total supply chain profit between the retailer and the supplier 
according to their advantage of information. Third, we have established the bridge, transfer payment scheme, 
connecting the centralized solution and the decentralized solution. Finally, we examine whether coordination can be 
achieved with contracts based on a single policy under our setting. Consequently, wholesale price contracts lead to 
double marginalization while other five contracts can coordinate the supply chain under bilateral asymmetric

5. Managerial insights and conclusions 
 
To improve the coordination between the supplier and the retailer, there are increasing interests in examining 
various types of supply chain contracts to achieve channel coordination as well as win–win situations for each partner 
of the chain. Since contracts based on a single policy, e.g. returns, quantity discounts, revenue sharing, rebates, fail to 
coordinate the chain, scholars attempt several approach. Beyond question, it is a better method to consider the 
composite contracts. Varying the setting is another good choice. On the one hand, modifying the supplier-retailer 
models could be considered, e.g. multiple suppliers single retailer, single supplier multiple retailers, even multiple 
suppliers multiple retailers. Actually, this is effective. On the other hand, information structure could also be altered,

e.g. the retailer's asymmetric information about market demand, the supplier's private information about production
cost. As a result, to coordinate, the composite contract is still indispensable under unilateral asymmetric information.
Clearly, this paper varies the setting. We preliminarily attempt to discuss the case under bilateral asymmetric 
information. Since one dimension of asymmetric information adds up, no additional degree of freedom left to satisfy 
increased incentive compatible constraint. This implies there is not enough degree of freedom to arbitrarily allocate 
profit. However, both parties don't require arbitrary profit allocations under bilateral asymmetric information since 
arbitrary profit allocations might hurt one party's profit. We can also regard this under bilateral asymmetric 
information as the difference from general supply chain coordination, hence some progress about the coordinated 
contracts in this paper based on traditional definition has been achieved. Then we have analytically obtained how to 
allocate the total supply chain profit between the retailer and the supplier according to their advantage of information. 
The dilemma comes to retailer (also supplier). From the perspective of interaction of information rent, he prefers the 
supplier with lower cost, while on the other hand, to improve his proportion of profit, inefficient supplier is better for 
him. In other words, retailer (or supplier) has to select between larger proportion within a smaller whole profit and 
smaller proportion within a larger whole profit.  
Wholesale price contract is prone to double marginalization and still cannot coordinate the chain though under 
bilateral asymmetric information. Buyback contract could be regarded as the focus in this paper since all other 
contracts are compared with it. Wholesale price will increase with c if the profit allocation proportion is exogenous 
while the case is opposite in our setting.  
From the perspective of supplier, her “one stone”--decreasing her cost--kills three “birds” with revenue sharing 
contract. Decreased c results in decreased 
r
w directly, meantime, it might also leads to decreasing 
r
H
so that 
r
w
will be decreasing indirectly. Apart from 
r
w , order quantity will also rise up owing to decreasing c. To sum up, the 
supplier who possesses more advantage of information could get more transfer payment due to three effects. Compared 
with buyback contract, players focus on the wholesale price for buyback contract while they will pay attention to 
transfer payment for revenue sharing. Moreover, revenue sharing contract doesn't depend on the retail price. As for 
quantity discount contract, there exists a price gap between quantity discount and buyback contract.  
At last, compared with buyback contract, the quantity flexibility contract fully protects the retailer on a portion 
of the retailer's order whereas the buyback contract gives partial protection on the retailer's entire order though unsold 
parts addressed in both contracts. Furthermore, the price will increase with in a square number. Coordinating the 
supply chain with QF contract, an intermediate 
I
ought to be considerable by both parties. In other words, can't 
work in the global range.

Abstract 
Turnaround maintenance (TAM) is a periodic event in which a plant is shutdown to perform inspections, 
repairs, replacements and overhauls to ensure plant reliability, availability and performance. This is 
practiced in many industries including petrochemical industries, refineries, power plants and chemical 
processing industries. TAM is a major event that is repeated every five to seven  and takes away long time 
of production stoppage and high costs of  material and workforce. In some industries it may take months 
of work  and millions of dollars. It needs long time of planning and preparation to maintain a minimum 
level of efficiency and effectiveness. Research in TAM is mainly focused on planning of a single plant 
and rarely deals with network of plants within or across business units. However, in the era of 
globalization supply chains became a matter of business survival. This brings the issue of TAM planning 
and scheduling across supply chains to the top of research needs. In this paper a mathematical 
programming model for scheduling TAM activities within the supply chain is presented. The model 
incorporates realistic constraints such as the availability of internal and external manpower  and material 
supplies,  product demand, production capacity and inventory capacity of all units involved. The 
developed model is solved using GAMS model builder and CPLEX solver. The utilization of the model is 
demonstrated on a realistic example from process industry.

Abstract 
Maritime transportation is the most obvious choice for industries to transport large amounts of liquid or 
dry bulk products over long distances. Often, the bulk products are stored as inventories at or near the 
loading and unloading port. A maritime inventory routing (MIR) problem is a planning problem where 
the ship operator has the responsibility not only for the ship routing and scheduling, but also for the 
inventory management at one or both ends of the sailing legs. Here we review research on MIR and 
extension problems during the last two decades. Since this problem was first introduced in 1987, we have 
found over a hundred publications on it in refereed journals. Most of them consider static and 
deterministic problems even though uncertainty plays an important role in MIR. We also found that most 
recent research on this field focuses more on theoretical contributions, rather than on the real problems as 
in previous studies.  However, future high-impact research remains wide open and provides challenging 
opportunities

Abstract 
Several government’s building in Jakarta are in bad conditions. Maintenance policies have been made by 
the government in an effort to keep the performance of the building remain good. In implementing the 
policies that have been made, appropriate strategies are needed to enable the policy to proceed as planned. 
Although the budget was increased for maintenance activities, the implementation didn’t go well as planned 
in government’s building. This study aims to improve building functional performance by evaluating the 
maintenance policy and strategic implementation. Several method were adopted to identify policy, strategy 
and the factors of functional performance which affected through questionnaire survey and Delphi 
technique. The results should show that maintenance performance could be improved by evaluating the 
maintenance policy and its strategic implementation. The originality of this research could identify the 
factors in maintenance policies and strategies, which affect the functional performance of government 
buildings that necessary including security and environmental aspects which is not included in past 
research.

1. Introduction
According to regulation of the Minister of Public Works no.24 of  2008, building is defined as physical form 
of construction process for human doing their activities. In order to maintain the reliability of the building and its 
infrastructure and facilities, maintenance work is needed. The less importance of reliability performance, the less the 
level of application of work on related elements in the building (Aksah et al, 2015). Based on Indonesia regulation, 
functional performance as reliability is include technical requirement such as safety, health, comfort, amenity and 
environmental sustainability. Poor maintenance is one of the biggest cause of problems in an organization (felice et 
al, 2014). Poor maintenance may lead to additional repair costs, significant loss of production and safety disasters 
(Shafiee, 2015). 
Policies have been formulated by the government in an effort to maintain the condition of existing buildings 
in Indonesia still feasible in function, at least for government buildings. Policy defined as the direction or action taken 
by the central or local or city government to achieve the objectives. After policy is formulated, then the implementation 
of the policy is needed to overcome the problems (Tangkilisan, 2003). Nevertheless, long-term maintenance strategies 
with long-term inspection without considering the possible variations in the systems used and available technologies, 
may lead to implementation without appropriate strategies will not be effective. Some policy issues that occur in

government policy by adding criteria and standard for maintenance performance measurement could help 
increase functional building performance. 
4.3 Conculsion 
Based on the results of research, in government buildings there are now various policies that guide maintenance work 
and also policies that regulate the functionality both in the law, the rules of the minister of public works, government 
regulations to presidential regulations. In general, the Minister of Public Works Regulation no.24 of 2008 is sufficient 
to describe the maintenance policy required. In detail, existing regulations is not contain maintenance policies that 
using computer-based maintenance management systems. Future research could be develop computer-based 
maintenance management system for governement building. The current Maintenance policy mentions that 
maintenance reports are the basis of consideration in the extension of a functional-worthy certificate, but no policy 
clearly defines maintenance report standards as references to be associated with function eligibility. 
Based on statistical analysis, the most dominant factor or influence the functional function of government 
building is planning and development policy, implementation policy and information and system policy. This is also 
supported by the results of analysis on PLS-SEM model. All the factors obtained require policies in order to implement 
appropriate strategies for the feasibility of building functions. So it is important that factors related to it can be 
controlled and monitored as consideration determines the maintenance policy. For the government policy that doesn’t 
exist as indicator shown before, it is recommend to create a policy based of these indicator. 
Based on the results of the identification of the maintenance policies studied have significant effect but not 
on all aspects of functionality, such as environment and amenity. The aspects of functionality that are significantly 
related to the policy studied are aspects of safety, health, security and comfort.

Abstract 
Culture of a society is considered to be one of the influencing factors for a consumer when 
switching a brand of a product. It not only shapes the underlying behavior but also 
influences the perception of a consumer in decision making. Since behavior of a consumer 
would be effected  his/her inherent cultural values which in turn would rely on culture of its 
society he/she is a part of, it’s important to study it in consumer switching context. Previous 
studies linking this phenomenon with culture has mostly found to be focusing on cross-
cultural references, using variety, novelty, curiosity and vanity-seeking behavior of 
consumer. But there is hardly any study using cultural as a construct for consumer switching 
taking primarily in account different dimensions of culture. 
Our research is one such attempt to explore consumer brand switching using cultural 
dimensions given by Hofstede. Effect of culture on consumer switching is explored using 
Hofstede’s six-cultural dimensions taking into account different levels of involvement 
(High, Medium and Low) of consumer and Value of product as moderators. As depending 
on involvement of consumer, the cost in terms of time and effort invested for purchase, 
switching is going to differ, effecting satisfaction and loyalty construct. Similarly, when it 
comes to value of product the switching levels might differ for a cost-effective and premium 
category product.

VI. CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION
In this paper through literature review, we have identified that societal culture affects consumer Switching 
Behavior. It is also proposed that CSB would vary depending on the level of involvement and value of a 
service, which acts as a moderator between cultural antecedents of a society and Switching Behavior. And 
hence, it is concluded that different market strategies can be developed by marketing firms and consumer 
business’ to tackle cultural differences of global consumers on these pre-defined Cultural dimensions to 
discourage switching, on different levels of consumer involvement for different types of Services 
depending on value-offering. We give a theoretical framework here and will get back after we are done 
with data collection and results. The proposed hypotheses will be verified through empirical data in the 
next version.

Abstract 
Buildings describe social and economic aspects in an environment, buildings provide shelter, space and 
facilities for human activities. However, the implementation of a good maintenance system is not visible 
in some of the current government buildings in Indonesia. Buildings that are not maintained properly will 
shorten the life of the building, because there will be damage that will affect the failure of the building. 
Incorrect use of quality may cause construction failure that may lead to building failure. Where a 
construction failure is a condition of construction work that is inconsistent with the specification of the 
work as agreed in the construction work contract either in part or in whole as a result of the error of the 
service user or service provider. This study aims to develop a quality management system in the 
implementation process of government building maintenance work. Research method used in this study 
are delphi method and survey questionnaire. The risks found in each activity are analyzed descriptively 
and qualitatively, resulting in the highest risk to be response. The result in this research is the risk based 
quality management system that can be applied in building maintenance work to improve the performance 
in government building environment.

1. Introduction
Presidential Regulation No. 73/2011 stipulates that the meaning of a state-owned building is a building for the 
purpose of being a state-owned / regional property and held with financing sources derived from APBN, and / or 
APBD funds, or other legitimate acquisitions. Government buildings are buildings that are functioned for 
government activities aimed at achieving national welfare, all activities carried out by using government funds. 
Therefore, government buildings are deemed appropriate to represent the objectives of good maintenance 
management, as the basis of building other functions in determining the effective and effective maintenance of 
building management . 
Building describes social and economic aspects in an environment, the building provides shelter, space, and 
facilities for human activities. Good investment in buildings can increase the production capacity of goods and 
services, therefore maintaining optimal building performance conditions becomes very important in increasing the 
value of the building, by maintaining the right management system (Grussing, 2013). Buildings that are not 
maintained and maintained will shorten the life of the building, because there will be damage that will affect the 
failure of the building in the age of the building. (Olanitori, 2011).

Abstract 
The effects of global warming are threatening the earth's ecosystem sustainability. Countries and 
companies need to get appropriate measures to maintain sustainability. One of the joint commitments 
made is about carbon emissions reductions. Practically, this commitment defines a different capacity of 
carbon limit for each country or company. Firms are expected to find the best solution to reduce the 
amount of carbon emissions while minimizing the total cost, including by optimizing transportation. This 
research is about modeling the combination of multimodal land transportation (truck and rail) from the 
origin (supplier) to the destination (manufacturer) with considering carbon emission emitted. Our 
objective is to find a tradeoff between transportation costs and emissions. We show how the parameters 
associated with carbon emissions affect transportation cost from the supplier to the manufacturer. The 
method used in this article is Mixed Integer Linear Programming.

Abstract 
Maintenance of a building has a purpose to preserve the building in accordance with the initial 
conditions on functional, structural, and aesthetic. In addition, maintenance aspects cover a long 
life cycle in a building, thusq maintenance costs tend to be larger than other construction phases. 
DPR RI building is one of the government buildings owned by the state which also can not be 
separated from maintenance and financing aspect. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a 
system and tools approach used in the aspects of building maintenance. The purpose of this 
research is to identify factors that influence the development of BIM-models and how to develop 
BIM-models to improve services in building maintenance. The research was conducted by 
validating the content to the experts of building maintenance and BIM to find out the influencing 
factors and further develop the BIM-model by taking of historical data and field survey. From 
the data then conducted an qualitative analysis based on the influencing factors. From this 
research, it is found that influential factor in BIM-model development that improve service in 
maintenance of Government building and found steps that can be done to enhance service in 
maintenance at Government building by using Building Information Modeling.

1. Introduction
Maintenance may also be defined as ""the necessary services and activities provided to conserve, protect and maintain 
the structure and form of the building upon completion or after any repair or replacement of the current standard in 
order to function at its entire age without interfering with its features and use original” (A.L. Olanrewaju dan A.R. 
Abdul Aziz, Building Maintenance Process, 2015). 
In addition, the constraints have also been mentioned by Ibrahim Motawa and A. Almarshad (2013), that 
adequate information is needed regarding the products available for maintenance operations, such as 
specifications, previous maintenance work, professional list of specialists to do the work, etc. It will 
support the preventive maintenance activities.

This modeling aims to facilitate the maintenance of buildings, especially visually. With the visualization of 
BIM-model will facilitate the building manager in identifying and analyzing related maintenance works. It 
also performed object recognition on each component in the BIM-model. 
4.
Conduct organizational and legal planning on BIM development
Experts say that HR can affect the BIM by 70-80%. An activity certainly can not be separated from the role
of stakeholders to achieve the desired goals. In order to achieve the desired objectives and functions of
BIM, the building manager needs to anticipate related organizations. Starting from preparing the
organization's ability to implement BIM, anticipating the collaboration of each stakeholder to support the
utilization of BIM, as well as from the legal side related to the BIM model data and taking into account the
applicable rules or standards.
BIM is a tool and can also be said to be a process that can be used in maintenance of buildings. In order for
BIM to be used / implemented properly and maximally by the organization or users who implement it, then
the user must first understand and competent in the operation of BIM. This can be achieved through
training to improve the competence of BIM users so that it will perform well. Collaboration/cooperation of
stakeholders also greatly affect the implementation process in the organization, both internal and external
organizations. Without the support of the owner, service providers, Government or other parties, the
function and purpose of BIM would be difficult to achieve. So in the development of the BIM-model on
Government buildings in maintenance also requires policy from the owner / building manager so that BIM-
model development can be done.
4. Conclusion and Recommendation
The first objective of this research is to identify factors that influence the development of BIM-model to improve 
service on maintenance of government buildings. So it can be concluded from all the important factors of BIM, which 
have been validated by previous experts, that several factors of BIM are very influential on the economic aspects, 
technical aspects and social aspects of maintenance. While in environmental aspect of maintenance has percentage of 
influence equal to 73%, slightly lower than other aspects. Each influential factor can be seen in Table 2 with details as 
follows: 
•
12 BIM factors that affect the economic aspects
•
15 BIM factors that affect the technical aspects
•
10 BIM factors that affect the social aspect
•
5 BIM factors that affect the environmental aspects
The conclusions can be obtained from the case study that the development of BIM-models to enhance service on 
maintenance of Government buildings is very new in Indonesia, although the use of BIM in other countries has been 
well developed. Until now the use of BIM in Indonesia is still done in several pilot projects at the stage of 
construction implementation, but has not entered the stage of maintenance yet. 
Since BIM is still relatively new in Indonesia, so much still needs to be prepared in the future, both from the internal 
manager of the Government building itself and from external involving the support of Government and other parties. 
The first step that can be done to develop BIM-model in Government building is by preparing criteria through 
several stages in order to improve service on maintenance of Government building. The stages are to know and 
determine the criteria of the BIM function, determine the necessary information criteria, determine the technical 
criteria related to the BIM implementation and determine the appropriate organizational and legal criteria to support 
the BIM functions. 
From the research results of BIM-model development to enhance service on maintenance of Government buildings, 
the suggested suggestions are as follows: 
1.
In further research it is necessary to know the right information system used in Government building to
support BIM-model development
2.
The constraints put forward by the authors are expected to be input or important note for further research
related to maintenance of government buildings.

Abstract 
This paper presents a manpower tour-scheduling approach that involves determining the manning 
requirements and optimum employee work schedules for several security gates. The two-stage approach 
is used to minimize the total labor cost of security personnel. In stage 1, manning requirements are 
determined based on the results of a manpower workload study at the company. In stage 2, an integer 
programming model is formulated to satisfy each gate’s staffing requirements during weekdays and 
weekends. The objective is to minimize the total labor cost of both Non-supervising and Supervising 
employees. The model proposed an alternative work schedule combination that resulted in annual savings 
of 24% in comparison to the schedule currently in use by the company.

Abstract 
The two-dimensional packing problem (2PP) is one of the main problems encountered in many industries. 
Proper nested pattern layout can minimize the trim loss and maximize the utilization of the material 
available. This paper presents a hybrid ant colony algorithm coupled with a simple local search algorithm 
to solve the two-dimensional bin packing (2BP) and strip packing (2SP) problems with additional 
constraint, where the items to be packed by levels. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested 
over a number of standard benchmark instances from the literature. Computational results indicate that 
the proposed algorithm is effective for solving these problems.  
Keywords 
Two-dimensional level packing, Bin packing, Strip packing, Ant colony optimization. 
1. Introduction
For several industries, material saving is one of the most important factors to be considered, and it is well-known 
that a well nested pattern layout can result in a saving in the resource material. The two dimensional packing 
problem is a NP-complete combinatorial optimization problem (Fowler et al., 1981). This problem occurs in 
different real world applications such as glass, paper, cloth industries, cutting rectangular components from large 
sheet of material, placing goods on shelves in warehouse, arranging articles and advertisements in pages in 
newspaper paging. 
There are two main specific problems of the two-dimensional packing problem considered in the literature (Lodi et 
al., 2004), bin packing and strip packing. In the two-dimensional bin packing problem (2BP), there is a set of 
rectangular items to be packed in an infinite number of identical rectangular containers (bins), these containers 
having width  and height  , and the objective is to minimize the number of bins used. In the two-dimensional strip 
packing problem (2SP), there is a set of rectangular items to be packed in a single container (strip), having width W 
and infinite height, and the objective is to minimize the height to which the strip is used. The 2BP is most suitable 
for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the 2SP will generally apply to the paper and 
garment industries (Mohammed et al., 2009). 
Exact solution methods, such as branch and bound algorithm (Cui et al., 2008) and column generation algorithm 
(Gilmore et al., 1965), can only be used for small problem instances. Martello et al. (1998, 2003) propose two exact 
solution approaches for 2BP and 2SP, respectively. For real world problems, heuristic solution methods have to be 
used, where these heuristic algorithms solve specific problem according to a set of rules, such as Next-Fit 
Decreasing Height (NFDH) algorithm, First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) algorithm, and Best-Fit Decreasing 
Height (BFDH) algorithm (Lodi et al., 2002a). In the last decades, researchers have shown a lot of interest for 
metaheuristics approaches such as Genetic Algorithm (Bennell et al., 2013), Simulated Annealing (Leung et al., 
2012), and Tabu Search (Alvarez-valdes et al., 2007) to solve the problem for a near-optimal solution.  Hopper and 
Turton (2000, 2001) review the approaches developed to solve 2D packing problems using Genetic Algorithms,

Figure 7 shows the %frequency within the 500 instances and the corresponding %deviation range. The proposed 
algorithm achieves optimality by 70.4% and 27.8% for the 2LBP and 2LSP respectively. The algorithm is capable of 
solving around 75% and 90% of the instances with less than 4% and 8% deviation of the optimal solution 
respectively for both types of problems. No deviation is registered more than 18%. The figure also show that the 
proposed algorithm gives good results for the 2LBP comparing with the 2LSP.

5. Conclusions and Future Work
This paper has presented an ACO approach to solve the 2LBP and 2LSP problems. During solution construction, the 
ants make the best possible choice, as indicated by the pheromone trail and heuristic information. The performance 
of the proposed ant system has been tested on sets of well-known benchmark problems. The Computational results 
show that the algorithm is capable of solving the small problems optimally, and gives good performance for large 
scale ones and has achieved optimality by 70.4%, 27.8% for 2LBP and 2LSP problems, respectively. Also, total 
averages percentage deviation comparing with the optimal solution are 3.52%, 2.35% for the 2LBP and 2LSP 
problems, respectively. 
More work could be carried out to optimize the algorithm parameters and to find more effective local search method 
in order to obtain better results for large size problems. Further research might also investigate the impact of the 
items' rotation on the objective value.

Abstract 
Government building is one of the state assets that requires effective and efficient maintenance 
management, to extend the life of the building and to optimize its utilization or function. 
Irrelevant government building maintenance strategies not only cause losses to the state but also 
harm building users. Many studies have shown that improper maintenance management has 
caused harm to residents or users of the building. As a state asset, government buildings have a 
very strategic and urgent function for the benefit of public services. While the maintenance tends 
to be still conventional, whereas the development of technology brings many benefits in 
building maintenance management. The concept that is widely applied today to building 
management is to integrate the concept of BIM and e-maintenance. These two concepts are 
considered to result in effective and efficient maintenance. E-maintenance is an important 
breakthrough for government building maintenance so that the entire maintenance process can 
be monitored through the system. This study aims to identify the conceptual framework that will 
be used for the development of the BIM-based government building e-maintenance system. This 
study is expected to generate a conceptual framework for the development of e-maintenance of 
government buildings based on BIM.

Abstract 
A wake region will be produced by truck when it is travelling at their maximum allowance speed which is 
56 miles per hour. The wake region can be seen clearly when a truck travelling at a wet road. The wake 
region has its own force which will affecting any vehicle travelling behind or next to the truck. This paper 
presents a numerical study of the flow field in the aerodynamics of the saloon effecting by the wake 
region. Simulation will be carried out for different position of the saloon next to the truck. The numerical 
study will be validated using Ahmed body to determine the mesh and domain size. The velocity will be 
set at 56 miles per hour and assuming the truck will be travelling alongside the motorway. The rotating 
region will be used for truck and saloon and the angular velocity will be calculated based on the 
circumference of its tires. Detailed analysis and result such as CD and CL together with the x-y chart will 
be presented to provide a better understanding of the effect of truck wake region to the saloon when it is

Abstract 
Emotion is found to be stronger than cognition in human and system interaction. Kansei Engineering has been 
extensively used to capture customer emotions and translate them into product characteristics since 1980s. 
Ergonomics in Kansei Engineering is dealing with user and customer capability and limitation in terms of emotional 
aspects. Customer emotion and expression resulted from both products and services interaction. However, research 
of Kansei Engineering in services is still relatively less explored. Since service industries are growing significantly 
as one of the contributors for today’s economy, it is a calling for ergonomics-based Kansei Engineering 
methodology in understanding, modeling and fulfilling what the emotional needs as a function of service attributes. 
In this study, Kano model has been proposed to Kansei Engineering methodology as a quality tool in screening 
which service attributes are sensitive to emotional satisfaction, so that more focused-improvements on services are 
highly expected. Public service sector has been chosen as an empirical study to verify the proposed model. An 
interview followed by face to face questionnaire which involved 100 subjects has been conducted to explore and 
investigate what the critical emotional needs related to service attributes in the public service sector. The findings 
were deemed to be important for local government in prioritizing which services need to be improved. More 
importantly, it is hoped that both parties (i.e., public and local government) will experience the public service 
offerings in more effective and efficient way.

1. Introduction
The fulfilment of customer needs is of critical to any product and service designers. It starts and ends with users and 
customers. What is needed and expected by customer should be of prioritized. In a case of service quality, service 
designer should capture what is needed by the potential customer, and translate it into service characteristic. It may 
be started by the measurement of expected and perceived service quality, then followed by the analysis of service

5. Conclusion and Further Research 
 
This study provides both theoretical and practical contributions. This study complements the applied integrated 
approach of Kansei Engineering and Kano to services, taking into account public services. The finding demonstrates 
how emotions were influenced by the usefulness and fulfillment of public service attributes. Apart from 
commercial-oriented services, this study was able to show that emotions are also important in bringing customer 
satisfaction regardless the type of business model. In addition, in-line with the previous studies on commercial 
services, this study provides a practical guideline for the local government or its representative in prioritizing which 
service attributes need to be improved given a limited budget and resource.

Abstract 
The proper Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is very important in project planning so that deliverables 
and project work can be broken down into smaller components, more easily to construct and costs can be 
better controlled. Construction of concrete precast bridges is the dominant type of bridge construction used 
in Indonesia because it provides many advantages over the other types of construction. Although the project 
is unique, the works on the construction of Precast bridges and their elements are relatively similar, so they 
can be standardized and used as a basis for project control. This study aims to create WBS Precast Bridge 
construction standards and identify risk variables on the work packages, activities and resources on the 
construction of concrete precast bridges for improved project cost performance. This study provides results 
that the WBS standard of concrete precast bridge construction consists of 6 levels, with 13 dominant risk 
variables and 5 risk response recommendation groups against project cost estimates as the development of 
WBS standards.

1. Introduction
The advancement of precast concrete technology has been the key to accelerating infrastructure development which 
is the main focus of government development until 2019 [5]. The Ministry of Public Works and Housings (PUPR) 
will build about 11,855-meter bridge infrastructure, including the long spans of Teluk Kendari Bridge, Holtekamp 
Bridge, and Balang Island Bridge [9]. Precast concrete is a concrete element or component without or with a molded 
reinforcement before being assembled into a building [14]. The development of precast concrete technology in the 
construction of this bridge has developed quite rapidly in the world, including in Indonesia in the last decade. Because 
precast construction on the bridge provides many advantages over conventional construction. The advantages of this 
precast system are construction carried out unaffected by the weather, efficient man power, good quality and 
maintained, mass production, shorten duration of work, saving the amount of material resources [2]. 
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a work-oriented, hierarchically oriented decomposition to be implemented by 
the project team to achieve the project objectives and produce the required deliverables [5]. The deliverable is a unique 
product, result, or capability to display services that must be generated to complete the process, phase, or project. 
Without create WBS or inaccuracy in defining WBS can lead to cost overruns project, this is due to the definition of 
the cost structure of each work package is not accurate. To achieve good project cost performance targets can result 
from a good cost estimation in the planning process. WBS has a major role in a project, so the creation of WBS is an 
obligation in project management both in the planning and execution phases. But in practice in Indonesia there are 
still many projects that do not use WBS or rarely made WBS in the formal form [15]. Although known to be an 
important input base in many project management processes, there are still many projects that do not use the WBS in 
detailing the work or making mistakes in making it [17].

5. Conclusion 
 
The result of standardized WBS of Precast Bridge Construction consists of 6 (six) levels i.e. 4 primary levels (project 
name, work section, sub work section, work package) and 2 complementary levels (work activity and resources). 
Alternative of work methods become the shape of work activity and resources breakdown. 
 
The identification of risk variables from WBS precast bridge construction yield 31 risk variables with 7 risk categories 
and produce 13 highest risk variables which influence of project cost performance. The identification of risk responds 
yield 22 preventive action, 21 corrective action and 14 risks respond as the development recommendation of 
standardized WBS. 
 
The development of standardized WBS grouped into 5 different categories and the application becomes project 
executor decision which is heavily influenced by corporate policy such as the organizational strategy, financial 
accounting policy, or project conditions. Risk-based standardized WBS of Precast Bridge Construction can be utilized 
for cost estimation, helping project executor identifies project works to the smallest items and setting cost objective 
for each item in greater accuracy as a tool to ensure every work has considered the requirements to respond cost-
related risks.

Abstract 
The mixing of different chemicals has traditionally been achieved using a rotating paddle in a tank. An 
alternate option to mix chemicals together is using jet nozzles to spray them into the tank. This paper 
presents different setups that could be potentially used for selected tank and find the optimal design. 
The aspects that are changed in the report where the inlet pipe location, the outlet pipe location and the 
inlet fluid speed. By using SolidWorks to create the models and Star CCM+ to run the simulations, the 
results of each test where generated and analysed. The validation had been conducted prior to the simulation. 
When analysing the results, the primary area of interest was the location and size of any dead zones 
that occurred in the tank during the running of the simulation. The results show that the optimal design 
for this tank is a side entry inlet pipe at the top of the tank with a side exit outlet pipe at the bottom of 
the tank, perpendicular to the inlet pipe. It was also shown that a slower inlet speed improved the 
quality of the mixing process.

Abstract 
This paper presents a preliminary method for improving the design and development process in a way that 
combines engineering design approaches based on learning algorithms and computational aeroacoustics. It 
is proposed that machine learning can effectively predict the noise generated by a coaxial jet exhaust by 
utilizing a database of computational experiments that cover a variety of flow and geometric configurations. 
A conceptual framework has been outlined for the development of a practical design tool to predict the 
changes in jet acoustics imparted by varying the fan nozzle geometry and engine cycle of a coaxial jet. It is 
proposed that computational aeroacoustic analysis is used to generate a training and validation database for 
an artificial neural network. The trained network can then predict noise data for any operational 
configuration. This method allows for the exploration of noise emissions from a variety of fan nozzle areas, 
engine cycles and flight conditions. It is intended that this be used as a design tool in order to reduce the 
design cycle time of new engine configurations and provide engineers with insight into the relationship 
between jet noise and the input variables.

1. Introduction
Although the sound energy emitted by modern aircraft is just one per cent of those designed forty years ago (Rolls-
Royce plc, 2015), thirty-one percent of people questioned have reported being bothered, annoyed or disturbed to some 
extent by noise from aircraft, airports and airfields (Notley et al., 2014). This can be attributed to a rise in air traffic 
volume and the number of flight paths, leading to an increase in noise exposure. This noise problem has led to the 
introduction of FlightPath 2050: Europe’s Vision for Aviation and a strategic research agenda which requires that an 
aircraft’s effective perceived noise level (EPNL) be reduced by sixty-five percent by 2050 (ACARE, 2012). 
The Uj8 law for subsonic jets (Lighthill, 1952) demonstrates that a jet’s radiated acoustic power is proportional to the 
eighth power of the jet exhaust velocity Uj. This characteristic has been exploited through the introduction of high 
bypass ratio (HBR) turbofan engines. These engines consist of a primary stream of hot combustion gases and a lower 
velocity bypass stream of cooler air. As the bypass stream exits the fan nozzle it surrounds the primary stream, 
lowering the overall velocity of the combined exhaust and dramatically decreasing jet noise. Although large jet noise 
reductions have been achieved through the introduction of HBR engines, jet noise is still a dominant noise source. 
Turbofan engines have a fixed-area fan nozzle designed for optimum performance during the most common flight 
mode. Varying the fan nozzle area and subsequently the bypass ratio would allow the performance to be optimized 
for various flight conditions. For example, increasing fan nozzle area would increase the bypass ratio. This, in turn, 
reduces the jet velocity leading to an increase in propulsive efficiency and a reduction in jet mixing noise, ideal for 
noise reduction during take-off. A variable area fan nozzle (VAFN) could also be complemented by the cycle changes 
of variable cycle engines (VCE) allowing the jet noise emissions and propulsive efficiency to be optimized across the 
entire flight envelope.  
In order to optimize the performance and noise emissions of new VAFN-VCE configurations, multiple tests would be 
performed during the design development stage. Experimental analysis could be performed on prototype nozzles but

Figure 3. Example multi-layer feed forward ANN 
 
Once the ANN is trained, the engineer can evaluate the ANN performance against the test data. The architecture can 
be adjusted if needed and the process repeated until the desired accuracy is achieved. Once testing is complete the 
engineer can then evaluate the ANN performance against the validation data and if necessary retrain the ANN to reach 
the desired accuracy. Once fully trained and validated the ANN can then be used to generate a complete jet noise data 
set that would allow the engineer to make informed decisions during the design and development process.  
 
The system benefits include: 
• 
The time and cost of the design development process is reduced. 
• 
Noise or other parameters of interest can be predicted across a range of configurations without the need 
for extensive CAA or experimental analysis. 
• 
CAA-ANN model allows a cheaper global exploration of the problem to be performed.  
• 
An informed local exploration can then be carried out with a view to determining the optimum design 
configuration. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper has described the conceptual framework for a CAA-ANN based design tool for the development of a 
VAFN-VCE with respect to noise and operation. CAA and ANN methods have been integrated to provide a model 
suitable for predicting noise from a variety of flow configurations of industrial interest.  
It is proposed that this model provide insight to industry through an enhanced understanding of the noise producing 
mechanisms of VAFN-VCE for subsonic jets and show how performance improvements can be maximized through 
the use of an ANN trained with a database generated using CAA methods. The usefulness of this as a design tool can 
be determined through the accuracy of the ANN results and the time taken to provide a result.  
Now that the framework has been proposed, future work will continue to expand the concept of combining artificial 
neural networks and computational aeroacoustics in order to validate this methodology.

Abstract 
The aim of the paper is to clarify the concept of Market Mavens in the age of e-commerce/brick and click 
retail. The paper also discusses about the alternatives for Market Mavens for current scenario. Paper also 
highlights the importance of various factors responsible for behavior of Market Mavens. Papers also 
present the way market mavens has evolved over time and its changing role according to the society.

1. Introduction
Market Mavens are individuals/group of individuals who have information about various kinds of products as well 
as they have niche knowledge for a particular line of products/segments. They are aware of places to shop, and other 
facets of marketing, and initiate conversation with consumers and respond to queries from consumers for 
marketplace information. (Feick and Price, 1987). They have a general knowledge about a wide range of products 
and services, and are conscious about product, prices, durability, availability, store characteristics, distribution and 
promotion (Brancaleone and Gountas, 2007). They are more likely to rely on secondary sources and have some 
confidential source of information like annual report, GBM report confidants from market. They read retail 
magazines, direct mail advertisements, and discuss retail store image attributes more freely than non-mavens (Higie, 
Feick and Price, 1987). They are high users of coupons. Market mavens have more accurate vision for service 
quality than opinion leaders and early adopters. But for a specific product, Market Mavens and Opinion Leaders are 
more sought after.   
There has been huge proliferation in recent years in numerous products categories (computers, softwares, hotels, 
automobiles etc.) A convergence trend has also been in trend i.e. integration of two or more technologies, thus 
further causing proliferation of products and increased demand of market mavens (Geissler and Edison, 2005). 
Market Mavens now-a-days are highly associated with E-Retail. E-retail is sales of goods and services via internet. 
This is a new form of conducting business where the need to go to a physical store and purchase has been 
undermined. This business model includes e-commerce website with its products displayed virtually, and through

came out and showed their credibility irrespective of age such as Technical Guruji and Geeky Ranjit, undermining 
the age factor. Thus we can come to conclusion that:  
   
H4: E-mavens will be younger than Market Mavens. 
 
Since various products have varying prices and features, the involved processes and complexity in decision making 
process vary as per the product. There are two kinds of products as far as we concern decision making process.  
a) Low involvement product: Product that is properly under budget and doesn’t involve high amount of 
thinking and cognition. A little risk is associated in purchase of these products. 
b) High involvement product: Product that are high in price and involve high amount of thinking, 
cognition and advice. These products incur high risks as having a worse product may cost a huge loss. 
Market Maven tend to have influence mostly on low involvement products (Puspa and Rahardja, 2009). The reason 
being that these involve minimal risks and therefore consumers are willing to try a new brand or follow an advice. 
But in case of high involvement products, people generally don’t prefer to try out new products unless they are 
highly influenced by opinion leader (Clark and Goldsmith, 2006). They tend to rely upon their cognitive and past 
experiences to review brand and service superiority to ensure a perfect purchase and no risk. For example, while 
buying a mobile phone, people generally get influenced by Market Mavens and give a thought to a purchase of new 
brand, but, in case of purchasing of cars, people still tend to trust the experiences of their relatives, past users etc. 
rather than trusting on some Maven. People tend to reject new brands when it comes to high involvement product 
purchase even if they are providing better purchases. This brings us to the following hypothesis: -  
 
H5: E-mavens in the e-world have influential role only in low involvement products.  
 
In today’s era, where the world is getting transferred to a high-tech lifestyle, everything has started to be mechanized 
and automatic. Internet itself has played a vital for proliferation of the same. As earlier in this paper, we discussed 
about websites like shopclues.com, gadgets.ndtv.com etc., these include specifications of various electronic products 
specifically. They contain the content like consumers’ reviews, star rating, marks out of 100% etc. Also, in a recent 
study, Ian Brodie, on his website, www.ianbrodie.com , posted the way to get good star ratings on Google search 
results. He explained how it is obvious to get a good click rate on the link that has higher rating and is appealing to 
internet surfers to help reducing the doubt in authenticity of the website. Also, a sufficiently large amount of 
population can ow access platform like YouTube etc. which is the reason for emerging of very famous market 
mavens like Technical Guruji and Geeky Ranjit. If it wasn’t for these platforms, many knowledgeful Mavens 
couldn’t have risen themselves. Observing it’s increment to occur at very fast pace, we can propose a hypothesis 
that: 
 
H6: In the e-world several websites would serve the job for e-mavens. 
 
In the above readings, while we have talked about the ways consumers are benefitted with the help of proliferation 
of internet which has led to the formation of e-mavens, there are certain drawbacks that comes with this boon. 
Websites now-a-days provide very keen comparison between every set of products. While consumers are highly 
benefitted from these product specification representations and are able to pursue based on its pros and cons, but at 
the same time, the availability of many choices leads to more and more confusion which leads to high uncertainty in 
the product purchasing behavior. Because of this, consumer even try to ruthlessly compare those features, which are 
not of his use. For example, in early days, for purchasing phone, the basic necessities were limited to calling, voice 
quality, music. But in todays advanced world, the necessities have gone freakishly high which may not be useful for 
some person, but is taken into consideration just because one phone has it and another doesn’t. Thus, we can 
conclude for following hypothesis:  
 
H7: In the E-world, the consumer will experience more uncertainty. 
 
8. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we explored the current scenario of Market Maven in the age of e-commerce, as how it is different 
from a physical market maven. The concept of e-retail and role of Market Maven in it was entertained in this paper. 
Types of Market Mavens and its alternatives along with its flaws were also explored. We observed that there has

© IEOM Society International 
been difference in the type of information diffused buy market maven in earlier age versus Market Maven in age of 
e-retail in the way that new methods of diffusing have been introduced like star ratings, public review, YouTube
Market Mavens etc. which has further made Market Mavens more approachable as internet has gain sufficient
penetration in Indian market. Since many market mavens are active now-a-days, there isn’t a scope for information
bias. The most active age group and there cause to go for online shopping were also explored. Examples taken in the
paper also proved the truthiness of the hypotheses that Market Maven do have knowledge about products out of their
domain and they aren’t able to diffuse them all. Since companies try to lure customers with attractive features and
offers without showing its dark side, making bold decisions were found out to be probable mistakes. Paper also
supported the hypothesis that e-mavens in fact are successful in clearing the inconsistent thoughts about products. It
was also evident that people tend to communicate with the people of same thinking and same age group, which can
be similarly implied in case of relation between Market Maven and consumers.

DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED WBS (WORK 
BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE) FOR PLANNING THE 
SCHEDULE BASED ON RISK IN STEEL BRIDGE 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

Abstract 
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a breakdown of deliverables and project work into smaller 
components that can be better managed. In fact, bridge construction projects in Indonesia are still many 
that are not in accordance with the planning in terms of scheduling. Therefore, the development of risk-
based WBS Standardization is proposed for planning schedule of Steel Bridge work. The research 
consists of several stages with qualitative risk analysis method. The results show that WBS standard 
consists of 6 levels, with the dominant risk variable on project time performance, in which risk responses 
are recommended to develop standardized WBS. 
Keywords 
Time, Scheduling, Steel Bridge, Risk,WBS 
1. Introduction
A steel truss bridge construction project requires a standard work breakdown structure to ensure that each work
package and its existing activities and resources can be defined one by one according to their scope of work. In the 
third Revised General Specification (2010), there are several divisions that determine the position of an activity in 
the making of WBS. But the common thing that often happens in the field is the lack of standards in the manufacture 
of WBS so that the work packages, activities and resource work can not be defined since the planning process 
leading to miscalculations on specific performance such as cost, time of execution, as well as safety planning work. 
On the other hand, WBS is known as the backbone of not only mature planning, but also implementation and 
control of a project [1]. Steel frame bridge work is one of the high risk category jobs where clear procedures are 
required in planning and implementation. For example, in the formulation of time performance, planning-related 
work methods are required, taking into account the risks that may have a negative impact during the construction 
phase. However, in the absence of WBS standards that take into account risks, project planning becomes 
unstructured and may lead to errors in cost estimates and implementation schedules in case of planning 
misidentification. Taking into account the risks of existing field conditions, the work methods outlined in the WBS 
already contain scheduling estimates, so all types of activities and resources in the work can be identified, so errors 
in the cost calculation and project schedule can be finalized. 
2. Literature Review
Making WBS is a process of describing deliverables and project works in the form of individual components in
the form of top down lists and hierarchically explaining the components to be built and the work associated with it. 
Each of the WBS representes an increasingly detailed work item. WBS is a system that divides the project into 
manageable work packages, components, or WBS element to provide a common framework for scheduling the 
scope, costs, allocation of responsibilities, communication, risk assessment, monitoring and control [2].

Abstract  
Retail shelf space is one of the most precious resources in retail chains. The proper product assortment 
is conducted by figuring out which product to be displayed to maximize the revenue. Moreover, 
deciding the location and the amount of shelf space assigned for each displayed product critically affects 
the overall performance of the retail chains. This study introduces a mathematical model to optimize 
the retail revenue by manipulating the above decisions while considering products’ cross-elasticity on 
the demand.  Unlike the majority of the previous studies, the space allocated to each product is 
considered as a continuous variable that has a lower bound of one product faces not as multiples of it. 
The resulting model, a NP-hard one, is solved using an adaptive meta-heuristic algorithm based on 
artificial bee colony (ABC). Numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance superiority of 
the proposed adaptive ABC over the basic one to achieve an optimum or a near optimal solution to the 
model.

Abstract 
This paper is an attempt to draw a map which allows a Virtual Team to be utilized efficiently in different 
organizations in consideration with types of personalities, which facilitates deployment of the same. Virtual 
teams and e-collaborations are a suggested substitute to traditional formats of bulk working style and 
enables to remove constraints like physical space and time. Virtual teams if driven by meticulous planning, 
able leadership, interpersonal trust and effective utilization of ICT will help in achieving efficiency in the 
supply chain for different type of organizations. In general ICT, organizational functions and traits of supply 
chain participants must synchronize in a way which creates an environment of a lean process and thus helps 
the supply chain to compete with the other existing supply chains of different organizations. This study 
focuses mainly on the best fit of the discussed vital factors which are somehow neglected or were not 
considered in the previous researches.

H5: Supply chain of Differentiator Organizations will have will have high flexibility, uncertainty and   
depicting complexity of work flow on a higher side, and the composition of such Virtual teams will 
comprise of judgmental type of participants.  
5. Conclusion 
This paper conveys potential scope of research in the field of Virtual Teams demanding different leaderships for 
different kinds of organizational setup strategy. Through extensive review of literature, it is suggested that the Virtual 
Teams of Prospector organizations who are Innovator in nature will have rich ICT (Information and Communication 
Technologies) in their operations which allows VTs implementation.The study proposes that ST type of participants 
will be dominant in the firms with Cost leader strategies and it is also evident that the Differentiators in a supply chain 
depicts high uncertainty along with an extrovert (perspective) behavior which presents an advantageous position for 
the consumer with reducing inclination towards substitutes. On the other hand, Cost Leader types of organization are 
more introverts (judgmental)These parameters will be further proved and verified through empirical data. This study 
holds good potential for accessing and building up a background for literature on implementation of Virtual Teams in 
different types organization, structure and able use of ICT. In this research we have pointed out the following 
hypothesis which will be empirically tested for further confirmation of theory. 
6. Discussion and Future Scope of Research 
The concept of Semantic Network or Semantic Priming has been proposed for as a tool that could be used by Managers 
of Virtual Teams. It is not known as of now, how to use it for Virtual Teams with different strategic 
Orientation.Semantic Network plays a vital role in channelizing teams/virtual teams in different strategy types of 
Organizations.

Abstract 
Rice is one of the most important food item worldwide. The dominant food crop of 
Bangladesh is rice. Bangladesh is currently the world's sixth-largest producer. High yield varieties 
of seed, application of fertilizer, and irrigation have increased yields, although these inputs also 
raise the cost of production and chiefly benefit the richer cultivators. The cultivation of rice in 
Bangladesh varies according to seasonal changes in the water supply.  
Problems faced by the manufacturing, working conditions of rice mills workers (male and 
female), safety of workers during work, cost of production as well as the marketing system need 
to be studied. At present lots of people are involved with this type of industries in Bangladesh. 
Most of the labors are illiterate.  The training and development programs in case of labors are not 
in satisfactory level. Usually the workers learn by doing their work. The labors are not conscious 
about the facilities offered by the management of the rice mills.  
Occupational health aims at prevention of disease and maintenance of the highest degree 
of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations.  An attempt has been made 
in this research to understand the human resource management of rice mills including 
Occupational Health and safety practices of rice mills in Sylhet, Bangladesh.  Different aspects of 
human resource management practices of the rice mills including focusing on some significant 
issues of social, economic, and cultural life of those people. Special attention has been paid on the 
knowledge of the people regarding working condition and safety of work etc.  
     The study includes studying various occupational health hazards and safety practices of 
selected rice mills workers of Sylhet, Bangladesh and future needs for improving rice mills 
workers social and working environment for both male and female. The result show a huge 
variance over the workers from different criterion. It is also found that there is lack of good 
understanding between the authority and workers.  High sound, improper ventilation system, dust,

Abstract 
Order picking is the most labor-intensive and costly activity for almost every warehouse. The problem of order 
picking routing in a warehouse is mainly solved using heuristics. The objective of this paper is investigating the 
impact of order picking regions on the performance of four order-picking routing heuristics. A proposed 
warehouse is divided to twelve main regions and large numbers of randomly test problems are generated. The 
computational results show that the order region has significance impact on the performance of the routing 
heuristics.

1- Introduction
Order picking is one of the important topics to study for improving warehouse (De Koster et al., 2007). It can 
consume up to 50% of the total costs in the warehouse operation (Frazelle, 2001). Order picking systems are 
classified into: picker-to-part, parts-to-picker, sorting, pick-to-box systems (De Koster, 2004). Efficiency and 
performance of order picking system depends on four basic components (Chan and Chan, 2011, Petersen et al., 
2004, Roodbergen and Iris, 2006): Layout, Picking, Routing policies and Storage assignment policies. Burinskiene, 
(2010) identified how to reduce order picker's travel distance in very narrow aisle shelf area warehouse. He took 
different aspects as: size of warehouse, layout, storage, and routing to optimize the order picking process and 
suggested some new approaches: volume based storage method ""across-floors"", usage of correlation between order 
picking efficiency and stock accuracy. 
The heuristics routing schemes are fast to memorized and quite easy to follow. This helps to reduce the risk of 
missing an item to be picked (Henn et al. 2010). Another reason for applying routing heuristics in practice is that 
optimal routes may seem illogical to the order pickers as they do not necessarily follow an easy to remember pattern, 
which is why they may induce the order picker to deviate from the routes. (Grosse et al. 2014). Petersen (1997) 
investigated the impact of depot location and the shape of warehouse on the performance of routing heuristics (S-
Shape, Return, Mid-Point, Largest Gap, Composite and Optimal strategies). He stated that the Return strategy 
appears to be ineffective for all pick list size, except when the order size is less than 5 items. To the best of our 
knowledge, the impact of order region on the performance is not considered in the literature. Thus, the main 
objective of this study is to investigate the effect of order picking region on the performance of four order-picking 
routing heuristics (Return, S-Shape, Mid-Point and Largest Gap).  
The S-Shape Policy (Hall, 1993), called “The Traversal Strategy”, leads to a route which make the aisles completely 
visited and totally traversed. The aisles in this strategy don't allow any picked item to be skipped; thus routes are 
usually in the shape of an S. These aisles visited from one end and leaved from the other end, starting at the nearest 
aisle to the depot. After do the last picking, the picker returns to the front end of the aisle, then go to the depot. The 
Return Policy, proposed by (Goetschalckx and Ratliff, 1988), allows to the order picker entering an aisle and leaves 
it at the front end. That is, no aisle is fully traversed. In the Mid-Point Policy (Hall, 1993), the picker enters the aisle 
nearest to the depot (containing a pick) and traverses it completely. The picker will go to the next aisle as far as the 
midpoint and pick all items then return to the front aisle and pick the remaining items then go to the depot. In the 
Largest Gap Policy (Roodbergen, and De Koster, 2001), a picker enters an aisle as far as the largest gap within an 
aisle. A gap is defined as one of the following three: distance between any two adjacent picks, distance between the 
first pick and the front aisle and distance between the last pick and the back aisle. The largest gap is the part of the 
aisle that the picker does not traverse. If the largest gap is between two adjacent picks the picker will follow the

Largest Gap are the best then S-Shape, (4) in the regions D, H, L the Mid-Point and Largest Gap are still the best 
while Return is the worst at this regions, (5) S-shape seems to be improved when the order is around the midpoint 
line. The summary of two-way ANOVA analysis of the results, Table 6, shows that the order regions have 
significant impact (P-value = 0 <0.01) on the performance of the routing policies. 
 
From the discussion of the above mentioned experiments, the routing heuristics that give best performance 
regarding the order regions are classified as shown in Figure 10.

5- Conclusions 
In this paper we investigate the impact of order region on the performance of four routing heuristics, S-shape, 
Return, Mid-point, and Largest gap.  Four experiments are designed based on proposed rectangular 
warehouse consists of 12 regions and single depot located at the lower left corner. Large numbers of test 
problems are generated uniformly from the regions under study. The computational results reveal the 
following findings: (1) if the orders are distributed in the whole warehouse the largest gap is the best when 
order size less than 4% otherwise S-shape is the best, these findings are valid if the warehouse is divided 
vertically. (2) Dividing the warehouse into two horizontal halves shows that the performance of Midpoint and 
Largest gap are the best in the upper half, and on the other hand the Return and Midpoint are the best in the 
lower half.  
Future research can be focused on investigating different layouts and other picking systems.

Abstract 
Forecasting of future crude oil price in one of the most challenging problem in forecasting 
technique due to its haphazardness, non-linearity and complexity, many models are available to 
predict these non-linear and complexity. Recently, many researchers developed models based on 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and 
Moving Average (MA). In this paper, we developed a crude oil price forecasting model based on 
Hidden Markov Model due to its proven fittingness for modeling vigorous systems and pattern 
classification. We apply the HMM methodology to forecast the crude oil price from 1996 to 2015 
using available past datasets from West Texas Intermediate. We used Matlab software in training 
and validating the data. The results obtained using Hidden Markov Model is inspiring because of 
the little error given. Lastly, we recommend development of fusion models by employing Hidden 
Markov Model with other lenient computing models.

1. Introduction
Crude oil is a critical and unavoidable product around the world. It is essential part of the financial development of 
the developing and developed countries in the study of Benería and Floro (2015). Moreover, political occasions, 
climate, unpredictability, multifaceted nature in crude oil market are a few determinants of unrefined petroleum 
price Kilian and Murphy (2014). The impact of unrefined petroleum price unpredictability will colossally 
influences significant number of market practitioners which have direct impact on the monetary value. In this 
manner, to diminish the hurtful impact of crude oil price varieties, it is imperative to forecast the variability of the 
crude oil price. 
In spite of the fact that it could be wrangled about that the time of raw petroleum is going to be over on 
the planet. Nevertheless, some inquires about have contended that worldwide request of unrefined petroleum 
would increment for the long haul in spite of the way that crude oil demand from organization for economic co-
operation and development countries (OECD) have declined, however, the need for crude oil has expanded due to 
the expansion in requests of non OECD nations, particularly China Kaygusuz, K. (2012). In addition, the way that 
considerable measure of crude oil comes from the temperamental Middle East implies that there are conceivable 
outcomes of crude oil price instabilities Middle East Research Institute (2015), accordingly, forecasting crude oil

Abstract 
Over time a machine will get experience a decrease in reliability, causing the engine to be damaged at the 
time of operation, thus disrupting the production line. To maintain a machine remains reliable then a good 
maintenance system is required. I this research, we will use Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and 
Reliability Centered Spare (RCS) analysis on the critical system of Goss Universal printing machine based 
on engine failure data. The result of RCM analysis obtained the optimal preventive maintenance schedule 
and the type of treatment, while based on the RCS analysis obtained spare part needs in accordance with 
the maintenance schedule. With the result of this analysis, is expected where the machine will keep good 
and will continue to operate without a sudden breakdown in accordance with the production schedule's 
need.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a basic framework of wireless maintenance system monitoring for manufacturing 
machine and equipment using cloud-based technology. The aim is to minimize the    full wire connection 
and monitoring process so that the access will be more convenient and efficient. By utilization of this 
proposed framework, the current condition of manufacturing machine and equipment could be monitored 
for 24 hours and accessed anywhere and anytime even though we are not in local area network of machine 
or equipment. This system is very useful as an early warning for maintenance department in order to prevent 
the sudden breakdown as well as minimize the worst case like as explosion. Therefore, the maintenance 
team would be possible to make a quick decision and action, whether it need a corrective, preventive or 
other special maintenance action. By this concept, it does not only increase the reliability, availability, and 
maintainability of the manufacturing machine and equipment but also will decrease the maintenance cost 
in overall as well.

Abstract 
Electronic devices used in Bangladesh has played a critical role in promoting the economy and improving 
life of the people across the nation .The global market of electrical and electronic equipment has grown 
exponentially but the lifespan of these products becomes short. Certain components of electronic products 
contains toxic chemicals which can generates a threat to human health and environment thus creating a 
new challenge to the policy makers. Computer, mobile phones and television monitors contain toxic 
chemicals lead, cadmium and mercury. Circuit boards contain nickel, beryllium and zinc and the casing of 
the electronic devices are made from polymer such as PVC. They are directly land filled or incinerated 
and thus increasing risks of cancer and neurological disorders. However, handling and storage of toxic 
chemicals can pose safety and security risks to human health and environment which need to be 
mitigated. This paper presents the mitigation of toxic and hazardous chemical using the supply chain 
concept. It shows that the producers are responsible for their products entire life cycles starting from 
design to disposal. The paper also shows that the recovery of the toxic chemicals from the disposed 
electronic parts can be achieved by using chemical methods or hydrometallurgical methods. Besides it 
shows that the process could be monitored by the application of a developed software. Thus minimizing 
the risk of cancer and neurological disorders and increasing the safety and security to human health and 
environment. Finally it will reduce the quantity of waste/used electronic products for dumping.

Abstract 
Satisfying different consumer preferences was a vital aspect in remanufacturing strategy when 
remanufacturer faced a problem of customer willingness to pay to the remanufactured product. However, a 
strategy to minimize only the remanufacturing cost means that it does not take into account the cost to 
consumers due to remanufactured product variability, as well as the cost of remanufacturer to achieve the 
required specifications by consumers. In order to balance the cost of losses due to the remanufactured 
products variability that consumers received it and the costs incurred by remanufacturing to achieve product 
specifications are by considering the quality loss function. In this paper, we apply Taguchi's quality loss 
function in a model for remanufacturing quality strategy. A numerical example is presented in this work to 
give the illustration of the proposed model solution and application.

Abstract 
Libya offers a unique place for the study of strategic management because it is still a developing nation. 
The problem exists on the issue and challenges faced by manufacturing industrial companies operating in 
Libya where business practices remain severely underdeveloped. However, due to lack of right strategic 
management practices, industries can achieve only 50% of the total production capacity in Libya. This 
suggests further investigations are needed for the advancement of the industrial sector in Libya. This 
research aims to establish and verify the hypothesized relationship between strategic evaluation and 
organizational success and the mediating role of organization’s continuous commitment in Libya’s 
industrial sectors. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from the 223 respondents 
through disproportionate stratified random sampling of employees working at the different industries in 
Libya. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that 
organization’s continuous commitment fully mediates the relationship between strategic evaluation and 
organizational success in the Libyan industry context. For proper implementation of strategic moves for 
Libyan industrial sector needs to confirm the proper practices and support from the senior managers 
towards implementation. This means significant companies should remember that strategic evaluation is 
extremely essential and should not be ignored.

Introduction
Today, organizations of all types and sizes continually face changing situations (Juan, 2010). These changes may be 
minor or insignificant, but there is an urgent need to cope with changes. Being able to cope effectively with these 
uncertainties in external and internal environment and achieve expected levels of performance are real challenges. 
By systematically following strategic management process, strategic decision makers examine all important aspects 
in order to determine the most appropriate decisions and actions (David, 2009),The deliberate structure of the 
strategic management process forces organizational employees to examine relevant variables in deciding what to do 
and how to do it (Coulter, 1998).  
The practice of strategic management is important to evaluate why firms succeed or fail, and why do firms have 
varying levels of performance. It seems that organizations that use strategic management concepts and techniques do 
have higher levels of performance (Abu Bakar, 2011). If it impacts the organization's performance, then it is 
important to know something about strategic management. 
Currently, strategic management is one of the most prominent and relevant areas in the management field. It 
constitutes a set of management actions that enables  company managers to keep aligned with its environment and 
on the correct path of development; Strategy evaluation is essential to ensure that stated objectives are being 
achieved (David, 2009). The final stage in strategic management is strategic evaluation and control. All strategies 
are subjects to future modification because internal and external factors are constantly changing. In the strategic 
evaluation and control process, managers determine whether the chosen strategy is achieving the organization's

Hypothesized Model 
 
It was hypothesized that there was a significant relationship between Strategic Evaluation (SE) and 
Organizational Success (OS) mediated by Organization’s Continuous Commitment (OCC). From the output 
presented, it can be seen that the model fits well (TLI = 0.906, CFI = 0.919, Normed ChiSq = 1.821 and RMSEA = 
0.061). These are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 4 below:

From Table 4, though, the path coefficient between SE and OCC is statistically significant (path coefficient is 0.45) 
Therefore, H1 is accepted. However, the relationship between OCC and OS is also statistically significant (path 
coefficient is 0.40) Therefore, H2 is accepted. However, the relationship between SE and OS is 0.15, the relationship 
is statistically insignificant (p ≥ 0.05). H3 is rejected. In this case, this study confirms that full mediation occurred as 
the direct relationship between IV and Dv is statistically insignificant, but the indirect relationship between IV and 
Dv through MV is statistically significant. Therefore, H4 is accepted.

Conclusion 
 
To examine the dimensionality of Strategic Evaluation (SE) in the Libyan organizational context, it was 
hypothesized that there is a significant relationship between Strategic Evaluation and Organization’s Continuous

Commitment. Both CFA and SEM results support this hypothesis. The indicators of the Strategic Evaluation (SE) 
construct are confirmed to be statistically significant. Attempt to examine the relationship between strategic 
evaluation and organizations’ continuous commitment shows that strategic evaluation also has a significant 
influence on Libyan organizations’ continuous commitment. This also shows the deliberate structure of the strategic 
management process that force Libyan employees to examine relevant variables when deciding what to do and how 
to do it in Libyan organizations.  
With their strong statistical magnitude and covariance with all Strategic Evaluation (SE) components (Figure 1), 
giving much attention to these components in the Libyan organizational context can increase productivity. Thus, the 
strategic evaluation and control should not be ignored by any companies.  The strategic evaluation and control are 
the last stages in the strategic management model (Andrews, 1971; Anderson & Sohal, 1999; Analoui & Karami, 
2003) The results are compared with desired performance, and later on, managers make the required adjustments to 
the formulated strategy and/or the implementation (Macmillan & Tampoe, 2001; Karami, 2005). Companies should 
remember that strategic evaluation and control is extremely essential and should not be ignored (Aaker, 2001; 
Macmillan & Tampoe, 2001; Karami, 2005; Hitt et al., 2012). The findings of this study are also similar to the past 
researches (e.g. (Andrews, 1971; Miller & Friesen, 1984; Anderson & Sohal, 1999; Aaker, 2001; Analoui & 
Karami, 2003; David, 2009; Hitt et al., 2012) where the authors proposed that despite the fact that good strategies 
cannot be implemented effectively, it remains a critical challenge to the strategic leadership and the whole 
organization (Dudin, 2013; Fiberesima & Abdul Rani, 2013). Finally, as the country’s private sector is known to be 
less productive, the parameters established can encourage workers in the Libyan manufacturing sector to work with 
increased efficiency and productivity through the deployment of proper strategic management techniques for 
business success.

Abstract 
The Development of Integrated Child-Friendly Public Space (RPTRA) had experienced a lot of time 
overrun caused by poor management of the stakeholders. Stakeholders are the important elements to 
manage. In this research, surveys are conducted on the interests of internal and external stakeholder are 
identified in order to improve the time performance in the development of RPTRA. The identifications 
key based on the survey result were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (Smart PLS 3.0) 
software on getting relationship pattern and strategy among stakeholders subsequently that can improve 
the time performance based on PMBOK.

. 
In 2016 fiscal year , Government of DKI Jakarta had built 123 RPTRA and spread throughout the city of DKI 
Jakarta province. This work was done by 1 (one) Contractor assisted by several Sub Contractors and 1 (one) 
Construction Management Consultant. 
The development of RPTRA faced many problems which resulted in the delay of implementation time from 
the initial planned time. The problems encountered during the development were changes on the location of the 
development, the structure design planning is not timely delivered as scheduled, the delay in material supply 
delivery by the contractor, the lack of man power resource in the field, the Construction Managment (CM) 
Consultant inability to encourage contractors to work without being equipped with budget plan due to delay on the 
design and build contract, and the development rejection by the community. All of these problems had impact on the 
addition of execution time in development contract, as shown in Table 1. 
Stakeholders in accordance with the PMBOK Guide fifth edition (2013) are the people, groups or 
organizations that will have an impact or impacted from project decisions, activities or outcomes. Therefore, 
customer satisfaction has an important influence on the success of a project (Davis, 2014; Serrador and Turner, 
2015).

Abstract 
In a project plan, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) has been defined as the total representation of 
the work or stage, including from start to finish the project has a role in project quality. WBS has many 
roles in every construction project such as buildings, bridges, roads, and many more. In many condition, 
many bridge construction projects in Indonesia are not in line with planning in terms of schedules and 
costs, therefore the importance of WBS development especially the risk-based bridge construction 
project. The result of the following research are expected to be a reference in bridge construction projects. 
The result indicates taht standarized WBS consist of 4 primary level and 2 complementary levels, with 9 
dominant risk variables on safety performance, and recommended risk responses as the developement.

1. Introduction
Successful project management depends on a well-planned for assigning, scheduling, and controlling progress of
the resources [1]. One importnat factor of a construction project performance is the compliance with safety plan and 
safety procedure [2]. In case of safety, the high number work accidents and casualties caused many negative impacts, 
such as financial loss [3]. In addition, work accidents can also lead to prosecutions and claims that will have an 
impact on additional costs, job delays, bad publicity, and can threaten the corporate financial [4]. To realize a safety 
of construction project, it is necessary to have a well-planned safety planning that have been prepared before the 
construction phase begins [5]. 
The developement of Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is the first step in the planning process after defining 
project requirements. The definition of activity is the most critical in planning process, that a project manager should 
spend more effort to identify the project activity using the WBS [6]. WBS is breakdown of project works into 
smaller components so it can be better managed and measured against the ultimate completion [7]. Although each 
project is unique, most of bridge construction works can be standardized to enable the provision of basic activities to 
have robust estimates for project management [8]. 
Therefore, the development of risk-based standardized WBS of construction of bridge for safety plan is proposed. 
The objectives of this research are to identify the following: 
1. To identify standardized WBS for bridge construction
2. To identify methods that used for every work package in cable stayed bridge
3. To identify any activities based on WBS in cable stayed bridge

7. Conclusion 
The first research objective indicate that standardized WBS consists of 4 primary level and 2 complementary 
level, it is also found that the alternative of design or method is not a hierarchy within the WBS structure, its 
importance is to be functioned as determinant to detail the WBS level 5 activity. The second research objective 
generates 9 dominant risks towards safety performance after qualitative risk analysis, the highest risk score obtained 
from the category of design or method. The third research objective shows that not every risk responses can be 
adopted directly into related WBS structure. There are 5 different categories and the application becomes project 
executor decision which is heavily influenced by corporate policy such as the organizational strategy, financial 
accounting policy, or project conditions (eg. how large the risk response will affect the project cost). 
Risk-based standardized WBS can be utilized for the basis of safety planning, helping project executor 
identifies project works to the smallest items and setting safety performance for each items in greater accuracy as a 
tool to ensure every work has considered the requirements to respond safety-related risks.

Abstract 
Implementing Quality Management Systems (QMS), Environment Management Systems (EMS) and 
Occupancy Healthy and Safety Management System (OHSMS) on The Construction Project Management 
must orient principle of sustainable improvement. Construction industry uses all of economic, social, and 
environment resource that are at a critical point so that they must be harmonized and efficiency. The 
integration process significantly to impact the sustainability of construction projects management, 
especially risk reduction of economic, social and environmental, organizing a good organization, 
transparent and accountable, optimization of resources, application of reward and punishment and 
development of new innovation technologies. Process integration of management system with clauses in 
the High Level Structure of ISO:2015 impact the system to achieve sustainability improvement. 
Correlation between process integration components is in accordance with the PDCA process approach as 
the main structure of management system standards (MSS). Commitment and awareness of leadership 
become most importance factor in management system to achieve sustainability improvement. Policy and 
planning important factor successes the implementation of the integration process. The process of 
integration of management systems with the model proposed in this research can be applied at the level of 
implementation of different management systems standards.

Introduction
Application of the quality management system (QMS) environmental management system (EMS) and Occupancy 
Healthy and Safety Management System (OHSMS) in the Construction Project Management is an inevitability. The 
application of the various management systems causes the occurrence of conflict and one of the benefits of

goals and objectives of the organization (Mourougan, 2015). The planning stage is an important and influential 
factor significantly to the success of the implementation of the integration process (Rebelo, Santos & Silva, 2014). 
The integration of planning and scheduling to the verification process performance evaluations (Dai, Tan, Su & Li, 
2015). Synergies and coherent between scope, planning and operational systems are important in the integration 
process (Rebelo, Santos & Silva, 2014). Establishment of integrated resources required in the establishment, 
implementation, maintenance, and continuous improvement (Muzaimi, Boon & Hamid, 2016). The audit must be 
scheduled on a regular basis, taking into account the business risks to assess the level of compliance and 
implementation of Integrated Management Systems, its evolution, its effectiveness and possible identification of 
corrections and improvements is necessary, which must be attached and prioritized in the evaluation and 
implementation (Rebelo, Santos & Silva, 2014). Systems integration makes the review of management (performance 
evaluation indicators) for each component within a single management system are planned to ensure the ongoing 
suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness in the continuous improvement (Muzaimi, Boon & Hamid, 2016). 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The process of integration of management systems with the model proposed in this research can be applied at the 
level of implementation of different management systems standards. The integration of process management system 
has a positive impact for sustainability. Component/clauses contained in the annex to ISO: 2015 is an effective way 
for the integration of the system, especially influential operational phase significantly in the integration process. 
Improvement is component towards sustainability. Leadership became the most important clause in the integration 
process towards sustainable improvement. Sustainability in the management of the construction project are reduced 
risk of economic, social and environmental, organizing a good organization and the optimization of the use of 
resources.

5.2. Hierarchy of Clause in Integration Process 
 
Hierarchies clause/factors that build the integration process for the order of 1-3, namely leadership, policy, and 
planning can be accepted by all experts, it is indicated that the third clause is the most important thing in the 
integration process (see Table 2). 
 
The big three are the most visible sustainability indicators are as follows: 1. Risk reduction. 2. Conducting a good 
organization, transparent and accountable. 3. Optimization of resources  (see Table 2). It indicated that risk reduction 
is important in a good organization, organization of transparent and accountable are done with the application of 
optimization of resources as well as for development must apply technological innovation for a sustainable system 
effectiveness. 
 
The support and commitment of the top management level are a most important factor in all of stages of the 
integration process of initiation, operation, and maintenance to close of the project (Rebelo, Santos & Silva, 2014). 
Sequence indicator on variable indicator which makes the leadership, commitment and concern of top level 
management at the first rank followed by top level management competencies, it is indicated that the competence of 
top level management also becomes one of the problems in the implementation of the integrated management system 
in line with result research Banihashemi et.al. (2017), that knowledge about sustainability practices is lacking among 
the practitioners of the construction in developing countries because they are more focused on the target time and 
cost and backed by one of the experts in the validation stage results, i.e. with high competency level in top 
management commitment then focus more towards sustainable improvement. 
 
5.3. Integration Process Model 
 
Two models of the development of the integration process that is proposed in this study had characterized the 
relationship between clauses in the process of integration is not too much different. These process integration model 
are carried out depending on the level of the relevant application management system at each company. In the 
implementation of the proposed model is the two to do further studies on the organizational context (clause 4 in ISO: 
2015). The management process can be integrated at different levels of implementation of the standard management 
system (Forslund, 2015). 
 
The integration process is impacted significantly to sustainability, especially in the aspect of balance economic, 
social, political, and environmental (Sadyrtdinov & Rodnyansk, 2015) and decrease environmental impact (Foo & 
Tan, 2016) through a process of risk reduction of economic, social and environmental. The positive impact of the 
integration process toward sustainability in the aspect of organizing a good organization, transparent and accountable 
(Silvius, et.al, 2017), optimization of resources (Klemes, Varbanov & Kravanja, 2013) and technological innovation 
(Porzio dkk., 2016). Sustainable integrated management system will not run without the application of the system of 
reward and punishment. 
 
Continuous improvement is significantly influential for sustainability (Rebelo, Santos & Silva, 2014) in the stage of 
system achieve the effective systems. When the management system has been integrated with the effectiveness and a 
good infrastructure of support improvement is not significant influence for sustainability, but that more significant 
influential is an integration process for sustainability. In that condition, every correlations between clauses are not 
influential significant. 
 
Ten clauses in Appendix MSS published ISO (scope, normative references, terminology and definitions, 
organizational context, leadership, planning, supporting, operations, performance evaluation, and improvement) 
makes it easy to integrate systems (Muzaimi, Boon & Hamid, 2016; Nagel-Picioruş, C.,Nagel-Picioruş,L. & Sârbu, 
2016; Mourougan, 2015) especially influential operational phase significantly in the integration process. 
 
The correlation between the clauses in the integration process embraced the approach of plan-do-check-act (PDCA) 
starting from the policy of the leadership system in the planning stages leading to ""plan"", supporting processes and 
operations in the state of ""do"" performance evaluation, through audit and management review at the stage of ""check"" 
and stage “act” through continuous improvement. The input of the planning process in the integration management 
system is the needs and expectations of stakeholders as well as internal and external issues related organizations

Abstract 
Several vine researchers have pointed out the negative role of water shortage on 
vegetative development and irremediably on the quality of vegetable development eaten in 
fresh and also on wine products and by-products. 
This phenomenon of water shortage is irreversibly associated with a water stress during the 
recovery of the vegetative cycle and the reproductive cycle is really impacted by the water 
deficit observed during the previous decades. 
     Our work on this subject is in concordance and corroborates with those published by 
many authors. 
     The results confirm that a water deficit seriously impacts the phloemian load which 
affects the anthocyaninic loading of grape berries, clearly visible on black and red grape 
varieties, on the sugar level, the acidity of the berries and the premature cessation of growth 
of the fertile branches and clusters compared to non-stressed vines

Abstract 
Additive Manufacturing (AM) or digital manufacturing is the new paradigm shift in the manufacturing 
domain which refers to technologies such as 3D printing, rapid prototyping, digital direct manufacturing, 
layered manufacturing, additive fabrication etc. The products are manufactured or printed using 3D 
printers directly from the CAD model without undergoing the conventional step of process planning that 
exists between the CAD and CAM systems. This technology is still to reach a stage where it could be 
commercially exploited by different manufacturing organizations to gain competitive benefits. Literature 
suggests that it has been already applied to some specific areas where it has levied promising results.  To 
realize the long term benefits, it becomes imperative to align the organizational structure and strategy 
which should support the AM functions or could be successfully implemented. The paper focuses on 
some organizational implications which will pave the way to fully reap the benefits of AM and its 
successful implementation.

Additive manufacturing, organizational strategy, structure 
1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing, 3D printing or rapid prototyping as it referred by many names is the set of advanced 
manufacturing technologies which are resulting into industrial sustainability. The consequences of adopting these 
manufacturing methods leads to localized production and highly customized products based on customer demand. 
These set of processes are often referred as disruptive technologies in literature. The disruptive technologies disrupt 
existing market and position themselves far ahead of existing market trends. They significantly affect all the three 
major domains i.e. product, process and supply chain. It results in redistribution of jobs and demand for low skilled 
workers are reduced due to automation. Supply chains are shortened and various functions in the value chain gets 
integrated. Organizations needs to align themselves to support this particular technology and reap its benefits. This 
paper discusses some prominent implications that additive manufacturing has on organizational strategy and 
structure.       
2. Some Implications on Organizational Structure and Strategy
2.1 Manufacturing and marketing functions comes under one roof
For digital or additive manufacturing based organizations, the manufacturing and marketing division will
be close to one another under one roof supporting mutual functions. In such a changed scenario, the concept of 
virtual teams comes into picture. Virtual teams will be larger in number. The different players of the supply chain 
viz. manufacturers, designers, engineers, marketing personnel and customers will be connected through virtual 
teams. The number of blue collar workers will be greatly reduced in such manufacturing organizations. Employees 
with higher educational qualifications i.e. white collar designates will simultaneously manage the production and

cutting and capacity development. Hence, depending upon their specific orientation, the authors suggested that 
prospector type organizations are most likely to implement a 3-layered or a 5-layered IoT architecture.        
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4: 5-Layer IoT architecture for innovator and prospector type organizations 
Additive or digital manufacturing should be supported with multi-layered IoT technology for effective and better 
performance. Multi-layered architecture of IoT is also suitable for additive manufacturing taking into consideration 
the fact that different kind of materials that can be utilized for this kind of manufacturing having their different 
requirements.   
 
3. Hypothesis Development 
 
Based on our understanding of the existing literature and discussion of theoretical framework, we propose the 
following hypothesis. 
 
Hypothesis 1: Organizations implementing additive manufactucturing technologies exhibit a new strategic 
orientation which is above prospectors/differentiators and below Innovators.      
Hypothesis 2: Organizations implementing additive manufacturing represents ambidextrous organization and 
management. 
Which follows: 
Hypothesis 2a: Organizations implementing additive manufacturing can have simultaneously high and low values 
for the dimensions of organizational structure. 
Hypothesis 2b: Organizations implementing additive manufacturing technologies can represent both task oriented 
and people oriented nature. 
Hypothesis 2c: Organizations implementing additive manufacturing technologies will pursue a pure exploitation 
strategy.  
Hypothesis 3:  The additive or digital manufacturing technologies based organizations are more likely to implement 
7, 9 or higher number of layers based IoT architecture to satisfy their manufacturing planning requirements. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Currently, additive manufacturing technologies have been applied only to a narrow and limited domain which 
includes production of models and prototypes during a product’s development phase, parts for pilot series 
production in medical, automotive and aerospace industries, short series production where tooling costs for casting 
or injection molding would be too high to name a few. However, the potential advantages and flexibility offered by

additive manufacturing can be commercially exploited. The organizational structure and strategy must support the 
technology to reap its full benefits.

Abstract 
Manufacturing organization as an entity is a combination of various functions ranging from production or 
operations, finance, marketing, human resources, R&D or innovation. For the successful running of a 
manufacturing organization, all these functions needs to be aligned, coordinated and implemented in for 
the achievement of common goals of the organization. Functional flexibility is one of the essential aspects 
which equips the organizations to deal with uncertain and dynamic environments. It is also interesting to 
learn that there exists evidence of synergistic relationships between the various functional flexibilities 
within an organization. These relations if properly identified and studied can be exploited further for 
gaining competitive benefits for the organization.   
Keywords 
Finance, marketing, human resources, R&D, synergistic 
1. Introduction
Manufacturing organizations are continuously dealing with environments characterized by uncertainty and 
dynamism. Flexibility has to play its role in this changed environmental scenario. All the essential functions within 
the organization’s domain must be flexible enough to deal these situations. These functions include 
manufacturing/operations, marketing, finance, human resources and R&D or innovation. Various situational 
evidences also point out that there may exist synergistic relations among various functional flexibilities. The present 
study attempts to explore the flexibility dimensions of the various functions of a manufacturing organization and 
tries to establish the synergistic relationships existing between the various functional flexibilities with 
manufacturing/operations. These relationships could be identified and exploited further in various circumstances for 
the competitive benefits of the organization.     
2. Organizational strategy
Defender or cost leader (Miles and Snow, 1978; Porter 1980) are stable type of organizations with a limited
product range catering to a narrow segment of the market. These organizations compete on price or high quality and 
are the lowest cost producers in the industry. They make efficient use of production and distribution of goods and 
services. Technological efficiency is highly emphasized as a result of which production, finance and engineering 
dominates marketing and R&D functions.    
Prospector or differentiator (Miles and Snow, 1978; Porter 1980) are the type of organizations that 
continuously search for new market opportunities. They focus on products highly valued by consumers. A few 
elements of differentiation are pricing and product. They use different manufacturing technologies to develop a 
variety of different product range. Marketing and R&D dominates finance and production. 
3. Investigation of the synergistic nature existing between the different functional
flexibilities (marketing, financial, human resources, research and development)
within a manufacturing organization
3.1 Marketing flexibility: It refers to the ability of an organization to enter and leave the markets, and to 
position itself within the existing and new markets. A marketing flexible organization gains competitive 
advantage as a result of its ability to change and reposition itself rapidly within the competitive global 
markets (Shalender and Singh, 2014). From the exhaustive review of marketing literature, it is evident that

Abstract 
The transformation of telecommunication industry in Malaysia has seen dramatic changes in the last 
decade. This industry provides high speed data, voice services, graphics, television, and video at 
increasing speeds and through diversity of channels. While fixed-line telephonic communication is still 
the core service mode, wireless communication, internet, cable and satellite program distribution are 
improving their share in the overall industry earnings.To sustain productively in this industry, operations 
strategy and critical decisions are important aspects of operations management. This paper reports the 
analysis on the operations management strategies of a telecommunication company (named TC) in 
Malaysia. The current challenges that play an important part in deriving and developing effective 
operations strategies to be in line with the mission and vision of the organization are identified. Analyses 
on the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) and the factors affecting the 
company mission provide the necessary information in helping the company management to make critical 
decisions in developing its operations management strategies. The final section discusses the global 
operations management mission and strategy that would be additional values.

1. Introductions
As telecommunications and computing technologies continue to evolve and shape the national as well as global 
business environment, the high speed broadband Internet readiness of every country becomes an increasingly 
important aspect in influencing the country's global competitiveness. With the emergence of High Speed Broadband 
(HSBB) in recent years, the transformation of the telecommunications industry in Malaysia has shown a dramatic 
positive change. Malaysian lifestyle and business operations has changed dramatically with the introduction of 
teleworking, smart home and tele-health. With support from the Government, HSBB become key national 
infrastructure initiative which will allow Malaysia to enhance its economic competitiveness in the region. It helps 
attract FDI to invest in the country as well as accelerate the nation’s ICT and high-tech aspirations and agenda, 
which is an enhanced skills and knowledge capital workforce. The Telecommunication Company (not the real name 
but shall be referred to as TC in this article) has taken a leading role in implementing and realizing the National 
Broadband Initiative (NBI). The project of High Speed Broadband (HSBB) started in March 2010. It has shown 
positive results where now there are 2.17 million customers having access to high speed internet. HSBB 
effectiveness in providing high-speed internet to users consequently inspired TC to carry out the implementation of

 New technology & Innovation 
 
 Regulatory changes causing constant impact on 
operations 
 Competitive pressure leading to pricing crunch 
 Technological changes 
 
 
Based on these analyses, the management teams will be able to make critical decisions with regards to their 
operations management activities. TC has much strength such as a strong foundation in the telecommunication 
industry and strong brand name.  
 
4.0 Conclusions 
 
The telecommunication company must continuously monitor and evaluate its challenges and SWOT. This could be 
achieved by identifying the detail changes in the current telecommunication marker, even those subtle ones. For 
instance, if a company’s product is receiving small patronage, then perhaps it's time to introduce or vary the product 
based on customer needs and satisfaction. These will provide critical inputs in designing the company’s competitive 
advantage strategies. Critical decisions for TC include those related to fast changing telecommunication technology, 
and consumer needs. Thus, it is essential that for Telecommunication company (TC) to remain competitive in the 
telecommunication market it must continually re-define and re-invent the company’s strategies. Differentiation 
strategy would be best for TC to adopt.

Abstract 
Our research focuses on mud and cement loss during drilling of oil wells. These losses of 
circulation represent a real problem in phase 81/2 and particularly in the geological zone of the clay 
triassic. The problems of loss of circulation in drilling or cementing are too expensive for the oil 
companies and can also, if the problem is not well studied, go as far as the loss of the well. In order to 
avoid or at least reduce these losses of circulation, certain factors must be taken into account, the most 
important of which may be : The precise location of the area at a loss in order to inject the appropriate 
clogging products at the intended. It is in fact a successful mixing of bottom products with surface 
products at low densities while specifying the thixotropic behavior of injection products. Hydrostatic 
pressure must also be sufficient to avoid the creep of the clays and thus avoid the risk of Cracking 
Triassic-Clay. Consultation of records of previous experiments on loss of circulation in neighboring 
fields may also often indicate to us the effective solution to be applied to solve problems of loss. The 
simulation of the injection of drilling mud or cement suspensions into a research laboratory can also 
help us understand and plan this operation. Nevertheless, the ideal solution would be to find an 
injection fluid which incorporates in advance, at the entrance to the loss zone of the clogging products 
in order to reduce the number of cement plugs. This will avoid or at least greatly reduce the triggering 
of the loss while enabling the zone to be consolidated at a loss.

This will avoid or at least greatly reduce the triggering of the loss while enabling the zone to be 
consolidated at a loss. 
Key words: Loss of circulations, thixotropy, clogging, simulation.

Abstract 
Design build is one of project completion method that accepts many risks due to integrated design and 
build activities into one process. In 5 years, 63% from 72 industrial projects with design build contract 
is experiencing cost overrun. One of the risk management strategies due to uncertainty is to include a 
contingency cost amount in the estimated cost. This study aims to model the calculation of risk-based 
contingency costs from each activity in 6 business process contractor design build, start from design, 
procurement, finance, controlling, build, and safety management. In otherhand, the highest risk 
response obtained is used as an additional activity that can respond the dominant risk in order to obtain 
a risk based business process. The method used in this research is monte carlo simullation.

Abstract 
In general, the accreditation is a process intended to ensure that degree programs in engineering fields are 
consistent with regards to quality standards and requirements set by their respective professional 
organizations. Initialed in 1932, as the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD) and then 
in 1980 renamed as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), Inc. is a coalition 
of over thirty five professional societies and organizations with over two thousands volunteers conducting 
program reviews. Over the past two decades, many academic institutions outside the United States had 
prepared and have gone through the accreditation process and more are joining annually. 
This paper presents the process and its challenges as well as the experience gained by an American 
university branch campus in in the Middle East. The paper also presents the benefits of accreditation in 
attracting more academic well-trained students to engineering programs.

1. Introduction
For graduating United States engineers to become licensed professional engineers in their state of employment, a 
degree from accredited engineering programs is essential.  The registration offices for professional engineers and land 
surveyors are often the state arm for granting license to practice engineering as professional engineers. With no 
exceptions, an engineering and in some limited instances a technology degree from an accredited program are required 
for applicants interested in taking the first segment of this exam, Fundamental of Engineering. Hence seeking 
accreditation for engineering and technology programs is considered essential for existence of such programs. ABET 
accredits university programs in engineering, engineering technology, computing, and applied and natural science

through its four Accreditation Commissions. Each commission regularly reviews its criteria and procedures and makes 
appropriate adjustments as needed. Although preparing an engineering program for accreditation has been mapped 
very clearly by ABET, the preparation of self-study, course materials, and above all training the program faculty and 
staff to fully understand and appreciate the roadmap to a successful and sustainable ABET visit demands attention 
and discipline. 
 
 
2. Accreditation Criteria 
Engineering Accreditation Commission currently requires that every engineering program meets eight criteria 
developed by ABET for engineering disciplines.  These include students, program educational objectives, student 
outcomes, continuous improvement, curriculum, faculty, facility, and institutional support. In addition, each program 
must meet the required program criteria. Although all eight criteria are equally important, more attention is normally 
devoted to criteria two, four and five. 
 
Criterion 2, Program Educational Objectives, is defined as “board statements that describe what graduates are expected 
to attain within a few years after graduation.”  Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) are required to be aligned with 
the institution’s mission and needs of the program constituencies.  Programs are required to develop and systematically 
utilize a documented process which allows PEOs to be periodically reviewed and revised as needed per needs of the 
program constituencies and the institution’s mission.  Some of the challenges with this criterion include that PEOs are 
not consistent with the definition of the “broad statements of what graduates are expected to attain” or all 
constituencies’ needs are not sought and incorporated. 
 
Criterion 4, Continuous Improvement, requires that “the program systematically uses appropriate documented 
processes to assess and evaluate the extent to which the Student Outcomes (a-k in the Criterion 3) are being attained.” 
This criterion also requires that results of these evaluations be utilized for the improvement of the program. 
Assessments in general could be a combination of both direct and indirect methods, however, they have to be 
appropriate and show what has been measured and how the objectives have been achieved.   
 
Criterion 5, Curriculum, this criterion requires that subject areas appropriate to engineering, however, it does not 
prescribe specific courses must be taken by students.  This criterion requires that a program curriculum devotes 
appropriate time and attention to subject areas aligned with the objectives of the program and mission of the institution.  
Engineering curriculum normally requires one year of a combination of college level mathematics and basic science 
and one and one-half year of engineering topics appropriate for the program of study.  There are no minimum number 
of required hours for the general education courses, except these courses must be aligned with the program and the 
institution objectives. 
 
Furthermore, the program is expected to periodically revisit its curriculum and maintain a strong tie with its industry 
advisory board, and solicit input regarding its content in order to achieve a high placement rate for the program 
graduates. Therefore, a strong, sustained and collaborative partnership with industry representatives is essential. Many 
engineering programs examined best practices of engaging members of industry advisory boards to elicit feedback, 
input and ideas that support effective assessment, refinement of curricula and continuous improvement. However, full 
benefits including experience and talents which abundantly exit in members of the advisory board are not utilized. It 
has been observed in many occasions that poorly managed and under-utilized advisory board rapidly either becomes 
ineffective or dissolved over a period of time. 
 
 
3. Conclusion 
Many engineering programs outside the United States have either recently gone through the ABET process or aligning 
their programs to meet the requirements to become an ABET accredited. ABET-accredited engineering programs must 
maintain and adapt curricula, student outcomes and educational objectives that reflect and respond to the needs of 
industry and the engineering discipline seeking accreditation.

Abstract 
In the context of SMAC technology, the paper investigates the analytics focus that plays a vital in the 
business strategy. The SMAC technology has been using to insight into business issues to increase the 
firm’s performance and sustain the business. On the basis of a comprehensive literature survey, we 
explore the two business strategy such as cost leadership and differentiation and two types of innovation 
focus such as exploratory & exploitative. Analytics focus in the firms is increasingly recognized as the 
application base that leads to enhancing competitiveness. Further, we build a theoretical framework and 
give four propositions that can clearly identify how the different strategic firms would require different 
types of analytics. In addition, we investigate the relationship between exploratory/ exploitative 
innovation, cost leadership/differentiation strategy, and analytics applications.

Introduction
SMAC is the fifth wave of Information Technology Architecture and a new concept of IT model that 
blends Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud technologies (Verma et al., 2016). Social, Mobility, 
Analytics, and Cloud (SMAC) are individual technologies and platforms which have risen during the past 
few years and have shown immense growth while each of these four components has been evolving 
individually, companies are beginning to treat them as an integrated whole (Gohel & Gondalia, 2014). It 
is the newest version of ICT (Information and Communication Technology). All four attributes of SMAC 
play a vital role to increase business performance. In this paper, we focus on single attribute i.e. Analytics 
application. SMAC based organizations are capable to develop an attractive customer engagement 
process and it consequently unfolds vast revenue opportunities for business. 
There are many studies in the literature that show that strategic alignment with information technologies 
is important and that it improves business performance (Choe, 2003; Chivandi et al., 2014). Additionally, 
Guttman (2004) noted that when IT and business strategies are properly aligned, the various parts of an 
organization move synchronously to better achieve results. Furthermore, according to Teece et al. (1997), 
IT has an influence on strategic alignment. Moreover, Luftman and Brier (1999) state that strategic

1. Introduction
It has been argued elsewhere that new venture formation and small companies with high growth 
potential, represent the greatest opportunity for the creation of jobs in economies across the globe 
(Bolton, 1971; Birch, 1987; Davis et al., 1996; Kelley et al., 2012). The process of new venture 
formation also provides an answer to the question “What purpose does an incubator serve?” Two 
main drivers for incubation have emerged: (1) incubation is a way of addressing market failures, 
which limit the ability of small high-tech start-ups to overcome uncertainty (Hansen et al., 2000); 
and (2) it helps overcome obstacles associated with the early stages of firm development (Dee et 
al., 2011; McAdam and McAdam, 2008). 
Since the first recognized incubator was established in Batavia, New York in 1959, the offer has 
grown from the provision of a shared workspace to a nurturing environment (McAdam and 
Marlow, 2008; Rothschild and Darr, 2005), providing access to business services (Lee and 
Osteryoung, 2004), business management and operational support (Scillitoe and Chakrabarti, 
2010; Nouira et al., 2005), and networking opportunities with seasoned entrepreneurs (Hoang and 
Antoncic, 2003), venture capitalists and mentors (Lalkaka and Bishop, 1996; Siegel et al., 2007). 
In addition, taking into account conditions specific to a country or university (e.g., geographic 
localization, university management, funding, awareness, researcher motivation) is essential to 
understand how to optimize internal university support infrastructure. Investigations into the

Abstract  
According to the NHS Confederation (2012), “It’s not good to be a patient stuck on an ambulance trolley in a 
corridor, but the patients at risk are the road traffic accidents or heart attacks still waiting for the ambulance 
service to respond”.     Ambulance Turnaround time is a measure of particular interest in the performance of 
Emergency Medical Systems (EMS). It determines the degree of coordination and communication with the health 
institutions where each patient will receive his final treatment.  Its value is key in the determination of the 
ambulance capacity of the operations system of an EMS institution. Long turnaround times decreases the 
availability of ambulances for future services and furthermore, it increases ambulance response times and 
patient´s health risk. This work is about applying an improvement approach based on Lean Thinking for reducing 
ambulance turnaround time in the EMS operations of the Red Cross located in metropolitan Monterrey, Mexico. 
Results of the application are provided.

Introduction
The fundamental responsibilities of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems are to provide urgent medical care, such as 
pre-hospital care, and to transport the patient to the hospital if needed. The efﬁciency of EMS systems is a major public 
concern.  
According to Fitch et al., (2015), EMS systems are to provide urgent medical care, such as pre-hospital care, and to 
transport the patient to the hospital if needed. The activities involved are: 
-
Receive emergency call and an ambulance is assigned.
-
Ambulance preparation.
-
Transporting the ambulance to the emergency scene.
-
Serving the injured or sick person until he is stabilized.
-
Transfer the customer to a health institution.
-
Delivering the customer to the health institution.
-
Transportation back to ambulance base.
The activities previously described are part of the ambulance cycle. According to Blackwell et al., (2009), the provision of 
optimal emergency medical services care in the pre-hospital environment requires a high level of coordination and integration 
of multiple operational and clinical resources utilized by many people located at different places. Activities such as call 
taking and dispatching, scene response, on-scene patient care, triage and hospital destination decisions, continuing care

turnaround time is in the order of 54%. These new time levels provide an increase on ambulance service capacity from four 
services per day to almost six, about 50% increase in ambulance capacity.

Abstract  
 
Coordination members in supply chain need effective communication and information flows. One of tools 
which can support the coordination is agent-based model. In this study, it is considered independent 
partners consisting of one manufacturer and two suppliers which have individual decision for its 
production planning and the decision must be synchronize each other to achieve supply chain goal 
particularly to have higher service level for customer order. Agents represent supply chain members 
aforementioned who will exchange information and decision related to production planning.  In this 
conceptual model, it will be described the production planning decision of individual participant which 
will be exchanged between supply chain members by agent-based modelling. Collaborative production 
planning is useful to achieve mutual benefit supply chain member by synchronizing their plan and 
deciding the most beneficial production planning.

Abstract 
This paper presents the novel mathematical model which considered the outbound scheduling problem in 
the multi-door cross docking system. The proposed model is different from other truck scheduling models 
due to the characteristic of the outbound trucks in which each outbound truck can make multiple trips to 
deliver products to different sets of customers. In addition, it is desired that outbound trucks leave the dock 
doors as close to their predetermined due time to ensure customer satisfaction. To determine optimal 
solutions for this problem, the problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. The 
objectives are to minimize the total tardiness and the total earliness of all outbound trucks. The model is 
solved using the exact method of LINGO programming solver. The experimental results are executed in 
two phases. First, the optimal truck schedules are obtained by optimizing two objectives separately. Then, 
the multi-objective approach is used to find a set of solutions so that the decision makers can make a 
decision based on their preferences. The numerical results illustrate that, the model can only find optimal 
solutions for the small-size problems, however; it could not find optimal solutions for the large size 
problems within reasonable time.

1. Introduction
Nowadays the organization has a focus on speed in responding to customer’s demand, which is extremely important 
in competition with other companies. Cross docking is a logistic strategy in which inbound trucks deliver products 
from suppliers and transfer their loads into outbound trucks to customers directly. Cross docking function as a 
distribution centers. The typical operations in a distribution consist of five main operations: receiving, sorting, storage, 
order picking, and shipping. The most expensive and resource consuming processes are storage and order picking 
activities. Cross docking functions as a distribution centers with elimination of these two expensive activities as much 
as possible. As a result, the inventory is held at the minimum level and the delivery lead time is shortened. Therefore, 
the aim of cross docking system is to minimize inventory management cost while achieving customer satisfaction with 
fast delivery. Many industries adopt the concept of cross docking to eliminate high cost activities. However, the 
completed coordination of the inbound and outbound trucks is difficult to achieve because an organization should 
have a decent plan and well synchronize schedule. It requires specific technologies, which would lead to higher initial 
investment in the basic structure than that of traditional distribution centers (Belle et al., 2012). 
Truck scheduling problem is one of crucial problems in cross docking operational activities that has been studies 
extensively. Miao et al. (2009) presented an application of Tabu search (TS) and Genetic algorithm (GA) for solving 
truck scheduling problems in cross docking. Two objectives; minimization of the operational cost and minimization 
of total number of unfulfilled shipments, were considered. They used ILOG CPLEX in order to find optimum solutions 
and compared solutions derived from the two metaheuristics. The computational experiment showed that the 
metaheuristics, especially TS, outperformed the CPLEX solver in nearly all test cases adapted from industrial 
applications. Soltani and Sadjadi (2010) presented an application of two hybrid metaheuristic algorithms named as

4. Conclusion
This paper considers the scheduling problem of outbound trucks in the multi-door cross docking system. Each 
outbound truck can make multiple trips to deliver products to different sets of customers. In addition, it is desired that 
outbound trucks leave the dock doors as close as their predetermined due time to ensure customer satisfaction. To 
determine optimal solutions for this problem, the outbound truck scheduling is formulated as a Mixed Integer 
Programming (MIP) model. The objective of the model is to minimize the total tardiness and the total earliness of all 
outbound trucks. The model is solved using the exact method of LINGO programming solver. The experimental results 
are executed in two phases. First, the optimal truck schedules are obtained by optimizing two objectives separately. 
Then, in the second phase, the multi-objective approach based on the weighed sum method is used in order to find a 
set of solutions according to the different combination of objective weights. Therefore, the decision makers can make 
a decision based on their preferences. Since the problem is NP-Hard, the numerical results illustrate that the proposed 
mathematical model is able to find optimal solutions only for the small-size problems. However; it cannot find optimal 
solutions for the large size problems within reasonable time.   
The further works include the improvement of the mathematical model to take into account of more complex 
constraints to represent real-world practices. Moreover, for highly complicated problems consisting of many trucks 
and many doors, other solution tools such as heuristic and meta-heuristic models could be used instead.

Abstract 
Corn is the core competence of the district of Majalengka, West Java. However, the use of corn 
in this area are still limited on corn seed processing into processed food ingredients. The waste 
that consist of husks, cobs, leaves and stems has not been optimally harnessed, since they only 
processed as food for livestock, organic fertilizer, or even thrown out. Since higher corn yields 
per acre will result in larger amounts of the waste, it is needed to do research to determine either 
the husks, the cobs, the leaves or the stems, that if it is harnessed, will provide the best value 
added, to increase the citizen welfare. In this study, the performance of four alternative corn 
waste are examined and compared using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. This 
method was chosen to use as tools to facilitate the decision making task.

Abstract 
Attributed to the rapidly maturing and evolving application of electronics packaging, efficient 
packaging processes are crucial in ensuring high quality and reliability of products. One of the elements in 
efficient packaging processes is the minimization of capacity losses. Most of the devices are patterned onto 
wafers, specifically for the front of line integrated circuit (IC) packaging. In this area, various capacity loss 
factors need to be correctly identified and integrated into production planning to prevent low fill rate, 
expansion of lead time and work-in process (WIP) build-up. This research is based on a case study; wherein 
potential capacity loss factors of a chosen front-of-line production are investigated to identify their impact 
on production performance. Mathematical models of various factors are integrated into the simulation 
model of the current production. The performance measure data are then collected and analysed, thus 
determining the significant capacity loss factors. It was found that cycle time, setup time, yield loss and 
machine downtime are significant capacity loss factors in front section of line packaging.

3.1 Discussion   
  
Reduction of cycle time is vital to retain capacity yield in the industry. Based on the mathematical model of cycle time 
(Eqn. (1)), it is proven that the processing cycle time and batch quantity affect the cycle time in progress. Practitioners 
are advised to reduce the batch quantity in order to diminish the effect of capacity loss. Yield loss in the production 
line is controlled on 2% in overall production. 2% defect variety is a restricted yield loss limit. Therefore, it can be 
said that the reduction of yield loss factor only plays a minor role in capacity loss reduction. The yield loss factor only 
significance on the total production measures, i.e. make span. In the Dunnett Test, only 20% and 30% reduction of 
machine downtime show significant comparison with the control group. Hence, large reduction on machine downtime 
can be translated to better production yield. Practitioners can increase the mean time between failures, or reduce the 
mean time for repair, thus increasing the machine availability and reducing machine downtime. Setup time has limited 
effect on the average flow time and throughput rate. Despite the situation, setup time influences the total production, 
such as make span of product in the production line. In the Dunnett Test analysis, only a large percentage of reduction 
on setup time has significant effect on the performance measures. This occurrence is due to the setup time is less than 
the operation cycle time. Hence, the small percentage of setup time does not affect the overall productivity of the 
organization. In the examination of WIP significance, the low Ftest value indicates that there is sampling variation in 
the experiment. In other words, WIP is not a significant capacity loss factor that may lead to productivity constraint 
in the front of line in IC packaging industry.

4. Conclusion  
  
This study describes a theoretical method in examining the significant capacity loss factors in the front of line of IC 
packaging industry. Five major capacity loss factors noted from literature review (cycle time, yield loss, machine 
downtime, setup time and WIP) have been pinpointed for determining the significance of the factors based on a case 
study. Five experiments are designed to test on the significance of the loss factors on average flow time, throughput 
rate and make span. The analysis indicates that cycle time, yield loss, machine downtime and setup time are the 
significant capacity loss factors in front line of IC packaging industry. The reduction of cycle time and machine 
downtime greatly affects the performance measures. On the other hand, only larger reduction percentage on yield loss 
and setup time will influence the factory performance eventually. It has been found that WIP is not significant in the 
front of line. Future work involves investigation of the capacity loss factors in end of line IC packaging to obtain 
detailed overview of capacity loss factors and their specific cause throughout the packaging line.

Abstract 
 
Relative permeability data are used to predict the most effective hydrocarbon displacement mechanisms 
in a reservoir and how to deplete most of the oil or gas out of the reservoir as quickly and cheaply as 
possible. Determination of capillary pressure and relative permeability are traditionally conducted in 
laboratory. However it is expensive, difficult, and time-consuming to measure capillary pressure and 
relative permeability in many cases. Models representing such relationships show that capillary pressure 
and relative permeability could be inferred from resistivity data using analytical mathematical models 
derived theoretically. In fact two parameters out three (capillary pressure, relative permeability or 
resistivity) could be inferred using these models if only one of the parameters is known. In this paper, 
laboratory measurements of resistivity index, capillary pressure with different techniques, and relative 
permeability were conducted on samples from two fields representing Libyan sandstone and carbonate 
reservoirs in order to review analytical mathematical models correlating resistivity index, capillary 
pressure and relative permeability. The results of relative permeability calculated using these models are 
analyzed and compared with data obtained from laboratory experiments. This paper shows that the three 
flow distribution functions, resistivity index, capillary pressure and relative permeability and also shows 
that relative permeability can be calculated from experimental data of both resistivity index and capillary 
pressure. Good matching between relative permeabilities calculated from models and with experimental 
data.

1. Introduction 
 
It is known that the three important parameters: resistivity, capillary pressure, and relative permeability, are all 
function of fluid saturation in porous medium. This implies that there maybe a correlation among the three 
parameters. Models representing such relationships show that capillary pressure and relative permeability could be 
inferred from resistivity data using analytical mathematical models derived theoretically. Literature on the 
relationship between capillary pressure and resistivity index has been scarce. Szabo [1] proposed a linear model to","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

validity of Eq. 6 in low permeability core samples. Comparing Figure 11 with Figure 10, it can be seen that the 
model (Eq. 6) works better in core samples with low permeabilities than those with high permeabilities. 
 
 
                              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
As demonstrated in Figure 10, Eq. 6 works properly for high values of capillary pressure and resistivity 
(corresponding to low values of water saturations) in core samples with high permeabilities. At high water 
saturations, experimental data deviate the power law model. This maybe because water saturation distribution is 
consistent at high water saturations. In this case, water (wetting phase) remains in both small and large pores. In the 
case of low permeability core samples, the number of data points that deviate the power law model is less than in 
high permeability. This maybe due to the irregular surface of core samples with low permeability or due to existence 
of micro-pore type system. In low permeability rock, most of the pores are small and the pore system maybe 
irregular. As gas saturation increases, first the larger pores dominate the resistivity. At this stage, water saturation is 
still high because micro-pores hold up a large water volume, which causes high resistivity. As gas starts to drain 
water from micro-pores, water saturation decreases sharply with little influence on resistivity, Swanson [10]. 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
The following conclusions may be drawn according to the present study: 
 
 
The three saturation functions, resistivity index, capillary pressure and relative permeability, are coupled 
and can be inferred from each other using mathematical models described in this paper if one of the three 
parameters is known. 
 
 
Relative permeability can be calculated from experimental data of both resistivity index and capillary 
pressure.  
 
 
Good matching between relative permeability predicted from models and that one obtained from 
experimental work directly especially for wetting phase in samples with high permeability. 
 
 
A power law model applies to the relationship between capillary pressure and resistivity index. Ability of 
fitting to experimental data is greater in low permeability rocks than in high permeability rocks.

Abstract 
Turnover rate of employees in head office of a retail company in East Jakarta in the last two quarters of 
2016 is about 6% and 7%. Though the company targets that the turnover rate of employees in the head 
office maximum of 5% in each quarter. Research has been conducted to determine the influence of Salary 
Level, Job Satisfaction, and Organizational Commitment to Turnover Intention (employee turnover) of 
employees at the head office of a retail company in East Jakarta. The sample in this study were 100 
employees taken from 102 population. Data analysis using Partial Least Square (PLS). The results of this 
study found that Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment significantly influence the direction of 
negative relationship to Turnover Intention, but Salary Level has no significant effect on Turnover 
Intention. The results showed that employee turnover rate increased in the last two quarters of 2016 due to 
decreased aspects of job satisfaction and employee commitment to the company.

Abstract 
The existing marketing literature of Bass’s innovation -diffusion model and many of its extended forms have been 
applied to depicting and predicting adoption curve for products. The loyalty towards a brand is often reflected when 
the products are bought by the consumer. In such cases, the theory of repeat purchasing exists and the higher is the 
repeat purchase value, it can be said that the better a firm is doing to keep customers loyal. In this paper, we use the 
concept of repeat purchase in an innovation and diffusion model based on 𝐼𝑡̂𝑜 type of stochastic differential equation 
(SDE). Its applicability and accuracy is illustrated by means of new product sales data. Predictive validity and mean 
square error have been used to check the validity of the proposed model. It has been shown that proposed model 
performs comparatively better than SDE-based Bass innovation and diffusion model.

1. Introduction
In today’s era of globalization, new products and technologies are being launched every day in the market by 
individuals, companies or organizations to keep up with the market and to save themselves from decline/fall. The 
major reasons why innovation is a survival skill are increasing competition, increased globalization, advanced 
technology, free trade, increased consumer expectations, changed workforce demographics, better communication 
channels and shorter life cycle of the products. However, at the same time, in the development and promotion of 
new product, risk of financial loss is also involved which calls for a judicious planning, risk analysis, market 
research and scientific decision–making. 
Diffusion theory is a technique which describes how, why and at what rate a new product, idea or a service will be 
adopted in the society among consumers known as the potential adopter population. Since its introduction in 1960s, 
research work has been done by many of the researchers of various different fields to develop analytical models to 
predict the adoption of a new product amongst the potential consumers of the social system, Bass (1969) model 
being the earliest and most widely used for describing the diffusion of innovation. The diffusion of innovation is a 
process by which an innovation or an idea is communicated through certain channels over a period of time among 
the members of the social system. The main four diffusion variables in a diffusion process are firstly, the innovation 
itself, which is an idea, time, a practice or an object which is professed to be new by an individual, members of the 
social system or any other unit of adoption. The channels of communication are the means by which information is 
spread into or with in social system. Time is the rate at which innovation is diffused into the social system or is 
accepted by the members of the system. Individuals, companies and organizations which share a common culture 
and form a potential adopter population for innovation is known as the social system. 
In the last several years, a considerable body of literature in the areas of innovation diffusion has been studied in 
depth by researchers from different disciplines, social sciences, economics and marketing (Easingwood, Mahajan 
and Muller, 1983; Mahajan and Peterson, 1985; Rogers, 1983). The main focus of the diffusion models in marketing 
is related to modelling and forecasting of the diffusion of innovations. The diffusion of a new product in marketing

4. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
In Table 2, we summarize the values of parameter estimation. From the Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed 
model describes the adoption growth and fits in all the data sets and performs better than Kapur et al (2012) 
stochastic differential based Bass model. If we discuss about the proposed model, we have seen that proposed model 
fits best in data set DS-I and DS-II with lower value of MSE and R2 in comparison to data set DS-III and DS-IV. 
Although the proposed model is not among the best fit for DS-III and DS-IV but gives better fit than Kapur et al 
(2012) model.  The proposed model describes the concept of repeat purchase growth in the adopter potential. From 
the Table 2, it has been observed that there is very low repeat purchase behaviour for the product as expected. As we 
observed that repeat purchase behaviour is more applicable to consumable product but it can’t be ignored for the 
case of technological consumer durable products.  
 
The loyalty towards a brand is often reflected when the products are bought by the consumer.  The adoption of 
newer version shows consumers’ loyalty for the firm’s products. To estimate the initial size of the potential 
population for the new products of the existing firm, measurement of loyal population for the same firm is very 
important. In such case, the theory of repeat purchasing is exist and the higher is the repeat purchase value, it can be 
said that the better a firm is doing to keep customers loyal. In this paper, we use the concept of repeat purchase in an 
innovation and diffusion model based on 𝐼𝑡̂𝑜 type of stochastic differential equation (SDE). Its applicability and 
accuracy is illustrated by means of new product sales data. Predictive validity and mean square error have been used 
to check the validity of the proposed model. It has been shown proposed model performs comparatively better than 
SDE-based Bass innovation and diffusion model

Abstract 
Today's modern banking calls for delivering quality service and it is considered an effective strategy for 
success and survival in the competitive environment. 
Thirty public and private major Iranian banks are working in different fields of business areas and 
offering various deals to their customers. 
Spite of Iran Central Bank (ICB) which over rules Iranian bank industry regulations. Doing best, Banks 
for their competitive job requires proper Information Technology infrastructure.  
Inadequate ICB constraints put limits to bank's industry. Therefore, push banks to spend lots of money to 
invent different methods for facing those constraints and limitations to survive in competitive market. 
Therefore, major banks for cooperation with international monetary system, individually or some together 
established a third company. Some purchased a new core banking platform using foreign developed 
software. 
This research has taken place in a well-known large private Iranian bank to overcome above mentioned 
problems. Expecting come up with either developing or purchasing core banking system able to support 
banking Open API.  
Delphi method was used to establish the validity of the proposed methods. The result showed 
combination of second and third method is the best. First alternative was eliminated because of cost, lack 
of internal experts and high dependency.

Abstract 
Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery (TEOR) is a family of tertiary processes defined as “any 
process in which heat is introduced intentionally into a subsurface accumulation of organic 
compounds for the purpose of recovering fuels through wells”. After hot water and heated gasses 
have been tried, the most common and effective vehicle used to inject heat is saturated steam. 
Most of commingle thermal wells has a problem in steam intensity distribution among the layers, 
which will lead to inconsistency in steam adsorption and some layers would adsorb more than 
double of the designed steam injected volume.  This phenomenon will lead to low productivity 
and negatively impact the distribution of water cut in the different layers. Steam adsorption and 
distribution represent one of the main challenges of heavy oil production from Sudanese oil 
fields. very limited studies have been conducted in this field in Sudan oil fields, and this study is 
focused on addressing this challenge to maximize recover factor from each well and each field.  
In this paper we will highlight the challenge facing Bentiu reservoir in Fula North East (FNE) 
and the Bamboo fields that are located in heavy oil zone with target of production around 85% of 
the total reserves. These fields are of shallow depth ranging between 520m and 13m and rather 
low pressure gradient 1.09 psi/m, and with reservoir temperature around 44 C and 65 C 
respectively. 
The study report our investigation on the benefits of steam adsorption to enhance the oil recovery 
focusing on the distribution of the steam inside the layers. Our ultimate goal is to design an 
optimum steam injection protocol that will maximize the recovery factor from these oil zones. 
The study covers analyzing and reviewing the actual steam intensity distribution among each 
layer in the two fields that are later compared with the designed ones. In a later stage, we 
designed a pilot model that has been designed using advanced thermal EOR Simulator to 
understand the effect of commingle injection and production (Steam adsorption and distribution) 
using data from single layers. 
The results show that the production performance of wells has been improved and  the 
cumulative oil  production increased almost five times compared to last cycle and the cycle 
duration been extended for more than two years..

Abstract 
The joining of millennial generation with their different characteristics and values in the workforce has 
brought new challenges to strategic human capital management. However, research related to employee 
well-being and organizational commitment of millennial generation is still difficult to find in Indonesia. 
This study aims to investigate the role of psychological capital and organizational fit to employee well-
being and organizational commitment of millennial employees in e-commerce industry in Indonesia.  Data 
were collected through a survey of 288 millennial employees who work in e-commerce industry in Jakarta, 
Indonesia. By using structural equation modelling, we found that employee well-being and organizational 
commitment are positively associated with both psychological capital and organizational fit, while 
employee well-being also mediates the relationship between psychological capital and organizational fit 
toward organizational commitment. The results contribute to better understanding of attitude of millennial 
generation in general and specifically to the predictors of employee well-being and commitment at work, 
especially in e-commerce industry. Furthermore, this research also provides both theoretical and managerial 
implications explaining the contribution of human factors in e-commerce industry as well as limitations of 
this study and direction for future research.

In the Ecuadorian Amazon region, the milk chain suffers from an insufficient coordination among the 
delivering actors, that’s why the objective of this article is to diagnose the milk agro-alimentary chain in 
Puyo, Pastaza, in order to propose development strategies. The Strategic Model of Collaborative Planning, 
as methodology, was used. The main results were focused on the characterization of the chain and the 
diagnosis of the integration between the actors and their fundamental weaknesses. The limitation in the 
application was due to the low training and the human potential formation that belong to the chain actors, 
that allows to propose a strategy of sustainable development. In conclusion, the work has, fundamentally, 
a practical value, given by the procedure application feasibility the in the supply chains, under the 
Ecuadorian Amazon conditions.

Abstract 
This paper presents an inclusive review on the application of Lean Six Sigma for strategic transformation 
of business process in a power generation organization. In today’s very competitive business environment 
around the world, organizations need to be lean and mean as their source of competitive advantage. This is 
no different for the company under study. The organization enjoyed steady growth in profit since its 
involvement in power generation business. However, it is becoming more apparent that the organization 
needs to review its internal business process in order to operate at its optimum level. One of the options is 
to implement Lean Six Sigma. In year 2016, the management has decided to deploy Lean Six Sigma as a 
structured methodology to enhance the organizational performance. The organization has chosen to embark 
on Lean Six Sigma journey in conducting its business process transformation and improvement as well as 
cost optimization as the means to improve its profitability. This study attempts to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the implementation. The research is to explore in depth on the characteristics of Lean Six Sigma 
methodology and the factors which may influence its implementation. The challenges faced during the 
journey were examined to identify the limitations of the Lean Six Sigma methodology and any 
improvements that can be introduced to enhance its effectiveness.

As described in Table 4 above, the pilot projects have brought about RM20.5million of Hard Saving (direct 
saving) and RM3.2million of Soft Saving (cost avoidance). In addition to the direct benefits in term soft cost 
savings, the Lean Six Sigma Program has indirectly inculcates the critical thinking habits among personnel 
towards cost optimization in whatever task they are involved in. 
 
During the course of conducting the projects, almost all teams reported that time constraints by the team 
members as one of the hurdles need to be overcome. In the case here, all team leaders and members are from 
respective sections and departments. All of the members have their own day to day operational task. 
Involvement in Lean Six Sigma is additional task to them. To overcome this, again it is important for the 
management to link the success of Lean Six Sigma to a fair reward system to ensure sustainability of the 
program. Another common problems faced was the difficulty to obtain data in terms of quantity as well as 
quality. Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that relies on data. As such, the outcome of it depends a lot on the 
input data. For the organization that is the first time embarking on Lean Six Sigma Program, it is now 
recognized that it is very important to archive data in structured way for easier analysis later. During these 
pilot projects, most of the data were those available in SAP. These are the most reliable and accurate data. 
For those data not available or not stored in SAP, the quality and accuracy of these data can be questionable.

Conclusion 
 
From the study done through two pilot projects, we  conclude  that  Six  Sigma  is  indeed  a  business strategy 
that  can  provide  a  breakthrough  improvement  in the   competitive era. In this paper, only two pilot projects 
were discussed and presented. This may not represent the entire spectrum of what Lean Six Sigma can offer.

It was observed that there were common challenges experienced by the team members during the deployment 
of Lean Sig Sigma such as time constraints, difficulty to obtain past data as well as cost and time incurred. 
Nonetheless, based on the two pilot projects presented here, the benefits gained in terms of direct cost saving 
as well as cost avoidance have far exceeded the initial resources and financial investment made. In addition 
to the direct benefits, the Lean Six Sigma Program has indirectly inculcates the critical thinking habits among 
personnel towards cost optimization in whatever task they are involved in. 
 
The future works may involve the application of Lean Six Sigma methodology in other areas within the 
organization such as power plant’s operation and maintenance strategy as well as business development area 
and as whether or not Lean Six Sigma can be successfully applied as the methodology to assist the strategic 
planning for the organization to support the growth of the organization.

Abstract 
The steel bridge construction project can be successful if the definition of project scope is in accordance 
with the requirements. WBS is a smalles work item and easily controlled. WBS standardization is very 
important because it will greatly affect the cost control. The purpose of this research is to develop WBS in 
steel bridges based on the regulation of the General Specification of Highways 2010 Revision 3 and Special 
Specification of Toll Roads 2017 from Toll Road Regulatory Agency (BPJT) for controlling project cost. 
The results of this study is we can get WBS standards by analyzing possible risks that may affect controlling 
project cost. So it is expected to assist the contractor in the cost control of steel bridge construction projects.

Introduction
In project planning, cost estimation, scheduling, resource allocation and risk management must be
based on WBS [1]. The process of breakdown into smaller and more manageable components of
deliverable and project work is the process of compiling the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) [2].
One of the difficulties encountered in project implementation is the lack WBS standardization which
causes controls to cost and time not well defined. In the details of cost and time is critical to the success
of the project so it is worth while [4]. WBS standardization is critical to the basic presentation and
management of projects from the measurement of each integrated performance [5]. The undefined
project is the first step in the planning process in developing the Work Breakdown Stucture (WBS)
[6]. The main factor in cost control and schedule is financial risk. In avoiding delays and cost overruns
we can used risk analysis so as to assist project managers in managing schedules and costs [7].

Abstract 
As banking business transactions has shifted toward otomation and digitalization, continous improvement 
on banking services are required to stay on top of the line. One of the most important aspects on 
delivering excellent services is how to manage your team working flawlessly as one solid unit. As 
millennial generation start to step in our workforce, some managers found new challenges on managing 
this new force.  Generation gap, has become an important issue, since many conflicts  might possibly 
arise, which could jeopardize company performance. It is important for management, to understand how 
millennial mind works, and  how to make them working as a team with older generation to enhance yje 
quality of service delivered.  The purpose of this research is to present the result of team engagement 
policy applied on Tanah Abang Main Branch of Private Bank ABC in Jakarta. Literature reviews from 
related theories ware used to explained the policy.  Result show very significant increase on service 
quality received by customers, indicating that team engagement policy as one success factor for reaching 
company’ goal

1. Introduction
Nowadays, banking transaction has gradually shifted to online transaction. Less customer came to banking branch, 
usually executed their transaction throgh e-banking facility. Few remains loyal to do transaction the old fashioned 
way, but they become more aware and critical of the quality of service they received, valued more on high touch 
factors rather than high tech factors  (Angur et al 1999).

Let them live and learn. Bank ABC gives away scholarship for bachelor and master degree. This is a very 
nice advantage to retain employee, because employee will feel that the company actually care about their 
wellbeing. Also, Bank ABC set up e-learning system that can be accessed from all branches around 
Indonesia. This system makes employees more flexible and relax while taking the time to learn. Of the 
three generations, the opportunity to study independently is an excellent opportunity. E learning moduls 
were set at a wide range, from basic computer knowledge, mastering english as second language, banking 
procedures, self improvement, even including ceritified assessment.  
As for banking services, managers make a drastic improvement as follow : 
1.
Every frontliners was role-played everyday, to make sure that they were able to generate warm service and
nice conversation with customers. Frontliners that showed positive progress during this session was praised
and rewarded, and they would lead next role-play session. These reward is proven to increase frontliner’ self
esteem, awareness, and sense of belonging, beside improving their service skills.
2.
Supervisors are in charge of maintaining customer comfort during the operational banking hours, in addition
to running everyday routine task. They have to make sure, for example, that the air conditioning is running
well, magazines on banking hall is up to date, banking hall are spotless, etc.
3.
Tanah Abang branch launched Service from the Heart Policy, where all staff focused on well being of their
customer. Frontliners were stationed on strategic places, keep customer company while waiting in line,
serving snack and beverages, offering magazine or tv channels, making all service at its warmest and most
personal.
4.
After services, customers are called to ask for their opinions about services received, and the result be shared
among the frontliners to ensure the customer input is delivered well, and followed up to improving service
delivered. Customers got informed when their opinion be used for service improvement, to make them feel
involved and proud.
5.
Cooperation also runs with all parties involved with frontliners, for example the security and cleaning
service officer. Managers from different units, worked together to maintain excellent service.
By the end of 2015, service score has skyrocketed to average 4,85, making it the highest score achieved 
nationally.  Tanah Abang branch received several award for conducting best service including the most prestigious 
Customer Engagement Award. Engagement and service improvement policies applied in Tanah Abang Branch was 
praised and benchmarked by other branches. 
4. Conclusion
To achieve excellent service quality, depends on how managers build the team. Boomers, Xers, and  Millennials 
should work together as one entity. Have the same goal and purpose of working. It is manager’s duty to build a 
positive environment where all generation can work together in harmony. 
Millennials often misunderstood as generation of problems, on the contrary, their spirit and carefree attitude are 
their best advantage. And despite what people believe, the have desire for collaboration. They work well alone, but if 
motivated with right guidance in presumably perfect working environment, they can also work better together (Martin 
2005). Previous generation should also be handled properly. With the inclusion of millennials into workforce, 
boomers and Xers could feel neglected. Proper management step is needed to overcome a strong sense of competition 
between generations, and build teams where all team members feel respected and involved. Managers must perform 
their functions actively, in a broad spectrum, serving not as superiors but also as coaches, lecturers, even as advisers, 
to achieve optimal team performance. What companies need to take care of, is how to maximize their strengths, rather 
that tap the differences. Intergenerational relationships must always be monitored, to overcome the generation gap, 
which can be a contra-productive factor for the success of the company 
To provide the best services in the banking industries, company must constantly making continuous improvement, 
because customers' expectations keep increasing. Services provided today, will become out of date next year, so that it 
must be constantly upgraded. Feedback for improvement, can be obtained from our own team or from customers.  
For further research, empirical studies should be applied to identify more problem regarding team work and 
enhancing service quality.  Datas from wider range of branches should be used, to make the model more accurate.

Abstract  
In this paper, using lean principles, we assessed one of the cross-docking DC operations in the USA. 
Specifically, a value stream map was developed to identify existing operational areas of waste and 
opportunities for improvement. According to the data, collected through filed observations and analysis 
using the lead-time concept, several areas of waste were identified in the cross-docking operations. Waste 
was manifested in the long queues, poor staff planning, lack of floor supervision and direction, 
overproduction, shifts and breaks transitions, and in the lack of discipline and sense of urgency. These 
types of waste contributed to the long lead-time, in some cases as much as six hours, where a carton could 
have taken only seven minutes from the inbound to the outbound step. 
The outcome of this study adds to the body of cross-docking operations knowledge. In addition, the study 
makes a contribution to the understanding of cross-docking workflow and lead-time issues, and the 
importance of value stream mapping in identifying waste in order to maximize throughput.

1. Introduction
The role of Distribution Centers (DC’s) in the supply chain has changed over time, evolving from serving as storage 
locations to becoming postponement operations for manufacturers. This is the result of strategic planning, in supply 
chain management, to release manufacturers from dealing with the added complexity of distributing goods to several 
customers, either end-users or retailers. Distribution Center operations, today, are becoming more complex than in 
the past. For instance, current DC operations entail receiving finished goods, in cartons, through what is known as 
“inbound;” then, depending on the type of operations in each DC, a variety of other processes could take place. For 
example, the cartons could be sent directly, on pallets and utilizing forklifts or automated conveyors, to temporary 
storage areas. DC’s process temporary storage differently depending on their end customer requirements. There 
could be manual picking, case picking, pallet picking, items sorting, or cross-docking to the final shipping areas, 
which is known as outbound operations, or shipping, where boxes and pallets are loaded into trailers and shipped to 
retailers and customers. These processes, therefore, require planning and control, similar to any manufacturing 
operation. 
The complexity of a DC’s operations, in today’s challenging and variable working environment, has increased under 
the influence of three main factors, namely; higher expectations from customers and management, cost savings 
pressure, and more volume processing requirements. Therefore, the management of any DC is faced with the 
challenge of running their operation more effectively and efficiently. In this study, we mainly focus on assessing a 
cross-docking DC using the lean analysis approach. The objective of our study is to identify existing opportunities in

operators responding to such waste, simply said, “Do not worry about red lights, I have been here for a long time 
and I know what I am doing…this is double stacking.” 
4.3.3.2 Overproduction 
Supervisors had the habit of stocking depalletization when there was no need. This created over-production and 
unnecessary inventory, and led to over-processing and overtime. The main objective should have been to tailor 
production to meet demand – not to indulge in over-production. Supervisors tended to run production based on the 
number of people on shift, not the levels of required production. This was done by placing more operators on the 
inbound and depalletization side rather than the outbound side, where the problem of recirculation was exacerbated. 
4.3.3.3 Shifts and Breaks Transition 
One of the areas of waste observed was caused by the fact that some operators left their stations early while others 
were still working. This disrupted the continuous flow of cartons and caused the re-circulation lane to fill up 
quickly, taking over the merge. Consequently, the move time of cartons was increased, as was the lead-time. One 
reason was that multiple operators were sent to break at the same time. Another was that some operators started 
earlier than others. 
4.3.3.4 Lack of Discipline and Lack of a Sense of Urgency 
More often than not, operators left their stations early while others were still working. This disrupted the continuous 
flow of cartons and caused the re-circulation lane to fill-up and take over the merge. Consequently, the move time of 
cartons was increased, as was the lead-time. The merge operator invariably left his/her station while the conveyor 
lanes were still running, inbound and outbound, before the incoming lanes from inbound and depalletization were 
cleared. This created an accumulation of cartons, and long queues, before they reached the merge stations, and 
caused a high re-circulation rate. This resulted in the operators in inbound and depalletization (all upstream 
operations) having to wait until the merge was clear, and the red lights cleared, before they could start operating 
again. This created a lot of wasted time before, during, and after breaks. 
5. Conclusion
Cross-docking operations are becoming more complex and thus require more attention to operations planning and 
control. Some cross-docking DC operations employ automation in processing cartons. If not studied and analyzed 
thoroughly, this automation can lead to a tremendous amount of waste, and a decrease in service levels. The study at 
hand assessed one of the cross-docking DC operations, in the USA, using lean principles. Specifically, a value 
stream map was developed to identify existing operational waste and opportunities for improvement.  
According to the data, collected through filed observations and analysis using the lead-time concept, several areas of 
waste were found in the cross-docking operations. Waste was manifested in the long queues, poor staff planning, 
lack of floor supervision and direction, overproduction, shift and breaks transitions, and in the lack of discipline and 
sense of urgency. These types of waste contributed to the long lead-time, in some cases as much as six hours where 
a carton could have taken only seven minutes from the inbound to the outbound step. 
This study adds to the body of cross-docking operations knowledge. In addition, the study at hand contributes in a 
practical way to the understanding of cross-docking workflow and lead-time issues, and the importance of value 
stream mapping in identifying waste in order to maximize throughput.

Abstract 
Nowadays business management forces every organization to stay ahead of the new events in order to be 
more competitive. These are constantly faced with restrictions that demand an increase in their levels of 
efficiency and efficacy through a more integrated approach in their management. Taking this approach 
into account, a general procedure was designed with the corresponding specific procedures, in order to 
evaluate in an integrated way the business management by process. The fulfillment of this objective was 
guaranteed through the use of several methods, techniques and tools, among which are: analysis-
synthesis, surveys, document review, correlation between variables, Goldratt reality tree, cause-effect 
diagram (Ishikawa), among others. 
Keywords: management; enterprise; evaluation; efficiency; efficacy; process 
Introduction 
The organizations are in a process of constant development in terms of management, due to the need to face the new 
challenges imposed by the market and respond to an extremely competitive context in order to achieve success. Its 
actions are focused on eradicating the deficiencies that arise. Business management systems have undergone a 
remarkable transformation in recent years, in which the demands of customers and consumers set the direction and 
pace of organizations (Isaac Godínez, 2004). 
The contemporary business world requires management is based on the process approach, a tool that encourages 
continuous improvement. Hence this approach after many years of being implemented is today a powerful tool for 
its ability to contribute to the results in a sustained way. It has become a significant path in order to achieve an 
increase in the levels of efficiency and efficacy of organizations, terms that are closely related to the evaluation of 
business management. 
Carrying out this assessment in an integrated way allows defining the real situation of a company. It supports the 
achievement of the proposed objectives, the agility in decision-making and the timely solution of problems. To 
measure business management, it is important to provide the company with indicators, based on the monitoring of 
current practices and focusing on future development.

Conclusions 
A methodology was developed that allows an integrated evaluation of business management by processes through 
efficiency and effectiveness indicators. The application of the procedure in the entity under study shows that the 
performance evaluation is not favorable. When evaluating the performance indicators for each of the processes it is 
evident that there are difficulties in these, the most representative are related to the operational and support 
processes. Solutions and an action plan were proposed to eradicate identified deficiencies.

Abstract 
Franchise business system is the relationship between franchisor and franchisee . Franchisor is obliged 
to provide support and franchisee with the obligation to pay the fees. It provides a beginner's franchisor's 
picture of rights and obligations and understands the potential of growing a business with franchise 
system in its business. What are the potential revenue sources that can be obtained for the franchisor? 
The data for this study were collected through a group discussion of members (Franchise and Indonesian 
License) that focused on information about the potential income of the franchisor. The results show that 
apart from the self-owned business profits there are also other franchisors' revenue sources that can be 
fostered from their franchisee; other income is royalties, franchise fees, advertising costs, material 
purchases. In the findings of the discussion of the income was the largest percentage of revenue 
contributors from the purchase of raw materials by the franchisee to the head office or franchisor.

fact that is not owned by one person so that the franchisor must ensure that each outlet of its standard, if there is one 
outlet only disappointing consumers in one place so consumers will have poor grades at other outlets in different 
regions of the same brand. Franchisors've made mixing and dosing accurate to the material as well as more detailed 
product brand for the raw materials it so that if it is not supplied by the franchisor may be possible 
ketidaktersedianya appropriate material standards set franchisor in the region or area outlet franchisee menggingat 
that the breadth of areas in Indonesia especially that is the archipelago country make there are some items of goods 
with a certain brand that is not available in one region, if using a different brand there will be differences that may 
occur in the product produced in the outlet belongs to the franchisee and this may aggravate perceptions that lenih 
worse if the sales at franchisee-owned outlets according to the product due to that produced less in line with 
expectations of consumers in the brand franchisor owned outlets were compared in the different regions. 
The advertising fee as described can not be considered as revenue because the funds collected should be 
allocated for marketing purposes.and very few franchisors in Indonesia charge this fee to the franchisee as most 
promotional programs are performed by each outlet in the region and area of the outlet itself is independently done 
by the franchisee. That can not be said wrong because a very wide area can be a franchisor think it would be better 
to use the system as above because it is very easy and not burdensome, but can not be denied that the good is the 
advertising fee is drawn by the franchisor and then managed as a mutual fund its importance to build the brand 
together with a large scale because the fund is centered in the franchisor's place. There are some franchisors who 
apply these charges on average are big established brands that apply this fee to the franchisee because of their ability 
to manage advertising funds more experienced and media selection can be right because based on the professionals 
in the field of marketing. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The conclusion of the discussion illustrates that what can be earned from the franchisor as income other than his 
turnover profit is franchise fee, royalty fee, and advertising fee but unexpectedly that it turns out according to the 
experience of franchisor regular income that can support the continuity of the franchise business franchisors are the 
revenue they earn from the provision of materials and raw materials are supplied to the franchisee this is an income 
that is felt great and enjoyed by the franchisor from developing franchise system so far. It is theoretically true that the 
revenue from raw material purchases does not arise from the sources and potential revenues of the franchisors 
because it is known by franchisees of types and magnitudes as well as the percentage of income of this type, because 
this is the private area of the franchisor who is the sole agent of the goods supplier to their franchisee. Raw materials 
become mandatory franchisee purchased from the franchisor because to get the franchisee's products according to the 
results must follow in detail the smallest thing used by franchisors in their outlets that have been successful in can be 
associated with the certainty of sources of income in the franchisor can in the business which is one big income that 
can continue to maximize without limits the amount of it by continuing to increase the number of outlets of the 
franchisor.Besaran this rarely argued in the early stages of franchise purchasing process by the franchisee because 
most are not contained in the business plan there is only the value of the cost of materials in it already contained the 
profit value obtained by the franchisor of the provision of such materials. For the franchisors now beginning to realize 
that there is a big thing to be gained from developing this franchise system, which is primarily the potential and 
sources of passive income that can be obtained from the franchisee which of course must diimbangin with training, 
support and chain information adequate for success the franchisee that ultimately makes the franchisor's revenue 
potential.

Abstract 
In this study, we analyze a location obtained by an electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities location model, using 
Geographic Information System (GIS) and organize what kind of consideration are necessary for location points 
obtained by numerical calculation. Generally, existing location model locate facilities to minimize a traveled 
distance to a facility of demands ranged spatially. However, demands of the facilities are traffic flows going through 
a road link and that is needed to locate without overlap. The model considering the traffic flow as a demand was 
proposed by Hodgson et al. as the flow-capturing location-allocation model (FCLM). In FCLM, ""Cannibalization"" 
that multiple facilities consume demands flowing on a same route makes the problem difficult. To avoid the 
cannibalization, FCLM is modeled to minimize the number of facilities located on a same route. However, EV has 
the feature that the driving distance is short so multiple facilities should be arranged on a sufficiently long route in 
order not to run out of battery. We have proposed a model considering the driving distance of EV to this problem. In 
this study, we analyze the obtained location and organized issues. Aiming for that the solution obtained by our 
model is used in business.

Tight banking business competition and approaching the enactment of ASEAN Economic Society (MEA) in 
2015, national banking industry, including Regional Development Bank (BPD) considered necessary to increase 
competitive endurance, amongst them through capital increase and good corporate governance. Bank is an 
institution taking role as financial intermediary between  surplus unit and deficit unit and as institution which 
function to enhance payment traffic stream.  
Third Parties Fund (DPK) is fund collected by bank originated from society, either individual society, as well as 
legal entity. Collected fund from society could reach 80-90% from entire fund managed by the bank. Therefore, 
DPK has extremely crucial role in bank operationalization (Oka, et al., 2015). According to Regional Development 
Bank Association (Asbanda) in 2014, Non Performing Loan (NPL) ration in credit distribution especially working 
and investment capital credit by Regional Development Bank (BPD) was high. Such condition caused by many

Abstract 
Good accessibility has become a significant need for major cities in the world as well as Indonesia. 
However, the funding ability of the government as a public agency to provide transportation infrastructure 
that supports accessibility is still insufficient. Increased accessibility is an essential element of the cause 
of land value increase, where for transportation infrastructure can capture it as an investment capital or 
cost recovery. From this perspective, this study will explore in depth the mechanism of land value capture 
(LVC) about improving transportation accessibility.   
The research will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches through questionnaires, 
life-cycle cost approach, in-depth interview and Focus Group Discussion. The result of the research is 
expected to produce policy decision formulation, mainly related to the land value uplift so that it can be 
an input for decision-makers and stakeholders related to the effort to increase the benefit of an 
infrastructure project. 
Keywords

Abstract 
As the country with the largest palm oil production in the world, the potential of lignocellulose waste like 
an empty fruit bunch produced by Indonesia is huge. Utilization of empty fruit bunch feedstock into 
second-generation (2G) bioethanol on a pilot scale is quite extensive. 2G bioethanol is also generally 
recognized as a promising market potential because of its less impact on the environment, however, the 
production cost is still rather high and the development of a commercially competitive process for 2G 
technology poses a challenge. This research attempts to investigate the model of scaling up of 2G 
bioethanol production to accelerate commercialization by integrating the well-established sucrose-to-
bioethanol process from palm oil lignocellulose feedstock.  The case of scaling up to be calculated for a 
chemical pathway of bioethanol production with productivity consideration.  Scaling up shows some of 
the unit process shall complete the basic step in laboratories scale.  The supporting process must develop 
in pretreatment step likes empty fruit bunch washing, drying, and mechanical tearing.  The additional 
process in hydrolysis step is filtering and evaporation glucose liquor until appropriate concentration.  The 
distillation step develops for industrial scale according to alternatives products such as ethanol for 
solvent, pharmaceutical grade ethanol, or biofuels.  The industrial-scale model estimate to produce 18.6 
KL/days of bioethanol (ethanol content of 99.6%) need to support at least three crude palm oil plant with 
capacities 30-45 ton empty fruit bunch feedstock/hour.  The model calculated empty fruit bunch feedstock 
about 600 ton/day.

1. Introduction
Indonesia has many sources of agricultural products that can be developed as raw materials for the bioenergy
industry. From a variety of agriculture products that became Indonesia's flagship, palm oil is the result of national 
flagship plantations.  Palm plantations spread in 22 provinces in four islands namely Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi 
and Papua. Based on data from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia (2015), Riau Province ranks 
highest in palm plantations, followed by North Sumatra and Central Kalimantan. 
Development of the bioenergy industry can not be separated from the national downstream program of the palm 
oil industry. Government Regulation No. 14 of 2015, this industry is categorized in palm oil derivative industry and 
become the mainstay of Indonesia's industry strengthening in the future.

5. Conclusion  
A scale multiplication study is needed to support the success of second-generation bioethanol production (Gen2) 
on a commercial scale.  These efforts provide support for the utilization of palm oil mill waste and produce 
renewable alternative fuels.  Second-generation bioethanol production process using chemical hydrolysis pathways 
is an option, especially when considering industrial productivity. The use of chemical processes will shorten the 
processing time. 
The multiplication of the scale shows that a number of processes found on the scale of laboratory experiments 
need to be developed more fully, especially in supporting processes such as leaching of empty bunches, empty 
bunch drying, mechanical fiber pretreatment separation. The addition of an industrial scale process is also required 
for the separation of the glucose solution and concentration of the solution before it becomes a fermentation 
substrate. In industrial scale also developed purification step by distillation to become main product either as solvent 
ethanol, pharmaceutical grade ethanol, and also fuel. 
In the modeling process, it is calculated that for the production of ethanol 99.5% as much as 18.6 KL/day 
required the support of at least three palm oil industries with a capacity of 30-45 ton empty fruit bunches/hour.

Abstract 
In recent years, management in restaurant industry has found itself in an extremely harsh environment 
and faces the important challenge of finding out how to attract consumers. It is assumed that ways to 
attract consumers to restaurants are to create attractive and individualistic restaurants and menus. From 
this context, we previously proposed models (Kwon and Yamashita 2014, Kwon 2015) that analyzes the 
influence restaurant menu design, the menu profile and the messages it carries have to consumers’ 
selection behavior. On the other hand, the emotional state of consumers somehow impacts their own 
decision making and actions. 
In this study, we focused on consumers’ emotional state (both positive and negative) and analyze the 
effect the consumers’ emotional state has on their menu selection behavior and the impact that it has on 
how the messages (fuzzy message) are received. To achieve this, we first evoke certain feelings to test 
subjects by applying of different set of stimulus. For positive feedback, we play music to the test subjects. 
For negative feedback, we expose the subjects to a noise source. Next, we conduct a questionnaire on the 
attractiveness of the restaurant menu using the menu profile designed by the L8(27) type orthogonal array 
of the experimental design method and an analysis will be done using data collected from this survey.

Abstract 
 
The present study seeks to investigate the effects of technology spillover on the performance of automobile 
companies. In short, technology spillover is an opportunity to transfer and exploit and obtain information, 
technology or technical know-how, without prior planning. One of the most important indicators in 
evaluation of cars’ manufacturing companies’ performance is sales; hence, this study focused on sales 
variable and took it as a representative of Technology spillover. To this aim, the sales data were collected 
from the domestic car manufacturing companies. For this mean, sales’ pattern during ten years is recognized 
using Seasonal ARIMA (S-ARIMA) model. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian 
Information Criterion(BIC) were used to select the most appropriate model. It is found that the selected 
model can be applied to forecast the sales with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the range of 
6%. This research also confirmed the idea, if Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is taking place in developing 
countries, with regards to the necessary conditions and infrastructures, technology spillover occurs, and 
meaningful changes in factory performance would happen. Also, the proposed forecasting model can help 
senior managers of domestic companies in mid-term and long-term planning.

connection has been cut off for any reason, the growth rate of sales has declined. Constructive and continuous 
collaboration with the manufacturing companies can be a good solution for the spillover of the technology. 
This year, after beginning a collaborative cooperation to strengthen the engineering department, some experienced 
staffs in the production and management sectors were added to the team which resulted in and improvement in the 
production automation system. Therefore, a positive impact on the factory's performance was observed. 
6. Conclusion 
 
Technology spillover is a situation which a company or organization can benefit from knowledge, market, specialist 
staff and innovations. In Iran, enough attention has not been paid to this subject and its impact on the progress of 
companies both economically and technologically. The purpose of this research is to clarify the influence of 
technology spillover in domestic companies in Iran to make suggestions to increase the resulting benefits.  
In this study, the sales of one of the car manufacturing companies, which absorbed foreign capital, is considered and 
the companies’ time series data were modeled by the well-known ARIMA model which has not been applied 
previously and is the novelty of the paper. The proposed model satisfactorily met the criteria of modeling accuracy 
with the MAPE in the range of 6%. Therefore, it can be used to forecast the sales of companies and help the managers 
of the companies in their planning to improve the corporate performance by the spillover approach. In fact, moving 
towards the realization of spillover in the production processes and the attempts to control the market share are among 
the advantages of this forecasting model. As a result of moving along the technology spillover, company’s products 
can surpass other domestic companies that do not have external connections and gain more market share. In the case 
of occurrence, the technology spillover, other domestic companies will also take advantage of foreign investment and 
technology. 
This article showed that even when many of the necessary infrastructures are not available, foreign direct investment 
and the approach of technology spillover can make significant changes. 
This article is well illustrated by the effects of some parameters that may not seem very important at first glance. In 
this study, there were significant leaps in the company's sales chart at times when certain changes occurred. All 
jumps in the graph have been accompanied by serious changes in the factory situation. We have witnessed a leap in 
the factory sales, precisely at the points where the R & D department has been activated and its outputs have been 
made available to the plant. 
 Also, solving the structural problems of the factory and establishing continuous communication with domestic and 
foreign technicians also triggered a sales leak. These tips can also be solved for other factories operating in similar 
environments. 
Investigating the impact of existing infrastructures in automotive companies on spillover and providing solutions to 
enhance technology spillover can be some topics of relevance for future researches. Also, the applicability of 
multivariate time series’ analysis may be of interest to feature studies in technology spillover.

Abstract 
There are many theoretical frameworks that attempt to describe adoption of green manufacturing (GM). The 
literature review is one of a tool to finding the pattern of previous research and looking for research gaps, so 
that further researchers can further develop the field of knowledge. The objective of this paper is to provide an 
extensive literature review on green manufacturing adoption on SME. We have reviewed 58 articles that 
spread from 2001 to 2017 (16 years). We collected the articles through systematic literature review and 
snowball technique from Scopus database. Mendeley software was used to manage and resume the references. 
We have identified and reviewed this database and try to make classification using coding criteria adapted 
from Siva et al. (2016). The coding criteria are publication year and journal, data collection method, data 
analysis method, and contextual (size, country origin and type of industry). We have identified, reviewed and 
compared constructs theorized of green manufacturing adoption concept in SME.

1 Introduction 
Today, many companies and organizations spend their money to improve their capabilities in environmental protection 
and sustainable development. Beside, companies attempt to increasing their profit by make their operations more 
efficient and effective. Increasing of customers awareness and pressure on the environmental practice, became one of the 
factors driving the company to adopt green issues (Govindan, Diabat, & Madan Shankar, 2015). One of the strategies to 
improve the efficiency of resources and the effective of environmental impact in manufacturing is green manufacturing 
(GM). The term ‘green manufacturing’ was first used in the article title by Dickinson et al. pada tahun 1995 (Sangwan & 
Mittal, 2015). In line with company attention, scholars interest increasing also. They propose many definition of GM. 
Shrivastava and R.L.Shrivastava stated that GM is a method for manufacturing that minimizes waste and pollution for all 
industries (Shrivastava & R.L., 2017). While, Govindan et al. addressed the definition of GM as a system that integrates 
product and process design issues with issues of manufacturing planning and control in such a manner as to identify, 
quantify, assess and manage the flow of environmental waste with the goal of reducing and ultimately minimizing 
environmental impact while also trying to maximize resource efficiency (Govindan, Diabat, & Madan Shankar, 2015). 
Chuang and Yang mentioned that GM as a manufacturing method that minimises waste and pollution and is a subset of 
sustainable manufacturing (Chuang & Yang, 2014). We can justify that the most critical thinking of GM is minimizing 
negative effect on environment, by eliminating waste/pollution, efficiency input/resources and product design.  
Adoption and implementation of GM in the company requires considerable cost and effort. Researchers and practitioners 
attempt to increase the understanding of the GM adoption process. As GM is considered as innovation (Dornfeld, 2014), 
theories based on innovation adoption may apply in empirical studies on GM adoption. ""An innovation is an idea, 
practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption"" (Rogers, 2003). The most widely 
used theory in adoption innovation is ‘diffusion of innovation theory’ (Chou, Chen, & Wang, 2012). In fact, there are 
many theories that studied innovation adoption. Based on Wolfe, there are three research approach on innovation, 
diffusion of innovation (DI), organizational innovativeness (OI) and process theory (PT) (Wolfe, 1994). The differences 
of these three approach is presented in Table 1.

Abstract 
A dominant paradigm in academics prescribed customer satisfaction as a primary precursor to 
customer loyalty. But changes in business regulations across the globe and rapid technological 
advancement have lowered the switching barriers and thus fueling propensity to switch despite 
being satisfied with an existing service provider. Recent researches empirically confirm the 
changing reality of markets by empirically highlighting the inability of customer satisfaction as a
construct to fully explain consumer switching behavior, particularly in the context of E-services 
wherein switching barriers are perceived to be even lower. The lack of any comprehensive study 
to explain the consumer switching intention in the context of E-services has been the primary 
motivation behind this study. The main aim of this study is to examine the role of consumer 
switching barrier in consumer switching behavior. Since acquiring new customers is much more 
difficult than retaining new one, marketers has widely deployed Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) tools to operationalize their intent. Our research indicates that besides 
satisfaction from core service offering, organizational antecedents such as service bundling, 
subscriber lock-in, asset specificity, and network value can lead to consumer switching barriers 
that in turn reduce switching intention in E-Services.

Abstract 
The Small Medium Enterprises of Knitting are small business actors who produce knitted clothes such as 
cardigans, sweaters, and jackets. The SME knitting actors currently operated their production on the 
knitting industries center that become their residence and the source of their income. The number of SME 
knitting actors has decreased every year due to the weak business capabilities. The improvement are 
needed to increase the capabilities to run business with the effective strategy. This paper aims to develop 
strategy to increase competency and business capability for SME of knitting actors. The method using 
SWOT analysis which describes their strength, weakness, opportunities, and threat in existing business. 
The result shows that the SME knitting business position is in third quadrant which is Weakness-Threat 
(WO) strategy. It can be concluded that it is essential to repair their weakness or minimize weakness and 
to avoid the business threat. The strategy for developing capabilities of the SME knitting is by minimizing 
weakness with the priority of ensuring the continuous supply of fabric material, upgrading the obsolete 
machine, and improving labor skill. The strategies to avoid business threat especially from imported 
clothes and competitors are improving the quality of knitting clothes, and running the effective production 
to press the production cost.

b.
Make coordination between government agencies in developing the knitting center business to avoid
duplication of the program as it often happens today.
c.
The intervention of government and agency done by individual is proved ineffective in developing
knitting centers.
d.
Create an integrated and sustainable business development assistance program plan.
5. Conclusion
The SWOT matrix position of the knitting industry is on the position of weakness-threat (WT) which means that the 
business person is currently in conditions which has internal weakness and face an external threat. So the strategy 
needed to be applied is the effort to immediately cover the weaknesses and avoid the various threats that exist. 
Weaknesses are covered by designing an efficient and effective yarn supply chain system. Then create a replacement 
program strategy from manual machine to automatic knitting machine to improve the quality of knitted products. It 
is needed to improve the skills of the workers, especially in using automatic machines and better production 
methods. Conducting the planning of facilities and infrastructure industrial centers, especially the ease of access to 
the location of industrial centers located in a densely populated area with narrowed road access. Furthermore, it is 
needed the coordinated and programed advisory strategies from various parties, especially the government, 
academia, yarn industry, and other parties so it can provide comprehensive solutions. 
For further research, it is necessary to examine the capability of each business actors in accordance with group or 
business size clusters in small, medium, and large categories so that the offered solution is more representative and 
accordance with the problems and business scale on each cluster and also need a further study on external factors so 
that the problem can be mapped thoroughly.

ABC toy store is a product for buyer's consumer with medium and upper financial ability. ABC toy store 
sells imported toys and baby products with high quality products, using international grade production 
materials and ISO production certificates: 9002. 
Meet the expectations of market demand is not easy; because by fulfilling all expectations, then 
the impact is the high stock of goods that must be available. Companies need to find an appropriate 
method to keep the stock of goods in the store is not too excessive and also stocks of goods are 
maintained at a safe level. This is the emphasis that the company should examine, how the procurement 
planning method is good and correct for the company to be more efficient. 
The identification of the scope of forecasting using the method of short-term quantitative 
forecasting method should be based on actual stock out and stock in the warehouse. Actual conditions 
stock out is a point that always wanted by the company, the stock that is minimum - run out of course not 
desirable, because it indicates the loss of potential company profit.

Abstract 
Due to the importance of perishable products is growing, in terms of sales, the management of 
these products is continously shifting for improvement. It can be evidenced from system 
emergence to reduce potential loss and prolong shelf life. In fact, the most common method to 
preserve quality is maintaining the desired temperature between the origins and last mile 
destination. Decision planning in temperature management context, particularly at operational 
stage,  should be simultaneously integrated, from production scheduling through the distribution 
into received consumer. Moreover, we put also more concern to energy issue since its consumption 
is applied to secure degree of acceptability atrributes, either appeareance or internal composition. 
This study seeks to develop multi objective framework model to reach integrate decision planning 
with prior shipment planning that consider energy consumption. The integration aims to not only 
maximize the expected revenue, but also guarantee the perishability that affect product durability. 
The outputs include optimization according to production sequence order delivery planning, total 
costs including energy, as well as any changes in shelf life. Furthermore, to solve the model, local 
heuristic approach, Nearest Neighbor algorithm is proposed.

Abstract 
Equipment maintenance on laboratory services is part of quality management to keep equipment in 
good condition, safe, reliable, consistent, and accurate. To ensure quality and reduce the loss of 
machine equipment failure, a maintenance method approach is required. Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM) as a maintenance concept that maintains and improves product quality by 
improving machine working conditions, and reducing failure. TPM measurement were performed in 
one of the structural testing laboratories that impacted the service. Overall Equipment Effectiveness 
(OEE) is used as a statistical test tool to determine problems in order to improve the performance of 
equipment (availability, performance rate and quality rate) that affect the organization.The results of 
OEE measurements were then analyzed with the help of pareto and fishbone diagrams. The results 
show that the average OEE score is still lower than the world class standard, where the availability 
value is 84%, the performance rate is 67%, the quality rate is 99% and the OEE value is 56%. 
Keywords—Maintenance; TPM; OEE; Pareto Diagram; Fishbon 
1080","Figure 11: Fishbone Diagram Breakdown Loss 
From Diagram of Fishbone Causes Breakdown Loss, there’s proposed improvement at each factor. On 
the machine factor: identify problems that arise before a failure occurs and fixed planned, proactive and 
preventive maintenance systems. On the man factor: increase operator knowledge of the machines and 
equipment they handle; responsible for routine maintenance (cleaning, lubricant inspection, bolt tightening) 
performed by the operator; and combine the collective talents of human resources within the organization to 
make continuous improvement. And for the last factor which is method factor: preparing the loog book for 
recording of equipment usage; utilize the effective time and human resources available in the handling of 
damage; and increased competence in learning proactive and preventive maintenance techniques. 
6. Conclusions
In this research, the effectiveness of static test equipment with TPM method has been done. The 
average availability rate of  84%, where the availability of  december 2016 is  88%, the highest value, while the 
lowest occurred in january 2017 of 74%. The low value is affected by downtime. 
The average  performance  rate of 67%, where the highest performance rate is 86% in february 2017, 
while the lowest is 47% in december 2016. The value is affected by downtime  due to setup and  breakdown. 
Average grade quality rate is 99%. 
The average value of OEE is 56%, where the highest OEE value is 65%  in January and October 2016 
and the lowest OEE value is 42% in December 2016 and February 2017. The low value of OEE is influenced by 
the value of performance rate. 
Based on the pareto diagram analysis, the low OEE score is affected by performance loss of 59%, set 
up & adjustment of  31%, breakdowns by 5%, and  idling  and minor stoppage by 4%. 
7. Suggestions
This study has some limitations such as OEE measurement using only one test equipment, and no cost 
analysis for the rejuvenation of old equipment. Therefore, for further research can do a cost analysis for the 
rejuvenation of old machine tools.

Conclusion
This study focuses on measuring the quality of The conclusions that can be taken from this research are: 
1.
Quality measurement instruments with SERVQUAL applied to BBPLK Bekasi have a high validity and
reliability. It can be seen from the previous discussion that the value of validity and reliability of the instrument
of this study exceeds the minimum limit for the validity of 0.963 and 0.961.
2.
The highest gap is seen in the appropriate library operating hours indicator and this is due to operational hours
coincided with training hours so that trainees can only access the library before the training begins or after the
training ends. And the lowest gap is seen in a meaningful and interesting experience indicator during training in
this institution.
3.
Based on the results of the analysis with Importance - Performance Analysis (IPA) Matrix, which describes the
level of participants' satisfaction and also the priority improvement for service attributes. Of the 44 service
attributes that exist there are 2 attributes that become priority improvement. These attributes are attributes of
training equipment that are compatible with the latest technology and quality of training materials and training
modules.
4.
From the attributes are given recommendations to the management of BBPLK Bekasi which can be used as a
reference in undertaking non-binding improvements. For attributes of training equipment that are compatible
with the latest technology are provided recommendations for improving or even replacing old and unusable
training equipment. And to attribute the quality of training materials and training modules are given
recommendations to improve the quality of training materials that will be given to the trainees and print training
modules better.
5.
Based on the result of hypothesis analysis of service quality dimension influence to overall trainee's satisfaction,
from nine dimensions of service quality measurement under study there are six dimension which influence to
overall satisfaction that is the dimension of training environment, training equipment, curriculum, training
implementation, service support and management training. The six dimensions that affect positively can be used
as a reference for the development and improvement of service quality in the future.

Abstract 
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the retailer business are important for Thailand. It is one of the 
driving forces of the country's economic and social development. As a result, the retail business is more 
competitive both in terms of product quality and reducing lead time of customer responsiveness. The 
organization has a great management of logistics which have a comparative advantage.  Many 
organizations usually choose outsourcing company to manage their logistics activities. Because logistics 
providers have more resources, experience, and efficiency than their own. The objective of this paper is to 
propose criteria for selecting the logistics service provider to the small and medium enterprises in the 
retail.  The beginning, literature reviews were searched and verified concerning the criteria from the 
related retail industry.  Then, the researcher ranked the frequency of the decision criteria discussed in 
descending order.  The top 5  from 89 criteria are Cost/ Price, Service quality, Financial Performance, 
Delivery Performance, and Information technology/System. In this paper, the selected criteria from the 
top 20, the first to eleventh criteria would be the highest frequencies, respectively. The others would be 
considered appropriate due to the few frequencies of duplicate criteria. The result from this paper shows 
that there are 8 main criteria and 5 sub-criteria to suggest the small and medium enterprises in the retail. 
The criteria would be applied for weighting by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of Multi Criteria 
decision making method that paper present sample weighting as a guide for those interested in education 
and the organization needs to be used to rank the alternative of logistics service provider.

1. Introduction
Now a day, the gross domestic product in Thailand has increased because of the global economic recovery.  In 
addition, the company develops of the selling model for meeting the increasing competition of domestic business. 
Small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in the retailers grew by 5.9 percent in the first quarter and 6.0 percent in the 
second quarter of 2016, expanding at the fourth rank in all categories. In the retail industry has a competition to 
rapid meeting the customer requirement. Logistics management is important to the organization because it is part of 
the supply chain. Which is the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, effective flow and 
storage of goods, services, and related information from point of origin to point of consumption for the purpose of

and Financial performance.  In the second group, we selected Service quality to be the most important sub-criteria. 
The next rank was Delivery performance and Financial performance. We had agreed that a good logistics service 
provider could empower the organization concerning over the operational efficiency and service reliability. The 
Capability was the third-ranking criteria involving to the resources of the organization, for instance, freight trucks, 
warehouse equipment, and related personnel. At last, the Information technology / Systems criteria was the fourth 
rank because nowadays, the technologies were adopted into the organization’ s operation continuously. It could 
facilitate the operation and give more convenient in the communication between the organization and the logistics 
provider to be more effective. The other criteria would be the additional components that advocated the overall 
decision making to be more complete, such as Flexibility describing the stretch in various aspects of logistics 
services that could be provided to the organization. 
 
4. Discussion 
 
In this paper, we proposed only some criteria for selection of logistics service providers based on literature review. 
Unlike the article by Jharkharia et al. (2007), which offered a review of the relevance of the selection of global 
logistics providers and ranked the top 25th criteria. Some criteria might not be appropriate for small and medium 
enterprises in the retail business in Thailand because of the differences in cultural resources, including the lifestyle 
of people in Thailand.  
The criteria obtained from the article would be supported the decision maker to have the basis criteria for decision 
making. In fact, the selection of logistics service providers must consider the decision criteria from the requirements 
and the characteristics of the organization to provide the most suitable logistics service providers. Therefore, this 
paper was only providing preliminary information to have a decision support. Furthermore, it can also be used as a 
basis for assembling the other criteria. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The decision criteria used for selection of logistics providers for small and medium-sized enterprises in the retail 
business is very important because they can reflect the needs of the organization that lead to the effective result. The 
objective of this research is to propose the decision criteria for selecting the third-party logistics service providers in 
Thailand. The 89 decision criteria were derived by reviewing 12 relevant kinds of literature, which were published 
in the international journals. We had arranged the frequency rely on the article that had referred repeatedly and also 
inquiries from the entrepreneurship of the retail. In addition, the criteria would be validated by academic, logistics 
and supply chain management for reliability intensification.  Eventually, 8 main criteria and 5 sub-criteria were 
selected to be final decision criteria.  We then performed an example of weighting depending on the personal 
preference using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on the Multi-Criteria decision making (M C D M ) 
concept. As a matter of fact, tools selection or weighting in decision making depend on many factors, for instance, 
the faced situation, problem, objective, and the needs of each organization. The given weighting examples presented 
that the four most important criteria are Cost /  Price, Performance, Capability, and Information technologies / 
Systems at 0.328, 0.232, 0.159 and 0.107 weighted scores respectively. Consequently, the criteria from the research 
can be applied to the small and medium-sized enterprises in the retail business for selection of logistics service 
providers.  People who interested in this strategy should adapt or adjust the criteria to suit your organizational 
characteristics. We will then apply the decision criteria to a retail business in Thailand to prioritize the needs of the 
organization and select future logistics providers.

Abstract 
Product quality is a crucial factor that significantly affects customer’s satisfaction and many organizations 
emphasize and invest large amounts in designing and assuring quality system to prevent flow of 
defectives along the process. Surviving in competitive environment many organizations attempt to 
reorganize their inspection policies in order to satisfy customer’s expectations while reducing costs. 
Inefficient inspection policy can lead to significant wastage of resources. Therefore, the researches on 
designing efficient inspection strategy have been studied extensively in last few decades. This research 
applied the Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA) technique first to trace material and energy used 
both in terms of physical quantity and monetary units in order to analyze efficiency of process and then to 
design the lot size and quality inspection system that maximize ratio of total positive product cost to the 
total cost obtained from the MFCA concept.  In this paper, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is 
used as a search algorithm for the optimal inspection sampling size and the lot size under serial multi-
stage processes. This studied shows that the best solution obtained from the proposed methodology results 
in the production and inspection system with higher resource efficiency and greater proportion of the total 
positive cost.

1. Introduction
 
The quality management strategy is an important key to improve the product’s quality while maintaining 
organization’s profitability. Product quality is the key factors that significantly affects customer’s satisfaction and 
many organizations have invested large amounts in quality system. Implementing different inspection strategy will 
result in different costs. In order to satisfy the customer needs and survive in competitive environment, the 
organizations have to implement an efficient inspection policy. In the same time, the waste reduction becomes a 
major concern for many organizations because it affect in organization’s finance.  
 
Generally reducing waste in a production means reduce process variation, resources usage and eliminate cause of 
defects to achieve higher quality and output. In this study, reducing waste means implement an efficient inspection 
strategy to defect defective items as soon as possible, ensure the required output quantity while minimizing costs.  In 
case of inspection only last stage may cause to non-conforming products, incur penalty costs, losing customer 
trustworthiness and market share, etc. In the same way, insufficient inspection fraction or sample size will result in 
non-conforming products reach to next process which is cause of waste resources. On the other hand, more and 
tighter will lead to a higher product quality, but will result in higher costs of inspection, rework and scrap. Therefore, 
a cost trade-off is important to select the efficient economic inspection strategy which desired to balance quality 
with cost effects (Azadeh et al., 2012).  
 
Another interesting factor is lot size impact. During past few decade, inventory management has been important 
for the most manufacturing industries. Previously, most organizations use economic order quantity (EOQ) model to

From table 3, it shows that there are only 4 inspection stations with fixed-inspection proportion = 0.25 of total 
production lot the current production. In optimal search we assume that if inspection should be performed after that 
process stage, it will take inspection time equal to 42 min/unit and require 1 inspection person. 
6.2 Cost analysis of current production environment 
 
MFCA analysis data of current manufacturing operation is shown in Table 4. Before establish the optimal 
inspection sample size and lot size, the total cost were $360,098 per year. Table 4 shows that the present operation 
has ratio of total positive product cost to total cost only 6.80%. The result shows this manufacturing operate 
inefficiently due to unappropriated inspection strategy. Inefficient sample size are causes of non-conforming items 
being processes and adding resources unnecessarily during manufacturing activities.

According to the results, no inspection is the optimal decision for the third process. In contrast, full inspection is 
suggest plan for the eighth process. Considering the inspection proportion as a decision variable to be optimize 
increase the average ratio of objective function (TPC/TC) to 0.2057. It is clearly that the ABC method provide the 
better inspection plan than present manufacturing operated. 
7. Conclusions and suggestions for further research
Efficient inspection system requires valuable resources that incurs the high operation cost to the firm. It is
important to seek the efficient inspection strategy while reduce cost. An efficient inspection strategy are cost trade-
off between inspection cost and penalty. Besides, it will help to prevent the unnecessary processing cost added and 
wastage of resources in the next processes. In addition, the production lot size was considered as decision variable 
since it impact on inventory and WIP holding cost structure.  
 
Considering, MFCA technique to show waste costs occurred from unidentified detective items being processes 
unnecessarily during manufacturing operations as a result of established inefficient inspection strategy. The

objective of optimization problem are the maximum ratio of positive product cost to total cost (TPC/TC). In other 
words, the study attempt to increase the positive cost while reduce total cost by implement the optimal inspection 
strategy and production lot size. This study a solution algorithm based on ABC has been develop to solve the 
optimal inspection strategy and lot size in a serial multi-stage process. In conclusion, the proposed approach is 
helpful for production and inspection sections especially in serial production process environment. 
 
Since there is no sensitivity analysis of the ABC parameters, the further research suggest to test the effect of 
changing of parameters. Moreover, benchmarking the solution and performance of ABC algorithm with other 
optimization techniques is optional in the further research.

Abstract 
With more hospitals emerging in Indonesia has leads to increased competition to get the number of patients. 
From that reason the hospital is required to have maximum performance in terms of service in order to win the 
patient's choice. To increase the employee performance of hospital it can be generated if job satisfaction from 
employees can be full filled, so it necessary to improve job satisfaction by create the organizational culture and 
encouragement from the management level to work motivation of employees. This research was conducted in 5 
biggest hospitals owned by PT. Pertamina Bina Medika, the sample is 338 employees from population of 2,172 
employees. To know the pattern of relationship between variables with the aim of knowing the direct or indirect 
effect on exogenous and endogenous variables, this research uses Structural Equation Model (SEM). Outer 
model test results using convergence test validity obtained all the loading factor values for the indicator greater 
than 0.70 it illustrates that the indicator is valid. The test results using discriminant validity obtained the value 
of loading factor for each indicator is greater to the intended construct than to the unintended construct, so it 
can be concluded that the indicator has a high discriminant validity value. Composite reliability test results 
show the value of composite reliability to four variables greater than 0.70 so it concluded that the variable has 
a good internal consistency. As for the value of variance of each indicator in the constraint obtained the value 
of AVE is greater than 0.50 so it can be concluded that the indicators in the construct can be caught by these 
variables more than the variance caused by measurement error. The reliability test results for each latent 
variable are obtained for Cronbach's Alpha value greater than 0.70 which means the reliability of the four 
variables is high. Inner model test results obtained R2 value of 0.2906 for job satisfaction that describe that 
organizational culture and job motivation has an influence of 29.06% to the job satisfaction. The result of R2 for

F-table value with error (alpha) 5%, df1 = 2 and df2 = 337 (N-k) where N number of sample and k number of independent 
indicator is 3,00. Because the value of F-hit > F-table (104.44 > 3.00) then it is proven that the organization culture and 
work motivation simultaneously have a significantly positive impact on employee performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From Outer model test results using convergence test validity obtained all the loading factor values for the indicator greater 
than 0.70 it illustrates that the indicator is valid. While the test results using discriminant, validity obtained the value of 
loading factor for each indicator is greater to the intended construct than the unintended construct, it can be concluded that 
the indicator has a high discriminant validity value. Composite reliability test results show the value of composite reliability 
to four variables greater than 0.70 so concluded that the variable has a good internal consistency. As for the value of variance 
of each indicator in the constraint obtained the value of AVE is greater than 0.50 so it can be concluded that the indicators 
in the construct that can be caught by these variables more than the variance caused by measurement error. The reliability 
test results for each latent variable are obtained for Cronbach's Alpha value greater than 0.70 which means the reliability of 
the four variables is high. 
Inner model test results obtained R2 0.2906 for job satisfaction that describe the organizational culture and job motivation 
has an influence of 29.06% of job satisfaction. While for R2 employee performance variable is 0.3761 which describe that 
organizational culture variable, work motivation and job satisfaction have impact 37.61% to employee performance. 
Hypothesis 1 results obtained t-statistical for organizational culture on job satisfaction is 5.886, this value is higher than 
1.96 so H0 rejected and proved that organizational culture significantly positive impact on job satisfaction. Result of 
Hypothesis 2 got t-statistic for work motivation on job satisfaction is 4,286, this value is higher than 1.96 so H0 rejected 
and prove that work motivation significantly positive impact on job satisfaction. Hypothesis 3 got t-statistic job satisfaction 
on employee performance is 4,016, this value is higher than 1.96 so H0 rejected and prove that job satisfaction significantly 
positive impact on employee performance. Hypothesis test 4 shows that t-statistic of organizational culture toward 
employee performance is 5,304, this value is higher than 1.96 so that H0 is rejected and proves that organizational culture 
has a significantly positive impact on employee performance. Hypothesis 5 results obtained t-statistic work motivation on 
employee performance is 2,285, this value is greater than 1.96 so H0 rejected and proved that work motivation significantly 
positive impact on employee performance. Hypothesis 6 shows that the coefficient of indirect (z) effect from organizational 
culture to employee performance through job satisfaction is 3,261, this value is greater than 1.98 at the 0.05 significance 
level which shows that organizational culture significantly impact on employee performance through job satisfaction. 
Hypothesis test 7 shows that the coefficient of influence (z) is not directly from work motivation to employee performance 
through job satisfaction 2,929, this value is greater than 1.98 at significance level of 0.05 which illustrates that work 
motivation significantly affect employee performance through job satisfaction. Hypothesis 8 results obtained by the F-hit 
(104.44) where this value is higher than F-table (3.00) it can be concluded that organizational culture and work motivation 
simultaneously have a significantly positive impact on employee performance.

Abstract 
Research in the field of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has grown rapidly but focuses 
mainly on the economic and environmental aspects and rarely considers the social aspect. This research 
will discuss recent literature review on SSCM and propose a model to measure the impact of institutional 
pressures on company’s SSCM level and the influence of that level on company’s performance. SSCM 
level will be measured from five variables: orientation, continuity, collaboration, risk management, and 
proactivity; whereas company’s performance will be measured from three variables of sustainable 
development: economic, social, and environment. Furthermore, we propose seven indicators to assess 
institutional pressures, fourteen indicators to assess SSCM level, and nine indicators to assess company’s 
performance.

1. Introduction
Awareness of sustainability issue has been increasing especially in the last five years (Beske-Janssen et al., 
2015). Sustainability is often regarded as a factor that signifies the modernization of a company, where companies 
that have given attention and engaged in sustainability activities would be seen as more forward-looking. One effect 
from this trend is the emergence of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) concept as an extension from the 
conventional supply chain management (SCM). The major difference between SCM and SSCM lies in three main 
areas, i.e., dedication to the triple bottom line, stakeholder management, and life cycle assessment (Beske and 
Seuring, 2014). These areas are the main features of SSCM that are not available in SCM. By definition, SSCM is 
“the management of material, information and capital flows as well as cooperation among companies along the 
supply chain while taking goals from all three dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic, 
environmental, and social” (Seuring and Muller, 2008a). The implementation of SSCM can depart from two 
different initiatives regardless of the SCM level in a company, i.e., from the development of supply chain systems or 
the adoption of sustainability in the company (Ashby et al., 2012). 
Companies with established SCM and growth mindset will naturally pay attention to SSCM and start 
concerning how to transform their old SCM model into SSCM (Seuring and Muller, 2008b; Pagell and Wu, 2009). 
Personal awareness of the companies is one of the internal factors that will encourage companies to transform SCM 
into SSCM, but the external factors are actually stronger drivers than the internal factors. External factors include

Abstract 
Rice is the staple food for the people of Kalimantan Selatan, Indonesia. The inability of the government to 
meet the needs of rice will lead to regional and national instability. Fortunately, the Government of 
Kalimantan Selatan has stated through statistical data that the production of rice in Kalimantan Selatan 
has surplus. Therefore, Kalimantan Selatan serve as one of the national food barn area. An interesting 
point is Kalimantan Selatan which has a wetlands as a majority of paddy field capable to achieve surplus 
production in rice, where the wetlands can only be planted with rice once a year. This study aims to 
provide an alternative policies to maintain a surplus in rice production through policy analysis approach 
based on system dynamics model. The resullt of the simulation that Kalimantan Selatan will capable to 
maintain their rice production in surplus condition if the Government can push the paddy field conversion 
and endorse the production insentives for the farmers. In 2027, Kalimantan Selatan potentially has a 
surplus 1 million tons per year for rice.

1. Introduction
The government has to capable to manage availability of rice as a staple food fo Kalimantan Selatan  people in 
order to avoid political instability and social conflict. Therefore, rice in Kalimantan Selatan  has engaged on the 
list of strategic commodities (Irawan. 2005). Population is increasing every year lead rice demand. The 
government established several policies to meet the rice need, such as increased productivity policies, price 
determination for governemnt purchases, determination of the lowest retail price, farmers incentives and import. 
The availability of food involves food quality, entity integrity, safety and health (Hu et. al., 2013), the 
sustainability of production, diversification of products, price affordability (Wibowo et. al., 2016) and related 
information services of foodstuffs (Vorst et al., 2009). It is to be important to focus not only on quantity of rice 
but also in quality and services. Unfortunately, the government today has a priority only on rice quantity and 
services, although rice quality remains a government consideration. 
An interesting point is Kalimantan Selatan which has a wetlands as a majority of paddy field capable to achieve 
surplus in rice production, where the wetlands can only be planted with rice once a year. Kalimantan Selatan is a

Based on simulation results, the combination LC and SRI gives the best results in the effort to achieve 
sustainable surplus on rice in Kalimantan Selatan. Both in terms of the rate of increase in production, a surplus of 
rice, the consumption of rice, and rice reserves. However, the powerful scenario will not work properly if the 
government fail in policies supervision.  
This research also show some findings, such as related the price of rice. It must be considered while discussion 
regarding to availability of rice policies development, especially for regional policies. The price of local rice is 
always more expensive rather than the price of non-local variety of rice. Consumer preferences are become a 
driver varible to encourage local rice market continues to grow. It may trigger the volatility of rice price in the 
market. This paper was define that price as exogenous variable in the model, therefore the further research the 
price variable should be endogenous factor in the system. It is evidenced by rate of inflation in Kalimantan 
Selatan significant influenced by the price of rice, especially as a price of local rice volatility. Consequently, the 
highest retail pricing policy is not working properly in order to control the price of local rice, yet it must be 
control at production cost.  
The local rice distribution has been disrupted by delay behavior. Over and over it is related to consumer 
preferences. As the finding, that local people like to eat outdated rice, even the price of outdated rice is more 
expensive than fresh rice. This is a unique finding, the delay that occurs can reach the period of one year. Delay 
behavior will change the pattern of rice distribution routines. This will have an impact on safety stock, price, and 
rice stock overall. Therefore, in this model stock of rice aggregate also represent the total of outdated rice stock a 
year earlier. At the same time, the government also has to ensure that the distribution of rice can reach remote 
areas in Kalimantan Selatan, although the price may more be expensive, yet the rice must be available. As the 
further research, detailed rice distribution from granary to the remote areas will be developed, with the intenton 
of rice distribution pattern investigation. The rice distribution also concern on rice flows, trade in and trade out 
from Kalimantan Selatan to other provinces.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Rice production model in Kalimantan Selatan gives an point of view of the policies in order to provide rice 
availability. Based on the result of simulation, Kalimantan Selatan rice stock will be safe for up to 10 years with 
the provision of land conversion evaluation and supervision on intensification program. Even though the stock 
will safe for up to 10 years, quality and price aspect will be the main focus for up the 10 years. Finally, as the 
investigation that Kalimantan Selatan capable to support as national rice supplier.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the global market is highly competitive and in order to survive, companies need to 
produce products and services of high quality to achieve customer satisfaction and loyalty to 
stimulate top-line business growth. This paper aims to develop hybrid methodology for the 
traditional DMAIC methodolgy roadmap by including an optmiziation and feasibility step 
following the improvement stage. The proposed DMAIOC (Define – Measure – Analysis – 
Improve – Optimizing and feasibility – Control) methodology, ensures that the desired quality 
level is achieved at minimum investment costs by integrating optimization models for selection 
of process alternatives and adjusting optimal specification tolerance. A case study is presented 
with the proposed methodology that reveal the benefits of implementing six sigma 
improvements. A cost-benefit analysis for the implementation is then provided. The inclusion of 
updated optimization models with the DMAIC framework enrich the research methodology and 
assist management to adjust performance and choose process improvement opportunities 
generating in its turn the transparency necessary for management to make a right decision.

Abstract 
Clean in place (CIP) is in site cleaning activity with a purpose to eliminate soils, preventing cross 
contamination and food decomposition by bacteria. Hence, CIP activity is a critical step in food 
processing industry. Unfortunately such activity is considered non-productive because it does not produce 
any finished goods, so CIP needs to be done in minimum time. This study aimed to describe and analyze 
implementation of PERT-type system model in order to reduce CIP cycle time in food industry. Research 
data is obtained from historical data of related party in production situation, with a focus of CIP cycle 
activity. Observations were also conducted directly on the object of study. Methodology approach began 
with non-productive dominant factor sorting, CIP activity elements identification, standard time data 
acquisition based on secondary data then followed by time reduction using a PERT-type system in 
heuristic manner. The results showed that CIP cycle time reduction could be achieved from the initial 
state of 330 minutes to 180 minutes per cycle.

1. Introduction
Network modelling is one of most used form of modelling in operation research because of its wide application and 
flexibility in practical situations. The width of its application often is implemented in business situation to increase 
productivity (Beer, 1967). Critical path map (CPM) as well as program review and evaluation technique (PERT) are 
special network model algorithm that is used as decision support system (DSS) (Trietsch & Baker, 2012). CPM is 
implemented to sequence a network of activities in deterministic time environment, while PERT model deals with 
activities in stochastic condition (Frederick & Lieberman, 2010; Supranto, 2006). More recently, the PERT and 
CPM systems have been combined into PERT-type system (Leitch, 1989). This system uses the fundamental 
network diagram to graphically depict sequential nature of activities. Such system rises in uses as one of important 
tools in industrial situation (Mazlum & Guneri, 2015; Puvanasvaran, 2013). Hence, in a production system, PERT-
type system can be implemented to map activities network. In a cyclic production operation, each type of activity 
involved will repeat in a similar manner in term of times and sequence. These characteristics fulfill the requirements 
of using PERT-type system model to map the network, provided each activity is interdependent, running in 
sequential manner with known duration so the critical path could be identified (Turner, 1993). 
Based on observation in food processing industry, there is a machinery and equipment cleaning phase known as CIP 
(clean in place). CIP is a necessary yet non-productive task of cleaning and sanitizing process equipment to prevent 
soils and bacterial contamination due to food processing in a long run, or to prevent cross contamination in different 
product processing (Fryer, 2005; Ryther, 2014). This activity is cyclic and comprised of several element of 
interdependent activities with certain duration of time to finish the task. These elements build a sequence of activity 
with a certain order of execution, and must be done is such sequential order to be finished. Since CIP solely 
concentrates on process cleaning, it does not produce any value added goods and must be done in as minimum time 
as possible. Moreover based on observation, the total duration of one CIP cycle is 330 minutes. Such cycle repeats 
in average of 14 times a month. This total average monthly time of 4620 minutes became Pareto dominant factor of

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, a PERT-type system approach can be implemented to reduce setup time in production system. This 
network analysis provides a measurement background to identify major sources of process bottleneck, especially if 
it consists of large network of activities. Combined with other techniques such as SMED, administrative change, 
work simplification and division, and equipment reengineering, a non-productive setup time can be reduced though 
optimality is not guaranteed. Compared to mathematical model on addressing CPM, this combined heuristic 
approach provides a more practical solution in industrial settings, where fast identification of process bottleneck is 
the essence of rapid improvement implementation. Decision makers then could react accordingly to manage and 
improve/reduce duration of critical path activities.

Abstract 
Performance management is the next step after an organization’s level of performance is measured. By 
observing the results of performance measurement, an organization is able to see where it stands 
regarding its operations and performance. In this paper, a Decision Support Network is introduced for 
effective procurement performance management and improvement. The procurement process involves 
many contributing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which determine the procurement performance. 
The focus of this paper is mostly on performance management. Any organization seeks further 
improvements in its operations. Hence, they proceed with making decisions which they hope might 
increase their credibility. Yet still the implications of such decisions are to be studied so that the 
organization can make such decisions with more confidence, by knowing the expected impact in advance. 
Once the model is built, it could be used for analyzing and foreseeing the result of any kind of decision in 
the organization. The fundamentals of Bayesian Networks are used to build the Decision Network (DN). 
This DN is built for procurement performance management in particular and an application of it is 
demonstrated through the ending of the paper.

1. Introduction and motivation
Procurement constitutes a high volume of costs and monetary turnover in any organization and hence is at 
significant importance to the organization (Abdollahi et al., 2015; Nair et al., 2015). Therefore it is vital to track and 
monitor procurement practices in an organization. It has been mentioned in the literature that better procurement 
practices can lead to huge savings in terms of costs and can secure a competitive edge in the market. The task of 
monitoring and improving the procurement process is facilitated through procurement performance measurement 
(Abolbashari et al., 2017) and procurement performance management (Abolbashari et al., 2018). These two 
complementary stages enable the organization to not only evaluate their current procurement practices, but to also 
manage it in an effective way. In fact, the design and implementation of a Procurement Performance Measurement 
System (PPMS) is the means towards achieving procurement excellence (Pohl and Forstl, 2011). 
Performance measurement is the predecessor of any other action after that seeking improvement. Through 
performance measurement, an organization can evaluate its current performance. However, the goal is not just to see 
what happens when we take a certain action, but to what action we should take to reach an outcome which is 
favorable. The former is introduced as performance measurement where the latter falls into the category of 
performance management. The implication of decisions is mapped by performance measurement. The optimum 
decision, however, is determined by performance management where we reverse the process. In the latter, the output 
of each decision is foreseen and the best decision which returns the most utility is selected as the optimum decision. 
Figure 1 captures the two concepts of performance measurement and performance management in terms of their 
components and how they work. In this figure, the implications of the current decisions/practices are mapped

expressed in Tables 4 to 6. Note that the utility acquired from each decision regarding a KPI is dependent to the 
impact that KPI has on the overall procurement performance level.

According to the results in Table 7, the optimum decision is to invest on Staff training and Procurement cycle time 
but not to invest on Supplier performance. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The focus of this paper is on performance management using Influence Diagrams, followed by its application in the 
field of procurement. Once the performance level in an organization is measured, the organization will have an 
understanding on how well its operations are. The step after that is to undertake effective actions (performance 
management) to maintain a good level of performance or to improve a poor one. The level of procurement

performance is levered by the amount of resources1 spent on it. One strategy to improve procurement performance is 
to make better use of the current available resources, spent for maintaining procurement proficiency level. In this 
strategy, the resources are re-allocated among the KPIs in which the more important KPIs, receive a higher volume 
of resources and vice versa (Abolbashari et al., 2018). Alternatively, an organization might be willing to spend more 
resources to improve procurement performance. The latter is studied in this paper and an Influence Diagram is used 
for determining the optimum decision. 
5. Future research
Apart from the scenario illustrated in this paper, two more scenarios can be studied for future work. The first 
scenario is when only one KPI needs to be selected for the organization to focus on. The application of such a 
scenario is for some organizations that are willing to have a single strategy as their core competitive advantage. In 
this case, all KPIs need to be compared against a single utility function and the KPI which returns the most expected 
utility should be chosen. The second scenario is when a limited amount of resources is available. In this case, 
considering the optimum decision regarding each KPI might exceed the resource cap. This case is similar to 
distributing a constant value of resources among a portfolio of KPIs. In such a case, a portfolio of KPIs with a 
fraction level of investment for each need to be selected for improvement, conditioned to the resource cap is not 
exceeded. Moreover in this case, a decision regarding a KPI affects the decision that could be made regarding other 
KPIs. The challenge to deal with here is a combined ID in which all the KPIs are present where a decision regarding 
each KPI is considered simultaneously with the decisions on the other KPIs.

Abstract 
Developments in aviation technology have led to the emergence of new aircraft taxiing strategies 
such as electric driven aircraft nose gear. Selecting appropriate aircraft taxiing strategies is 
crucial in view of increasing concerns surrounding airport ground emission and fuel 
consumption. This paper reports on the performance of strategies regarding aircraft taxiing 
processes at airports. The research aims to optimize emission reductions hence simultaneously 
minimizing fuel consumption. The performance measurements of taxiing operations were based 
on total emissions and fuel consumption. Daily data on aircraft arrivals and departures, runways 
and gates were analyzed, and the preferred aircraft taxiing strategy was presented. Amsterdam 
Schiphol Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport were selected as the case studies. The 
International Civil Aviation Organization, (ICAO) emissions database was used to determine the 
emission index and fuel-burning index for each type of aircraft. In order to model the taxiing 
strategies, discrete event modelling tools of DELPHI 7 with TOMAS compiler were used. The 
result shows that the three alternative taxiing strategies reduced emissions and fuel burned at 
both airports as compared of full-engine taxiing. However, there is a slight increment of NOx 
emission for operational towing strategy due to emissions from tow trucks.

Abstract 
The aim of this study is to propose an incubator framework for a new start-up in Thailand. Literature review 
of the incubator practices, critical success factors and their processes were analyzed and summarized. The 
paper conducted in-depth interviews with five incubator experts and,-two successful startups in Thailand 
followed by an-, in-depth case study at the Chulalongkorn University’s Innovation Hub. Six incubation’s 
activities to support and scale up the startup were observed in conjunction with interviews the participants 
and mentors. The analysis shows that the incubator activity consists of pre-incubated process, incubated 
process, and accelerator process. Factors such as startup team capability, networks, quality of the mentors, 
and market efficiency play an equally important success in the incubation process.

1. Introduction
Innovation has been widely recognized in the industrial sector for providing the competitive advantage and create the 
economic value for countries around the world. Many countries are continuously searching for innovative promotion 
framework which are best suited to their country’s economic environment. Many new start-ups use innovation create 
the opportunities for their business, but not all of them survived. There are number of reasons why some start-up 
companies fail, for example, the product does not meet the market demand, wrong team, lack of business skills, lack 
of managerial experience, lack of funding support (Crowne, 2002). Incubation activity has been addressed as a 
mechanism to support start-up through education, resource sharing, co-working space, and collaborative network 
(Smilor, 1987; Heckett and Dilts, 2004a; Dee et al., 2011). The incubation concept try to link the technology, 
knowledge and capital in order to increase the new start-up competency and support to develop the new start-up 
companies (Grimaldi and Grandi, 2005). In developed countries, the various studies using the incubation concept 
determine the business policy which assists in promoting sustainable economic growth (Salem, 2014). However, the 
incubation process is not exactly defined in many related studies (Tehodorakopoulos et al. 2014), especially in 
developing country. In a developing country, like Thailand, still encounters problems lack of quality start-up.  Even 
though the government, private sector and university are continuing to provide support and educate the new start-ups, 
these start-ups still lack business and technology knowledge, and struggling to find an innovative partner. (National 
Science Technology and Innovation Policy Office, 2017).  Moreover, there is less communication between 
institutions, each operates on its own (Wonglimpiyarat, 2016) hence there are duplicated activities, resources and no 
improvement of the incubation processes.  The aim of this study is to propose an incubator framework for a new start-
up in Thailand by using a mixed methodology research that include the key success factors and the incubation process 
in Thailand.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
Incubation play an important role in encouraging the startup for its survival and growth in the competitive business 
environment. This paper looks at incubation concept framework in Thailand. We developed a framework of incubation 
model based on the theoretical foundation and the literature on incubation effectiveness model. The critical success 
factors were exposed from the in-depth interview and observation case study of incubation in Thailand. The incubation 
conceptual framework consists of pre-incubation, incubation, acceleration phase. Each phase provide the activities in 
support of the start-up. The pre-incubation phase focus on the development of the startup idea base on the market need 
and the start-up capability. The incubation phase focus on bring the product to market by provision service including 
advance business coaching and training, share administration support, and monitoring startup tenant closely against 
their business plan. The acceleration phase focus on scale up the potential startup into the global new market.  
  
Most activities focus on training and workshop the startup tenant of creating the idea to meet the market need. The 
screening and selection criteria is help to screen the applicant who are talented and fit for the program through the 
application and interview. The program activities should provide the section that allow the startup tenant to explore 
the market need by survey the customer need outside the classroom. The activity key success factors are the startup 
team especially team leader and the mentor. The result is, the startup tenant receive after attending the program are 
the mindset on entrepreneurship and the connection between other tenants and mentor. 
  
By comparing the result of in-deep interview and observation six case studies, the result implies that the success of 
the innovation begins with the start-up team who have a passion and commitment. Under incubation process, there

are a number of factors that supports the successful start-up, there are administrative support, training and coaching, 
business advice, mentor, and network.   
Incubation should act as a centre of knowledge that encourages the start-up and community to exchange the ideas 
between inside and outside of the incubation. The incubation should create the value-added network system between 
government, university, the private sector and the community. The value-added network system is providing real-
time, two-way transactional capabilities for the stakeholders. The important mechanism is to connect to an automatic 
network where important information or advice can be obtained. Sometimes, a start-up does not know where to contact 
each network such as where to find the source of funds, which technology can support their concept, etc. Therefore, 
the business incubator should act as an immediate centre of the network that can find the relevant network for an 
entrepreneur. In addition, every entrepreneur needs different incubation services, especially training, coaching, and 
consulting. The incubation should find out what the new start-up lack and choose the right program for their needs.

Abstract 
This paper presents a classification of Product Design Methodologies for manufacturing refrigerator in 
Bangladesh: Design for Production, Design for Manufacturability, Design for Aesthetics, Design for 
Environment and Design for Ergonomics. Each product design methodologies were distinguished with 
well explanation and pictorial illustration. The selection of the most appropriate methodology for a 
particular product (refrigerator) in a particular market/country may depend on following criterions or 
variables: sales quantity, product durability, cost saving, ease on production etc. Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) could be a very useful tool in comparative study of different product design 
methodologies based on different criterion for selection of the most appropriate methodology. So, how 
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used for selection of the most appropriate product design 
methodology for manufacturing refrigerator in Bangladesh is also discussed in this paper.

Abstract 
The management of spare part has been a crucial thing regarding the availability and reliability of a 
machine. Managing of spare part inventory is different with managing of material at production process. 
The forecast of the spare part need with a special demand pattern needs a suitable method. Exponential 
Smoothing method that was often used giving forecast result that is not suitable with what the spare part 
really needs. In this present research, the Croston method is used for forecasting spare part demand. This 
method considers the mean of non-zero demand as well as the interval of it. Moreover, this method is going 
to be compared to Syntetos-Boylan Approximation (SBA) which is the advancement of the Croston method. 
Before classifying the spare part based on the analysis of FSN which is going to get the forecast spare part. 
From the error comparison, SBA method has less error score. It has least score on 14 kind of spare parts 
from the 16 spare parts, which already predicted. Meanwhile the 2 kind of spare parts has least score on 
Croston method.

Abstract 
Universities increasingly are facing budgetary pressures along with stringent accreditation requirements. 
Students too have expectations of educational programs such as time to graduation, cost, quality, flexibility, 
and variety of course offerings. Researchers have addressed program planning using techniques such as 
optimization, simulation, Markov analysis, material requirements planning, and flow analysis (Little’s 
Law).  In this paper, we invoke project management methodology to address this problem by envisioning 
a program from the student’s perspective as a project requiring completion of tasks (courses). Each “task” 
has a specific duration (semester) and precedence requirements (prerequisites). From the institution’s 
standpoint, program management can therefore be viewed as one of managing multiple projects with the 
objective of minimizing average duration while meeting various student-facing criteria.  However this poses 
a significant challenge to the institution beginning with the need to define appropriate performance 
measures that capture the subtleties in the education sector.  Moreover, educational projects as defined here 
vary from conventional projects in that the client’s participation goes beyond mere financial commitment 
and includes active value co-creation. Completing courses and navigating a path to degree completion 
requires collaboration of student and institution through the advising process. Our approach takes into 
account both strategic concerns and operational nuances.

Abstract 
This study consists of modeling and solving a real problem in the supply chain design of a real petroleum 
company in Pakistan. The company facing an increase in the demand of some of its oil products decided 
to restructure its distribution network to serve the northern customers in Pakistan. The products are 
transported from the plant in Karachi to the warehouses (currently in Lahore and Multan) before delivery 
to one of the fourteen customer regions. The problem consisted of deciding how to relocate warehouses 
by opening a new one and eventually closing existing ones, how to reassign customer regions to the 
different warehouses, and analyzing the impact of different possible solutions. 
The problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear program and solved using Microsoft Excel Solver. This 
choice is motivated by the availability of the software, its accessibility for the practitioners and its post-
optimal analysis capabilities. 
We present a thorough analysis of the results in terms of different costs, distribution modes, and other 
practical considerations. 
In addition to the usefulness of our work for the company, it can serve as a good case study for students 
taking a course in supply chain management and logistics.

Abstract  
Risk is something found almost everywhere, and not managing risks can be extremely costly. This study focuses on 
climate-based risks associated with the oil and gas industry in Libya. The primary data was acquired through a survey 
study, where a total of 150 questionnaires were distributed to a targeted population. 71 of the questionnaires returned 
indicating 47.3% involvement of the survey population. The water related issues are common climate risks, and most 
of the companies spread climate risks among insurance companies, while others retain and manage these risks. Based 
on the ranked results, this study illustrates various critical climate risk factors. The top ten of these factors are 
extremely critical. These include temperatures, lack of water availability and droughts, loss of access to water, loss of 
peak cooling capacity, air pollution, gas leaks or pipeline explosions, burning of fossil fuels early season delays, 
damage to coastal facilities, and changes in land use. However, the majority of firms adopt a risk transfer strategy 
followed by risk response and risk acceptance strategies for treating climate risks. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
to adopt possible ways to avoid the harmful impacts of climate risks for the improvement of the efficiency of projects.

1. Introduction 
As the oil and gas industry of the world is currently operating in places with an extreme range of environment for 
example deep water, arctic, regions and hot and arid areas, it is of key importance for the companies to identify and 
evaluate the risks of climate changes in these environments. The climate variables have a significant impact on the oil 
and gas industry and the potential variables that have been identified by the world industry include the rise of sea 
level, floods; migratory shifts of different species, availability of water, extreme events and permafrost thawing just 
to name a few. These variables present a risk for not only the operations of the oil and gas sector but also to its 
supporting infrastructure and the value chain involved. In this study, the climate risk factors associated with oil and 
gas industry in the Libyan perspective were discovered by integrating the questionnaires approach and literature 
review approach. Afterword, the identified risks were analyzed and evaluated based on the opinion of the survey 
respondents.  
 
However, in 2013 International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) reported that 
the coastal barriers are under degradation as a result of increased erosion. The enhanced permafrost thawing is causing 
a reduced time. The change in the precipitation patterns of the particular regions and their frequency is affecting the 
water resource availability which would ultimately affect the operations by flood susceptibility. In the northern 
latitude, the increased lightning strikes have a potential to damage the infrastructure and also have a strong impact on 
the communities of particular importance are the ones that lack the electrical grounding and are wildfire susceptible. 
Nevertheless, it is important to understand the risks of these climate changes for neighbors and other communities that","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

h) Mitigation strategy: risk mitigation strategy can be established as a result of active identification and evaluation 
of climate risks associated with the oil and gas industry. This strategy consequently explains a way to develop a 
framework through which existing operations within the firm can be accomplished with a relatively low cost. Some 
possible treatments were identified from the literature and loaded into the questionnaire. Table 3 shows the responses 
of the survey participants that are ranked through weighted average (Equation 1). The results show that the transfer 
strategy ranked first with 14.5 weighted average and response strategy ranked second with 13.46 weighted average.

7. Summary and Conclusions 
Climate risks and changes have a devastating impact on oil and gas sector worldwide regardless of any specific 
country. Among many stern climatic risks, water related issues like lack of water, leakages, poor water quality and 
floods have deep impact on oil and gas operations and consequently raises time and cost of the entire project. Similarly, 
high temperature has overwhelming impact and result in cost increases during oil exploration, extraction, 
transportation and refining operations. The climate risks also result in failure of physical assets, risks to the health and 
safety of the workers, intensified pressure on the available water resources; financial assets value drop and a significant 
damage to the reputation of the company. A rapid increase in climate risks placed a greater risk for the communities 
through a number of incidents. It is concluded that Libyan professionals today are familiar with the importance of 
climate risks and their impact on various projects in oil and gas context. It is also important to know that climate 
changes in neighboring countries can also influence the operations to a great extent in terms of disturbance in the 
transportation system, weather effects, water supply, and communication etc. The impact of human activities on 
climate changes due to overloading the atmosphere with CO2 is the point raised by many international organizations, 
but it is perceived as a low impacting factor in Libya. 
 
The geographical position and weather changes in Libya have upsetting impact. Many water related issues are the 
common climate risks in Libya. Although, the NOC along with the government has taken many steps to bring 
improvement in the availability of water resources but still it is not standardized. From the survey results, it can be 
concluded that professionals are confused about the responsible authority or body for minimizing or eliminating the 
impacts of climate risks. Thus, the major reason for this confusion is the lack of knowledge of the respondents. It is 
also found that oil and gas companies in Libya do have adequate climate risk reduction policy to stay away from the 
devastating impacts of climate risks. Most of the companies also spread climate risks among insurance companies 
while others retain and manage these risks. 
 
Climate risks are always critical to oil and gas companies, but not all risks have the same impact. In this study, several 
climate risks are identified and ranked on the basis of experienced professionals and matched the results with previous 
studies. Based on the ranking results, this study concludes various critical climate risk factors where top ten are 
extremely critical such as: high temperatures, lack of water availability and droughts, loss of access to water, loss of 
peak cooling capacity, air pollution, gas leaks or pipeline explosions, burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), early 
season delays, damage to coastal facilities, and changes in land use. The full list is available in Table 2. It is evident 
in the list that a majority of top factors are related to air and water pollution and leakages.  
 
The climate risk management is a part of risk management strategy and has become an integral part of the organization 
strategy of oil and gas companies worldwide. The multinational companies usually manage various climate risks with","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

high and low impacts during their routine operations. Therefore, the adoption plans are developed as a vital part of the 
climate risk management to organize and minimize the identified risks for the operations. In most of the oil and gas 
companies in Libya, the responsibility of managing climate risks is given to either operations department or senior 
management. Hence due to lack of separate risk management department or experts, only few companies adopt risk 
management strategies in either formal or informal ways. However, it is a good sign that survey respondents showed 
their understanding about the importance of climate risk management. It is also concluded that a majority of firms in 
oil and gas sector in Libya adopt a risk transfer strategy followed by risk response and risk acceptance strategies for 
treating climate risks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt possible ways to avoid the harmful impacts of climate 
risks for the improvement of efficiency of Libyan oil and gas projects.

Abstract 
Although the Republic of Indonesia had conducted number of gender equality programmes, it is still 
remaining as one of the highest inequality index in the far east. This shows that males are still dominant 
in each indicator, whether employment, education or representation in parliament. The importance of 
women's decision-making issues has been recognised within the framework of the millennium 
development goals. One of the indicators to monitor the Millennium Development Goal 3 on gender 
equality. One of the skill requirements for a leader that can be a benchmark of leadership effectiveness is 
decision making. The research was conducted at Universitas Narotama, Surabaya, while for survey and 
data collection was done at Ministry of Research and Technology Dikti and Kopertis VII East Java. One 
of the skill requirements for a leader that can be a benchmark of leadership effectiveness is decision 
making as one of the methodology content. The paper will provide an insight research on finding the 
impact of inequality gender within the University in Indonesia focusing on the management leadership. 
The paper will summaries and provide a recommendation to the Ministry of the Higher Education of 
Indonesia.

Abstract 
Air traffic control (ATC) is an important profession that directly affects the performance of flight operations in the air 
and on the ground. The fluctuating number of incidents and accidents in the aviation sector is as a result of various 
factors, in which safety culture is a vital factor in establishing the overall safety in aviation.  This research aims to 
assess individual perceptions and judgments of safety culture in practical contexts utilizing nine aspects of safety 
culture (Work situation, Learning, Communication, Risk perception, Attitude toward safety, Justness, Safety-related 
behaviors, Flexibility and Reporting). The safety culture was assessed using observations, questionnaire packages and 
interviews. This study pertains to the ATC staff in Mitiga International Airport, Tripoli, Libya. A number of 25 
samples of the suggested questionnaires were collected, along with a numeral of interviews. Assessment of the nine 
aspects were found to function well with good reliability (internal consistency) with (α) value above 0.8. A five-point 
Likert Scale was used. Assessment with gained results of mean, standard deviation and variance showed medium 
average scores in the nine aspects. An individual characteristic such as experience was found to have very little effect 
on how the safety culture aspects were perceived and judged.

1- Introduction  
Air traffic controllers (ATC) are people trained to maintain the safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic in the 
global ATC system. The position of air traffic controllers is one that requires highly specialized knowledge, skills, 
and abilities. Controllers apply separation rules to keep aircrafts at a safe distance from each other in their area of 
responsibility and move all aircraft safely and efficiently through their assigned sector of airspace, as well as on the 
ground. Due to the fact that controllers have an incredibly large responsibility while on duty and make countless real-
time decisions on a daily basis, the ATC profession is consistently regarded around the world as one of the most 
mentally challenging careers, and can be notoriously stressful depending on many variables (equipment, 
configurations, weather, traffic volume, human factors, etc.) However, recently, several studies shined a light on the 
importance of the risk management in the aviation sector Elkhweldi and Elabrouk (2015).  
 
The aim of this research is to assess individual perceptions and judgments of safety culture in practical contexts 
utilizing nine aspects of safety culture along with their related questions (Work situation, Learning, Communication, 
Risk perception, Attitude toward safety, Justness, Safety-related behaviors, Flexibility and Reporting). The safety 
culture was assessed using observations, questionnaire packages and interviews. This study pertains to the ATC staff 
in Mitiga International Airport located in Tripoli, Libya. A number of 25 samples of the suggested questionnaires 
were collected, along with a number of interviews which had been conducted with mangers and staff. In this research, 
the study sample was nominated from the control tower of Mitiga airport. The age range of the respondents from 26 
to 56, the experience range varied between 2 to 31 years. However, upon the examination of the gathered data the 
revealed results could prove to be useful in upgrading the current level of safety culture and consequently developing 
the overall safety structure. Assessing safety culture in the ATC sector can show whether there is a positive culture or 
negative culture in the ATC sector. Since safety culture affects the overall safety of the ATC profession, so there is a 
good chance to improve safety through upgrading safety culture aspects that may be useful for the appraisal of the","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

which equals to 3.08 and the guided Mean number of Likert Scale Table 4 which equals (M = 3.4). In addition, the T-
test illustrates in Table 6 that most values of significance (Sig.) are at less than 0.05. These results revealed that the 
first hypothesis (Null Hypothesis h0) failed to be ascertained and the alternative hypothesis (h a) is true which specify 
that the safety culture of the ATC sector is in the level of negative safety culture.

9- Conclusion 
Since the safety culture was studied using observations, questionnaire packages, interviews, and collection of facts, 
the nine scales representing the nine safety culture aspects were found to function well (with a good level of 
measurement reliability) in the ATC sector settings. The questionnaire packages allowed an establishment of reference 
data concerning safety culture aspects in the ATC sector. Likewise, the interviews provided knowledge and examples 
of positive and negative expressions of safety culture that the interviewees had experienced. 
 
The comparisons of average scores for safety culture aspects showed that the ATC sector generally had the lower 
average scores. An individual characteristic such as experience was found to have very little effect on how the safety 
culture aspects were perceived and judged. It was found that the learning processes are not as proficient. The 
communication was not considered by most of respondents to function well. A negative concern was found in the 
training on how communication should function in an emergency situation. Respondents think that communication 
functions well during change of shift (e.g. information at hand over). Some negative responses were noticed that it is","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

not clear who they should contact to discuss questions of safety. They agreed that there is not much information that 
they receive about incidents and accidents.  Reporting in ATC sector is showing better in this aspect.  
 
10- Recommendation 
Further research in safety culture should concentrate on: 
o 
Developing methods for assessing the behavioral and situational areas of safety culture. 
o 
Testing the relations of safety culture to safety management. 
o 
Determining which aspects and items are important for the measurement of safety culture. For instance, in 
order to reduce the questionnaire package to an essential minimum, question such as, what elements influence 
safety behaviors, and how they exert this influence are imperative to finding the key indicators. 
o 
Culture measurement stage to an improvement stage is an essential and big issue that make it very important 
to concentrate and take quick and serious actions to expedite having the required suitable changes, from the 
other hand share lessons gained from previous different safety culture practices. 
o 
It is recommended that, more research is conducted in relation to pilots, maintenance staff and airport 
handling staff to have a full and complete idea about safety culture in addition to having more knowledge to 
facilitate the improvement of the aviation sector aligning it with that of the fast-pace advancements existing 
in the field of aviation.

Abstract 
The growth of the maritime economy and the tourism economy is increasingly supported by the Sea Tol 
(Sea Highway) program. Data states that the number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia during January-
April 2016 reached 3.52 million visits. In addition to the maritime economy, data also suggested up by 
1.98 percent compared to the previous month and up 16.50 percent compared to the same month in 2015. 
Economic growth in East Indonesia should be optimally utilised by the Government by developing the 
Maritime Economy and Tourism Integration Model. This study aims to model, mapping and economic 
feasibility of Maritime Economic Integration and Tourism in the region to improve the economy of East 
Indonesia, along with the making of Geographic Information System that supports the economic 
development. Research conducted in three stages, first stage is modeling, mapping and economic 
feasibility analysis of Maritime Economic and Tourism Integration Model, accompanied by making 
Geographic Information System, continued Second stage is to develop Geographic Information System 
application model of Integration of Maritime Economy and Tourism Development Eastern Indonesia. The 
paper will present the first stage of the modelling and mapping based on the data provided by Indonesian 
government.

Abstract 
 
 
Electronic manufacturing companies spend a significant portion of their quality costs on calibration; which 
in most cases is done externally to the company. This case study company mainly manufactures remote 
controls for electronic devices; after carrying out a cost analysis of calibration, it was concluded the 
resources were allocated for an integral project to implement an internal calibration laboratory. The 
objectives of the project were: (a) to reduce costs in the payment for calibration services, (b) to evaluate a 
team as a working standard to carry out internal calibrations with company personnel applying current 
standards, (c) to record data for the control and administration of the measurement equipment of the 
company and (d) to train the personnel implanting a metrology culture. Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma 
tools were used in the development of this project. The mathematical model for the equipment to be 
calibrated is based on the NMX-CH-140-IMNC: 2002 (Mathematical Model of the Measured) and NMX-
EC-17025:2006 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories). The 
results reflect the economic feasibility of implementing a calibration laboratory in the company, reducing 
costs by 20%.

1.  Introduction 
 
Metrology-related activities in the manufacturing industry promote and maintain uniformity and accuracy in 
measurements. Marbán & Pellecer [1] mention that there is a relationship between metrology and quality, between 
measurements and quality control, calibration, laboratory accreditation, traceability and certification. Without 
metrology, it would be impossible to verify the quality of products or processes, as defined in international regulations. 
In other words, metrology and standardization are essential for quality assurance [2]. Metrology ensures that 
measuring instruments contribute to quality control of industrial processes; to achieve this, these instruments must be 
calibrated regularly [3]. According to the Federal Law of Metrology in Mexico, calibration is ""a set of operations that 
aim to determine the errors of a measuring instrument and, if necessary, other metrological characteristics"" [4]. On 
the other hand, the standard NMX-Z-55IMNC: 2009 defines calibration as: 
 ""An operation that under specific conditions establishes, in a first stage, a relationship between values and 
their measurement uncertainties obtained from measurement patterns and the corresponding indications with 
their associated uncertainties; in a second stage it uses this information to establish a relation that allows to 
obtain a measurement result from an indication ""[5]. 
The calibration of an instrument guarantees a correct operation within the instrument specifications, and it is a 
fundamental tool to ensure the traceability of a measurement [1]. Performing the calibration, every year or whenever 
determined, will allow to identify and reveal the possible deviations of the equipment over time. Some of the benefits 
of calibration are that: (a) it guarantees a level of measurement uncertainty that can be achieved with the measuring 
instrument, (b) it confirms if there has been any alteration in the measuring instrument that could cast doubt on the 
results of former measurements, and (c) it determines the deviation between the indicated value, the so-called true",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

internal calibration system in the company SMK. Figure 6 shows the decrease in calibration costs in year 2 compared 
to the first year when transferring equipment internally, lowering the cost of billing for payment of calibration services, 
thus concluding that the objective of reducing the cost of calibration by 20% was achieved. It is convenient to invest 
in more equipment as a standard for dimensional, RF (radio frequency), pressure, among others. According to the 
stratification that was done in the analysis of the magnitudes, it is observed in this case study that when investing in 
standard equipment the calibration costs decrease.

5.1 Future Work, Opportunities for Improvement in the Metrology Area 
 
This work was done developing the electrical magnitude, however, there are improvement opportunities in transferring 
other magnitudes such as: dimensional, RF (Frequency Radio), frequency, pressure, temperature and mass simulation. 
According to the classification of magnitude analysis, there is also a lot of documentary work to do as it can be seen 
in figure 5.12 there are sections that were not realized in this project; what was achieved, however, in terms of the 
clauses of the standard NMX-EC-17025: 2006 were the clauses: 4.7 Customer Service, 4.10 Improvements, 5.2 
Personnel, 5.3 Environmental Conditions, 5.5 Equipment, 5.6 Traceability and 5.10 Certificates of Calibration. The 
opportunity for improvement is the implementation of the other clauses and the transfer of the aforementioned 
magnitudes.

Abstract (12 font) 
Indonesia is currently on the fast forwad of developing new housing, sky building, apartment, 
offices and malls. Evidences suggested that they implement a specific method to ensuring 
development meet to the target both in time and cost. However, the evidences also suggested that 
the quality of build are at comprised on several areas in Indonesia. There are number of different 
methods use by different real estate to achieve their goal. The purpose of this paper is therefore 
to investigate of the method used by the real estate and develop a new method using the six 
sigma approaches to improved their quality of build, lower the cost and ensuring consistency of 
the supply chain for the materials and labour. This paper will provide the data analysis and 
present the finding.  To achieve this, data from REI (real estate Indonesia) will be used and 
literature review will be critically used as a guidance. The outcome of this paper will benefit for 
the real estate in term of cost and quality of build.

Abstract 
In Mexico, pharmacies have the possibility of offering basic health services inside or close to their facilities. 
The foregoing generates direct competition for non-profit civil associations such as the Mexican Red Cross 
in Monterrey (MRCM), which currently has nine urban health facilities, known as relief bases. As it is well 
known, the Red Cross is maintained through donations, and for the services provided, a voluntary fee is 
asked.  Due to the recent financial losses, and looking for increasing the productivity of its health care 
facilities, the MRCM is considering the closure of some of them with a minimal social impact due to the 
decrease of the community’s access to health services. 
The closure's impact of urban health facilities has not been deeply explored. After a bibliographic review, 
fifteen variables related to social impact were identified, which were grouped into three categories: 
competition, organization and affected population. Based on these variables, this paper proposes two 
strategies to increase the productivity of the MRCM: a staff reassignment scheme and an optimization 
model to determine which relief bases should be closed with the least social impact and significantly 
increase of the MRCM’s average productivity.

Introduction 
One of the action lines of the Mexican Red Cross (MRC) in Monterrey, Mexico, hereafter MRCM, is to provide 
medical services in the nine relief bases located in the metropolitan area. The objective of this project is to increase 
the productivity of the medical services operations of these relief bases. The MRC is a humanitarian institution of 
private assistance, which is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It is dedicated to 
preventing and alleviating human suffering in a timely manner to improve the living conditions of people and 
communities in situations of emergency or disasters (Mexican Red Cross Delegación Monterrey, 2017).  
The MRCM has nine relief bases which are located in the municipalities of Monterrey, Escobedo, Guadalupe, 
Apodaca, Santa Catarina, García and San Pedro. (see Figure 1). These facilities are intended to provide emergency

the exercise of calculating the HHI was done taking into account that all the bases of the MRCM were closed and an 
index of 1,541 was obtained, that is, a moderately concentrated market. Because the market does not fall into a 
monopoly even though the MRCM completely eliminates its presence, the restriction of the HHI index was eliminated 
to avoid being redundant.  
 
The mathematical model and the sensitivity analysis was performed in GAMS. A standard laptop was used, so the 
model is not very complex and had an average computation time of 0.072 seconds. Also, the productivity equation is 
non-linear, so the MINLP solver was used.

Results 
 
Without any other restrictions, the optimal solution found was to close 6 out of the 9 relief bases, as observed in Table 
4.  Given that the project research was to achieve a 10% productivity increase, the closest solution is to close only 
three bases.  With this solution, the equivalent to 1.63 ambulances could be operated monthly or a total of extra 43 
health campaigns could be performed with the resources released by the three closed bases. The market will be able 
to absorb the demand of the closed base. It is important to note the robustness of the solution, since the increasing 
number of closures only add a new base but not change the previous decisions.

Conclusions 
 
Regarding the first strategy, the proposal 7 in Table 3 was suggested to the client, which consists of maintaining the 
current staff of doctors and interns, but reducing in each relief base to half the staff of nurses and social workers. If 
the client follows this proposal for improvement for all the bases, it would reduce his salary expense by 19%, (this is 
MXN$137,500.00 savings per month, which could be used for any other purpose of the organization, according to his 
priorities In one year, savings of MXN$ 1,650,000.00 would be generated only in salaries. With respect to the second 
strategy, according to the needs of the organization and its scope, it was decided that closing three relief bases was 
within the possibilities of the MRCM: García, Monterrey and Metroplex. With this strategy, a relative increase in 
productivity of 9.10% is generated.  In addition, by combining the suggestions proposed in both strategies it will be 
possible to achieve a relative increase in productivity by 21.04%, which is greater than the proposed as the general 
objective that was 10%. 
 
On other hand, results reveal that in an urban context, as the one analyzed in this project, the closure of bases does not 
affect the capacity of the market to provide the current (basic) health services.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 
According to Food and Agricultural Organization 
(FAO), Indonesia is the third largest tuna producer in the 
world on 2010, after Japan and China [4]. The tuna 
fishery in Indonesia has developed so much which 
showed by the significant increase in the fish exploration 
and exploitation activities in the last decade. The 
uncontrolled exploitations can degenerate the stock of fish 
as well as profit in fish industry in the long period of time. 
 
According to Damianus Suryanto, Head Researcher 
in Indonesia Fisheries Research and Development Center, 
tuna need to get special attention because it has the 
highest exploitation rate among other type of fish in 
Indonesia for the last decade [8]. Most of these tuna is 
exported to Japan, Thailand, USA, China and Europe. A 
lot of these tuna are produced at the coast of Sendang Biru 
in Malang Regency, which is the largest grade “A” tuna 
producer in the entire East Java, Indonesia. 
 
In Malang Regency, the production of tuna is having 
an increasing trend from 2005 to 2010 but after 2010 the 
production is tend to decline (shown by figure 1). In the 
other hand, the number of boat is tend to increase from 
time to time for the last decade. This is a counter-intuitive 
effect, where increasing number of boat commonly will 
cause higher production (before 2010), but in this case 
(after 2010) the production is declining because of the 
over-exploitation activities several years before. 
 
System dynamics (hereinafter referred as SD) 
approach has been widely used to analyze a number of 
ecology-concern problems such as energy management 
[6], population health [5], or even fish nursery [2], 
including about tuna [7]. However, there is still very 
limitted number of works have been dedicated to analyze 
and give solution to fishery problems. For example, 
according to [3] in her research, SD is suitable to map the 
high tuna fishery complexity and its behavior-pattern 
along with the flow of time. Another research also made 
by [4] in the coast of Sendang Biru using SD approach, he 
cited that such approach is suitable to describe the tuna 
dynamic population. 
 
 
Fig. 1.  Tuna production in Sendang Biru from 2005 to 2015 [1] 
 
 
However,  all of above mentioned works still have a 
drawback when exploring system under discussion for 
tuna fishery comprehensively. Only applying SD 
approach for doing policy analysis is inadequate since 
there are more than one parties involve in manipulating 
options to get the best possible outcome for each party. In 
this study, the parties are local government, fisherman, 
and fish trader. In overcoming this challenge, game theory 
(hereinafter reffered as GT) approach is used. In applying 
this approach, interaction amongst parties could be 
accomodated to provide win-win solutions. 
 
II.  METHODOLOGY 
 
 
The tuna fishery system is constructed by first, 
develop the conceptual model as prescribed in SD 
approach. This step is then followed by translating the 
conceptual model into a simulation model. These SD 
model is used to see the behavior of the tuna fishery 
system when some input is changed. At last, the best 
strategy for every party is determined by GT method. The 
framework of this research is shown by figure 2 below. 
The decision variables inputted into SD simulation model 
will be the strategies for players (local government, 
fisherman, and fish trader) in GT payoff matrix, while the 
simulation output will be the payoff for each player.

VI. DISCUSSION 
 
 
The simulation graph shows that the stock of tuna and 
number of catch are increasing in the early of simulation, 
but going down in the end of simulation. This is becaused 
of the increasing number of local boat in the early to more 
than half of the simulation. At the nearly end of the 
simulation, the number of local boat is tend to constant. 
When the number of local boat is constant, stock of tuna 
and number of catch are also tend to constant. This 
constant sustainable level is the most profitable level for 
all local government, fisherman, and fish trader in the 
long period of time. 
 
Based on the chosen strategy from payoff matrix in 
figure 5, the player who has most control in not over-
exploiting tuna is the fisherman. They should limit the 
number of fishing trip to a certain treshold value in order 
to keep tuna sustainability. 
 
VII. PROVISIONAL RESULTS   
   
 
This study demonstrate the development of tuna 
fishery policy analysis using the combination of SD 
simulation modelling and GT approach. The development 
a model of tuna fishery policy analysis using combined 
SD and GT approach provides an effective decision 
making mechanism to the policy makers. This study 
describes advantage and benefit of SD modelling which 
provides clear simulation for tuna fishery dynamic system 
and a practical multi-parties decision making by 
implementing Nash equilibrium concept under GT.  
 
As our further development, current tuna fishery 
model is going to be expanded and adapted into different 
kind of fishery in a different place with more involved 
parties to capture data richness so that the policy analysis 
could be performed more comprehensively. In this 
research, the foreign fisherman is not included in the 
system which they also contribute to local government 
income. Considering foreign fisherman into the system 
might give different result for the decision makers. Thus, 
further development is necessary.

Abstract 
Inbound logistics is a major challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in landlocked countries such as 
Burkina Faso, Niger and Uganda. The World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is a well-
established international logistics benchmarking study, but does not offer context or specifics of problems 
faced by importers in Africa. For this research, we adopt a case study approach on a large Singapore-
headquartered distributor with significant operating experience in Africa. The case company distributes 
consumer electronics from principals in East Asia to more than 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Semi-
structured interviews of local managers based in 4 African countries and the headquarters in Singapore 
were conducted in late 2017. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and interpreted 
in conjunction with landed cost analysis. Our preliminary findings indicate that while Africa is often seen 
as a contiguous market, logistics challenges and solutions are highly diverse within the continent. More 
importantly, landed costs of importing into an African country do not necessarily correlate with that’s 
country LPI score. Due to practical realities and infrastructure constraints, optimal freight movements 
during last-mile deliveries sometimes transcend international boundary considerations. These findings 
have implications for researchers and policy-makers studying logistics performance in emerging African 
markets.

Abstract 
This paper investigates low-carbon warehousing, via a case study at a large multinational contract 
logistics services provider. The case company’s experience and outcomes from sustainability initiatives 
were collected from interviews of two informants. More than 100 managers at the company were then 
surveyed on their perceived barriers to sustainable warehousing in their respective countries. Results 
show that while the case company has reduced carbon emissions by 36% on a revenue-normalized basis 
between 2008 and 2014, it had been less successful in reducing CO2 emissions in emerging markets, 
compared to in mature countries. The attitudes of customers and governments towards sustainability were 
the most significant barriers to the adoption of sustainable warehousing practices in the emerging Asia-
Pacific markets. More generally, external barriers were perceived to be higher in emerging economies 
than in mature economies. Findings suggest that logistics services providers, their customers and 
governments all have roles to play in emerging markets for supply chains to incorporate sustainable 
warehousing as part of a larger Logistics Social Responsibility program.

Abstract 
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is an integrated information system to manage a company’s
business  processes.  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME)  needs  ERP  but  lack  the  funds
necessary. Open Source System ERP (OSS ERP) becomes the choice for applying ERP by SMEs
for  the  price  and  customizability.  This  research  aims  to  identify  the  characteristics  and
configuration of e-commerce module OSS ERP at KKPS (Koperasi Karyawan PT SRI) using
OSS ERP Odoo.  Sales Section is the most important part in Employees Cooperation PT Suryaraya
Rubberindo Industries (KKPS). Most of the turnover is generated from the sales process. Currently the
sales process is still done manually and the procurement of goods has not been computerized, thus
causing delays in data transmission from one part to another. To improve the sales process in KKPS, a
system that supports the integration of each part is needed. Data integration with Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) system implementation is expected to help the sales process to be more efficient. The
selected ERP system is Odoo, as it is an open source ERP application that has various business
application programs. Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is used to create business process
analysis and modeling so that KKPS performance can be improved. Simulated purchase of goods is done
to ensure the Odoo Website and E-commerce module runs well. After the implementation of Odoo
Website and E-commerce module on KKPS, information on KKPS is more accessible to its members. The
purchase of products or services through KKPS can be done more easily through e-commerce.

1. Introduction
Along  with  the  increasingly  tight  competition  in  the  business  world,  the  existence  of  data  processing  into
information in computerized has contributed greatly to improve the performance of a company. Computerized data
processing is a series of activities to provide information so that the information can be used as an effective decision
support tool. Computerized data processing has various advantages, such as data processing is fast, accurate, and
support data processing on a large scale compared with data processing manually.
PT Suryaraya Rubberindo Industries (SRI) is one of the companies in Astra Group which is a subsidiary of PT Astra
Honda Motor (AHM). PT SRI established since 1991 and engaged in the industry of tires outside and tires in special
motorcycles. PT SRI has a business entity that is Employees Cooperation PT SRI (KKPS), which has several types
of business including trade/sales, savings and loans, and other businesses. Sales Section is the most important part in
KKPS, because most of the turnover is generated from sales process. Currently the sales process is still done
manually and the procurement of goods has not been computerized, thus causing delays in data transmission from
one part to another.

Abstract 
Compressibility factor, z, values of natural gases are necessary in most petroleum gas engineering calculations. Most 
common sources of the compressibility factor values are experimental measurements, equations of state method and 
empirical correlations. If laboratory measured data were unavailable, empirical correlations can be used to determine 
the compressibility factors. However, there might be discrepancies between laboratory-measured values with those 
obtained by correlations which, in turn, might affect the outcome of a study. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used 
to determine how different values of the compressibility factor would affect well testing and material balance 
equation calculations. Under a given set of data, this technique is used within specific boundaries that will depend 
on one or more methods, such as the effect that changes in reservoir's parameters obtained from build-up test and 
calculations of gas initial in place by using material balance equation. This study highlights how changes in the 
compressibility factor affect well testing results and volume of gas initially in reservoir calculated using material 
balance equation. Three wells producing under partial water drive mechanism were considered for this study. 
Dranchuk and Abu-Kassem’s method was found to have the lowest error.

1. Introduction 
A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the effect of measurement uncertainties on performance 
calculations. A detailed review of various sensitivity analysis techniques has been provided by Gevrey et al (2003). 
In this study the sensitivity of gas compressibility (z-factor) in gas well testing and material balance equation 
calculations was conducted. However, the importance of gas condensate reservoirs has grown continuously since 
the late 1930’s. Development and operation of these reservoirs, for maximum recovery, require engineering and 
operating methods significantly different from crude oil or dry gas reservoirs. Properties of reservoir fluids 
determine best program in each case. A thorough understanding of fluid properties together with good understanding 
of economics involved is therefore required for optimum engineering of gas condensate reservoirs. Other important 
aspects include geologic conditions, rock properties, well deliverability, well costs and spacing, well-pattern 
geometry and plant costs. 
 
1.1 Gas Condensate Characterization  
Hydrocarbon reservoir fluids range continuously from dry gases containing almost no condensable liquid to solid 
tars and bitumen. These hydrocarbons are classified in arbitrary divisions based on their color, density and gas-oil 
ratio. Although some gases have their source in carbonaceous rocks, most hydrocarbon accumulations originate 
from organic rich shales. The degree of degradation of complex organic molecules increases with temperature and 
pressure to which the organic matter has been subjected. Therefore, the deeper the source rock the more likely the 
resulting hydrocarbon mixture is to be gas or gas condensate that is usually found in deep reservoirs. The classical 
categories of hydrocarbons are in decreasing order of volatility.  
 
A gas condensate will generally yield from 30 to 300 barrels of liquid per million standard cubic feet of gas. Most 
known retrograde gas condensate reservoirs are in the range of 5000 to 10000 ft deep at 3000 to 8000 psi and 
temperature from 200 to 400 ᵒF.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

4. Conclusions 
A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the effect of measurement uncertainties on performance 
calculations. The following are the main conclusions that can be withdrawn from this study: 
• 
Different methods, temperatures, pressures, and gas compositions covering a wide range of naturally 
occurring petroleum gases and non-hydrocarbon impurities have been used to calculate the compressibility 
factor by empirical equations then compared with the equivalent compressibility factor determined in PVT 
laboratory. 
• 
Determination of accurate critical parameters of mixtures is an essential step in order to obtain accurate 
compressibility factor value. 
• 
Using two methods to determine critical properties with known composition yield an average absolute error 
of 17% and a maximum error over 100%. On the other hand, two other methods used to calculate the 
critical properties with unknown composition have an average absolute relative error of 22 to 82%.   
• 
Dranchuk and Abu-Kassem’s method yields lower errors than the other methods; compressibility factors at 
an average absolute error of 17% and a maximum error of 46%. 
• 
Well testing is the only method through which information on the dynamic behavior of a well/reservoir can 
be obtained.  
• 
Derivative (diagnostic) analysis plot must be used to better interpret transient pressure tests. 
• 
Wells CC11 and CC13 considered in this study can be recognized as damaged wells because their skin 
factors are positive. 
• 
Two build-up test methods were used to estimate reservoir parameters; Horner method and MDH method 
which both yielded close results. 
• 
Upon comparing reservoir parameters determined by utilizing the compressibility factor obtained by fives 
methods with those obtained by utilizing the compressibility factor obtained experimentally, Dranchuk and 
Abu-Kassem’s method yielded the lowest absolute error ranging from 0 to 10%. While Brill and Biggs’s 
method yielded an absolute error of 0.8 to 20%.

Abstract 
In construction projects, risks play a significant part in decision making and may affect the performance of the project. 
Nevertheless, construction projects always face uncertainty that leads to cost and schedule risks.  Most of those risks 
can be mitigated with better up-front planning and analysis. The cost estimate should be consistent with the schedule 
in terms of resources assumed, their productivity and other factors. Poor cost and schedule estimates lead to cost and 
schedule over-runs, poor decisions, funding problems, and other risks. As a result, project cost risk and schedule 
uncertainty should always be addressed and each task’s most likely, optimistic and pessimistic cost and duration values 
should also be documented.  
 
In this study, the cost and schedule risks associated to design and implementation of twenty housing units for low 
income people in Tripoli, Libya were analyzed. The qualitative risk analysis process carried results in a prioritized list 
of forty-four risk events. The cost and schedule risks are integrated and analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation. Two 
scenarios, pre and post mitigations, were conducted. The results showed a risk reduction from 20% high, 25% medium 
and 55% low risk to 22% medium and 78% low with no high risks.

1- Introduction 
In recent years, construction industry has made significant contribution to the country’s economy growth.  Large 
construction projects operates in a very uncertain environment where conditions can change due to the complexity of 
each project, many construction projects are faced by scheduling problems causing the projects to finish beyond their 
predetermined due date which in turn will cause increase overall cost of the project, and Contractor may have to face 
penalty for causing delay, Hence risks and uncertainties must be considered for overall duration of the project to 
complete the projects in time and within budget. The chance that project will be completed on time and within budget 
is one of the most important indicators for the decision-making.  
 
This paper aims to be a guide that clarify and simplify cost and schedule risk assessment process for construction field 
using PMBOK guide procedure and Primavera Risk analysis (PRA) and provide hands-on guideline assist project 
controller in developing and conducting schedule risk analysis module to increase the likelihood and impact of positive 
events, and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events in the project. 
 
2- Literature Review 
Many previous studies have been conducted within the field of integrated cost and schedule risk analysis but each 
presents a different approach to this concept. In 2012 Hulett studied the impact of schedule risk on cost risk using","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

8- Conclusion 
This case study represents the application of risk management process in construction projects. In order to carry the 
process perfectly, an efficient program tool was used called the PERT-Master Primavera Risk Analysis tool. By using 
an information gathering techniques a total number of forty-four risk events related to different risk categories were 
identified by the end of the risk identification process and experts suggested the probability of occurrence and impact 
scales of prioritized risk factors. Thus, the risk categories include 1) Design Risks, 2) Financial risks, 3) Legal and 
Contractual risks, 4) Sites construction risks, 5) Logistic risks, 6) Environmental risks, 7) Resource related risks, 8) 
political and war risks, and 9) Management risks.  
 
Quantitative analysis for the most important risk events was done using Monte Carlo analysis simulation. The 
simulation passes through two different scenarios. First scenario is the pre-mitigation scenario by which risk factors 
are implemented without taking into consideration the suggested mitigation actions. The other scenario was the post- 
mitigation. Those scenarios are compared with original plan (uncertainty only in cost and schedule without risk event). 
As we observe from probability histograms (original plan, pre-mitigation, post-mitigation), the time needed as a time 
contingency reserve in pre-mitigation scenario was 3 times as large as time needed (time contingency reserve) in 
original plan whereas, post- mitigation plan was 1.4 times. Whereas, the cost needed as a cost contingency reserve in 
pre-mitigation scenario was 44 times as large as cost needed (cost contingency reserve) in original plan whereas, post- 
mitigation plan was 10.3 times.

Abstract 
In the current consumer market, an equipment’s warranty is one of the important factors in the
consumer’s decision-making process. Pro-rata Warranty is considered among the commonly-
used warranty policies. Under this warranty, if an equipment fails before the end of the warranty
period, it is replaced at a cost that depends on the age of the equipment at the time of failure. The
replacement equipment is then covered by an identical new warranty. In this paper, based on the
forecasting optimization problem, we develop a mathematical model to study the opportunity
provided by the pro-rata warranty for the buyer as well as for the manufacturer, taking into
account the influence of the production  rates  in  the  equipment  degradation  consequently  on 
the  total  cost.

Abstract 
There is a large number of important archaeological sites around the world that have fragile properties, and face 
different challenges. Old city of Tripoli is one of those sites which are under a variety of risks. Natural disasters, 
development, tourism, pollution, looting, conflict and inappropriate site management are merely some examples of 
these risks. Generally, the risks to heritage sites depend on nature, specific characteristics, inherent vulnerability and 
the geographical environment of the site. Ultimately, it depends on the nature of external threats that affect the heritage 
itself. However, the level of the qualitative approach to risk is determined based on the intensity of the effect and the 
frequency and potential damage occurs. In this study, mainly seven risks were analyzed and assessed. The results 
demonstrated that the main critical risk is the risk of migratory movements and changes in the population. It has a 
catastrophic priority with risk magnitude (RM) of 14.5. Ranked second the risk of weak management and state 
regulatory bodies and the risk of Lack of knowledge of restoration techniques with RM of 13. Whereas, the risk of 
insufficient skilled staff has the lowest RM of 6.5 and low priority.

1. Introduction  
Many definitions of risk are existing in the literature. As underlined by Sotic and Rajic (2015), some of the risk 
definitions are based on probabilities, others on expected values, some on uncertainty and others on objectives. Some 
authors regard risk as subjective and epistemic, depending on the knowledge available, some regard it as aleatoric, 
due to the probabilistic character of certain parameters, while yet others give risk the ontological status independent 
from the person assessing it. Nevertheless, the traditional definition of risk in the context of engineering is led by the 
authors Wilson and Crouch (1982); risk equals the product of probability and severity. However, risks to heritage sites 
are also dependent on the specific characteristics of each site and its inherent vulnerability. Conversely, risk 
management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical 
application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events (Hubbard, 
2009). Risk control and risk management decisions regarding the mitigation strategies might be based on financial, 
operational, legal, political, environmental, social and other criteria. Thus, reducing, anticipating and managing risk 
are all part of the daily grind for organizations that have integrated risk management into their business strategy. That’s 
why they often turn to ISO 31000 on risk management to support themselves in this task (The revision of ISO 31000 
on risk management, 2015). However, several studies applied risk management in different fields have been published 
in the literature. For instance, recently, Elkhweldi and Elmabrouk in 2015 presented risk management strategies in 
aviation sector and Elmhedwi et al (2015) offered a practical risk management plan of a Wi-Fi network deployment.  
 
2. Historical and Heritage Sites Risk Management  
To heritage sites, risk management is the process that involves managing losses and impacts in order to minimize them 
and to reach a balance between opportunities gained and lost. In 2015, Jigyasu presented that the floods have caused 
enormous damage to cultural heritage properties around the world. One example is the Balkan floods in May 2014, 
which caused enormous damage to many historic towns and villages. Such a damage was witnessed previously in 
Rome (Italy) and Beverley (UK) during floods in December and June 2007 respectively. Similarly, floods in Pakistan","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

In Table 3, a scale of RM values classified according to their level of priority: catastrophic (in red color); extreme 
(orange); high (yellow); medium (green); and low priority (blue). The biggest possible value of RM obtained with the 
A, B and C scales is 15. The main critical risk is the risk of migratory movements and changes in the population. It 
has a catastrophic priority with RM of 14.5. Ranked second the risk of weak management and state regulatory bodies 
and the risk of Lack of knowledge of restoration techniques with RM of 13. Whereas, the risk of insufficient skilled 
staff has the lowest RM (6.5) and low priority. Fig. 19 demonstrated to compare, prioritize, and show all the risks that 
affect the heritage site. The graph presents the risks magnitude. It shows seven risks to a historic Tripoli old city.  
 
Conclusions  
This applied methodology of risk assessment is aimed to provide guidelines for risk management at historical and 
heritage sites. The scope of work, GIS vector layers, coordinates of existing border points, land-use, zoning, technical 
mapping, and photographic documentation for each border points were utilized as tools to identify the proposed risks 
at Tripoli old city in Libya. The magnitude of each specific risk is obtained based on ABC scaling method for risk 
analysis and 5x5 risk matrix. Afterward, the identified risks are summed up with seven main risk categories; (1) 
migration movement and population change, (2) week management and state regulatory body, (3) spread of rainfall 
and sewage affecting, (4) inadequately define roles and responsibilities, (5) insufficient skilled staff, (6) politic context, 
and (7) lack of knowledge of restoration techniques. Accordingly, ranked first place the risk of migration movements 
and population changes with RM of 14.5. Two Risks ranked second place; the risk of weak management and state 
regulatory bodies and the risk of Lack of knowledge of restoration techniques with RM of 13. Whereas, the risk of 
insufficient skilled staff has the lowest RM of 6.5 and low priority.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract 
The calculation of oil reserves (estimate ultimate recovery, EUR) is required for reservoir management. It is 
important to differentiate between oil reserves and oil resources. The latter is roughly defined as the sum of 
recoverable and unrecoverable volumes of oil in place; whereas, the oil reserves can be defined as those amounts 
of oil anticipated to be commercially recoverable from a given date under defined conditions. However, there is 
always uncertainty when making reserve estimates, and the main source of uncertainty is the lack of available 
geological data. Depending on the quantity and quality of the available data, different methods are used for the 
evaluation of the EUR.  
 
A number of essentially straight-line extrapolation techniques (production data analysis) have been proposed to 
estimate the EUR for oil and gas wells. Thus, a detailed analysis of past performance of oil and water production 
data is required in order to predict the future performance of the oil and gas wells. This work utilized seven 
straight-line extrapolation techniques to estimate and compare the values of EUR of three oil wells from the same 
reservoir. The comparison shows very similar estimated EUR.

1- Introduction 
The calculation of expected initial oil in place and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of oil and gas wells are 
required for evaluation and reservoir management purposes. It is important to differentiate between oil reserves 
(EUR) and initial oil in place. The latter is roughly defined as the sum of recoverable and unrecoverable volumes 
of oil in place. Whereas, the oil reserves can be defined as those amounts of oil anticipated to be commercially 
recoverable by applying development projects to known accumulations from a given date under defined 
conditions. However, there is always uncertainty when making reserve estimates. The main source of uncertainty 
is the lack of available geological data. Depending on the quantity and quality of the available data, different 
methods are used for the evaluation of the EUR. For example, in the initial stage of development of the 
hydrocarbon deposit, there is very little information available; therefore, approximate estimates are usually made 
using analog or volumetric calculations. Considering that, in the late stage of reservoir development, production 
data analysis and reservoir simulation methods are commonly employed. However, it is worthwhile to mention 
that the EUR is the most important step toward taking any decisions regarding drilling activities, field development 
and reservoir management. Simultaneously, it is the most difficult aspect of reservoir engineering, especially in 
the early life of the reservoir. Several methods are used to estimate an EUR, and the methods differ depending 
upon the purpose of the study and availability of the data. Mainly, there are six methods available in the literature 
to estimate the oil and gas reserves; volumetric method, material balance method, production decline analysis 
(DCA), type curve analysis (TCA), numerical simulation method, water oil ratio (WOR) data analysis.  
 
Commonly, oil and water production data are regularly measured with time. Most oil wells which are produced 
by natural water drive or a pressure maintenance waterflood will produce water along with oil during their life. 
Oil and water production history can be used in a number of ways; however, the DCA, and WOR data analysis 
techniques are utilized in this study where the historical oil and water production data for three selected oil wells 
was analyzed in order to determine EUR. In most cases, WOR is used as an analytical tool. WOR data is a","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Summary and Conclusions 
Estimated ultimate recovery of oil and gas wells are required for evaluation and reservoir management purposes 
even though there is always uncertainty when making reserve estimates. Depending on the quantity and quality 
of the available data, different methods are used for the evaluation of the EUR. Employment of oil and water 
production data for reserve estimate have a certain degree of uncertainty; therefore, different methods should be 
applied to reduce this uncertainty. 
 
In fact, oil and water production data are regularly measured with time, which can be analyzed in a number of 
ways. The analysis and interpretation of the oil and water production data (WOR, fw, and fo functions) take into 
consideration presence of both the oil and water phases flowing simultaneously in the reservoir. In particular, this 
paper provides verification and application of calculating the EUR from oil and water production data. The 
analysis consisted of performing plots of different OWR functions versus time or cumulative production that could 
be extrapolated to provide an estimate of future rate of production for a well or a field. The success of this method 
depends on our selection of straight line points. 
 
Three field examples from Libyan oilfield were analyzed with seven different extrapolation techniques: 
• 
log(qo) versus production time, t 
• 
qo versus Np 
• 
1/qo versus to 
• 
log(fw) versus Np 
• 
fo versus Np 
• 
1/fw versus Np, and  
• 
Np versus X-function 
These techniques should be applied simultaneously in order to obtain consistent approximate of the EUR. We 
believe that due to the uncertainty in the accuracy of these extrapolation methods and the lack of a fully rigorous 
mathematical basis, the best approach is to use as many extrapolation techniques as possible. This approach helps 
comparing the results obtained with different approaches providing consistency and a validation element. The 
results are summarized in Table 8, illustrating reliable results.

Abstract 
A major portion of total energy will be continuously dependent upon the fossil fuels, i.e. oil, gas and coal 
because of the industrialization of developing countries, which is supported by the petrochemical 
industry. These trends will increase the global CO2 emissions to 80% in the next 40–50 years. Although 
shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy such as wind, solar and hydropower can provide energy with a 
low carbon footprint, but is not the sole solution for providing low carbon energy to meet regional or 
national energy demand.  To reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the fossil fuels are 
continues using as an energy source, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology could be a useful 
option. This work seeks to propose the multi objective optimization model based on integrated 
management planning system for the process of CCS. The model includes the elements of Environmental 
Assessment, Technology Assessment, and Economic Management for the process of CCS.

Abstract 
Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a lightweight material that many people recognize as being used in packaging 
materials. EPS is an innovation building material that lends to design and structural integrity of many building projects. 
Nowadays, EPS became a powerful design element and an ideal choice for green building design, offering tangible 
environmental advantages that can maximize energy efficiency, provide improved indoor environmental quality and 
enhance durability. Recently, EPS is manufactured as a flame retardant grade, which reduces the risk of accidental 
fire. With all of the previous advantages of using EPS, there are still some risks associated with the utilization of this 
material in the construction sector, especially when it enters to the market as a new product. This study aims to assess 
the risks that could come up with the use of EPS material as a relatively new product in the Libyan construction sector.  
A total of 30 risks were identified and recognized into seven main categories; resource, technical, economic, 
management; design, installation, and others. The risk of “sudden change of foreign exchange rate” under the 
economic risks category, and “lack of training readily available” under the technical risks category were the most 
frequently mentioned risk factors.

1. Introduction: 
Risk assessment and risk management have been established as a scientific area and have made important 
contributions to support the decision-making process. In recent years, many attempts have been made in developing 
a broader perspective on perception, assessment and risk management. However, many studies have been published 
dealing with different aspects of risk assessment and risk management in different scientific fields. For example, in 
2015 Elkhawaldi and Elmabrouk showed that risk assessment has always been the most challenging part of the risk 
management process for aviation operations, and Elmhedwi; et al. (2015), noted that recently, instability and unrest 
in Libya have raised the issue of risk analysis to a very sensitive level that may affect any business activity, and this 
has placed more emphasis on identifying and assessing potential risks at a very early stage of any project, which is 
critical to planning the most appropriate strategies for reducing threats and exploiting opportunities. Thus, every 
organization is continuously exposed to an endless number of new or changing threats and vulnerabilities that may 
affect its operation or the fulfillment of its objectives. Identification, analysis and evaluation of these threats and 
vulnerabilities are the only way to understand and measure the impact of the risk involved and therefore to decide  the 
appropriate measures and controls to manage them.  
 
In highly competitive markets, the launch of new products with innovative strategic functions and performance is 
essential for the survival of companies and the factors required to achieve advantage in institutional competition. It is 
reported that the success rate of projects to develop new products, however, is very low. Around the world, nearly","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

5. Conclusion 
Recently, EPS has become an innovative building material that lends to the design and structural integrity of many 
building and construction projects. In Libya, there is a poor and an inadequate professional support in the use of EPS 
material for construction. Most graduate students and practicing engineers are not conversant with this new building 
technologies and therefore often design housing using the traditional technology. There lacks research information on 
the acceptability of use of EPS materials by professionals in Libyan's construction industry. The slow uptake of EPS 
as a construction material in Libya is has further attributed to lack of awareness of EPS existence in the market.  This 
study aims to assist the risks that could come up with the use of EPS material as a relatively new product in the Libyan 
construction sector.  A total of 30 risks was identified and recognized into seven main categories; (1) resource risks, 
(2) technical risks, (3) economic risks, (4) management risks; (5) design risks, (6) installation risks, and (7) other risks. 
Under the economic risks category, the risk of sudden change of foreign exchange rate, and the risk of lack of training 
readily available in using ESP in building and construction projects under technical risks category were the most 
frequently mentioned risk factors.

Abstract 
A phenomenon of FinTech has been in Indonesia since early of 1990s, but in the last 3 years, has grown 
up tremendously, but the players are different. There are 142 start-up companies work in FinTech 
sectors and very few of them has acknowledgement from Central Bank of Indonesia, as well as from 
Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK). Most of the work in “payment system” sector, very few 
are working on “lending, deposit and capital raising” sector. This paper will discuss about the 
phenomena and study the business model of “start-up company” to work on “lending, deposit and 
capital raising”. Many articles discuss about FinTech and business model has been widely spread, 
however, no articles discuss on business model of FinTech Start-up companies in Indonesia.  FinTech 
phenomena has been widely accepted by Indonesian, and users comes from all generation.  But the risk 
created by FinTech considers as medium to high rank, which make Indonesia Financial Services 
Authority (OJK) issued regulation number 77/POJK.01/2016 on Information Technology-Based 
Lending Services (LPMUBTI).  Primary data will come from major Entrepreneur FinTech start-ups and 
users.

Abstract
The purpose of this STEM project is to develop the Sports Analytics concept for playing 
Basketball by forming a special Basketball Team. Authors have defined the key functional 
metrics for each of the three player positions: Guard – Shooting and Assists; Forward – Shooting 
and Rebounds; and Center – Blocks and Rebounds. The objective is to maximize team 
performance through effective performance across all player positions. In order to maximize 
team performance, Guard will try to pass the ball to Forward. Center should focus on 
Rebounding and Blocking, not Steals. Each player’s Statistics are recorded by two different 
individuals. Hypothesis tests are conducted (1) to verify whether players can fulfill their position 
within their team, and (2) to perform a position comparison between the two teams. Sample sizes 
are determined in order to conduct a 2-Proportions Test at 95% confidence. In the Analyze 
phase, the authors decided to add Steals (for all three players), Turn Overs (for Guard), and 
Offensive/Defensive Rebounds into the Project Scope. Statistical analysis software (JMP and 
Minitab) was used to study the multi-correlation patterns. The winning team demonstrates better 
team communication among players by playing according to this unique Basketball Game player 
position model.

1. Introduction and Literature Research
In basketball, there are many positions and unique roles. While other authors have used many advanced analytic 
techniques to assess player performance (Oliver, Hollinger), these methods have not provided tangible insights 
which determine overall team performance (Goldsberry).  In fact, a review of performance by position using 
foundational statistical methods could not be readily found in the authors’ review of published literature. A team that 
is properly assigned per position will have maximum efficiency because every player is in their best-matched 
position in terms of their ability to meet the positions’ performance criteria (Trninic and Dizdar). But a team that is 
incorrectly assigned will be poorly coordinated with players not knowing how to play in their designated position. 
Therefore, in this project we want to find out how we can correctly assign a player's position. To solve this problem, 
data collected after each game is analyzed to determine whether or not each player is correctly assigned in each 
position. For example, if Center is scoring more than Forward, then these two players are not in their correct 
positions. In a classic 3-on-3 basketball game, there are 3 players, each in a different position. There is one Point 
Guard, one Center, and one Forward.  Each one of these positions has their own role that they must play. The Point 
Guard’s role is to be the leader and coordinator of the team. The Point Guard does a lot of dribbling and 
passing/assists.  Next is the Forward. The Forward’s responsibility consists mainly of shooting and scoring. The 
Forward also does a lot of dribbling but will receive the ball from the Point Guard and shoot.  Lastly, the Center’s

5. Conclusions and Future Work
The Authors successfully designed a special Basketball Game position model which can facilitate team 
communication. The baseline analysis sample size was too small and was missing critical sample statistics for Steals 
and Turnovers. The improved analysis can facilitate team communication on both Offense and Defense. The use of 
statistical analysis to make inferences on position and team performance in the population at large can help each 
team study their performance pattern and to study each player's’ strengths/ weaknesses relative to their position & 
across teams.
Future efforts will be focused on studying a larger sample size in improve decision accuracy. For example, a future 
study could compare three or more teams. This way, there will be a higher chance of inferring the correct conclusion 
of a true performance difference (or lack thereof) between players of the same position & across positions across 
teams.

Abstract 
This paper empirically examines the TQM obstacles faced by the managers of RMG sector in 
Bangladesh. Now a day, the demand for quality improvement of the product has been raised to cope with 
the challenges in marketplaces. TQM implementation has already shown a positive attitude towards 
quality improvement. As a result, Bangladeshi RMG firms are trying to implement TQM in their 
organizations. Unfortunately, they are not able to implement TQM in their organizations. To determine 
the exact obstacles, two–pronged approached are used: first, an extensive literature review has been 
conducted to find out the obstacles of TQM implementation and second, data have been collected from 
some selected Bangladeshi RMG firms. 25 obstacles have been identified so far. Finally, five obstacles 
have been selected for empirical test according to the expert’s opinion. The findings of this study suggest 
that, the most important barriers are lack of: top-management commitment to quality, focus on customer, 
continuous improvement, quality management practice, and knowledge about quality cost. This study is 
unique in terms of investigating TQM obstacles in this sector. Therefore, this paper can contribute to meet 
an urgent need of successful implementation of TQM in Bangladesh and other developing countries in the 
world.

1. Introduction
Bangladeshi firms are getting opportunities to explore their business in abroad due to globalization. For this reason, 
several firms are looking for sustainable business environment (Al-Zaabi et. al., 2013; Jaeger and Adair, 2016; Lee, 
2012; Shen et. al., 2013; Weckenmann et. al., 2015). They are comparing their firms with other organizations as a 
benchmark to improve their quality (Sit et al., 2011). Total quality management (TQM) has played a positive role to 
achieve their goal. Now a day, several firms in different sectors are using the TQM philosophy to achieve their 
success across the globe (Mosadeghrad, 2014; Sit et al., 2011; Talib et al., 2013; Talib,2013). They are enjoying 
several sustainable competitive advantages. Among the several benefits enjoyed by the several successful TQM 
implemented firms, customer satisfaction and better organizational structure are most important, because these two 
benefits can lead a firm more towards sustainable development (Bhat and Rajashekhar, 2009; Mosadeghrad, 2014; 
Talib et al., 2011a, b & c). Similarly, readymade garments (RMG) sector in Bangladesh are trying hard to increase 
their quality of product through application of TQM. But, in most of the cases, the RMG firms are facing difficulties 
to implement TQM successfully in their organizations (Syduzzaman et. al., 2016). During the implementing of 
TQM, they become familiar with some obstacles that hinder the TQM implementation. As a result, this RMG sector 
fails to achieve the benefits of TQM implementation. To address this gap, it is essential to identify the important 
obstacles of TQM implementation in RMG sector in Bangladesh. Therefore, this research has given emphasis on: 
i) To investigate the important obstacles of TQM implementation in Bangladeshi RMG sector.
ii) To develop a research framework that will investigate the effect of different barriers.
iii) To validate the framework empirically by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis followed by structural
equation modeling (SEM).

Abstract 
Stochastic Petri nets (SPN) and Arena simulation software can both be used to study the qualitative and 
quantitative behavior of systems in a single environment. However, no comparative studies of the two 
formalisms have been conducted. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the selected 
formalisms by using the ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, which 
can provide a better understanding of both formalisms and prepare a fertile ground for exchanging ideas 
and techniques between the two. A real world system of the main student restaurant of the King Saud 
University in Saudi Arabia is discussed in this paper to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 
methodology. First, data for the study is collected, and thereafter, the appropriate distribution is adapted for 
the data points using the Arena input analyzer. A visual network was then developed and run on the 
stochastic Petri nets and Arena simulation software in order to acquire output for the simulation. The results 
showed that the Arena and SPN simulation software are convenient for modeling and analyzing the case 
study. However, using the VIKOR approach, a comparative analysis showed that SPN is better than Arena.

1. Introduction
Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time (Banks et al. 2005). A 
descriptive technique of simulation enables a decision-maker to evaluate the behavior of a model under various 
conditions (Stevenson 2005). However, before conducting any simulation, a model must be developed. This model 
represents the key characteristics or behaviors of a selected physical or abstract system (Gallagher and O’Sullivan 
2011). The simulation represents the operation of the system over time, whereas the model represents the system itself 
(Levine et al. 2013). Simulation is used in many contexts, such as safety engineering, training, simulation of 
technology for performance optimization, education, testing, and even in video games (Banks et al. 2005). Training 
simulators, which include flight simulators, are utilized for training aircraft pilots and provide them with a virtual 
experience (Kelton et al.). Simulation can be used to show the eventual effects of a course of action and alternative 
conditions (Law 2007). It can also be used with human systems to gain insight into their functions, or for scientific 
modeling of natural systems. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged because it is inaccessible, 
unacceptable, dangerous, and inexistent, or it may be in the process of being designed, but not yet built (Law 2007). 
A computer simulation is an attempt to model and study hypothetical or real-life situations on a computer in order to 
visualize how the system works (Banks et al. 2005). Predictions about the behavior of a system can be made by 
changing the variables in the simulation. It is a tool for the virtual investigation of the behavior of a system under 
study. Simulation can be defined as a series of “what-if” type of experiments that are implemented on the simulation 
model. Evidently, simulation has a wide range of applications (Law 2007). In relation to the foregoing, there are 
several commercial off-the-shelf simulation software that can be used to develop a simulation model. Two of these 
are the stochastic Petri nets (SPN) and Arena software.  
Stochastic Petri nets is one of the several mathematical modeling languages that can be used for describing distributed 
systems. Petri nets (PN) is a valuable formalism to model manufacturing systems and have been used in a plethora of

6. Conclusion  
Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a system over time or real-world process. A descriptive technique of 
the simulation enables a decision-maker to evaluate the behavior of a model under various conditions. Two of the 
several different commercial off-the-shelf software—stochastic Petri nets and Arena—can be used to develop a 
simulation model. However, no comparative studies of these two formalisms have been conducted. Therefore, in this 
paper a methodology to evaluate the selected formalisms by using the ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno 
Resenje (VIKOR) method is proposed. The criteria used to evaluate the best simulation technique are divided into 
running times, accuracy, development of scenarios, modeling power, and modeling abstraction. Two simulation 
techniques, Arena and SPN, are considered. Simulation models for the case study were developed using the Arena 
and SPN software, and the results show that long student waiting time exists at the KSU restaurant. Accordingly, in 
order to reduce such waiting time, one suggested improvement is made for this phase. Scenario changes are made to 
the self-service area by removing the second self-service section (Move the cold drinks to the first self-service section; 
move the food utensils and condiments to an area after the cashier section). As a result, the new averages of the waiting 
time in line 1 are 13.82 and 12.00145 min per student for Arena and SPN models, respectively. For line 2, the waiting 
time averages are 13.65 and 12.8154 min per student for Arena and SPN models, respectively. In addition, the results 
show that the Arena and stochastic Petri nets are convenient for modeling and analyzing the case study. However, 
based on the VIKOR approach, the comparative analysis shows that SPN is better than Arena. The future work on this 
study is to develop a flexible simulation model that can be applied to different types of systems that is able to yield 
more accurate results. In addition, more complex properties can be considered during the development of the model 
using the full version of the software. This will allow the creation of a more detailed model with a wider performance 
variety, which can be used to study resource allocations, such as the reduction of server idle time.

This paper seeks to examine how communities value the diversity of environmental sustainability and waste 
management at Aba, Abia State Nigeria. The issues surrounding problems of enlightening and beneficiation 
accrue to waste management practice and sustainability is linked to adoptive-collective management. As 
such, the eco-system outlook is concomitant to socio-political and socio-cultural patterned of the 
communities’ livelihoods in the addressing of environmental sustainability and the protection of habitat. 
Using a quantitative data from an on-site research survey to solicit views, the study utilised the Univariate 
Analysis of Variance (UNIANOVA) comprising the Tests of Between-Subjects Effects and engaged the 
Pearson Chi-square Likelihood Ratio and Linear Association  for Assumption Significance two sided, while 
the Symmetric Approximate Significance measures was utilised as Post Hoc Tests of Multiple comparisons 
were garnered. Findings demonstrated that the patterns of combating and preservation methods stirred to 
assist in poverty alleviation, created entrepreneurial ventures and the motivation for residents’ involvement 
in self-help training. Recommendations were made including the several areas of combating environmental 
challenges and collective adaptation for waste management and environmental sustainability.

This article surveys the impact of environmental preservation practice monitoring awareness among Aba 
residents in Abia State of Nigeria. It strives to investigate the effect of community participation on 
monitoring mechanisms set out by the local government agencies towards the reduction of waste effluence 
impact on the health of populace. We run two-stage of descriptive statistics on ecological conservation 
awareness monitoring practices and the Test of Between-Subjects Effects on correlated model, intercept 
and community. Further, we engaged the Homogeneous subsets on community using the Post Hoc Tests of 
Multiple comparisons of Tukey’s H.S.D a, b, c and the Tukey’s B a, b, c to observe the means, where the 
harmonic mean of the group sizes for Alpha at significance .05 is utilised. The study’s outcomes suggests 
that residents of Aba have dissatisfaction and disillusion on the monitoring contrivances and programmes 
established by government agencies to reduce effluence and for sustainability and of eco-friendly health. 
The study agrees with the neglected “social fairness” of Shakir-Hanna et al (2014) that biotechnology and

States).  The study seeks administrators’ opinions on the familiarity and problematic components of their 
codes of ethics and how it affects sustainability of practice milieu domain. The principal investigation 
instrument was structured to cater for quantitative derivatives, so that the research outcomes could be able 
to confirm, corroborate and validate the phenomenology of administrators’ ethical sustainability patterned 
suggestions. The multivariate comparative statistical analysis that engaged the Turkey’s Post Hoc Test was 
used for the study to reinforce the effect of the tested hypotheses analysis. The study findings revealed that 
gendered patterns and habitus accounted for the code of ethics enactment and adherence, as such, fortified 
the sustainable patterned aspects of the ethics. Recommendations were made including that policy should 
attune for more status recondition within the gender patterns and on ethical code inclusiveness to strategize 
on multi-system levels for sustainable social work administration and practice. Further studies should 
explore more on transgender ethical issues and administrators’ integer years of practice experience to ethics 
enactment.

Abstract 
 
Carbon emissions is a subject of growing importance in recent years as companies and countries are under 
pressure to reduce such emissions to a level below what is called carbon cap. They are expected to find the 
best solution to reduce the amount of carbon emissions while minimizing the total cost. In this research we 
developed an integrated model of inventory and transportation from a single supplier to multiple customers 
considering carbon emission. Our objective is to find an optimum solution that considers both total cost and 
carbon emissions. Our numerical examples show that the carbon cap affect the total emission and total cost. 
In addition we also show relationships between the inventory level kept by the customer and the carbon 
cap.

1. Introduction 
 
In the last decades, research related to the environmental issues has grown rapidly. The increasing attention of the 
academics on the environmental issue is due to, among others, the decreasing quality of the environment due to 
electronic waste and emissions from Green House Gases (GHG). The electronic waste is increasing with the trend of 
people using electronic products having short product life cycle (Gan et al., 2015). The GHG is a greenhouse gas that 
has a major contribution to global warming and climate change. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) research report, the current global temperature reaches temperatures of less than 2 degrees Celsius, 
whereas the maximum carbon emission limit (called carbon budget) is 2 degrees. World Resource Institute (WRI) 
explained that carbon emissions of the earth have reached 52% of the total carbon budget in 2011 (www.wri.org). 
Meanwhile, the target is to reduce global carbon emissions at least 50% until 2050 (Pan et al., 2014a). From 1850 to 
2011, the five countries that contribute the most to this pollutant are the United States (27%), European Union (25%),

In the supply chain area, all activities related to inventory storage, production, and transportation have an impact on 
carbon emissions. Different decisions related to transportation, for example, would lead to different costs as well as 
different carbon emissions. Somehow, these two objectives could be a trade-offs, where lower carbon emission maybe 
achieved with higher cost, or the vice versa. It is therefore important for companies to not only consider traditional 
objectives such as minimizing costs, but also to take into account carbon emissions when making any supply chain 
decisions related to production, transportation and inventory (Hua et al., 2011).  
 
1319","4. Conclusion 
 
In this research we attempt to model the inventory and delivery decisions by considering carbon cap. We also explore 
the impact of varying carbon cap values on the total costs and the inventory level. We show that there is a trade-off 
between emission and total cost, that is, lower emission is achieved at higher cost. The results is in line with earlier 
works such as Benjaafar et al., 2010; Hoen et al, 2010; Palak et al., 2014; and Muhammed et al., 2017. An implication 
to this is that there is a potential that companies need to absorb more costs when the objective related to the 
environment is given a higher priority. In such a case an important future works is to develop a framework for making 
decisions under different situations, for example, under a different level of willingness to absorb additional costs in 
the supply chain. In this research, we also attempt to explore the relationships between inventory level kept by the 
customer and the carbon emission. The results show that customer tends to keep higher inventory when the carbon 
cap is relaxed. However, to find a firm conclusion on this, further works involving more extensive set of experiments 
would be needed.

Abstract 
Quality assurance and control are designed to enhance organizational performance and earned considerable 
attention from industrial practitioners and scholars during the current decade. The reason is due the ever-
growing universal pressures from consumers expecting superior quality of goods and services. As a result, 
the competition in the global market environment has been increasing at fast pace. Since organizations are 
developing innovative strategy to satisfy the consumers demand. To this end, the present paper aims at 
examining the extent to which both quality assurance and control and performance of different business 
organizational scales (small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale) are linked and how both quality 
assurance and control influence the business corporations’ performance in a highly competitive 
environment. The scope is on South African food manufacturing industries. This paper is expected to assist 
determining and discovering the impact of quality assurance and control at manufacturing companies level, 
whether the quality assurance and control systems of South African food manufacturing industry enable a 
smooth inter-company relationship, enhanced supply chain management activities, determining whether 
the quality of food produced are recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization.

I. Introduction
Within the arena of food business, there are two critical factors that ensure a smooth running of business, these are: 
quality and safety. The reason is that, no diet generation, processing, delivery firm or business corporation would be 
able to self-upheld without acknowledging and addressing correctly the issues surrounding food quality and safety. In 
South Africa, the food processing sector is made of more than 1,500 companies, accounted roughly 11% of the overall 
manufacturing production. Industrial key players include both the local and international firms, for example, Nestle 
and Unilever. Nevertheless, the South African food sector remains outweighed by the small and medium scale business 
organizations, estimated at 13 % of the overall SME manufacturing companies. Main subsectors concerning the food 
processing establishments consist of seafood, cattle and livestock, fruits, vegetables goods etc. The food worldwide 
market of food still very competitive and hard to grab. Taking the nowadays challenges into account, the South African 
food processing sector must make sure of becoming and remaining competitive within both local and global market. 
One potential strategy in achieving this goal is through the implementation of the quality assurance practices. Since 
those practices have the potential to offer and increase trust of customers and end-users towards the players of this 
industry. Simultaneously, enhance end-users satisfaction and establishment competitiveness within the market. To 
this end, this paper aims at investigating quality assurance practices in the South African food manufacturing industry. 
The motivation behind this paper is because various papers have focused on evaluating the quality management 
practices in other manufacturing companies over the last decades. Therefore, the current study seeks to fill this gap.

whether the quality assurance and control systems of South African food manufacturing industry enable a smooth 
inter-company relationship, enhanced supply chain management activities, determining whether the quality of food 
produced are recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization. It was observed that more than half of the 
companies that were involved in this study have already adapted and implemented quality assurance practices and 
these were: GMP, HACCP, or ISO 9001 certified. The outcomes demonstrated that most of the South African food 
processing companies have got enough experiences and knowledge regarding the quality assurance practices. 
Additionally, the South African government has recently implemented the food hygiene and food safety. Nevertheless, 
there is no an requirement or regulation in South Africa pushing a food manufacturing firm to compel with a GMP or 
HACCP or ISO 9001 certification. As far as the authors are aware this the first example works in the context of South 
Africa covering important aspects regarding the universal benchmark.

Abstract 
Within the current worldwide business environment, several manufacturing firms have been 
spotted within a significant competition for survival; this has led firms to continuously longing to 
enhance the quality of their goods and cut the cost down. Most of these firms are seeking to address 
radical amendments in accordance with the demands in the market with the aim of being ahead of 
their contenders, however there is an unceasing necessity regarding maintenance and continual 
enhancement concerning quality management practices. South Africa is currently in the 
progressing phase and quality of the products by local manufacturing companies is still below 
average and thus, it is essential to improve the quality of manufactured goods to encourage 
economic expansion. Even though, the quantity of ISO certified organisations is on an increase, 
the quality of the product is still not enough. Additionally, in South Africa, mots of manufacturing 
companies lack effective quality systems established. Hence, several critics suggested that the 
awareness to the significance to implement efficient quality practices that can give the local 
manufacturing firms more advantage within the global market by means of high quality yardstick 
has not been outstanding. This research, thus, seeks to close the gap by clarifying and improving 
the awareness of the quality management practices effects and the performance of local 
manufacturing companies within South Africa.

I. Introduction
In the light of globalisation, the highly competitive market segments, permanent industrial development, and 
progressively demanding consumers, quality has developed into one of the most crucial aspects regarding the strategy 
of creating manufacturing companies competitive in the light of global market. To this end, ISO has the main 
wideranging scope within the enhancement of manufacturing companies’ performance by means of promoting quality. 
The ISO family of standards are universally well known and are designed in such a way that they demonstrate the 
ability of a manufacturing company to handle the processes as well as to make the product or service adequate; thus, 
their operation could be a foundation of competitive benefit, improving the performance of the company’s (Ambe & 
Badenhorst-Weiss, 2011) Consequently, most manufacturing companies need to execute and operate using a 
collection of quality methods which have been successful somewhere else which will assist them to detect changes in 
their work environment and to provide feedback proactively in the course of continuous improvement and to enhance 
performance. In South Africa, many manufacturing companies are quickening to being ISO certified, but whether the 
certification will bring about improved business performance is still to be established. Many other African countries, 
including South Africa, have implemented ISO standards. Barnes & Morris (2008) noticed that being ISO certified is 
relevant and appropriate to all type of organization, that include the manufacturing sector, and it compels performance 
to improvement. Given the Resource-Based View theory, performance of a company is established on the resources 
and competences it has in control, of which may develop into a foundation of competitive advantage. Riemann &

Causes of food crisis in the Southern African Development 
Community

Abstract 
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is one the largest region in the African continent. The 
region is made of fifteen countries. Over the current decade, this region has been going through a critical food 
crisis, particularly within the disadvantage rural areas. In order to relieve this situation, the state members of the 
SADC region have come up with various strategies such as the program called zero hunger and the second one 
called the outcome seven. These programs are designed to create a future environment where households are not 
dealing with issues relating to food insecurity. However, these approaches have not yet met the expected result 
because the trend of food dearth still rising considerably at regional and national level. To this end, this paper 
aims at measuring the main issues impacting negatively on food security at household level. At least ten countries 
out of fifteen countries that composed the SADC region were used as case study. To date, various studies have 
been carried out investigating the issues related to food insecurity at country’ level in the region. However, there 
is lack of such study at regional level, hence, this paper aims at bridging this gap. The data were collected through 
quantitative approach at least 960 participants were involved in this research by answering to the questionnaires 
presented to them. The findings revealed that inequality in land distribution, unemployment, inflation, inequality 
in wealth distribution, shortage of adequate labor, HIV disease, households gender head, education status of 
household head, age are contributing to food crisis in all ten states of SADC region are the major concern towards 
food security.

1.Introduction
Since its creation, the SADC region has been steered through the need for establishing a regional amalgamation 
bloc in order to link regional economies, strengthening the region’s economic performance, and improving the 
region’s political stability. To begin with, the region was first founded in 1980 as the Southern African 
Coordination Conference (SADCC), the region had the goal not only to alleviate economic reliance on the then 
apartheid South Africa, however to promote economic links for the development of a genuine and impartial 
regional incorporation by mobilising the means for the promotion of interstate and regional policies. After most 
of the Southern African states had attained political independence, the region decided to revise the mandate of the 
regional body by putting more focus on economic and political issues in the post-colonial period. The 
establishment of the SADC in 1992 was therefore seen as a continuation of efforts to strengthen collective self-
reliance within the Southern African region. However, there cannot be any economic development without food 
stability; therefore, the new revised regional body included food crisis in its principal mandate. Additionally, the 
regional body took cognisance of the fact that economic developments can only be realised through a concerted 
effort; hence the member states saw regional integration as the gateway to economic development within the 
region. During the past decade, food availability has become a serious concern for every human and particularly 
for those who live in the developing countries. Food security can be viewed as an easy access to adequate healthy 
and socially accepted food by different stakeholders such as government, non-governmental organizations, and 
public in general. While, food insecurity is the restricted access to sufficient healthy and safe food [1]; [11]. 
Coleman-Jensen et al [7] report that food security is a constant and reliable access to sufficient healthy food for 
humans. In this study, food security is defined in accordance with the definition provided by the Food Agriculture 
Organisation (FAO) “an existing situation where by all humans, at any times, have physical, social, and economic 
access to enough, secure, and healthy food meeting their nutritional needs and food preferences for an active and 
healthy life”. This description involves four essential elements: availability, stability, accessibility and utilization. 
However, when one or two of these four elements are missing that means the food system is being vulnerable [11] 
FAO [12] report that food insecurity is currently a global issue because of the trend of undernourished human 
1346","Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
(IEOM) Bandung, Indonesia, March 6-8, 2018 
 
depending upon the age groups. For example, we noticed that in all ten member states older headed households 
were found to be less vulnerable than younger headed households. The reason maybe most of youngers do not 
prioritise food instead they are focus on having expensive items such as latest phone brand, cars, etc. That is why, 
they end up feeding themselves with fast food, which in general are not healthy and expensive.  We also collected 
the data regarding the education level of households’ head. No surprisingly, the level of food insecurity across the 
region varies widely. For example, headed households with higher level of education are less vulnerable to food 
insecurity than those with less education level. Education is a key player in determining household food insecurity 
level regardless of gender headed households. When collecting the data across the region, we figured out that the 
size of household plays a critical role in determining food security status. For example, household with few 
members are unlikely to be food insecure as the one with many members.  
III. Conclusion  
Over the past decade, SADC as a region has been coping with a crucial food insecurity status, especially within 
the disadvantage rural areas. To alleviate this crisis, the SADC leaders have introduced various strategies, 
including the program called zero hunger and the second one called the outcome seven. These programs are 
designed to create a future environment where households are not dealing with issues relating to food insecurity. 
However, this approach has not yet met the expected result because the trend of food shortage still growing 
dramatically at regional and national level. Although, Therefore, the present research article aims at analysing the 
major factors affecting food security at household level. The SADC region was used as case study since in this 
this part of the Africa continent, access to sufficient food is not stable, consequently many households are coping 
with recurrent food crisis, which in turn is threatening their livelihoods and negatively affecting their welfare. 
several studies were conducted to investigate the factors affecting food security at country’ level in SADC region. 
However, there is a lack of such study at regional level as SADC, this paper aims at filling this gap. The data were 
collected through quantitative approach out of 1 000 questioners only 960 respondents answered to the 
questioners. The study revealed that inequality in land distribution, unemployment, inflation, inequality in wealth 
distribution, shortage of adequate labor, HIV disease, households gender head, education status of household head, 
age are contributing to food crisis in all ten municipalities of Limpopo province.

Abstract 
The manufacturing industry continues to develop rapidly and has since become an important catalyst to 
the country’s economic growth. So, the manufacturing environments are becoming highly competitive. 
Queuing theory and Taylor theory are analytical models that will be used to analyze capacity usage of 
manufacturing.  This study examines the utilization of production facilities in an automotive industry 
based on the application of queuing theory and Taylor theory. This study was conducted in machining 
department and only focused on production of oil pump product. The validation of resulting utilization 
values, through comparing them with the utilization value, was based on the company database. Based on 
this validation result, the effectiveness between Queuing theory and Taylor theory in analyzing the 
utilization of production line can be determined. The finding displayed that the effectiveness of Queuing 
theory is better than the effectiveness of Taylor theory.

1. Introduction
Analysis of several related processes, such as; arriving at the queue, waiting in the queue, and being served by the 
servers at the front of the queue are important in making engineering, operational and business decisions. Many 
manufacturing systems can be modeled as network queues, and the use of Queuing theory is one of the alternatives 
to analyze the performance of these systems. Besides Queuing theory, Taylor theory is also able to analyze the 
performance of the manufacturing systems. Both theories can be applied to measure the capacity utilization of 
manufacturing system. 
This work is a case study for the application of Queuing and Taylor theories in the multi-stage in the assembly 
production line. The company produces oil pump, which will be used by a certain automotive industry. There are 9 
processes to produce oil pump, which are OP1-plug taper installation, OP2-leak test, OP3-spring plunger cap and 
pin, OP4-pressure test, OP5-water drying, OP6-stud bolt screw, OP7-rotor installation, OP8-oil seal installation, and 
OP9-rotor inspection. Oil pump product is shown in Figure 1. 
The objectives of this study are: 
•
Applying Queuing theory and Taylor theory to examine their utilization on an assembly production line.
•
Comparing the effectiveness of Queuing theory and Taylor theory in the utilization analysis.

Figure 4 shows a comparison between the average utilization percentages for the assembly process using Taylor 
theory and Queuing theory. Based on the graph, the average utilization percentages using Taylor theory is higher 
than that using Queuing theory where; Taylor theory resulted in 63 percent average utilization compared to a 19 
percent resulting from using the Queuing theory. This happens because Taylor theory is simpler than Queuing 
theory in its application, and thus its accuracy is lower than that of the Queuing theory. However, both theories 
require less data and less computational effort compared to simulation models and other analysis techniques.

6. Conclusion  
This study presented a specific approach that determines how the utilization factor affects the performances of the 
manufacturing system by using analytical theory. The study showed that Taylor theory and Queuing theory are 
capable of analyzing the production system. This theory is able to provide system design guidelines, capacity 
analysis and estimation throughout times. Future research is directed towards using simulation software such as; 
ARENA to measure capacity utilization in the assembling line.

Abstract 
The palm oil industry is an important industry for the Indonesian economy. However many problems 
faced by the palm oil industry in Indonesia, especially related to the environment and social in various 
levels of production and consumption in the supply chain. This has resulted in poor performance and a lot 
of attention for improvement. This paper proposes methods for improving the performance of the palm oil 
industry using Sustainable Value Stream mapping (Sus-VSM). Sus-VSM is a methodology developed 
from traditional VSMs by adding three metrics to evaluate environmental sustainability and two metrics 
to evaluate social sustainability on production lines. In this study, sustainability index  is measured  using 
29 metric indicator which been obtained from the previous research. A case study on one of  palm oil 
companies in Indonesia was conducted and resulted in a sustainability index score of 59.34 (in range 1-
100) or highly fair, with the highest index in the economy (72.23) followed by Social 54.56 and
Environmental Index 20 , 64.  Suggestions for improvement are given to improve the index sustainability,
especially the Environment index.

1. Introduction
Palm oil is a very important commodity  and  became the leading commodity exports for Indonesia. Palm oil and its 
derivatives products contributed to the export of 75 percent of the non-oil and gas sectors. Therefore palm oil 
became one of the largest contributors to the country's income (Gapki,2017). The challenge of the palm oil industry 
is getting bigger. In the late 90s the palm oil sector began to face criticism about some environmental and social 
practices at various levels of production and consumption in its supply chain.  Forest fires in oil palm-run areas in 
Indonesia in recent years have put more pressure on the palm oil industry in Indonesia. 
Today, people prefer to buy environmentally friendly products. attention to ""ethical and green credentials products"", 
including manufacturing and distribution processes as well as corporate and brand reputation are the focus of today's 
European consumers. Looking at this green trend, in the future, it is not just European consumers who will demand a 
hundred percent sustainable supply chain for various products, but began to expand to consumers of other countries. 
Therefore it is necessary for the palm oil industry in Indonesia to improve performance, especially its sustainability 
performance. This study focuses on performance measurement using Sustainability Value Stream Mapping (Sus-
VSM) approach. A case study on one of the major palm oil companies in Indonesia will be done by measuring index 
sustainability in three sizes, namely economic metrics, environmental metrics and Social metrics. This research is a 
continuation of previous research, where in previous research found 29 metric and its weight (Kusrini & Primadasa, 
2017). This metric will be used in measuring index sustainability. By using this Sus-VSM method, the company can 
know the performance comprehensively, especially from the point of view of sustainability. The company can

The results of this study indicate that the economic sustainability index total of 59.34, where the index is in the 
category of Highly Fair. The categorization of sustainability index results is based on Cheng EWL (2006) as 
presented in Table 2. This index is generated from the economic index of 72.23 (Moderately good), environmental 
index of 20.64 (Moderately poor), and social index of 54.56 (Highly fair). Sustainability supply chain performance 
in this palm oil company need improvement especially on environmental issues. The company needs a thorough 
evaluation of environmental indicators because it is still not sustainable. Improvements can be focused on increasing 
BOD, COD,% CPO Certified and Percent Products with Take-Back Policies. Companies should attempt to obtain 
Sustainable Indonesian Palm Oil (ISPO) certificates, both on plantation and factory sections. The efforts to increase 
CPO% gradually should also be the focus of improvement. Improved worker  satisfaction could be done by 
providing training and development. To increase OER, it is necessary to suppress its oil losses especially in final 
effluent to waste water pond. % Waste Reused can also be increased especially for POME (liquid waste) by utilizing 
liquid waste for example as irrigation and liquid fertilizer. Furthermore, companies can use these metric results as a 
basis for prioritizing improvements.

5. Conclusion  
 
The sustainability VSM metrics are used to measure the performance of oil palm companies by using 29 
metrics grouped into 3 types of metrics, namely economy, social and environment metrics. The use of 
VSM along with index sustainability measurement can help company in enhancing performance in each 
process more easily because it is visually displayed. Index sustainability is the multiplication index 
between the value of performance  with the indicator weight. The performance measurement results can 
be used to determine corrective actions to improve sustainability performance.

Abstract 
The current economic growth has pushed the manufacturing sector to go through important changes over the 
past decade. The main reason of this situation is due to the current course of competition, which has been 
dramatically increasing in the local as well as global market. Consequently, the focus of both products’ 
manufacturers and customers has been on the quality, delivery time, as well as product’ cost. Due to these, many 
manufacturing industries seek to develop and implement a quality system to constantly enhance and increase 
both quality and throughput. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is considered as an approach aiming to 
guarantee an effective management of company’s resources by means of employee participation and 
empowerment, as well as to augment the availability, quality, and product throughput to reduce the need for 
additional capital investment. To this end, the present paper proposes TPM as a roadmap for South African food 
manufacturing industry. Mixed methodology was used to obtain out of this study best possible results. The study 
was conducted at a larger South African food manufacturing company that has two sister companies (subsidiary 
A and B).  both primary and secondary data were collected. The productivity and values of overall equipment 
effectiveness of both subsidiary A and B were calculated by employing standard equations. The findings 
revealed potential major challenges faced by those two sister companies. It was also shown in this study that 
both sister companies have less rate of overall equipment effectiveness when comparing to the world standard 
values, which caused many failures. Furthermore, there is a variation in terms of values of overall equipment 
effectiveness, performance, availability, and quality at both sister companies. Despite this fluctuation of value, 
we noticed that subsidiary A has got better performance than subsidiary B regarding productivity and overall 
equipment performance.

I. Introduction
Within the current highly competitive worldwide market, quality is viewed as the key player to succeed in such harsh 
competitive environment. This ever-increase of global competition has fostered manufacturing companies across the world 
to turn their attention to Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). Whether in the United States, Europe, Asian, there is an 
increasing recognition of the necessity for continuous enhancement as a way of becoming and remaining competitive, 
mainly within the South African manufacturing sector whose market share has lately been losing ground to the developing 
economies of Asian, American and Western countries. A recent example, is the exist of General Motors from South African 
market, and this has proven the need for South African manufacturing industries to fully turn to TPM to be one step in 
advance of the competition by increasing management effectiveness and the providing of worth to the customer. In the 
concept of TPM, quality is not only considered in terms of manufactured goods or service, however, also as an essential 
factor for the cost-effective management of the material and human assets employed to deliver the manufactured goods or 
service. Intrinsically, it is a best option to customary methods to managing to guarantee the effectiveness of the business. 
Whilst, concurrently providing quality and adding value to buyers whose buying decisions generally depends mainly on 
this basis. Despite, most eagerly experienced within the economically emerging countries of US and Europe, this trend 
concerning more uncompromising end-users’ expectations about quality is applied around the globe, particularly within 
countries where the buying power of consumers and the freedom of choice presented by a free market is extreme. 
Furthermore, in the previous decades the adoption and implementation of TPM was only considered as relevant to emerging 
economies as it is to the more innovative industrial countries.

The first observation, depicted from the figure 4 above is that the subsidiary A demonstrates good results regarding either 
partial or total productivity. Considering this, a conclusion can be drawn up from the results above that subsidiary A is 
performing well than subsidiary B with regards to both partial and total productivity. And this has a significant impact on 
the costs incurred in the operations of both sister companies.  
III.2. Overall Equipment Effectiveness 
This sub-section aims at measuring the extent of TPM at subsidiary A and subsidiary B at a company X (south African 
food manufacturing company). This analysis is based on quality, performance, availability, and OEE. Additionally, the 
results of both subsidiaries are benchmarked with those set up from world standard. To this end, figure 5 below 
demonstrates this analysis.   
 
Figure 5:  Graphical representation of parameters of OEE and its comparison 
The first observation from the figure 5 above, is that the results of subsidiary A and B fall behind the values set up for 
world standard. The results also demonstrate that subsidiary A has got good results regardless of parameters when 
comparing to subsidiary B. considering this, it can be concluded that the performance level regarding TPM is good than 
subsidiary B. 
III.3 Challenges faced in implementing TPM 
Besides, the results presented above, this study also seek to determine the types of challenges face at both subsidiary A and 
B when implementing TPM. The data were collected from 527 questionnaires, participants were urged to indicate on a 
scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 was strongly agree and 5 was strongly disagree). Thus, the results are presented in the figure 6

Figure 6: Challenges faced when implementing TPM 
From the results above, it can be depicted that paucity of management support, insufficient necessary skills, poor structure 
to support TPM are the important challenges. For example, insufficient management support is assigned to management 
not fully recognising the actual objective of the TPM and its activities. Additionally, in case where management view TPM 
as a way of reducing operation and maintenance crew, this shows that management do not have a clear knowledge of TPM 
and its goal. The overall aim is to increase the effectiveness of the equipment, not reducing the labour head-count. Lack of 
sufficient training and education can unsurprisingly cause a decline in OEE and ending in failure to implement innovative 
and upgraded measures. It takes significant effort to shift human mindset from an old to a modern approach to successfully 
implement TPM in a lifespan of the plant. The participants report that an effective understanding, education and training 
are key players when implementing TPM. time needed to fully implement TPM is considerable. Some respondents point 
out that it could take up to six years before reaching a competitive advantage for the TPM approach. TPM should be 
considered as a long-run commitment striving for free defective products and not a means of achieving short-run solutions.  
Conclusions 
In the current highly competitive global market, TPM has proven to be a key competitive approach for business 
organization. To this end, the present paper recommends TPM as a roadmap for South African food manufacturing industry. 
This study revealed that the South African food manufacturing company is likely struggling when seeking to fully adopt 
and implement TPM approach. To this end, it was shown in this study the potential major challenges faced by those two 
sister companies at a company X where the survey was conducted. Therefore, to successfully implement TPM, it is 
recommended to the food manufacturing company X to address the various challenges presented in the figure 6. It was also 
shown in this study that both sister company namely here as subsidiary A and B had less rate of overall equipment 
effectiveness when comparing to the world standard values, which caused many failures. Furthermore, there is a variation 
in terms of values of overall equipment effectiveness, performance, availability, and quality at both sister companies. 
Despite this fluctuation of value, we noticed that subsidiary A has got better performance than subsidiary B regarding 
productivity and overall equipment performance.

Abstract 
Poor cost management is a severe problem that occurs in the current construction industry, resulting in big amount of 
cost overrun which not only in Malaysia but also happens frequently in the global construction industry. Traditional 
methods such as standard financial s-curve, daily monitoring, weekly or monthly report are less efficient in monitoring 
and controlling the cost performance of a project. This paper is focusing on the investigation of the effectiveness of 
Earned Value Analysis (EVA) as cost controlling tools in construction projects in contractor’s perspective. EVA is a 
cost controlling technique that unites the performance of cost and schedule. Descriptive study is carried out in this 
research and survey form was used to collect the quantitative data from target respondents who are Grade 7 Contractor 
firms in Petaling District. The findings have shown that the awareness of EVA technique is low among study area as 
the frequency of usability is low. However, the findings have indicated that EVA is able to improve the cost 
performance of the construction projects. The contribution of EVA which is remedial actions can be taken earlier to 
keep the cost within budget is ranked as the 1st place among the listed contributions.

1.0 Introduction 
Construction industry plays a crucial role in determining the development status of a Nation. Research studies have 
opined that construction industry has contributed a lot to the economic development of a country (Myers 2013). Takim 
and Akintoye (2002) indicated that construction project is unique yet complicated as it involved many different parties, 
complicated procedures and process and it requires special skills and technique for the sake of the project success. 
The most significant performance indicator used to assess the success of a construction projects is a great performance 
of cost (Akinsiku et al. 2014). However, according to Malaysians Auditor General 2008 report, the issue of poor cost 
performance in which eventually causing the cost overrun has brought the delay of the progress of the project and this 
has caused clients and contractors suffered from financial loss (Khamidi et al. 2011). Bowen et al. (2012) has opined 
that time, cost and quality are the most significant components in order to plan and manage a successful construction 
project.

3.5 Effectiveness of Tools In-use 
Figure 3.1 Effectiveness of Tools In-Use 
This question is used to obtain the perspective of respondents on the effectiveness of the tools in-use. From Figure 
4.12, the effectiveness of EVA can be proved by 18.75% of respondents opined that it is a very much effective tools 
by comparing EVA to another four types of tool in-used. None of the respondents has rated its effectiveness below 
neutral. Therefore, the aim of the research which is to investigate the effectiveness of EVA as cost controlling tools 
can be proved.  
4.0 Conclusion 
The result of the findings has shown EVA technique is able to improve the cost performance of the projects. The 
following conclusions can be drawn from the present study by according to the most obvious finding to emerge from 
this study which shows that EVA is effective in controlling the cost of the projects and three of the objectives in this 
research have been achieved. After the interpretation of the findings, the factor that contributes the most in the cost 
overrun of the project is evaluated and the result shown is poor cost control method. Besides, the greatest benefit that 
contributed by EVA in improving the cost performance is remedial action can be taken earlier to keep the cost within 
the budget; while the biggest challenge that encountered by contractor is complete information of the expenditure of 
the project is needed in order to generate an accurate EVA graph. In a nutshell, the effectiveness of the application of 
EVA technique in improving cost performance could be a reference or guidance for those who wish to adopt EVA 
technique in future. This research will be served as a base to raise a better cost-consciousness in the construction 
industry. The awareness of adapting advanced technique among all the parties in the construction industry can 
definitely curb the problem of cost overrun. It is crucial that the decision of cost controlling method or technique used 
in a construction project will consequently define the success of the project.

Abstract 
Indonesian economic growth has been trending down from about 6.5 % in 2010 to less that 5 % 
in second half of 2017. Although global economy is also still struggling to recover after world 
crisis, economic expectations improved by prospects of growth in the last quarter of 2017. In 
February 2017, unemployment data was recorded at 5.33 percent or 7.01 million people. When 
compared to February 2016 and then reached 5.50 percent, then open unemployment data in 
February 2017 decreased 0.17 percent or 10,000 people. Bappenas data states that the projected 
population of Indonesia until 2035 is estimated to reach 305,652,400 million people. If there is no 
significant policy breakthrough, no one can imagine TPT rate will also increase , and can cause 
various social issues. To promote economic growth, Indonesian government should encourage 
enterpreneurship and innovation. One of the new economic concepts is the ""Community-Based 
Creative Economy"" which is a community-driven concept of entrepreneurship that is socially 
committed to bring changes to be more advanced and cooperative-minded. This study using the 
methodology by analysis of indepth interviews and observed from some user of microfinance 
institution as a role model. The concept aimed at lower and middle-class workers, and depends on 
three vital elements : government, private economic institutions (cooperatives and banking) and 
educational support from the university. Such a concept of social entrepreneurship is a powerful 
opportunity to be implemented in Indonesia, but still facing many challenges if tends to be 
developed into massive, structured, and sustainable movement. The purpose of this research is to 
present the result of the application of microfinance service model with community-based in 
Parish 
of 
Robertus 
Cililitan,

The 
research 
is 
conducted qualitatively, 
literature reviews from related theories were used to explained the policy. From this research, 
micro finance model had significant influence for the improvement of the welfare of middle to lower 
class workers. Further research with broader spectrum is needed to established model that can be 
applied in more global and comprehensive way.

communities and classes also need to be encouraged to develop, especially in terms of intellectual 
property rights and protection and are free from unequal exploitation in the production chain of 
creative products and services. If the stakeholders of the creative economy are unable to create 
synergies, then it can be predicted that the Indonesian nation is only a user of creative products 
originating from other countries. In addition, talents and intellectual capital also become useless 
because it cannot be transformed into a competitiveness that determines the common prosperity as a 
nation. 
 
4. SOCIAL ENTERPRISES AS SOLUTIONS 
 
We are inspired by the reviews in the Kompas Newspaper on Friday, June 20, 2013 p. 37 
""International telescope"" entitled ""Social Entrepreneurship: Finding Gotong Royong in the City of 
London"". The review made me dream and aspire to happen also in Indonesia especially in Jakarta and 
also other areas. Portrait of 30 years of social entrepreneurship in London, England is one of the 
countries that became the center of civilization in Europe. The busyness of business and capital 
turnover in the city of London continues to provide a friendly space for the growth of a community-
based creative economy conceptualized in the form of social entrepreneurship for lower-middle-class 
workers. The success of social entrepreneurship in the city of London due to the existence of a unified 
and sustainable cooperation 3 (three) parties namely government, private and universities. Quoting 
Ari Sutanti, Senior Program Manager of British Council Indonesia, considered that the spirit of social 
entrepreneurship actually has strong roots in Indonesia, for example cooperatives present before 
independence era and run social organization. In addition he is proud of the rise of community-based 
activities led by educated young people. Indonesia still has many opportunities to cultivate social 
entrepreneurship with a community-based creative economy model that becomes a massive, 
structured and sustainable movement spearheaded by governments, private and universities. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
 
With the idea of empowering the community-based creative economy through social entrepreneurship 
economic development is driven through a group or community economic development approach or 
microeconomic approach. It has a tremendous power to improve people's lives, especially the middle 
to lower layers, thereby reducing the gap between the poor and the lack of capital with the rich who 
have the capital. Social entrepreneurship is a paradigm that has been proven to support the nation's 
economic development. Governments, private and colleges need to work together to be the guarantor 
of social entrepreneurship sustainability. Because, basically the estuary of it all is the improvement of 
community life that sustains the performance of government work and stimulate the economy. Efforts 
that can be done by the government is to shade the business with regulations that favor the 
strengthening of social entrepreneurship patterned and patterned community-based creative economy 
to the middle layer of society down. It is best if this policy reaches the level of district (kelurahan)  
through training, coaching and providing or adding capital with a credit union system with low 
interest rates. Efforts that can be made by the private sector is to pay attention in cooperation with the 
government to manage well and structured by providing capital assistance and capital development 
and management of places for the creative economy communities so as to create quality and quantity 
improvement of existing entrepreneurial groups or communities. The university or college in 
collaboration with the private sector and the government continues to provide the results of scientific 
studies on the concept of social entrepreneurship that is able to increase the economic growth of micro 
and were able to reduce the social problems, but it can involve themselves in the implementation of 
social entrepreneurship by sending students to become a volunteer for assisting communities creative 
economy tiny layer of society whose role and to cultivate seedlings young entrepreneurs are creative. 
Thus the role of government, private sector and universities in order to empower community-based 
creative economy with the concept of social entrepreneurship to achieve a more prosperous living 
standard for the people of a small layer can run massive, structured and sustainable.

Abstract  
 
There are several models of multicriteria analysis methods, but there is no common agreement on the 
most effective method for project selection (Archer & Ghasemzadeh, 2004). In this article, we will 
present a case study for the selection of projects using two families of multicriteria analysis methods 
namely the methods of upgrading ELECTRE II and I and utility methods, and then give a comparative 
summary of the two categories. Through this case study, we note that the results obtained are different 
depending on the method used and the intended purpose, and the choice between a method close to the 
Utility Theory (MAUT) and outranking method must be made according to the advantages and limitations 
of these categories of multicriteria analysis methods (MAM).

1. Introduction 
Current projects evolve in a complex environment that is undergoing rapid and often unpredictable changes. 
Conventional planning and project execution tools are only effective if they are part of a global project portfolio 
management approach, while taking into account these dynamic aspects and emphasizing the need to innovate to 
succeed (Tayeb Louafa, 2008); in project portfolio management, success does not only mean doing projects well, 
but also choosing the right projects. In the early phases of project portfolio management, several processes require 
tools and techniques for project analysis (qualitative and quantitative analysis: prioritization analysis, capacity 
analysis, graphical analysis, etc.) (PMI, 2013). Thus, multi-criteria decision-making methods become indispensable 
tools to select the right projects. 
 
There are several models of multicriteria decisions (ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, MAUT, AHP, the weighted sum, 
etc.) and mathematical optimization (ILP, IGP, etc.). However, there is no common agreement on the most effective 
method for project selection (Archer & Ghasemzadeh, 2004). Indeed, selection processes based on quantitative and 
qualitative criteria are used in decision-making to justify budget investments and resource allocations. In many 
cases, however, only financial criteria are taken into account in project selection decisions.  
 
In other cases, the decision-making process is based on the experience and impression of senior management. And 
generally the decision that results from these methods can be very debatable (Hugo Caballero et al., 2012). In this 
article, we will present a case study for the selection of projects using two families of multicriteria analysis methods 
namely the methods of upgrading ELECTRE I and II and utility methods, then give a comparative summary of the 
two categories.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

We note that the results obtained are different depending on the method used and the intended purpose. 
Although the MAUT approach highlights a wide variety of easily comparable numerical solutions and uses fairly 
simple computational methods, it is still complex for the decision-maker to visualize what utility is associated with. 
performance given on each criterion and give a total pre-order. In addition, it is a totally compensatory method, that 
is to say that the bad score of an action on a criterion can be completely compensated by its good score on another 
criterion which complicates the interpretation results obtained.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Categorie  
Advantages 
Limitations 
Outranking 
method 
- A more elaborate structure based on a 
reflexive relationship, 
- it inform the decision-maker about his choice; 
the actions to be eliminated and those to be 
kept (but incomparable between them), 
- Most outranking methods construct the 
overclass relationship based on two concepts of 
concordance and non-discordance. 
- structure preferably developed progressively 
on the basis of less rich information (absence of 
pre-orders), 
- acceptance of the idea of the incomparability 
of actions, which often leads to a more in-depth 
study with the aim of reducing or clarifying all 
the actions and all the criteria, 
- Does not solve the problem of decision-
making, 
- The outranking relationship has no particular 
properties other than reflexivity. As a result, 
outranking methods will first have to build this 
relationship and then use it to answer the 
chosen problem. 
Utility Theory 
- Production of a total pre-order, 
- The result is very rich, based on the wealth of 
hypotheses of the theory, 
- Produce a function that can store all the 
actions from the best to the least good: Large 
varieties of solutions put forward according to 
the method used, 
- Possibility to have the decision-maker 
describe this function via a set of numerous 
and sometimes-difficult questions concerning 
the intensities of his preferences and the 
weightings of the criteria and / or the 
substitution rates between criteria. 
- Need a lot of information (values and 
parameters) 
-Additional methods: compensatory. 
-Delicate interpretation of the parameters, 
-A sensitivity analysis should be conducted 
systematically, to release the only robust 
information, but this is rarely done. 
 
5. Conclusion: 
All multi-criteria decision support methods have the advantage of being able to make a decision based on multiple 
criteria and not on the basis of a single criterion (profit for example). Beyond this observation, the results obtained 
are different from one method to another. Thus, the choice between Utility Theory (MAUT) and outranking method 
must be done according to the advantages and limitations of these broad categories of multicriteria analysis methods 
(MAM). Indeed, MAUT has the advantage of being easier to use but its compensatory character makes the 
interpretation of the results difficult. Unlike the ELECTRE method, which is more difficult to apply, but it helps to 
inform the decision-maker about his choice between the actions or projects to be kept and those to be eliminated but 
doesn’t solve the problem of decision-making itself. This is why the use of other methods is still necessary to 
complete the decision-making process. For example, the AHP (Analytic hierarchy process) which allows to 
hierarchically structure a complex, multi-criteria, multi-person and multi-period problem. This method is used for 
decision making in complex situations where human perception, judgments, and consequences have long-term 
implications (Bhushan and Rai, 2004). Thus, the combination of several methods remains possible.",annual 2018

Abstract 
High competitiveness level in manufacture industry has caused companies to compete not only to be 
efficient (lean) but also sustainable. In order to achieve sustainability, a company requires a thorough 
examination of the product design process, the manufacturing process, and the overall supply chain. 
Many studies have attempted to develop value stream mapping (VSM) that is integrated with 
environmental and social aspects to produce sustainable system, but they fail to describe the overall 
performance of sustainability throughout the product supply chain. To do so sustainable supply chain 
value stream mapping (SSC-VSM) has been developed. SSC-VSM aims to analyze sustainability 
performance throughout the product supply chain. In term of the product supply chain considered are 
pre manufacturing, manufacturing, and distribution. Aspects that are considered are economic, 
environment, and society in which each aspect has some indicators. This research aims to extend the 
previous research focusing on only manufacturing stage under the concept of Sustainability Valye 
Stream Mapping (Sus-VSM) to all stage in supply chain and to apply the modified Sus-VSM named 
SSC-VSM in two bottled drinking water companies. The application aims to assess and compare 
those companies and identify which indicator that less efficient and should be improved.

1. Introduction
Activity in manufacturing industry produces a considerable impact on the environment that is through the
use of excessive natural resources and waste generated. Natural resources are limited and non-renewable 
resources. Uncontrolled use of resources can lead to natural resource shortages and the future generations can 
not meet their resource needs. While the waste produced by manufacturing industry can cause environmental 
pollution such as air pollution due to emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6) generated, water 
pollution caused by liquid waste containing chemicals, and soil contamination due to solid waste generated. 
Besides the importance industry on paying attention to environmental aspects, social aspects need to be 
considered. This is because humans have an important role in building sustainability. 
In addition, the point of view environmental and social safeguards, increased public awareness of the 
importance of environmental and social safeguards for the better life of the future encourages companies today 
to compete not only to be lean but also sustainable. The concept of sustainable manufacturing becomes the main 
foundation for manufacturing industry practitioners to compete in global market. Sustainable manufacturing is 
important facts in competitive advantage for the company. Sustainable concepts are more able to compete 
globally considering they have been able to meet the standards of ISO 14000.

4. Discussion  
According to the results of the application of SSC-VSM in both companies, it is found that PT Y tends to have 
better sustainability performance than PT X. Comparison of the performance of the two companies as follows: 
A. Economic  
PT X and PT Y have poor performance that is for PT X at manufacturing stage and PT Y at pre manufacturing 
stage. PT X has poor performance at the manufacturing stage due to the back wash filter process caused by the 
back wash filter activity done 2 times in one day. The back wash filter activity is classified as NVA because it 
aims to maintain low water TDS (<6), while the TDS standard allowed by the health ministry is less than 500 
mg. Therefore, since drinking water standards do not require low TDS (<6) then back wash filter activity is 
classified as NVA. Likewise PT Y does not do back wash filter process every day because PT Y follow the 
standard set by the health ministry that is below 500 mg. Overall, both companies are able to produce products 
that fit to the quality specifications at each company and able to meet the consumers needs 
B. Environments  
In environmental aspect it can be seen in manufacturing stage that material, water, and energy consumption of 
PT Y is better than PT X. This is caused by PT X has back wash filter process, so there is material consumption 
for back wash filter process (HCL chemicals and caustic soda), In the indicator of energy consumption and 
emissions generated during pre manufacturing and distribution stage. The performance in the pre-
manufacturing stage is low due to the fact that there is still a material purchase process under the minimum 
amount of purchases on suppliers so that the company needs to make manual purchases to suppliers. The last 
indicator is waste management. It is known that both companies for pre manufacturing stage until distribution 
process, do not apply waste management process. So that the waste generated will be immediately disposed of 
in the final landfill. But for gallon packaging has been well managed by both companies, especially by PT Y. 
This is because the gallon that has been used will be returned to the company for reuse to be refilled into new 
products. The difference between the two companies is that PT Y manages the defective gallon waste by 
resending it to the supplier for the recycling process in the gallon, whereas PT X does not recycle the unused 
gallon packaging. 
C. Social 
On the social aspect, it is found that both companies have good performance. However, workload of workers in 
the company especially in the manufacturing stage can be identified that the workload of workers in PT X 
greater than PT Y, this is seen from the method in the production floor. PT Y produces the product using 
machine while PT X manually produces. In addition the number of workers in PT X 14 people and PT Y more 
than 50 people. This further indicates that the workload of PT X is bigger than PT Y. Similarly in the pre 
manufacturing stage it can be seen that in PT X the workload is increased due to the requirement of purchasing 
all material manually to the supplier. Whereas in PT Y manual purchases made on water purchases, this is due 
to the need for high enough water and difficult to meet if only rely on delivery by the water supplier.  
 
5. 
Conclusion and Future Work 
It can be concluded that SSC-VSM can be used as a sustainability tool. SSC-VSM is able to identify economic, 
environmental, and social wastage throughout the product supply chain. Based on the results of SSC-VSM 
implementation, it is found that there are differences in sustainability performance between the two companies. This 
indicates that firm size has an effect on sustainability performance. Factors that cause performance differences are 
different quality specifications, production capacity and type of process used. PT X focuses on low TDS (<6) and 
the manual production process leads to the need for back wash filter process twice daily. The existence of this 
activity leads to the consumption of time, water, and energy that is high enough at the manufacturing stage. In 
contrast to PT Y back wash process carried out for 3 months so that the consumption of time, water, and energy for 
each unit produced is quite low. PT X is classified as a small company because it has 14 workers and has a 
production capacity of 6000 units per month. This causes the number of orders on suppliers are not able to meet the 
minimum order so that the company purchase material using the company vehicle. This causes the energy 
consumption and there are emissions generated. Similarly with PT X, PT Y does purchase by own vehicle to 
purchase water at mountain springs. But for other material sent by supplier because it meets the minimum order. 
This is considering that the production capacity of PT Y is quite high at 30,000 units per month and PT Y is 
included in medium companies because the workers above 50 people. In the overall distribution stage both 
companies have the same performance. The future work can develop several indicators that can generalize a variety 
of products in sustainability measurement.

Abstract 
As a country with a majority of adherents of Islam, Indonesia is one of the countries with the largest 
market share of Halal products in the world. The emergence of Halal-labeled food and beverage products 
businesses is growing even imported products entering Indonesia are beginning to register their 
certification to MUI, indicating that the level of consumer awareness of Halal products in Indonesia has 
increased. The case of Samyang noodles in Indonesia has recently become one proof that imported 
products must also have Halal certification. Social media as one of the most widely used technologies 
today, is rapidly influencing consumers that the products that are logistically distributed from Korea are 
Haram and directly lower the benefits of this product which was originally the most popular and viral in 
social media. This is to prove that the role of technology, the logistics process will affect the profitability 
of a company for its products, so that through this research will be proven empirically. This study is a 
descriptive quantitative research with questionnaires distributed to 100 respondents who have appropriate 
criteria as the object of this research is the producers of halal food. Data processing using descriptive data 
analysis technique and simple linier regression analysis technique using SPSS 23 software. The results are 
the Information Technology supports have positive and significant relationship with Halal Logistics. The 
model in this study can use to investigate the relationship of Halal Logistics and Information Technology 
in Halal cosmetics, Halal medicine, and others, for further study.

Abstract 
Utilizing wind turbines to produce electricity has been increasing in recent years, due to technology 
advancement, global warming and environmental pollution. Identification of the most suitable place for 
harnessing wind energy is enormously important, so effective criteria must be considered. This study is 
aimed to prioritize different cities of Fars province for establishment wind farm facilities. In order to this 
purpose six major criteria including wind power density, topographic situation, distance to distribution 
net, population, land cost and natural disasters were investigated. Wind power as the foremost criterion, 
that a candidate site must have, is the high degree of continues and persistent windiness. The Weibull 
distribution function has been applied to estimate the wind power density by using 3-h wind speed and 
other meteorological data. The function’s results indicated that Izadkhast has the most value of wind 
power with amount of 166.64 W/m2. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Andersen-Petersen (AP) 
were used to rank the under study areas. FTOPSIS and AHP were applied for validating calculated 
results. Finally it is suggested that Izadkhast is the best city for wind-hydrogen conversion constructions. 
About 21.9 ton hydrogen will be produced per year by using a 900 kW wind turbine in the city.

of Izadkhast was selected as the most appropriate location to generate wind energy. The best capacity factor of this 
wind turbine is related to the year of 2006 with the value of 18.9%.  
6. Conclusion
The most important findings of this study can be summarized as follows: 
•
For ranking the cities, 6 important criteria including 3 output criteria of wind conditions, topographical
conditions, and population and 3 input criteria of distance from distribution grid, land price, and probability
of natural disasters were used for DEA model.
•
The probability of 3 natural disasters of flood, earthquake, and dust storm were considered for this criterion
as sub criteria, because they impose the risk of damaging or even destroying wind turbines. According to
expert’s opinion, weight coefficient of 0.25, 0.25, and 0.5 were considered for flood, earthquake and dust
storm respectively
•
For Bavanat and Neyriz were calculated the least (0.569) and the most (0.668) probability of natural
disaster, respectively.
•
Weibull distribution was used for calculation of wind power density. Finally specified that Izadkhast city
has the most value of wind power between the other cities (with value of 166.64 W/m2). Because wind
power had given a “very important” preferential value in 2 validations method so Izadkhast were placed in
top of the 13 cities with AHP and FTOPSIS.
•
After ignoring places with trees, hills, mountains and tall building, Safashahr was specified as the best city
in terms of topographic situation with 171 km2 suitable lands, versus Shiraz was detected as the worst city
with 117 km2 suitable lands.
•
Average of suitable distances to the city center in circle with 7.5 km radius for Neyriz was calculated 6.85
km so this city has most distance and versus Shiraz has least distance to distribution net.
•
After executing DEA model, rank of 5 cities were specified but 8 cities including Izadkhast, Estahban,
Safashahr, Eghlid, Bavanat, Fasa, Kazerun and Shiraz have obtained full efficiency score, so for ranking
these cities is used from AP model.
•
Final rank of the cities by usage of DEA was 1- Shiraz, 2- Izadkhast, 3- Bavanat, 4- Fasa, 5- Estahban, 6-
Kazerun, 7- Eghlid, 8- Safashahr, 9- Abadeh, 10- Arsanjan, 11- Sepidan, 12- Neyriz and 13- Firuzabad.
•
After ranking the cities with 2 validation methods, Izadkhast city was recommended to wind farm
establishment.
•
The utilizing a wind-hydrogen energy conversion system will result in a substantial amount of hydrogen
production (averagely 21.9 ton/year) when a 900 kW wind turbine is installed in this location.

Abstract 
Nowadays depletion of fossil fuel resources and air pollution are the two most concerning issues that 
human is facing with because of increasing demands and consumption. These reasons make renewable 
and green energies such as wind and solar an attractive source of energy in world. The current study is an 
investigation research to estimate wind and solar energy potential in different cities of Fars province in 
Iran. Afterward is attempted to prioritize the places for hybrid solar-wind constructions. For this purpose 
4 main criteria including economic condition, social condition, geological condition and natural disasters 
which each criterion has sub-criteria were investigated. Wind power density and solar irradiation are the 
most important criteria and are estimated by the Weibull distribution function and Angstrom-Prescott 
equation, respectively. After calculating the amount of wind and solar energy by using long-term 3-hourly 
data, results showed that Eghlid and Estahban have the highest amount of wind power and solar energy, 
respectively. FTOPSIS is used for ranking the cities and AHP, ELECTREE III, WSM, MAPPAC and 
DEA are applied to validate the results. According to results, the best city for establishing hybrid wind-
solar site is Eghlid.

6. Conclusion
The results of this study are summarized as follows: 
• Cities were rank according to five general criteria: climate, natural disasters, economic condition, social
condition and geological condition, each with a number of sub-criteria. In total, the model used in this study
consisted of 6 positive sub-criteria and 7 negative sub-criteria.
• After calculating the wind power and solar irradiance for all cities using, respectively, the Weibull
distribution function and Angstrom-Prescott equation, Eghlid was found to have the best wind power, 146.30
KW/m2, and Estahban was found to have the best solar irradiance, 7739 MJ/m2, among the studied cities.
• After eliminating the geologically unsuitable areas, namely areas with tree cover, mountains and hills, and
difficult accessibility, among the studied cities, Eghlid was found to have the greatest geologically suitable

© IEOM Society International 
land area (91 km2) and Bavanat was found to have the smallest area with favorable geological conditions (61 
km2). 
• Probability of natural disasters is another important site location criterion. Given the susceptibility of area
to dust storms and magnitude of their effect on turbine blades, in these calculations, this event was a given a
weight of 0.5 while both earthquake and flood were assigned with a weight of 0.25. After merging the
probabilities of these three sub-criteria (natural events) based on the said weights, Bavanat with probability of
0.569 and Firuzabad with probability of 0.665 were found to have, respectively, the best and worst status
among the studied cities in terms of susceptibility to unfavorable natural events.
• After running the model, ranks of the 7 cities in terms of suitability as the site of solar-energy hybrid plant
was determined. The final ranking obtained in this study is: 1-Eghlid, 2- Firuzabad, 3- Estahban, 4-
Safashahr, 5- Bavanat, 6- Izadkhast and 7-Arsanjan, indicating that Eghlid is the best option for combined
exploitation of wind and solar energy, which as mentioned, leads to reduced maintenance, operation, and
infrastructural costs, greater operation efficiency, and better reliability.

Abstract 
Hydrogen is one of the cleanest energy carrier that is one of the future fuel. This study proposes to 
establish a wind-powered hydrogen production by desalting sea water nearby the coastal areas. For this 
purpose 7 coastal cities in southern and northern of Iran were investigated. Weibull distribution function 
(WDF) was used for evaluating the available amount of wind energy potential in under study cities. 
Results of the calculations showed that the city of Anzali has a yearly mean of wind power density of 
327w/m2 which is highest between the other places. By using a 900 kW wind turbine the value of 2315 
MWh energy will be produced, which this amount of energy will desalt 439950 m3 of sea water or 35974 
kg of hydrogen a year. According to the numbers of personal vehicles in the city, a wind farm containing 
55 wind turbines (900kW) is needed to fuel all the cars and reduce the pollutant gases.

Abstract
Applying integrated system, product quality and production process are important on both 
manufacturing organization and service organization efficiently and productively. One of 
improving quality method mostly used in industry around the world is six sigma. This method 
concerns on significantly improvement in which costumers’ demands are considered as 
quality improvement ways in the company. The most determining factors to improve process 
quality from six sigma method consist of five stages such as DMAIC method (Define 
Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control). DPMO and Sigma Quality Level score for Nylon 
Filament Yarn production process on July 2014 was 14875 and its sigma was 3.72 and in the 
yield process level on July 2014 was 92.1%.

4.1 Conclusion 
1.
Based on Pareto diagram, it shows the dominant types of defect of Nylon Filament yarn. The
dominants defects are mottled/UV about 29,3%, oil about 28,4%, dirty about 23,9%, bad form
about 13,5%, and the rest about 4,9%.
2.
DPMO and Sigma Quality Level score for Nylon Filament Yarn process on july 2014 is
14875 and its sigma score is 3.72. It means that sigma score is influenced by DPOM score. If
DPMO score decreases so the sigma score will raise by itself and vice versa.
4.2 Suggestion 
1.
It is better to apply DMAIC and FMEA Method on the production process of Nylon Filament
Yarnat PT. Indonesia Toray Synthetics to improve the quality of product and to decrease the
defect of the product later on.
2.
The company should give training to the operator in order to comprehend employees Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP) and to be more careful. Moreover, it would be better to give
training to new employees who do not understand SOP, so that they can decrease the number
of defect because of new operator who are dereliction and careless and also improve the air
circulation in company.

Abstract 
The growth of commercial aviation in Indonesia is increasing and making the potential growth of MRO 
(maintenance, repair, overhaul) company. Tight competition among MRO companies in Indonesia demands 
the right quality management strategy in order to compete globally. This reseach objective is to find a 
implementation of quality management strategy for Indonesian aircraft MRO companies. This research 
methodology based on Kano Model, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) matrix, and Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) to understand and analyze customer’s need. The results of this study are strategies that can 
be applied by Indonesian aircraft MRO companies to improve product quality and maintain company’s 
competitive advantage.

1. Introduction
The aviation world today has a huge social and commercial role for society, so as global economic growth continues 
to grow, demand for air transportation is expected to grow rapidly (Poll, 2017). Although demand for air transport 
needs is often considered close to GDP, the International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2016) reports that 
passenger traffic growth has exceeded global GDP over the past nine years (Wyman, 2017). In Indonesia alone, 
throughout 2014, national route services increased by 18% compared to 2013, then on international lines increased by 
32% (Ministry of Industry, 2016). 
The rapid growth of the aviation world will undoubtedly have an impact on the growth of the aircraft maintenance 
industry which is an important factor in the success of airlines generating revenue with high-flying aircraft utilities, 
where data indicate that aircraft maintenance costs can generate businesses by two-thirds the price of the aircraft itself, 
and play 10-20% of shares in airline international costs (Jingmin, 2006). The growth rate of the global aircraft 
maintenance industry is expected to increase at an average rate of 5.2% to 2022 and 3.8% on average per year until 
2027 (Wyman, 2017). 
Currently airlines tend to use outsource strategies for areas that are not their core business, one of which is in the field 
of aircraft maintenance as it is considered capable of transferring risks associated with regulation and at a reasonable 
cost (Rieple, Outsourcing for competitive advantage: an examination, 2008 ) and (McFadden & Worrells, 2012). 
Overall, airlines allocated an average of 64% of their maintenance costs in 2007, compared to 37% in 1996, for 
outsourcing aircraft maintenance activities, covering everything from repairing critical components, such as landing 
gear and engine repairs, to check the weight plane (FAA, 2008). Outsourcing MRO allows airlines to avoid significant 
capital investment in the facilities, equipment and supply of parts and components (Tang & Elias, 2012), therefore

Figure 11. Technical requirements related to responsiveness 
Figure 12. Technical requirements related to costs 
After  customer requirements and technical requirements (as two main house of quality component) are completely 
anayzed and prioritized, QFD is used to integrate customer requirements and technical requirements into development 
of a quality management strategy of aircraft MRO company. 
7. Conclusion
In this research, we proposed a integrated method to develop quality management strategy using three methods that 
complement each other. Kano Model is used as a qualitative tool to analyze customer needs in depth, then AHP is 
used as a quantitative tool. These two integration methods provide an in-depth understanding of the customer's need 
for outsourcing aircraft maintenance. After that, technical requirements are analyzed by descriptive survey. All of 
those factors are then integrated to develop quality management strategies using the house of quality of QFD. The 
results of this study should be used as one of the reference that can be considered by the directors or board of 
management of the MRO aircraft companies in Indonesia to improve and expand its business. 
Since the topic about aircraft maintenance outsourcing management is still new, future research should be done to 
improve knowledge about aircraft maintenance outsourcing management. Future research of this topic can discuss 
about the implementation phase of strategy developed in this research and it’s possible problems that may arise.

Abstract 
The development of core competencies is expected to increase the competitiveness of national industries, 
because it the performance becomes measurable and easy to evaluate its development program. Global 
economic competition has been increasingly right now. The low competitiveness of the industry at 
international market is still a challenge to the national industry. Industrial development can be done by 
utilizing the natural resources, and focus on the region competence. This research was conducted to help 
know the core competence of industry by take case study at Pekalongan City. The first phase is 
determining regional competence on some existing industrial alternatives. The alternative is obtained 
based on secondary data collection and using method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results 
will be in the form of core competencies that can be developed, as a competitiveness in Pekalongan City. 
Phase two, plans the development strategy using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method. In 
designing the core competency,  it will done by discussing with experts to get additional analysis about 
the strategy to be done.

1. Introduction
Global economic competition is now increasingly, impact of the global economy that now leads to free trade. 
Both regional and international levels such as the adoption of AFTA (Asean Free Trade Agreement), and ACFTA 
(Asean - China Free Trade Agreement) (Nurcahyo, Erlinda , Maemunsyah, Saparudin 2011). The low 
competitiveness of the industry for international market is still a challenge to the national industry. As stated by the 
Ministry of Industry of Indonesia, Indonesia's competitiveness declined from 37th rank last year to rank 41 this year 
from 138 countries (Kemenperind, 2017). There are several factors causing the low competitiveness of national 
industry, seeing many problems in Indonesia such as inefficiency of government bureaucracy, weak infrastructure, 
corruption, lack of legal certainty, especially employment and tax incentive regulations, inflation, lack of access to 
finance for farmers, and the instability of government policy and its implementation (Institutional Science and 
Technology, DIKTI, 2017).  
Industrial development can be done by utilizing locally owned resources, and focusing more on the competencies of 
a region (Mappigau and Hastan 2012). The approach, according to the Ministry of Industry, is called bottom-up 
approach, namely through the selection and determination of core competencies that are regional advantages that 
have competitiveness (Kemenperind, 2007). The development of core competencies of regional industries is 
expected to increase the competitiveness of national industries because the industrial development is more focused 
and  clear, so the performance becomes scalable and easy to evaluate development program (Kemenperind, 2007).

5. Conclusion and Recommendation
Core competence is determined from the largest PDRB, which is the largest contributor in economic activity 
Pekalongan City. Determination of core industrial competence in Pekalongan City is done by using Analytical 
Hierarcy Process method). There are 3 levels in the determination of core competencies. The first level is level 0, 
which is the goal to be achieved, namely choosing core competencies. The second level is level 1, the selection 
criteria. Criteria for choosing core competencies are contributions to regional development, social impact and equity 
of income, availability of human resources, infrastructure, value-added prospects, competitiveness, marketing, 
locality values, geographic conditions, policy and institutional support. The last level is level 2, which is an 
alternative industrial sector to be selected. The industrial sector that is used as an alternative option is based on the 
industry sector which has the highest distribution, namely the Trade Industry, and the Processing industry. The 
election to find out the core competencies that are owned by the Pekalongan city, selected from the processing 
industry. In processing industry which is in the city of Pekalongan is divided into three classifications of industries, 
namely metal machine and chemistry industry, varied industry, and agricultural industry.  
The results of data processing using AHP method indicate that which has the highest priority value is varied 
industry with a weight value of 0.668, then the industry becomes the core competence of Pekalongan City. One part 
of multifarious industry which has the highest contribution is Pekalongan batik industry. Based on the result of the 
discussion with the batik businessmen of Pekalongan, there is 6 variables that is improving the marketing, support 
from the government, the development of technology, the development of information media for batik, development 
of labor, and the development of batik models and products. 
The recommendations for further research are to get more insight not only from the existing industry side but 
also from local government, as well as other experts as inputs for the design and determination of strategies. The 
recommendation for future research is need for further research into the design of an industry strategy on the basis of 
core competence. Requires application of core competencies in other regions or industries.

Abstract 
The numerous cases of laboratory incidents make it clear that safety in laboratories become an important 
issue to be discussed. This research investigates the safety perceptions of students on using University 
teaching laboratory. This study is concentrated to the students who are regularly use chemicals substances 
in teaching laboratory. Regression is used to get the correlation between safety perception and safety 
behaviour among students in the teaching laboratory activities. The result showed that respondents have 
good perceptions on safety in university teaching laboratories but there’s still improvement needed to 
raise a good perception of threats in order to increase safety behavior.

1. Introduction
There are numbers of accidents involving chemical substances all over the world. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released that there were 57,975 incidents involving hazardous chemical 
substances and 4,621 of those incidents resulted in 15,506 persons being injured (Hill, 2015). The U.S Chemical 
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), who respond to only the most serious chemical related accidents, has 
reported 120 laboratory accidents resulting in 87 evacuations, 96 serious injuries and three deaths since 2001 
(Mulcahy et al., 2012 on Jorgensen, 2017). Langermann (2011) and National Research Council (2014) stated that, in 
addition to the incidents reported by the CSB, students and faculty working in research laboratories experience the 
pain and suffering of minor accidents injuries and illnesses (Jorgensen, 2017).  
Association of Public & Land-Grant Universities Council on Research Task Force on Laboratory Safety (2016) 
has encountered the critical need for increased safety in research laboratory since the accidents have negatively 
impacted the students and faculty staffs (Jorgensen, 2017). Hill (2015) stated that most of the accidents happen in 
chemicals usage caused by human and this unsafe behavior of human is caused by perceptions based on Health 
Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behavior (Rosenstock et al., 1988, Ajzen, 1991 on Ying Ni et al, 2017). 
However, there are just few research discuss about human’s perception on safety (Schröder et al., 2016). So, the new 
insight which this paper develop is to get to know the safety perception on University Teaching Laboratory.

number. There is significant relationship when the score is lower than the alpha, and not significant if the score is 
higher than alpha. 
From the data provided above, we can infer that to create safety in university teaching laboratory, we could 
manage the perceptions of teaching laboratories user. The good perceptions in university teaching laboratories can 
be raised by increasing the perceptions of susceptibility, perceptions of benefits, and also supportive external factors. 
These criterias can increase the perceptions of threats in every user and it will lead to safe act because it has a 
significant correlation to safe act or behavior. 
The result of this study is in line with the Health Belief Model Theory which stated that perceptions has 
significantly impacted likelihood of behaving safely and also in line with Schröder et al (2016) which stated that risk 
perception motivates safety behavior. What makes this possible is that because in the current study, most of the 
respondents have good knowledge on risk, the environment is supported the likelihood of taking safe behavior, the 
university also have program to protect from accidents, and it all makes good perceptions among the respondents. 
When people have a good perceptions on university teaching laboratory usage, it will create a good safety behavior 
on laboratory users. 
However, this result is a little bit contradictive with the conclusion of Safety and Health Perceptions in 
Work-Related Transport Activities in Ghanaian Industries (Atombo et al., 2017), the research was in the same 
interest but in the different scope, which stated that interventions to improve safety and health concentration has 
been on drivers’ safety practice with less attention to safe driving environments and vehicle usage, while this study 
has shown that external environment and chemicals usage (susceptibility) have significantly affected the safety 
perception of threats and that leads to safety behavior taken by the users. This might be caused by on the previous 
research, there is a gradual raising of health and safety standards and increased awareness of the benefits of safety 
practices at the workplaces (Atombo et al., 2017) while in the current study, people’s perception is significantly 
impacted by the environment and hazard susceptibility so when the environment is not supported, they might have 
lower perceptions and when they dont perceived hazard susceptibility, the same thing will also happen. 
The future research that can be taken to reinforce what is written on this paper is quite about the more 
comprehensive discussion about the correlation of safety perceptions and safety behavior in university teaching 
laboratory and the elaboration of how safety behavior affects safety perceptions. 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations
From the data analysis, we can conclude that most of the respondents have good perception on safety in using 
chemicals in laboratories and their perceptions have significantly correlated with safety behavior that they take in 
teaching laboratory activities. The good perception is caused by some reasons. Most of them has introduced to basic 
safety and health and this raised their awareness to the risk they will face on using chemicals in teaching laboratory. 
Then, the university management quite have supportive program to protect the laboratory users from accident, such 
as safety inspections. Also, respondents are mostly aware with their safety when knowing many cases related 
chemicals usage in laboratory. However, there still are some potential improvement, such as : 
a.
Update Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Determining Control (HIRADC),
b.
Conduct safety system management audit periodically,
c.
Create faculty safety team and conduct monthly meeting to discuss safety issues,
d.
Conduct emergency response simulation,
e.
Conduct annual safety talks,
f.
Enrich safety posters and signages,
g.
Conduct regular safety training to asisstant laboratories and lecturers,
h.
Provide more adequate protective equipments.

INTRODUCTION
Two-way radio or usually known as “Walkie Talkie” is a communication device use to 
connect people using wireless transmission of electromagnetic radio frequency signal. VS01 
production line consists several product of portable twoway radio to be manufactured. There are 
ten different product are specify to this line. The products are differentiating with the design of 
the radio itself such as it shape, features, specification and the software that programme into it. 
The assembly process were categorized into different assembly line according to product families 
and it variants. VS01 produce very high runner volume product for every week. The customer 
forecast and demand are varied for every week. At the peak time especially in quarter four end of 
every year, which is the demand exceed the capacity, the production volume unable to compensate 
with the capacity of line. Based on statistic from logistic department, the volume increase for 40% 
in quarter four compare with other quarter in year 2014. The company had to run overtime to their 
operator and reshuffle the shift from three shifts to four shifts to encounter of this issue. 
There are several limitation on this scope of study which is it only involve on process 
improvement from the highest volume product in VS01. The line improvement also only covered 
FE BTC area which is Nome offline and test process. This line is located between SMT and Back 
End Assembly. Based on the problem statement above, the objectives of this research had been 
set:

Cost saving is the priority to company reduction for headcount/operator and floor to ensure 
either their improvement project space reduction. The calculation should be effective or failed. 
Figure 15 shows the cost considered by cost per year. 
The calculations for the operator are taken by four shift crew. Before improvement five 
operators are needed to operate the process which means twenty operators in total. Similarly for 
after improvement, two operators are needed which mean eight operators in total are needed to 
run the operation.  
Cost Saving = Cost reduction – investment cost 
Therefore, 
Cost saving = 73562 – 21333 = USD$ 52229 per annum 
The investment cost mostly come from Auto screwing robot which is USD$18000 and fixture 
for burr cutting process combine with de-panelization board process which cost USD$ 3333. 
Training cost is excluded from this calculation as the training is done internally. The difference 
between head count and space cost reduction compared by investment cost is the cost saving that 
gives impact to the company.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
In summary, using Lean Six Sigma, the bottleneck and waste are able to be identified and the
improvement was able to be implemented. The highest possibility product that requires 
improvement had been identified which is Nome. Nome is the highest among all products in VS01 
for the standard hour time and highest number of operators. This project is able to reduce the 
Nome process standard hour from 0.0581 to 0.0232 and reduce the head count of the operator 
needed to operate the total Nome line from five people to two people. Based on all Nome process 
flow which is Burr Cutting, Crystal Scan, Proscan, Screwing and Compats, screwing process is 
the highest standard hour required to complete one task. In order to reduce the standard hour, 
Automation Screwing Robot had been introduced. By applying Work Element Scrubbing method, 
elimination on unnecessary station number, re-arrangement of Burr Cutting process to SMT 
process, combination, simplification on total Nome process line and automation able to help to 
reduce of standard hour and headcount for Nome process. The implementations of Lean Six Sigma 
improvement are able to help company for cost saving USD$52229 per year. This is happen due 
to the reduction of the three operators to complete the process and the saving of production space 
from line simplification. Control and monitoring should be in place after improvement. This is to 
ensure no other issue happen and affected the new process flow line. Training and certification 
should be provided to the operator and the technician to ensure they understand the new process 
before operates. All procedure needs to be documented for guideline to operator to refer and 
further improvement enhancement. By the improvement of standard hour time and headcount 
operator, it is sufficient enough to cover during 40% production ramp up time.

Abstract 
The main objective of power system operation is to supply the customer electricity demand with 
acceptable quality in an optimum way. With constantly varying demand, this objective may not be easily 
achieved.  An adaptable system enhancement is therefore necessary to attain the objective. One of the 
strategies is controlling the switchable devices in distribution system for the purpose of maintaining the 
system voltage within the acceptable limits and minimizing the loss with minimum control action. One of 
the electricity customers is industrial institution, where some types of loads are nonlinear. This may 
include electrical machine and power electronic devices. Besides drawing the power from the grid, these 
loads may also inject distortion to the system causing destructive effects. This study proposes 
optimization scheme on distribution system considering the presence of nonlinear loads. In addition to 
control the system voltage and reduce the loss, system distortion should also be suppressed. To include 
the nonlinear loads into optimization, the calculation of power flow should be extended to accommodate 
the characteristic of nonlinear loads. The optimal control of switchable devices is determined using 
Genetic Algorithm (GA). The significant of involving distortion injected by nonlinear loads are 
highlighted.

1. Introduction
Electric power utility includes components of generation, transmission and distribution. The components 
work together to fulfill the electricity demand of customer. It is the requirement of customer that the electricity 
should be supplied continuously with acceptable quality. From the side of electric power company the power should 
be generated and transferred in a minimum cost. The electricity demand that constantly changes may cause the 
difficulty of the utility to fulfill the demand with required quality. It is therefore necessary to control the system 
operation such that it may enable continuously fulfill the demand with acceptable quality. If this objective cannot be 
successfully achieved then either the electricity demand cannot be fully satisfied or the electricity supplied to the 
customer will be of poor quality. 
Distribution system is part of power system taking important role in the entire system since this sub-system is 
directly connected and supplies the power to the customer. In the distribution system, variation of electricity demand 
is the problem, which is very difficult to overcome in technical and economical sense. If not carefully managed, the 
change of electricity demand may cause several problems such as voltage violation and power loss escalation. In 
order to solve these problems, an adaptable enhancement is therefore required for controlling the voltage and 
minimizing the power loss. Some modern distribution system may consist of some switchable devices such as Load 
Tap Changer (LTC) in the secondary side substation transformer, and shunt capacitors in the secondary side 
transformer and distribution feeders. These devices may be controlled for the purpose of maintaining the voltage not 
to exceed the permitted limits while minimizing the system power loss. This planning strategy practically consists of 
optimal dispatch of LTC and shunt capacitors for the aforementioned objectives. However, the devices may not be 
switched as many as needed, since it may reduce their lifetime. Therefore the dispatch control of the switchable 
devices must be carried out with minimum number of switching.

4. Conclusion
The optimal control of distribution system is investigated due to the presence of nonlinear loads. The main 
conclusions are: 
•
The optimal control of distribution system may be carried out by switching the LTC and shunt capacitors,
•
Comprehensive device control may be simultaneously determined using Genetic Algorithm,
•
The purpose of including nonlinear loads on optimal dispatch problem is to assure the system distortion does not
exceed the maximum allowable limit,
•
Straightforwardly taking the effects of nonlinear loads into account enables achieving higher energy saving and
better average voltage improvement.

This is particularly true for automotive manufacturer. This research discusses the relationship between 
influential variables with performance in Indonesia automotive manufacturer by manufacturing capability 
and sustainability strategy. Data are collected from automotive manufacturers around Jakarta, Bekasi & 
Karawang area. Data is processed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The analysis of this paper 
in the selected companies is provided with the purpose to help understand how automotive manufacturers 
know the effect of sustainability strategy in manufacturing performance based on their manufacturing 
capability.

1. Introduction
The acceptance of sustainability strategy in corporate has continued to grow steadily in recent years (Sukitch et al., 
2015). Manufacturing is regarded as a key sector in sustainability due to its high volume of resource consumption, 
increasing annual introduction of new products that require a relatively high amount and generation of materials, 
energy and wastes, an increasing volume of emissions throughout the product life cycle and the collective impact of 
manufactured products and manufacturing processes on the immediate community (Joung, et all., 2013). 
Manufacturing companies are not only aiming to improve operations in terms of flexibility, delivery, quality, and 
cost, but also attempting to be competitive in terms of environmental and social issues (Caniels et al., 2013; Vachon 
and Klassen, 2008).  
Failing to manage these sustainability issues can substantially damage the image of the company and thus affect its 
performance (Chen L., 2008). This research discusses the relationship between influential variables with 
performance, especially for environment in Indonesia automotive manufacturer namely manufacturing capability 
and sustainability strategy.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) test model study was conducted to determine the Latent Variable anywhere 
that is valid and can be further processed to test the structural model. 
To see whether the research hypothesis acceptable or not, we use model structural. This is done by analyzing 
theprocessing of the T-value (t value) to test hypotheses of significance to the research model. T-Value is the 
measure of the statistical significance of an independent variable b in explaining the dependent variable y. 
The function of SEM is to tests hypotheses about relationships between variables. Hypothesis accepted if the 
absolute number of t> 1.96 (for 2-tailed) which is equivalent to p < 0.05, then accept alternative hypothesis with a 
coefficient in accordance with the proposed research hypotheses (positive or negative) where previously measured 
first value Standardized Factor Loading research model. To see how far the data support the model, then used the 
indicator value by GOFI for all latent variables structural model. The calculation results are listed in Table 1 as 
follows.

As conclusion, all hypotheses can be accepted by the path : Manufacturing Capability (Man Cpb), Sustainability 
Strategy (Sus Strat), and Manufacturing Performance (Man Prf). This path is shown to prove the truth of the 
hypothesis that manufacturing capabilities will affect the sustainability strategy which applied in the automotive 
company, and  will also affect the performance of the company. 
Based on ANOVA testing, we can conclude that for latent variable in Manufacturing Capability (Man Cpb), 
Sustainability Strategy (Sus Strat), and Manufacturing Performance (Man Prf) in almost all groups of respondents 
profile shows the results of ‘no difference’. 
In order to obtain a better and more comprehensive understanding of sustainability, it is suggested for future 
research to increase the number of participating firms and compare also with different industry or countries. It is also 
worthwhile to explore the differences of the capability and strategy approaches for sustainability between the big 
firm’s and small/medium firm’s.

Abstract 
Remanufacturing has achieved increased attention in recent years for reprocessing end-of-use (EUO) and 
end-of-life (EOL) products. Technical feasibility as well as profitability of a remanufacturing process is 
affected by the assemblability and disassemblablity of products. Selection of fastening methods during the 
design stage affects not only product assemblability but also the disassemblability of used products for 
remanufacturing. Fastening methods selected for easier assembly during initial manufacturing may cause 
difficulties during disassembly for remanufacturing or vice versa. This would in turn have an impact on the 
cost of assembly and disassembly. Hence, decisions made during early product development regarding 
fastening method should address assemblability, disassemblability and cost concerns.  In previous studies, 
simultaneous consideration of assemblabilty, disassemblablity and cost factors for fastening method selection 
was not addressed properly. In this paper, a methodology for fastening method selection is proposed by which 
all the three factors are simultaneously considered in the selection of fastening methods.  In the proposed 
methodology, the selection problem is formulated as an optimization model with the objective of minimizing 
the overall assembly and disassembly costs. Genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to solve the model. A case 
study on the selection of fastening methods for laptop computers is conducted to illustrate the proposed 
methodology and to evaluate its effectiveness.

1. Introduction
Over the last few years, various countries have passed directives and legislation which hold manufacturers
responsible for taking back and reprocessing end-of-use (EOU) and end-of-life (EOL) products in an environmentally 
friendly manner. Remanufacturing has gained increasing attention in recent years as a sustainable and profitable product 
recovery option (Lund & Hauser, 2010; Matsumoto et al., 2016).  Remanufacturing is an industrial process whereby a 
used products is brought back to operating condition through reuse, refurbishment and replacement of its components 
(Ismail et al., 2014; Östlin et al., 2009). Giutini and Gaudette (2003) estimated that the cost of producing a 
remanufactured product is 40–65% lower compared to that of a new product. Despite the attractiveness of the 
remanufacturing business, quite a few companies such as Apple, Fuji Xerox, HP, and Sony are currently offering 
remanufactured products in the market. It was reported that most of the technical barriers to product remanufacturability 
are due to design issues (Charter & Gray, 2008; Yang et al., 2016). Remanufacturability of EOU and EOL products is 
largely affected by their disassemblability.  
Types of fastening methods used during the design stage affects product’s disassemblablity. Decision making 
with regard to the selection of fastening method is a critical and challenging task for designers when remanufacturing is 
planned to be undertaken. This is due to the fact that fastening methods which facilitate assembly during initial 
manufacturing may cause difficulties during disassembly when used products are disassembled for component recovery. 
Similarly, fastening methods which can facilitate disassembly of used products may not be appropriate from an assembly 
point of view.  For example, fastening methods such as snap-fit joints, and adhesives are quick and require little effort 
to assembly, but cause difficulty in disassembly. Therefore, to facilitate remanufacturing of used products, design for 
disassembly (DfD) should be considered together with design for assembly (DFA) when selecting fastening methods. 
Quite few studies have attempted to develop DFA and DFD based methodologies for fastening method selection. 
However, simultaneous consideration of assemblability, disassemblability and cost issues during the design stage was 
not properly addressed in previous studies. In this paper, a methodology for fastening method selection is proposed 
where DFA, DFD and cost concerns are simultaneously considered. In the proposed methodology, the fastening method

5. Conclusions  
A company which plans to offer both new and remanufactured products must consider assemblability 
and disassemblability issues during design stage. Assemblability and disassemblablity of a product is affected by 
the types of fastening methods used. Some fastening methods which facilitate the assembly process may not be 
appropriate from the disassembly perspective and vice versa which makes selection of appropriate fastening 
method a critical and challenging task.  
In this study, a methodology for fastener selection which simultaneously considers assemblability, 
disassemblability and cost factors is proposed. In the proposed methodology, an optimization model is formulated with 
the objective of minimizing the sum of the product assembly and disassembly costs. A genetic algorithm was used to 
model the problem which was then solved in Matlab.  To illustrate the proposed methodology, a case study on fastening 
method selection for a laptop computers was conducted. The result of the experiment showed the model’s effectiveness 
in selecting optimal fastening methods for ease of assembly and disassembly such that the overall assembly and 
disassembly cost can be reduced. The proposed methodology offers a guide to designers in selecting optimal fastening 
methods by simultaneously considering ease of assembly, disassembly and related cost.  
The proposed methodology can be improved further. In this study, variability of condition of the EOL product 
which can affect the disassembly time, was not taken into account. Furthermore, the degree of damage caused to fasteners 
during product’s life time was also not considered. These two factors could be considered in future to further enhance 
the model’s capability.

Abstract 
As one of the corporate travel agency that has been using ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) in the 
company. However, with this ERP, the company still faces several problems such as not yet integrated 
database between branches so it can’t control the number of tourists who travel on that month and still 
face the overload of passengers on the high season/holiday season Christmas & new year. The purpose of 
this research is to design Business Intelligence (BI) application as complementary to ERP that already 
exist in Company to improve company performance. By way of designing an engineering analysis tool to 
describe the performance of each branch using Qliksense application. The results of this study show that 
by designing BI as a complement to existing ERP in the company, can improve sales performance better 
than the previous year and can eliminate the number of passengers who did not get the package tour.

Abstract 
Alternative energy is a term that refers to all usable energy that aims to replace conventional fuels without 
undesirable consequences. In the context of this research, alternative energy is meant to be renewable 
energy, which is generated from natural sources, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tidal current, and 
geothermal, renewable or natural after use. Many methods, procedures, and techniques are adopted by 
some companies to improve the competitiveness of products through the fulfillment of customer 
satisfaction as much as possible by enhancement and improvement of an alternative energy utilization. 
This paper suggested combining Quality Function Deployment and Kano’s model as design techniques in 
product design and by focusing on capturing dan translating consumer needs into product design. The 
result shows that the most important feature to be quickly corrected is technology sophistication and 
production cost with importance level, difficulty level, and highest cost estimation. From the planning 
matrix is obtained attributes which have the highest weight loss, namely container price and endurance. 
These attributes are the top priority. 
Keywords: Quality Function Deployment, Kano, Product Design, Alternative Energy Utilizaton. 
1. Introduction
Demand for the world's energy continues to increase throughout the history of human civilization. Expected
demand for energy in 2050 is nearly threefold. It seems that energy issues will be a topic that must be resolved 
together. The use of energy has grown and increased in accordance with human development itself. The effort to 
obtain alternative energy has long been done to reduce dependence on petroleum resources. The use of petroleum is 
expected to be exhausted in the shortest time if current consumption patterns are rising with industry and 
transportation increases. Various studies have shown that air quality is increasingly anxious about petroleum 
burning. 
Energy is one of the main requirements in human life. The increase in energy needs can be an indicator of 
prosperity, but it also creates problems in its preparation, because humans are only dependent on fossil fuels, of 
course, there is a very limited supply. Because of classified as irreversible and drained continuously, then the energy 
supply reduced and its existence cannot be re-established. Therefore, it is possible that in the future there will be 
problems related to the energy crisis. To anticipate that, over the last two decades, many experts energy from various 
1626","is the top priority as it has the highest weight. The technical characteristics of the highest priority are technology 
sophistication, material type, product mechanism, generator capacity and production cost. These attributes will then 
be used as inputs in QFD phase 2 for further investigation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From Kano questionnaire, it is obtained that attractiveness is an interesting category. Although the safety and 
operational are included in one dimensional category. Although aesthetic is the attributes that fall into the indifferent 
category. Through the use of the Kano’s model, researchers can eliminate the attributes for subsequent processing. 
The technical characteristics in QFD phase 1 are technology sophistication, material type, product mechanism, 
generator capacity and production cost. It produces technical performance measures namely level of difficulty, 
importance level, and cost estimation. The use of QFD can help manufacture produce better products based on 
customer needs.

Abstract 
This paper aims to test empirically a conceptual model of quality label equity proposed by previous study. 
More specifically this study tests the goodness of fit, validity, and reliability of the model. Data were 
collected through a survey using questionnaire to the 183 SNI-labeled helmet users in Jakarta area who 
bought helmet less than a year. Sample selection was done by convenience sampling technique. The 
goodness of fit and validity analyzes were done by Confirmatory Factor Analysis-Structural Equation 
Modeling (CFA-SEM) and the model reliability analysis using Cronbach Alpha. This study had proved 
that the conceptual model of quality label equity satisfies the goodness of fit, validity, and reliability 
criteria of the model. The Fit, valid, and reliable model of quality label equity can be used by 
governments and corporations to measure the equity of quality labels or the effectiveness of the policy of 
quality labeling. The effectiveness of quality labeling can be evaluated from the five dimensions of 
quality label equity, including the awareness of quality label, image of quality label, perceived quality of 
labeled product, attitude toward quality label, and intention to use quality label.

Abstract 
Cloud technology offers a lot of benefits for organizations in the global supply chain network to achieve 
agile and sustainable Supply Chain Collaborations (SCCs). Characteristics of cloud computing (especially 
Software as a Service and Coordination as a Service) – i.e. on-demand self-service, broad network access, 
resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service – shift SCCs’ traditional business model. By 
facilitating transparency in data exchange, supporting the establishment of neutral orchestrators, and 
increasing the collaborations’ flexibility to choose members and service providers, cloud transforms the 
nature of the Inter-Organizational System (IOS) from a support system to an enabling IOS. This paper 
explains the revolution in SCCs’ business models and structures which are enabled by cloud 
implementation. Each element of SCCs’ Business Model Canvas – i.e. customers, key resources, partners, 
channels, revenue streams, key activities, and cost structures – and the influence of cloud to each element 
are described. Cloud-enabled SCCs’ structures are not limited to a hierarchical structure with a central 
orchestrator, but can also be a less hierarchical network with individualistic decision-making and shared 
governance. In the end, a set of alternatives elements and structures are presented. Some examples of 
SCCs are also identified based on the framework proposed. This framework could be used by academics 
and practitioners in transforming a traditional SCCs and establishing or evaluating a cloud-enabled SCCs’ 
business model.

Abstract 
Aerospace companies implement certain quality management and environmental standards, e.g. ISO 9001 
and ISO 14001 requirements specific to the aerospace industry. The big question is whether the 
implementation of the ISO standards has provided its hope for returns. The aim of this research is 
therefore to analyze the benefits and challenges of the implementation of ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 in the 
aerospace industry. This study aims to investigate two underlying subjects – quality management and 
environmental management, and explore how they influence firm performance and how they are 
implemented in the aerospace industry. Nine participants from different aerospace companies were 
interviewed. The results suggest that these companies were put under pressure internally and externally 
by the customers for pursuing the certification. Major factors that affect the implementation include size 
of company, employee participation, and company commitment. It also discovered that ISO 14001 seems 
to mainly impact the managers and employees related to environmental work. This study found that the 
larger the company size, the more sensitive it becomes toward customer pressure on commitment to 
sustainability.

1. Introduction
According to Bansal & Hunter (2003), one of the strategic explanations for why firms get certified is because they 
may seek to ‘reinforce’ their present strategies thus further enhancing their competitive advantage. Another 
explanation can be due to marketing motivations or customer pressure (Buttle, 1997). This study seeks to explore the 
actual benefits and challenges the aerospace companies get from these certifications. 
Aerospace companies implement certain quality management and environmental standards, e.g. ISO 9001 and ISO 
14001 requirements specific to the aerospace industry. The International Organization for Standardization is a 
European body responsible for creating and maintaining international standards. It developed a set of quality 
standards, referred to as ISO 9000 and environmental standards, referred to as ISO 14000. These standards are made 
up of many subparts. This study will narrow the focus down to only ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards or 
derivatives to these that are specific to the aerospace industry. It will then explore how these companies deal with 
the compliance and investigate the challenges and benefits of it.

Abstract 
ISO 9001 is a popular topic in quality management research field. Many researchers have studied ISO 
9001 implementation in various sectors. However, there is lack of ISO 9001 study that focus on the 
content of ISO 9001 requirement. More specifically, there is lack of literature that discussed 
nonconforming services (NCS) control system in ISO 9001 implementation. On other side, controlling 
nonconforming outputs is one of ISO 9001:2015 requirements. In order to fill the gap in the literature, this 
research aims to design NCS control system for ISO 9001 implementation in a service company. The 
NCS that is controlled is all non-conforming outputs at all stages of service provision. This research 
applied qualitative research methodology by using case study approach. The object of case study is a 
company that provides laundry service. When the research is performed, the company was under process 
in implementing ISO 9001:2015. This research consists of four stages, namely setting process objectives 
and scope, data collection and existing NCS control system mapping, process analysis, and NCS control 
system formulation. The research result shows the NCS control system we developed for the research 
object. This paper will describe the content of the system and the research implications.

5. Conclusion
This research has built a NCS control system for ISO 9001 implementation in a service company. The design of the 
system was based on the results of the existing NCS control system analysis compared to ISO 9001: 2015 
requirements. The proposed NCS control system consists of a nonconforming service control procedure and a 
nonconforming service handling list. This research fills the gap in the literature that discussed nonconforming 
services (NCS) control system in ISO 9001 implementation and in practical terms, this paper provides a 
nonconforming service control system that can be utilized by the company and the methodology used in this paper 
can be a reference for others service company in designing the NCS control system or others system.

Abstract 
A Fundamental issue faced by Small Medium Enterprise (SME) in Indonesia is the increasingly 
competitive business competition. It is also occurred in the laundry service industry. In order to maintain 
the business or success in the business competition, SME laundry service company should focus on 
business key success factors. One of the key success factors is customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is 
important for the SME laundry service company to have a tool for monitoring customer’s satisfaction. 
This research aims to propose a customer satisfaction measurement system for SME laundry service 
company in Indonesia. The customer satisfaction measurement system can be used by the SME laundry 
service company to monitor its customer satisfaction. The research was conducted by three phases, i.e. (1) 
developing a customer satisfaction measurement system, (2) trial of the customer satisfaction 
measurement system, and (3) evaluating the customer satisfaction measurement system. We performed 
several data collection methods, i.e. literature review, observation, interview, company document study, 
and survey. The research results show that the customer satisfaction measurement system for SME 
laundry service company in Indonesia consists of two measurements type, namely (1) simple-measurement, 
and (2) complex-measurement. This paper will describe the system and the research implications.

Abstract 
The exponential Newell-Whitham (eNW) model, deﬁned by a differential equation with time-delay, is 
one of the most important models for traffic flow. In this presentation, we propose the ultradiscrete eNW 
model,which is a cellular-automaton model , by applying the ultradiscrete method to the eNW model. We 
first point out that there is a close relationship between the eNW model and the Lotka-Volterra (LV) 
equation, which is a soliton equation. The time-discrete analogue of the LV equation which keeps its 
integrability is well-known in the field of integrable systems. Considering these facts, we then give a 
time-discrete analogue of the eNW model. Furthermore, we present its exact solution using the bilinear 
method as well as Kanai and Tutiya did for the original eNW model. Also, since the ultradiscrete method 
can result in reducing soliton equations to cellular automata which inherit the solitonic nature such as an 
inﬁnite number of conservation laws and soliton solutions, we apply it to the discrete-time eNW model 
and its exact solution to obtain the ultradiscrete eNW model and its exact solution. Finally, we evaluate 
the validity of this model as a traffic flow model by conducting simulation.

Abstract 
Reservation and monitoring of facilities are some of the regular activities in management of facilities in 
academic institutions. However, there are similar problems being encountered by users such as 
identifying the available facilities that can be used, securing approval for request if signatories are not 
available or loss of documents mainly because the processes are being done manually. This paper presents 
the design of Facility Management System based on customer requirements. Using criteria analysis, 
technical specification alternatives were defined and the best option that will satisfy the customer 
requirements had been selected and incorporated in the design of the automated system. A prototype was 
made and tested to group of users. The results showed significant improvement in the reservation and 
monitoring processes in terms of the level of customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Facility, being one of the perceived components of quality education should be managed well. Nwagwu (1978) and 
Ogunsaju (1980) stated that the quality of education that children receive bears direct relevance to the availability or 
lack of physical facilities and overall atmosphere in which learning takes place. Research findings have also shown 
that students learn better when a combination of methods and materials are employed during teaching. Thus, 
education system requires the provision, maximum utilization and appropriate management of facilities. Advances 
in science and technology should be employed in facilities management (specifically, reservation and monitoring 
processes) of the universities to provide accurate, exhaustible and updated information. This can also be done 
through a centralized device and channel for communication among related parties such as students and 
administrative heads and staff. This study aimed to develop an automated information system that will aid in facility 
management and provide users satisfaction.  
The authors conducted the study in two of the engineering schools in the Philippines. Users are classified into two 
types: Type 1 Users or the students and Type 2 Users or the Facility Managers and laboratory technicians for both 
laboratories and common facilities such as seminar rooms. Three hundred ninety-eight (398) respondents were 
interviewed from University 1 and three hundred fifty four (354) were from University 2. Out of the total number of 
respondents from each institution, 20 were Type 2 Users. Both users were interviewed in order to assess their 
experience with the current processes, the areas for improvement and to get ideas on how the automated system is

The results of the survey showed that Type 1 and Type 2 Users from both Higher Education Institutions (HEI) gave 
the lowest rating to “Responsiveness” and “Competence” for the current system, respectively.  However, with the 
proposed system, it was observed that all performance categories for Type 1 and Type 2 Users from both HEIs 
showed an increase in performance ratings as compared to the current system.  Specifically, Responsiveness and 
Security obtained the highest ratings for Type 1 and Type 2 users from both HEIs, respectively.  This just showed 
that users were more satisfied in the performance of the proposed system in addressing their concerns.

4. Conclusion 
By using a customer-driven methodology, the researchers were able to come up with the proposed automated system 
that would satisfy the needs of the users. Criteria analysis aids in the selection of the best technology that will be 
used in the design of the Facility Management System. The evidence can be seen from the result of the test as they 
gave a higher rating to the proposed system.  Furthermore, a comparison of the processing time of the same process 
was done to show the difference of the performance of the current and proposed system. It was proved that 
employing an automated system for such transactions provide faster service to its users

Abstract 
Spatial models have attracted considerable interest in the recent economics and econometrics literature, 
both on an empirical and theoretical level. One of the most widely used spatial models is the single 
equation model. The following spatial simultaneous equation model can be viewed as an extension of the 
widely used spatial single equation model and can uses more than one equations. Generalized Spatial 
three Stage Least Square (GS3SLS) estimator is more efficient than the Other spatial simultaneous model. 
GS3SLS with weighted matrix as an invers from Distance can give best model than other weighted 
matrix. By using GS3SLS it can be concluded that there is a relationship of Unemployment Rate and 
economic growth in East Java.

Abstract 
ERP has attracted phenomenal interest in the recent years. Actually, an ERP System is considered 
as a backbone of most organizations across all the industries. It will usually cover all business 
functions on all management levels, supporting most or all functional areas in the daily operations 
of the enterprise, and it is considered as a source of competitive advantage for some organizations, 
if the system is set up at the right way. However, the chance of failure has always been high. Today, 
many companies fail to realize the full benefits of ERP systems due to their negligence of some 
aspects of management and implementation. Finally, the result is either the improvement of the 
performance or on the contrary a slowdown because of its powerful concept. 
To answer that we tried to do a literature review of “the implementation and management of ERP 
systems”. we have selected a certain number of papers of work published between 2010 and 2017 
(1st September) . It seeks to define the general topics, to address some issues related to 
implementation and management of ERP , and point out overall trends.  
Keywords: 
ERP literature review; ERP system; ERP implementation; ERP management. Supply Chain Management. 
1. Introduction:
The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a software solution that has been conceived to unify all 
information systems of all departments into a single integrated system that manages all of functional areas in a 
company such as financial and cost accounting, planning and manufacturing, sales and marketing, materials 
management, human resource management, distribution and transportation. It is considered as a backbone of the 
information systems in an enterprise, and it supports all parts of business processes by providing flow of information 
between all business functions on all levels within an enterprise. ERP system offers a competitive advantage 
especially in terms on the value of the information; according to Abd Elmonem et al. (2017) “Sharing data and 
information between enterprise departments helps in many aspects and aims to achieve different objectives”. 
During the 1990’s, ERP system was regarded as one of the major information technology (IT) innovation. 
The concept of ERP systems traced its roots to the emergence of inventory management systems around the 1960’s, 
MRP systems in the 1970’s and MRPII systems in the 1980’s. However, there have been many fluctuations in the 
world of ERP systems. The Panorama consulting solutions report (2017) shows that the choice of 67% organizations 
remains focused on the traditional ERP with an increase of 11% over 2016,  compared to the new innovations of 
ERP vendors such as SaaS or Cloud ERP that are chosen only by 27% and 6% of organizations, respectively . 
Despite these changes and from the same report, SAP is still leading the market of ERP (20.3% of market share) 
with others historical key vendors such as Oracle (13.9% of market share) and Microsoft (9.4% of market share). 
The need for rapidity, flexibility and transparency for access to information led to a rapid and permanent change of 
these systems, which explains their evolution throughout history. 
A wide volume of research focused on the ERP exists in the literature. This article will facilitate continuity 
of research from some previous articles. Schlichter and Kraemmergaard (2010) analyzed abstracts from 885

Abstract 
In the present modern technological driven production scenario, most of the suppliers are having basic 
capabilities and possess necessary competencies to qualify the selection process. Hence for decision 
makers, selection of right suppliers based on elementary criteria is a challenging task. Therefore there is a 
need of identification of some criteria (Attractive Criteria) that will help not only decision makers in 
selection of suppliers but also will increase the satisfaction level. In this work Fuzzy Kano model has 
been applied for selection criteria classification and identification of Attractive criteria. Fuzzification of 
Kano model has been done for capturing the vagueness of decision makers. Further Step-wise Weight 
Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method has been used to 
assign influential weights to attractive criteria. Finally, Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives 
(COPRAS) MCDM technique has been applied for supplier’s assessment through Attractive criteria. For 
the illustration the efficacy of proposed work, a case study of Indian Iron and Steel plant of central India 
has been considered in which seven suppliers are selected for evaluation. It is observed that supplier 4 has 
highest utility values.

1. Introduction
Qualified and potential suppliers helps in deciding the competitive position of industry in market and also aids in 
maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers (Banaeian et al., 2016; Jain and Singh, 2017). With right 
suppliers, industries also achieves manifold advantages such as production cost reduction, enhanced product quality, 
improved customer satisfaction, minimum lead time, increased profitability and so on (Jain and Singh, 2014). Thus 
selection of qualified suppliers is a strategic and critical activity performed by purchase department of organization 
(Kannan et al., 2013). Selection of right supplier depends on many diversified factors/criteria such as value for 
money, quality of product supplied, after sale services etc. (Chai and Liu, 2014). Thus supplier selection process is 
A Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)  problem because selection criteria’s are quantitative, qualitative and 
conflicting in nature (Jain et al., 2016, 2013). Figueira et al., (2005) reported criteria analysis, choice, ranking and 
sorting as the four main aspects of MCDM and emphasised the importance of criteria in decision making process. In 
literature authors have proposed different supplier selection methodologies based over various criteria (Boer et al., 
2001; Dickson, 1966; Ware et al., 2012). From literature review it is observed selection of criteria for supplier 
selection has been mostly done on the basis of literature review and decision maker’s involvement is less. Further it 
is also seen that most of the authors have considered traditional criteria as reported by Dickson (1966). However

Abstract 
Airports are expanding their facilities in respond to increasing number of passengers. 
Airport connectivity is one of indicators to evaluate airport performance. Airport connectivity can 
be define as the airline network of airport, related to frequency of flight and number of flights from 
origin to destination. Airport with good connectivity is attractive for passengers. This paper aimed 
to evaluate airport connectivity of medium sized airports in Thailand, which are Sakon Nakhon 
airport (SNO), Nakhon Phanom airport (KOP), Nannakhon airport (NNT), Phitsanulok airport 
(PHS) and Trang airport (TST) by using NETSCAN model during October, 2017. It was found 
that Phitsanulok airport (PHS) has the highest connectivity unit, with more frequency of flights.

1. Introduction
Air transportation is one of the important factors of life quality improvement. It plays an important role in 
the economy and society of the world. It is a convenient, faster and safer transportation service than other mode of 
transportation. Nowadays, air transportation industry is growing rapidly, and customer are attractive to travel by air 
more than the past. Air transportation industry in Thailand also expands their capacity to fulfill the customer need. 
There are six airports that operated by Airports of Thailand Public Company Limited (AOT) and twenty-seven airports 
operated by the Department of Airports Thailand (DOA). According to Figure 1, the number of passengers that 
travelling by air in Thailand has increased 123% within this decade, there were 60 million passengers in 2010 and 139 
million in 2016 (AOT and DOA, 2017). This phenomena emphasize the importance of air transportation in this decade 
with a bright future for business extension. The main players of the air transportation in supply chain encompasses 
aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, ground services and related industry. The airport serves the service for aircraft 
take-off, landing, passenger embarking and disembarking. To fulfil the customer satisfaction, the airports need to 
improve their performance of service quality, operational performance, airport connectivity and their facilities.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the airport connectivity of medium airports in Thailand, which are 
Sakon Nakhon airport (SNO), Nakhon Phanom airport (KOP), Nannakhon airport (NNT), Phitsanulok airport (PHS) 
and Trang airport (TST). The destination of medium airports is Don Muang Airport only, because the medium airports 
are operating only domestic flights and the flight distance is not too long, therefore the indirect connection is not 
necessary. The direct connection which is flown directly from origin to destination is attractive for passengers than a 
flight with transfer at intermediate airport. Because the medium airports operate only direct connection, thus the value 
of quality index of every connection from medium airports to Don Muang Airport is closer to 1, it represents the routes 
are attractive for passengers. 
 
The connectivity unit can measuring the attractiveness of the airport and can define the competitive position 
of airline networks. The future study might select the airport which has many destination into account. The airport and 
airline can apply the airport connectivity concept to plan the strategy to improve the airline networks.

Abstract 
The usual vehicle scheduling problem is a static vehicle scheduling problem (S-VSP) problem where the 
scheduling problem assumes a fixed travel time. While the traffic situation is crowded in urban areas, can 
cause travel time is dynamic. This may result in delays in departure hours of existing public transport. 
Therefore, it is necessary to make a vehicle scheduling by considering the dynamic situation. This study 
will discuss the problem of scheduling public transport vehicles taking into account dynamic travel time or 
dynamic vehicle scheduling problem (D-VSP) uses a mathematical model in the form of quasi-assignment 
issues. Based on the research, it can be concluded that the scheduling of public transportation of city which 
is a dynamic vehicle scheduling problem (DVSP) problem can be modeled as quasi-assignment problem 
and solved by auction algorithm approach. If implemented on the issue on the route under investigation 
with some assumptions made, then the results obtained are 38 vehicles with a total operational cost of + $ 
800,- each day. Despite the addition of vehicles, the solution remains optimal due to losses in passenger 
waiting time is not long. This can benefit the company because it can get long-term of customer loyalty.

Abstract 
This study demonstrates how early project management performance may predict project 
completion time prior to project execution. Using 109 capital projects and a longitudinal design, 
we develop a measurement model based on project management performance in the project 
initiation and planning phases. Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis identifies key 
determinants in the project initiation and planning phases that affect the durations of completed 
projects. A time series robust regression forecasting model on the longitudinal data further shows 
that a combination of 20 metrics from the project management performance measurement model 
reveals high estimation accuracy and relatively small estimation differences in in-sample and 
out-of-sample data. Out-of-sample validation demonstrates that the forecasting model provides a 
reasonably good overall estimation rate of 85.49%. Ultimately, our findings suggest that project 
management performance in the initiation and planning phases explains an important part of 
project duration and, more significantly, is a useful predictor of project time performance.

Abstract 
Increase in industrialization and transportation of different equipments all over the world in all sectors 
led to the increasing demand of vehicles.[3] To run these vehicles mostly Diesel engines are used. But 
due to the scarcity of petroleum based fuel like Diesel, it is necessary to go for the fuels other than 
conventional fuels which will require little or no engine modification. Again the fuel should be 
economical as well as environment friendly in order to follow the stringent emission norms. In this 
context waste tyre pyrolsis oil is the most emerging fuel which is tested to evaluate the performance 
analysis with Diesel fuel in Single cylinder water cooled variable compression ratio type Diesel engine. 
Tests were carried out with 100% Diesel and then 10%, and 50% of tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO) blended with 
Diesel fuel (DF) for different loading conditions. It is observed that the brake power, indicated power as 
well as Brake mean effective pressure(BMEP) increased when diesel blended with tyre pyrolysis oil at 
higher loads while friction power decreases with increase in TPO concentration in the blend as well as 
with increase in load. The variation of Brake thermal efficiency with load was also observed and it 
is found the tyre blends D75% + TPO25% shows maximum thermal efficiency than other blends 
with diesel. Again engine can run without any modification with addition of 50 % TPO by volume with 
Diesel  
Keywords : Tyre Pyrolysis oil, Diesel fuel, Brake Power ,Friction Power ,BMEP 
1. Introduction
 Due to the fuel crisis, hike in oil prize and stringent emission norms there is initiative all over the world 
to replace gasoline and diesel fuel. Number of researchers are working on different alternative fuels.[7]. 
The focused technologies in this context are bio-ethanol, bio-diesel, waste oil recycling, pyrolysis, 
gasification, dimethyl ether and biogas. Various alternative bio-diesels such as rice bran oil, waste 
cooking oil, have also been researched upon for their suitability as a diesel blend. Rapid growth of 
vehicles also generating large number of tyres which after use should be disposed properly. But the 
disposal of waste tyres from automobile vehicles is becoming more and more complex and world is 
facing to another major problem is the waste management.[4] Since waste management problem is 
concerned to every metropolitan cities and small cities ,appropriate waste management strategy is 
important aspect of sustainable development.  
 
Pyrolysis of waste tyres produces oil which can be used in the engines and it is the most emerging 
alternative fuel in this regard. From the investigation, there are many materials from the waste have

4.5.Variation of Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) Vs Load 
 
The variations of Brake Mean Effective Pressure with Load under various blends are shown in 
figure 6.From the plot it is observed that BMEP increases with increase in the load. Again with 
increase in the TPO concentration, BMEP increase at higher load compared to the rise at lower 
loads.

Conclusions 
 The brake power is increased when diesel blended with tyre pyrolysis oil. 
  Brake power found to be increased with increase in the loads as well as TPO 
concentration in the blend.  
 Friction power is found to be increasing up to certain load but decrease at higher loads. 
With increase in the TPO concentration in the blend, friction power increase and then 
decreases.  
 Indicated power found to be increased with increase in the loads but with increase in the 
TPO concentration in the blend, indicated power is found to be decreased in the blend. 
 Brake mean effective pressure increases with increase in the loads. With increase in the 
TPO concentration in the blend, BMEP decrease at lower load but increases at higher 
load. 
 The variation of Brake thermal efficiency with load was also observed and it is found the 
tyre blends D75% + TPO25% shows maximum thermal efficiency than diesel as calorific 
value tyre oil is more than diesel and less viscosity 
 All the Diesel +TPO blends are suitable for diesel engine without any engine 
modification.

Discrete Wavelet Packet Based Spectrum Sensing in 
Cognitive Radio using an Improved Adaptive Threshold

Abstract 
Thresholding is a very important technique in the detection of spectrum holes in cognitive radios. It is the 
benchmark by which a cognitive radio decides if a spectrum hole is present or not in a given frequency 
spectrum. However, the method by which a cognitive radio computes the threshold for any given scenario 
can be quite a challenge in terms of accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Fixed thresholds are less 
cumbersome to implement, but they are characterized by undesirable sensitivity and performance issues 
in the radio environment in which the cognitive radio operates due to uncertainty in noise level. On the 
other hand, adaptive thresholds give superior performance to fixed thresholds due to their ability to adjust 
their computational parameters in response to changes in the cognitive radio environment. In this paper, 
we present a discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio with 
an improved adaptive threshold in terms of speed. The approach developed in this paper halves the 
number of computations needed to determine the adaptive threshold for each sub-band channel in a 
discrete wavelet packet transform. The results obtained show the method is efficient, fast, and dynamic in 
response to the variations in the cognitive radio environment.

1.0 Introduction 
The electromagnetic spectrum is a unique natural resource which is at the core of the operation 
of wireless technology and devices. It is a resource that is reusable by wireless transceiver 
systems which are licensed by government agencies based on certain conditions and criteria. 
Like any other natural resource, the electromagnetic spectrum is certainly finite. This limitation 
poses a great challenge in the presence of the ever-increasing wireless devices and applications 
which place a high demand on the available electromagnetic spectrum [1]. One candidate 
solution in literature is the cognitive radio (CR) technology which operates through a cognitive 
cycle [2-4] shown in Figure 1[2] in order to mitigate this problem. The cognitive radio cycle 
consists of three major components:

6.0 Conclusion 
In this paper, we explored the norm of the Euclidean distance between two vectors that 
characterize the terminal sub-bands of the DWPT. This vector was used as the basis for the 
improvement of a DWPT thresholding technique. The improvement achieved was in terms of 
speed of calculation required to compute the adaptive threshold for all sub-band channels at a 
given level of decomposition. The results and analysis of this approach showed that the accuracy 
of the proposed scheme with respect to increase in SNR was as expected.

Abstract 
Problems that appear in a company that produces refined sugar, the production floor has not reached 
the level of critical machine availability because it often suffered damage (breakdown). This results in 
a sudden loss of production time and production opportunities. This problem can be solved by 
Reliability Engineering method where the statistical approach to historical damage data is performed 
to see the pattern of the distribution. The method can provide a value of reliability, rate of damage, 
and availability level, of an machine during the maintenance time interval schedule. The result of 
distribution test to time inter-damage data (MTTF) flexible hose component is lognormal distribution 
while component of teflon cone lifthing is weibull distribution. While from distribution test to mean 
time of improvement (MTTR) flexible hose component is exponential distribution while component 
of teflon cone lifthing is weibull distribution. The actual results of the flexible hose component on the 
replacement schedule per 720 hours obtained reliability of 0.2451 and availability 0.9960. While on 
the critical components of teflon cone lifthing actual on the replacement schedule per 1944 hours 
obtained reliability of 0.4083 and availability 0.9927.

Abstract 
As the international trading competition has begun to arise, Batik Small Medium Industry (SMI) needs to 
maintain and improve its competitiveness by exploring the innovations that can generate value added to 
batik product. Although many studies provided suggestions regarding innovation for batik industry, 
there’s problem in determining which innovation is bringing important value added. Moreover, many 
Batik SMI players have lack of knowledge about value creation in performing innovation. This study 
attempts to determine which innovation should be prioritized for batik SMI based on value chain in batik 
production processes. The first step is determining activities in Batik SMI then divided the activities into 
primary and support activities. The next step was identifying possible innovation opportunities through 
systematic literature review where 8 innovations were obtained. The innovations then mapped to Value 
Chain Activities model. The innovation related to primary activity is suggested to be prioritized. This 
study indicates that the use of natural coloring material, the application of electric stove and solar home

haven’t defined in this study. Moreover, this study performed qualitative study both in mapping the activities 
and the innovation to VCA model and the determination of innovation priority. Future study can calculate the 
rank of the innovation to obtain the rank of priority using analytical hierarchy process, factor rating, or any 
other method and compare the result with the result obtained from VCA model.

Abstract 
Piper retrofractum is a raw material of herbal medicine in Indonesia, especially in Madura. Marginal and 
small farmers have important rule in the herbs supply network. Synergy between stakehoders in the 
supply network build significant result in increasing supply network performance. This paper presents a 
conceptual framework of Piper retrofractum supply chain performance. Socio-technical system was 
applied to identify criteria of the supply network performance. Analyzing supply network performance 
requires better understanding and implementation of system approach. The initial conceptual framework 
provided in this paper could support stakeholders, including government in managing network and 
increasing benefit of Piper retrofractum for economic and social welfare.  
Keywords:  
Conceptual framework, Piper retrofractum, supply network, performance 
1. Introduction
The government of Indonesia is currently undergoing a significant development to increase conservation and need of 
natural resources in herbal medicine that is reflected in the agribusiness policy. Tight competition in the 
international market, need to deal with the long-term focus of development that should be directed towards 
increasing research capability and development. It is also important to build the synergy between farmers, 
entrepreneurs, and government of Indonesia throught an optimum supply network performance. The success or the 
failure of agribusiness development in the future needs support of stakeholders in order to determine the task and 
function between them. Supply network management in herbal medicine industries has been implemented through 
the paternalistic system of supplier relation. Long-term relationship with suppliers has dominantly influenced in 
supply network performance. However, long-term relationships have lacks of information sharing, risk sharing, and 
activities sharing. Indonesian traditional medicines companies’ state propagating policy of Bapak-anak (Father-
Child) relations between firms, in which large firms help the small ones to strengthen the Indonesian economy 
(Mangestuti, Subehan, Widyawaruyanti A., Zaidi A.F.H, 2007).  
Jamu is an indigenous herbal medicine of Indonesia. It is complex mixture of herbs and widely used throughout 
Indonesia, especially in Java and Madura islands. Maduranese Jamu, or Jamu Madura is one of the famous kinds of 
traditional medicine in Indonesia. Historically, Jamu Madura was secret traditional medicine for a Sultanate of 
Madura. After the end of royal period in 20th century, the secret ingredients of Jamu Madura become familiar among 
ordinary people and the herb is manufactured in companies and home industries (Mangestuti, Subehan, 
Widyawaruyanti A., Zaidi A.F.H, 2007). One of cultivation plant that has many benefits in Madura’s herbal 
medicine raw material, is Cabe Jawa (Piper retrofractum). A high quality of herbal medicinal production made from 
Cabe Jawa could be obtained by an adequate supporting of provision upstream technology (Ruhnayat, Muljati, & 
Haryudin W., 2011). There has been a global increasing in the use of traditional medicine in both developed and 
developing countries in the last decade. Therefore certain forms of traditional medicine play an important role in 
health care and health sector reform globally (WHO, 2010).

2013). In addition, the constraints would then be the areas that the research institution and policy makers could focus 
on in order to assist industry development with the greatest potential for improving the supply networks’ 
profitability.

Industries or organizations serve the needs of stakeholders by ensuring that their expectations and needs are realized. 
Therefore Industries or organizations that does not meet expectations of influential stakeholders is not likely to be 
regarded as successful, even if it remains within the original time, budget and scope. Effective decision makers 
require keen analytical and intuitive skills to identify high-impact and cumulative impact stakeholders and work 
with them to understand their expectations to achieve goal. These activities are managing a process that maximizes 
stakeholders positive input and minimize any potential detrimental impact. In order to define and get potential value 
that brought by solution, stakeholders must be brought together in a joint process to define potential solution when 
seeking higher level of performance (Klassen & Vereecke, 2012).  
5. Conclusion
The use of herbal medicine in both developed and developing countries has been increasing over the last decade. 
Therefore certain forms of herbal medicines play an important role in healthcare and global reform in the health 
sector (World Health Organization (WHO), 2010). The WHO estimates that over 80% of the world’s population 
relies on herbal plant-based medicine for their primary health care needs and the trade will be up to US$50 trillion 
by 2050 (Booker, Johnston, & Heinrich, 2012). Supply network has appropriate rule and stages in decision making 
process. However, it is important to analyze the performance of supply network implementation since each of 
components in supply network gives crucial effect in supply network decision making. The analyzing supply 
network performance requires better understanding and implementation of system approach in identifying, 
analyzing, controlling and improving problematic situation in development. Therefore, the application of socio-
technical system in generating a conceptual framework of supply network performance in piper retrofractum 
especialy from marginal and small framers has been in line with the current needs of the stakeholders and support 
government in policy arragement.

Abstract 
In improving the quality management system, the testing laboratory uses the ISO / IEC 17025 standard as 
a benchmark for the general requirements of testing / calibration competence, including sampling. This 
standard is also used for quality, administrative and technical activities. Customer laboratories, regulators 
and accreditation bodies may also use them to confirm or acknowledge the competence of the laboratory. 
The application of standards in laboratory testing is closely related to achieving the quality objectives 
contained in the laboratory. By using the standard ISO / IEC 17025 then the resulting product is guaranteed 
security, reliable and certainly has a quality that no doubt. Testing laboratory can be said to run effectively 
when it can manage or manage flexibility, customer, production, value-oriented, and the main job of its 
employees. Therefore, the analysis of the effectiveness of ISO / IEC 17025 implementation takes an 
important role for the testing laboratory. The Focus Group Discussion (FGD) method consisting of several 
competent assessors is instrumental in assessing any clauses related to the effectiveness of ISO 
implementation.

The six main clauses obtained from discussions with the 5 (five) Assessor of the National Accreditation 
Committee related to the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 17025 implementation provide an illustration that a good and 
effective quality management system cannot be separated from the consistency of the implementation of international 
standards designated for testing or calibration laboratories 
 
4. Conclusion 
Quality management systems in laboratory based on ISO/IEC 17025 will be effectively work when some of 
the key factors in the effectiveness clause can be well executed, including organization, management system, 
management review, personnel, testing methods and quality assurance of test results. The management and technical 
clause becomes the assessment parameter how the laboratory can achieve its operational objectives.

Global warming has triggered public concern for 
environmental protection. Given this trend, carbon 
emission evaluation and improvement become a 
critical management in many companies. However, 
the developing of such kind of a model is very 
complicated, considering regulations, process, and 
platform to register and many other problems 
managers have to deal with. The complex process 
makes carbon emission management a very difficult 
issue. This research is to integrate green design and 
life cycle assessment (LCA) and builds up a feasible 
model- low carbon value chain model (LCVCM)- 
for assessing and improving carbon emission on a 
case product. The implementation method involves 
four steps: “Scoping the process of product”, 
“Analyzing carbon emission on each process”, 
“Simulating carbon Impact”, and “ Targeting and 
Improving the Product”. From the result, the carbon 
footprints are significantly reduced. LCVCM drives 
an original product from a less green into a greener 
and more eco-efficient product. After years of efforts, 
the standard quantity of carbon emission will be 
clearly taken into consideration by green product 
development. This model is created which enabling 
many organizations to improve their carbon 
emissions. It also supports organizations to find the 
balance 
between 
environment 
and 
economics

I.  Introduction 
 
 The modern acceleration of global warming, 
attributed primarily to anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions and blamed for extreme weather patterns and 
weather-induced natural disasters, draws prodigious 
attention of both governments and scientists the world 
over [1]. From intensifying focus upon global warming, 
two interlocking sources of pressure have evolved which 
now bind the world economy. First, the limits of the 
natural world could constrain business operations, realign 
markets, and perhaps even threaten the planet's well-being. 
Second, enterprises face a growing spectrum of 
stakeholders who are concerned about the environment. 
Those who best meet and find solutions to these challenges 
will lead the competitive pack [2]. Green designs in 
reducing carbon emissions are generally efficient when life 
cycle assessment (LCA) is employed during the design 
stage since all possible carbon emissions factors from 
inputs, manufacturing processes, distribution, use, and 
disposal are calculated and optimized during design. 
Materials selection and carbon management are two core 
principles of green design strategies in developing low 
carbon supply chains, because prevention is better than 
cure. During the design stage, careful selection of raw 
materials and ecological manufacture has advanced 
impacts and therefore also has the potential to significantly 
reduce an environmental shock [3]. By employing green 
design strategy, companies produce less scrap and less 
pollution. In short, green products are efficient, easy to 
assemble, easy to manufacture, and, above all, superior 
designs. In recent years, LCA has been utilized in a variety 
of applications, such as automotive design, manufacturing 
systems, and consumer product design.  
Our research integrates green design strategies and 
LCA principle to develop a low carbon value chain 
methodology. Such an analysis can provide valuable 
information related to complete processes and also provide 
information about how to reduce the carbon emissions of a 
product. The paper is organized into five sections. Section 
2 reviews green design strategy. Section 3 presents the low 
carbon value chain model for integrating green design

The backplane results in a major portion of the 
overall carbon footprint. Therefore, substitution of 
polluting materials with less polluting ones is a sensible 
strategy to reduce pollution and remain competitive. 
According to green design strategy, this case substitutes an 
alternate material for the backplane modular component.

As observed in table 3, the measure of emissions 
resulting with green design (6.403563 kg) is less than that 
without green design (34.6547 kg). This green design 
method can reduce carbon emissions by 28 kg. Fig 5 
highlights the differences between the two approaches. 
 
Global manufacturers face the challenge of reducing 
carbon emissions and protecting our earth. If a consumer 
has to make a choice between a polluting and a 
nonpolluting product, assuming the two products are equal 
in all other regards such as features, quality, cost, 
functionality, cosmetic appeal, etc., he is likely to choose a 
nonpolluting one. Hence a manufacturer of a polluting 
product is likely to lose market share in the long run. All 
product producers are responsible for designing and 
manufacturing green products with minimized carbon 
footprints. When manufacturers are dedicated to the 
reduction of carbon footprints, the sale of green products 
enhances their competitiveness and brand reputation. The 
low carbon value chain model based on green strategy 
presents a significant correlation between materials chosen 
and carbon reduction.  
Using the above strategies, this study divides the 
reduction of carbon footprints into two scenarios. The first 
scenario uses traditional materials, but the carbon footprint 
is higher.  The second scenario replaces traditional 
materials with alternate materials and produces a low 
carbon footprint. According to the result, the methods used 
for reducing the carbon footprint of the TFT LCD include 
enhancing ecological efficiency and lowering the carbon 
footprints attributed to specific materials. Simultaneously, 
as demonstrated by the research result and review of 
relevant literature and technical reports, Figure 5 shows 
that a green design strategy is effective in reducing the 
carbon footprint of a TFT LCD.

V.  Conclusion 
 
 Global warming has prompted nations to pay 
more 
attention 
to 
ecological 
protection, 
resource 
integration, and laws dedicated to carbon emissions 
regulation. 
If 
companies 
can 
develop 
innovative 
approaches to provide low carbon products, the 
performance will reflect significantly on reputation and 
market share. Therefore, low carbon value design is an 
innovative perspective for manufacturers to maximize core 
competitiveness and minimize environmental shocks. This 
paper constructs a low carbon design model (LCVCM) 
based on green design strategy. LCA is used to define and 
estimate all product components resulting in carbon 
footprints. Simultaneously, the simulation tool has been 
applied to test product components and clarify the optimal 
low carbon improvement, calculating for the various 
interacting factors.  
 
This paper provides a preliminary study to help 
corporations accurately assess and reduce the carbon 
footprints of mass customized green products. It drives an 
original product from a less green into a greener and more 
eco-efficient 
product. 
The 
implementation 
method 
involves four steps: “Scoping the process of product”, 
“Analyzing carbon emission on each process of whole life 
cycle ”, “Simulating carbon Impact”, and “ Targeting and 
Improving the Product”. A model is created accordingly to 
support the carbon reduction. From the result of this case 
study, the carbon footprints are significantly reduced. In 
addition, this model also presents simulations with two 
scenarios and explores how the design-effective method 
can reduce the carbon footprint.  The result of the analysis 
demonstrates 
that 
the 
connection 
between carbon 
footprints and the green component life-cycle design is 
interrelated.  
 
According to the results, the green design strategy is 
appropriate for the carbon emission issues and the 
proposed model serves as an adequate base for analyzing 
carbon emissions of similar products in a larger context. 
This paper expects that the industry understands clearly","the global effects related to its decisions and encourages 
companies to realize that pollution-prevention activities 
must be initiated. Further work will extend to green 
production system application and consider the issue of 
multi-objective optimization under a green design 
mechanism. 
 
After years of efforts, the standard quantity of carbon 
emission can now be clearly considered in the green 
product development.  It is clear that many organizations 
were willing to adapt green design, green life cycle 
analysis and 3R (recycle, reuse, and reduction) under this 
new trend. A more active carbon model is created which 
enabling many organizations to improve their processes 
and to reduce carbon emissions thereafter.

Abstract 
Spatial patterns are useful but also lead to violation of independence assumption in global dependence 
models. In social studies, spatial information can provide the pattern of poverty. Welfare research is 
important but has limitations in sample adequacy, thus small area estimation method is an alternative. 
Classic Small Area Estimation (SAE) only includes spatial information as a random effect but another 
method use the spatial information as covariate which known as Spatial SAE.  However, the relationship 
between the response variable and the auxiliary variables may not be linear either in the original scale or 
in a transformed scale. So that, geoadditive model accommodate that non linear relationship. The 
objective of this paper is to determine household expenditure in Bangka Belitung province on 2017 by the 
best fit spatial model. This paper found out that the best fit model is geoadditive with the significant 
auxiliary variables are distance to district center and spatial information.

Abstract 
Indonesian Red Cross is one of the appointed organizations by the Indonesian government to circulate 
and manage blood distribution. Blood is a perishable product due to its short lifetime. Therefore good 
management is crucial in achieving optimal blood supply. Reaching the optimal balance point of supply 
and demand has been a major challenge and risk that often occurs in the supply chain. The purpose of this 
research is designing a strategy mitigation action to risk agents in blood supply chain. It is aimed to 
minimize the level of risk that affects blood supply. The approach taken to achieve these objectives is an 
observation of risk agents that occur in each supply chain. The method used in this research is House of 
Risk. Application of the method will result in an Effectiveness to Difficulty Ratio value on Preventive 
Action. Preventive Action is designed and customized based on the risk agents occurrence. The results of 
this study indicate that there are eleven risk agents which are needed to be treated in prioritization by 
seven possible mitigation actions. It is expected that the mitigation action could be a help in suppressing 
risk agents of blood supply chain flow.

1. INTRODUCTION
Supply Chain Management activities is a crucial part of an organization’s business process since it involves 
all stakeholders, starting from suppliers, manufacturing companies, to its customers (Kusnindah, et al., 2014). 
Nowadays, the focus on an organization starts to shift. It is not only focused on the products created, but rather on 
the whole process, from procurement to on-time delivery, which is also valued by the customer. Indonesian Red 
Cross (Palang Merah Indonesia/PMI), as a non-profit organization, is working toward that goal. PMI starts to 
focused on the whole process of blood management, including blood supply chain management. 
Blood itself is body fluid that delivers necessary substance in human body, thus plays a critical role for 
human life, especially in near-death experience such as accident or emergency situation. Blood is categorized as a 
perishable product due to its relatively short lifespan. Depended on blood product type, it has varied lifespan. Whole 
Blood and Packed Red Cells are expired in ± 30 days, platelets is expired in ± 5 days), Frozen Plasma is expired in ± 
6 months, while Wash Red Cells is expired in ± 4 days. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good management in 
achieving optimum blood supply (Stanger, et al., 2012). Achieving balance point between blood supply and demand 
is a challenge that is needed to overcome and remains as the main risk that often occurs in blood supply chain. 
During this past 6 years, the number of blood donors in PMI at Kabupaten Sleman has increased in each year, from

4. CONCLUSIONS
This paper result is aimed to solve supply chain risk of PMI. Here is the conclusion that could be drawn based on the 
HOR model process for problem illustrated previously: 
1.
There are 28 Risk Events and 37 Risk Agents that have been identified. Based on the calculation of House
of Risk phase 1, there are 11 risk agents that counted in the priority category, ranked by the highest value
for handling. Those 11 risk agents are; uncertain blood demand from hospital or other PMI (1428),
occurrence of natural disasters on the route traversed (1134), donor health donor (784), natural disaster
occurred in a region (756), transport disturbance (684), uncertainty donor (486), absence of definite blood
safety stock (396), RS did not want any BDRS (304), employee inaccuracy in blood selection (300),
storage takes too long to exceed the expired blood limit (270), bad weather conditions (256).
2.
In House of Risk phase 2, preventive action that is needed to be carried out based on the risk agents
handling priority are; collaborating with other PMI (74376), managing mass donor activities (63040),
adding blood storage (49572), maximizing SIMUDDA usage (47304), improving communication with
suppliers (36264), improving communication with RS (33156), and improving service standards (10800).

Abstract 
Airports open their doors to visitors and investors from around the world, crucially boosting the 
economy, trade, investment, and tourism of countries throughout the world. This paper aimed to 
categorize service quality factors used in the service evaluation of three regional airports in Thailand were 
used on case study. The factors of airport service quality were accumulated through literature review 
survey of service satisfaction from 300 passengers. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was then deployed 
and in a used to analyze the data from the survey to categorize into sub-factors. Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) was also used to evaluate the weight factors via pairwise comparison. Findings of this 
research provide the key factors of service quality for aviation authorities and airport administrators to 
raise service level in their respective airports.

1. Introduction
By 2035, it is expected that number of aviation passengers will reach 7.2 billion globally (The International 
Air Transport Association, 2016). With rising demand from passengers, the market competition will continue to be 
highly aggressive in the aviation industry. Not only airlines but also airports have to strive to be more competitive in 
term of service quality to survive in the market.  To deliver superior service quality in accordance with customer 
expectations, understanding about the service is the key to success and survival (Gilbert and Wong, 2003). It is 
generally believed that higher service quality can contribute to the higher overall customer satisfaction and provide a 
long-term competitive advantage (Chen, 2008). Thus, airports must be able to meet the passenger demand for air 
transport.  
In Thailand, between 2015 and 2016, the tourism industry contributed to the growth in the passenger 
traffic.  According to the Airports of Thailand (AOT), AOT-managed airports handled over 121.7 million 
passengers in 2016, increasing from 109.8 million in 2015. There were 790,194 aircraft movements (takeoffs and 
landings) in 2016 versus 727,750 movements in 2015.  
The objective of this study is to categorize service quality factors for the evaluation of airport service 
quality of the three selected airports operated under AOT in different regions of Thailand namely Chiang Mai 
(CNX), Don Mueang (DMK), and Phuket (HKT). Service quality factors will be accumulated from literature review 
and used in the satisfaction survey of 300 passengers at these airports in terms of service quality. The Exploratory 
Factor Analysis (EFA), which is a statistical method widely used for group categorization, will be employed to 
analyze the data from the survey to categorize the factors into sub-factors. In addition, the Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) will be used to evaluate the weight factors via pairwise comparison.

ABSTRACT 
Road traffic accidents involving motorcycles have been seen to have an upward trend in the Philippines. 
Previous study by Flores, Gotohio and Paras (2008) was the first and only study that considered linking 
motorcycle accidents with environmental and personal factors: age, lighting conditions, traffic movement, 
weather conditions, road character, junction type, time, day, surface conditions and driver behavior. The study 
fails to expound on the concept of driving behavior as well as failed to include the personality of the driver. 
The independent variables of the study are driver personality and riding behavior while the dependent variable 
is accident involvement. The chosen method to analyze the data is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The 
scope of the study would only be in Metro Manila the capital of the Philippines. The purpose of the study is 
to determine the relationships of driver personality and riding behavior factors as well as to predict accident 
involvement using the same factors. The findings of the study suggest that normlessness has an inverse 
relationship with accident involvement, while self-assertiveness, speeding, rule-violations and anger all 
exhibit a direct relationship. 
Keywords: predictive model; Structural Equation Modeling (SEM); motorcycle accidents 
1. INTRODUCTION
Driver behavior, mainly aggressive driving increases the likelihood of a motorcyclist getting into an accident. 
According to Angelito Vergel de Dios, executive director of the MMDA Traffic Operations Center (2006, as 
cited in Flores, et al., 2008), the continuous increase in motorcycle accidents roots from the motorcyclists 
driving on the curb, the sidewalk, and just continuously swerve and zig-zag their way through traffic. Driving 
style or driving behavior of either handling a motorcycle or a standard four- wheeled vehicle could be a factor 
that yields to a road traffic accident. A study conducted by Sabbour et al. (2010) focused on analyzing the 
driving behaviors of students in relation to driving accidents. Driving behavior or style included: driving with 
excessive speed, deviance, calmness, concentration, violations, usage of safety belt, participation in risky 
conditions etc. The results of their study indicated that driving style and driving behavior were significantly 
higher among males and the factors were indeed significant in the involvement of such road traffic accidents. 
In order to create a more accurate and detailed predictive model, the factors considered significant would be 
included, wherein driver behavior would be further delved upon, as well as the personality of the driver, 
wherein both variables will be tested as significant predictors of motorcycle accidents. Furthermore, a research 
study conducted by Valentine, et al. (1977) for the office of traffic safety suggests that “man drives as he lives” 
and that those having trouble or difficulty with the personal as well as social demands of living would tend to 
make repeated driving errors. The results of their study indicate that the long-term repeaters of accident errors 
are characterized by these personalities: aggressiveness, impulsiveness, depression, anxiety and extroversion 
and theories suggest that driver personality deterioration in individuals could lead to accident

Abstract 
The availability of spatial and spatio-temporal data has widely increased and allow researcher to describe 
potential geographical pattern, including information about space and time (and its interraction) in many 
scientific fields. Bayesian method to deal with spatial and spatio-temporal data extensively approach with 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), however, when models are complex and designed with 
hierarchical fashion, MCMC algorithms may be extremely slow and even become computationally 
unfeasible. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm is current development in 
R-INLA package in R, designed to deal with fundamental limitation of MCMC computation. This paper
purpose to investigate how the socioeconomic information (i.e. population density, expectation years of
schooling and construction overpriced index) effect the number of poor people in East Java province,
Indonesia, using Bayes spatial model. Investigation result that expectation years of schooling has greatest
effect in reducing number of poor people. Not only on its spatial pattern, we also investigate time
dependency of poor people data from years 2012 to 2016 using classical, dynamic and space-time
interaction of Bayes spatio-temporal models. In this paper, the computational aspect is efficiently solved
with R-INLA, resulting dynamic Bayes Spatio-temporal is the best model based on the smallest Deviance
Information Criteria.

Abstract 
SMEs are beginning to realize that today's consumers want the company to provide cheap, 
quality products, and quick response. To be able to meet the wishes of the company's consumers 
must be able to make improvements. In the process of improvement, SMEs faces some 
interference from internal and external company. Disorders from internal companies can be a 
disruption of the manufacturing process, financial disturbances, and disruptions caused by 
inappropriate products. External distractions may arise from the environment, demand, supply, 
information and logistics. To survive, SMEs must establish the right strategy to keep their 
business running and growing. SMEs can be more developed with risk sharing strategies. This 
study measures the relationship between risk factors and risk sharing information. This research 
uses quantitative method with PLS software for data processing. Population in this research is all 
existing SMEs in Bandung city of West Java.

1. Introduction
Facing the era of free market in Southeast Asia, the business world in Indonesia must take
strategic steps in order to face competition with other ASEAN countries, including the sector of
Cooperatives and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (Arisandy, 2016).
The increasing number of SMEs and the increasing competition makes MSMEs have to think
about ways to maintain business continuity. SMEs face risks in running their business, the risks
faced can make SMEs cannot survive. A strategy is needed to enable SMEs to cope with
emerging risks or to anticipate risks. Supply chain risk according to Tang and Musa (2011) is an
incident that the rate of occurrence is small but may appear suddenly and bring negative impact.

Abstract 
Quality of raw materials from suppliers is a very affect the product produced. A well managed supplier 
relationship management can improve the quality and better service of suppliers. From the selection 
criteria of existing suppliers, quality is one of the important criteria. Choosing a supplier based on the 
quality of its products will have a positive impact on the manufacturing company. There has been a lot of 
research on supplier selection using index capability process but it only ends in supplier selection only, no 
follow-up to selected supplier or not selected. In this research, the supplier is divided into two groups 
based on multiple characteristic capability index process with the aim to give development proposal for 
each supplier group. The number of suppliers in this study is nine, with the result of the division is, the 
first group consists of five suppliers. As for the second group consists of four suppliers. Characteristics of 
quality in group one is better than group two overall in both bursting, tear strength, tensile strength, and 
elongation. The development of this research is uninterrupted in the selection of suppliers only because 
there are not many skin suppliers available. From the supplier grouping based on the capability index, 
then develop the program for the supplier based on the group.

1. Introduction
Raw materials are a major requirement in the production process for manufacturing companies. In
meeting the need for raw materials for the production process, most manufacturing firms depend on
suppliers. The quality of raw materials supplied by suppliers is very affect both good and bad product that
will be produced. The low quality of raw materials delivered can lead to a decrease in the quality of the
resulting product. Non-compliance with raw material quality specifications may also result in additional
work. This will lead to disruption of production processes in manufacturing companies. In that case the
supplier plays a very important role to smooth the production process of manufacturing companies. From
this case, the manufacturing company should be able to establish good relationships with suppliers, so
that better support is given to manufacturing companies.
According to Roushdy et al. (2015) frequent interactions and close relationships with suppliers can have a
positive effect on the exchange of information and knowledge flows, thereby improving process and

For the development of suppliers in the next stage is presented in Figure 5. In the development of this 
stage is done integration of product / process development. This is done so that between customers and 
suppliers can share information about new products they can do or the effective and efficient process they 
get to improve the quality of the products produced between the two. Supplier network system integration 
is built, so that between customers and suppliers can share information quickly, so it can be easy to make 
decisions. Improvement on second level supplier is also done, in this case second level supplier can 
provide raw material of leather with good quality. Steps in making improvements to second-tier suppliers 
are initial supplier capacity evaluation, production process evaluation, performance evaluation, supplier 
qualification, and implementation of quality management system. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Frequent interactions and close relationships with suppliers can have a positive effect on the exchange of 
information and knowledge flow, thereby improving process and performance. Suppliers play an 
important role in business success. A well managed supplier relationship results in increased customer 
satisfaction, reduced costs, better quality and better service from suppliers. As a result, supplier 
management processes are an important factor to maintain competitive advantage and quality 
improvement through continuous improvement and supplier development. 
Process capability index has been widely used in manufacturing companies. The method is used to 
measure supplier capability process. The process capability index provides a numerical measure for the 
ability of a process to produce goods that meet specified quality requirements. The advantage of using 
process capability index is more accurate and reliable. 
After the calculation of the capabiitas index on each supplier, then done grouping suppliers using minitab 
software, suppliers are divided into 2 (two) groups. The results of the division are: 
1. The first group consists of supplier A, supplier D, supplier I, supplier B, and supplier C. 
2. The second group consists of supplier E, supplier F, supplier H, and supplier G. 
The quality characteristics in the 1 (one) group were better than the 2 (two) groups overall in both 
bursting, tear strength, tensile strength, and elongation. After grouping into 2 (two) groups, then proposed 
for SRM activity. 
Supplier development framework identified into 3 phases include: 
1. Framework of Group Supplier Development 1 
2. Framework of Group Supplier Development 2 
3. Framework of Supplier Development in the future

Abstract 
Modern day customers wish to receive product and services as per their choice of channel, reach and 
convenience. For meeting such needs, supply chain managers have always looked for newer approaches 
and philosophy. One of such philosophy is emergence of Omnichannel for providing seamless shopping 
experience to its customers. To implement omnichannel strategies in real practices need structuring and 
reconfiguring the practices of traditional supply chain network (SCN). Also due to easy and rich 
availability of information on dot com, customers tend to shift to the channel where prices are low. Thus 
demand fulfillment is affected by uncertainty in demand. For this, in this work a mathematical MILP 
model of multiple-channel distribution SCN (MCDSCN) has been proposed in which customers will be 
able access to product and services as per their choice of channels. So, the objectives of this model is not 
only minimizing total supply chain cost but also maximizing service level under uncertain environment. 
For showing the applicability of proposed model a numerical is illustrated which compares proposed 
model with traditional SCN. Significant saving is being achieved in proposed model over traditional SCN 
which justifies its applicability.

1. Introduction
Today’s customers have become more powerful than ever. They expect flexible and fast delivery and 
moreover wish to choose the channel as per their wish, reach and convenience. This idea of providing the customer 
shopping experience as seamless has given birth to the concept of Omnichannel retailing (Rigby 2011). In simple 
terms omnichannel (OC) is the integration of all available channels for making customer shopping experience 
seamless (Rigby 2011; Brynjolfsson et al. 2013). The different channels in omnichannel could be physical stores, 
websites, kiosks, direct mail and catalogs, social media, call centers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, televisions, 
home services, networked appliances and more (Rigby 2011). Broadly these channels can be categorized as shown 
in Figure 1. To provide omnichannel experience the traditional supply chains need to be altered which would result 
in structuring and reconfiguring the practices of designing traditional distribution network (Yadav et al. (2017)). 
These changes possess lots of challenges. Some of these challenges include providing flexible distribution, 
providing real time information to all stakeholders of supply chain, faster and on-time delivery etc. For handling 
such challenges, organizations look for various operations and activities, among them an efficient and effective 
supply chain network (SCN) is most preferred option (Sachan & Dutta 2005).

proper integration of different channel. Further it would help online giants to attract more customers and gain market 
share thus increasing the profit of the organizations.  
Two objectives i.e. minimizing SC cost, and maximizing service level has been considered in this 
MCDSCN model. A similar situation is considered for traditional SCN and results obtained are compared with the 
proposed MCDSCN. Our MCDSCN has superiority over traditional SCN in terms of cost saving and maximizing 
service level along with better customer service i.e. customer convenience by flexible distribution. Due to flexibility 
in distribution and easy access to different channel in the proposed model, uncertainty in demand may arise. 
Uncertainty at any point in MCDSCN model has lesser overall effect since it is being divided into different channel. 
The proposed model is also tested for uncertainty level up to 20% in discrete sets   i.e. at ±5%, ±10%, ±15% & 
±20%. Our MCDSCN model has better capability to handle uncertainty than traditional SCN. One of the prominent 
benefits of MCDSCN model is that in this model the capacity of central DC and regional DC could be reduced since 
they don’t need to carry full inventory which lead lesser requirement of space. Further this space could be used for 
expansion of other business activities. 
The proposed model could be further improved by capturing real-time information to the stakeholder of the 
supply chain. This would make the model more complex and could be solved using non-traditional optimization 
techniques like Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm 
(MOGA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Ant Bee Colony (ABC) and simulated annealing (SA) etc. Further 
different type of risk could also be embedded to make model more realistic. Testing the proposed model on actual 
field data would provide more appropriate conclusion, which is the limitation of this work. Though the numerical 
illustration resembles the real world scenarios and can be considered as good move in this regard.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the influence of culture, job satisfaction and motivation on the performance of 
lecturers/employees in universities. Respondents numbered 180 people, consisting of all full time 
lecturers and permanent employees. Structured questionnaires were developed and distributed to 180 
respondents. Valid questionnaires amounted to 146 pieces. Data were analyzed using 2 methods, namely: 
1). Descriptive analysis, and 2). Multivariate regression analysis with SEM (Structural Equation 
Modeling). The results showed that (i) culture and job satisfaction affect motivation; (ii) culture also 
affects job satisfaction; (iii) job satisfaction and motivation affect the performance; (iv) culture does not 
affect the performance;   (v) culture and job satisfaction affect the performance through motivation. Thus, 
job satisfaction factor is an important factor to be managed in order to increase motivation, which will 
ultimately improve the performance. Moreover, the performance variable shows the average interval 
value of 2.90 to 3.58, which means the performance of lecturers/employees is good enough. 
Understanding the relationship between culture, job satisfaction and motivation toward the performance 
will improve the quality of service in universities. This is possible because the leader knows the factors 
that become the leverages of the performance of lecturers/employees.

Abstract 
The broadcast industry sector in the Philippines is mandated by the government to adopt and implement the 
digitization of television networks. Various networks have conducted studies on technical aspect but not on 
media consumer’s watching preferences. This paper studied the media consumer’s preference in watching 
television. A survey questionnaire method was used to determine and identify the preference and significant 
key factors of the media consumer.  Socio-economic factors like age group, job specification and financial 
status have several considerable impacts on digital terrestrial television implementation. Preferences on 
television viewing are identified to come up with a socio-economic business model.

1. Introduction
The Philippines, with more than 14 million television (TV) households nationwide relying on free to-air (FTA) analog 
TV broadcast, is currently on its way towards digitalization of the broadcast sector industry officially adopting Japan’s 
Integrated Services Digital Broadcast - Terrestrial (ISDB-T) as the sole standard of Digital Terrestrial Television 
Broadcasting (DTTB) services in the country. On February 14, 2017, the ceremonial Digital Switch On (DSO) marks 
officially the start of the comprehensive nationwide implementation of DTTB. The digital switchover will mark a new 
beginning of the disruptive technology that forces the restructuring of the broadcast industry and adopt to the changes 
(Galperin, 2002). Digital migration is a complex socio-technical endeavor (Shin, Song, 2012) that must be a mutual 
effort of the government and the mass media; this will create an inequality among the people in accessing the digital 
technology, and gives rise to the so called “digital divide” among the members of the society. It also presents a techno-
analytic approach (Cambini, Garelli, 2011) in utilizing the digital frequency spectrum assessing the opportunity cost 
bring about by the digital dividend.  
In the Philippines, since the early 2000s, studies about digital television transition has been carried out. Only in 2013 
that Philippine government, through The National Telecommunications Commission, announced to adopt the Japanese 
DTV; “Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting – Terrestrial” as the chosen DTTB among other competing standards 
for digital television. The analog shut-off (ASO) is set to take effect last December 31, 2015 and was moved to year 
2023 as part of migration plan, given that technical standards, implementation plan, government policies and 
regulations as well as fiscal considerations of the country did not materialize. The same scenario happened all over 
the world with the attempt to fully enforce the all-out digitalization of the broadcast sector, the government is unlikely 
to meet the analog shut-off target date (Bazelon, 1999, Galperin, 2002) due to political, economic, social and policy 
issues. As per National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), DTTB in the Philippines is on the provisional

Cost Structure 
 
Capital expenditure is the consequence of media evolution. The purchase of new broadcast equipment and facility 
expansion is necessary to cope with the change in technology as the former equipment can no longer support and 
compete with the existing “state of the art” digital technology devices. Hence, it is also necessary to train professional 
individuals and talents to learn and acquire knowledge and be familiar with the technological advancement that digital 
technology can offer. Strategically, a broadcast stations can tie-up with the digital broadcast equipment manufacturers 
to train its technical personnel for free. A contract that can be organized in exchange of buying equipment that can 
save cost for operating expenditures on personnel training. On the other hand, the government’s fund on DTV 
awareness campaign and STB subsidy program for those who are poor, will heavily rely on taxes. Likewise, STB 
manufacturing company could sell STBs at an affordable price in the media consumer market benchmarking on the 
current retail price of STB at ₱1,500 for a STB with standard functionality and more so with value added features. 
 
Channels 
 
It is through channels that the customer segments can be reached. Infomercials, road shows and DTV mascot are ways 
to promote and inform the media consumers on digital terrestrial TV broadcast with the initiative of National 
Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) 
as the primary governmental agency for DTV implementation plan. Based on the survey, majority of the sample 
population already have an idea and are aware about digital TV. Likewise, broadcast TV network’s channel allocation 
i.e. Channel 2, Channel 7 is a valuable tool to reach the mass media consumer through TV “channel recognition”. 
Hence, set-top box equipment can be purchased in an outlet store or digital consumer market. 
 
Revenue Streams 
 
Television ratings is one of the primary considerations in advertising. It is through advertisements that a broadcast TV 
company can gain profit by spending an ample amount of TV airtime to sell and promote its businesses gaining an 
awareness on products and services. With the introduction of digital terrestrial TV technology, pay-tv is already a big 
equation in the profit revenue stream of a broadcasting company. From the results, media consumers are willing to 
pay for ₱300 for TV subscription. Moreover, the ease of payment and availability of services will encourage media 
consumer to make use of the offering. Hence, marketing and advertising is a way to encourage and gain the mass 
media market demographics that will eventually gain revenue upon full implementation of digital TV technology. In 
addition, partnership between a TV station and STB manufacturer will gain profit by selling branded set-top box with 
the station’s logo, loaded with sim card or smart card as the set-top box enables TV viewers to watch and pay for the 
channel subscription with access code on some TV channels. It is an opportunity that the TV networks can offer 
various services, to cater the need and demands of the media consumers. Hence, based on the results media consumers 
are willing to pay for “value-added” features. A good sign that the media consumers will most likely to avail various 
services that they want.  Likewise, broadcast stations can offer a set of Digital TV package: STB on Standard 
Definition, STB on High Definition or a combination of the two. The package can come up with an array of programs, 
channels and services flexible enough to cater the watching preference of the media consumer. On the other hand, the 
government will earn revenues upon lease of radio frequency allocation spectrum from a broadcast station company. 
This is a government’s intangible natural asset that is worth millions in value to be leased in a specified time frame. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Digital terrestrial television technology is now the on-going trend for broadcast communications industry. The 
evolution has an impact in the aspect of socio-economic for the media consumers. Based on the statistical test 
conducted using chi-square test there is a significant impact between analog terrestrial TV or digital terrestrial TV for 
tele-viewers. The assumption points toward the enhanced capabilities of digital television technology to cater the 
demands of the media consumer and satisfying the preference for TV viewing experience. Significantly, media 
consumers thought that Digital TV has more to offer in terms of value added services and enhanced viewing 
experience as compared to analog TV. The result is reflected based on the statistical test conducted above where the 
media consumers are expecting more with the change in TV medium. Likewise, set-top box or digital receiver is the 
primary equipment to receive and experience Digital TV in which media consumers based on the age group are willing 
to buy set-top box to avail the value-added services offered by Digital TV. Based on the results, in the aspect of 
1851","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bandung, Indonesia, March 6-8, 2018 
© IEOM Society International 
awareness, gender and age group may not be a significant factor but the age group has a strong significant evidence 
on components of TV viewing that lead towards Digital TV experience. On the other hand, financial status is highly 
significant in both awareness and viewing preference since income greatly affects the capacity of the media consumer 
to avail the technology, sooner or later. While set-top box acquisition is an important factor in digital TV awareness 
and implementation. Furthermore, results from the gathered data showed that age group on time slot is a factor to 
consider but the preference on TV programming and channeling may not be a factor. On the other hand, among the 
characteristics of TV viewing high resolution video content produced a greater inclination among all other TV 
watching characteristics indicating that the media consumer of the modern age is inclined to visual details giving 
importance on what the eyes can see in reproducing a virtual reality.  
 
Hence, the socio-economic business model for digital terrestrial TV has a great impact in the aspect of age group and 
financial economic status. The model proposes a simplified approach in digital terrestrial TV awareness for media 
consumers and implementation for the government and broadcast TV stations based on capital investments, media 
consumer viewing preferences and set-top box acquisition. 
 
In general, based on the results of the statistical analysis of significant relationship among the factors on Digital TV 
awareness and watching preferences; showed a promising future in the TV broadcast industry since the modern media 
consumers are looking for something new to experience where entertainment will be at its finest. Likewise, socio-
economic aspect on financial capability is significantly a factor in digital TV implementation. Efforts from the 
government and various TV networks who already into digital broadcast are needed to fully utilize the emerging 
technology that is capable of upbringing the realized potential of the dynamic television market industry. 
 
6.  Recommendation 
 
Digital terrestrial TV technology is only at the early stages of operation in the Philippines. The study only represents 
a portion of the total nationwide population with stratified sampling in Quezon City. Further studies for large coverage 
areas can be conducted when partial to full digital TV implementation is observed to know the progress of the 
migration plan and when to “analog-shut off “. As mentioned, the study only identified three (3) socio-economic 
factors namely: age group, job description and financial status. Further study can include other economic factors which 
are relevant to the deployment of the digital TV technology. Independent variables can also be modified prior to the 
subject of the study. Media consumer preferences can also be modified. The study can focus from one to two or more 
preference(s) which can be crucial to the operations of a broadcast TV station, to know if it is a significant factor(s) 
to attest. Finally, since digital TV has other platform aside from digital terrestrial TV, further studies can include 
IPTV, cable TV and satellite TV. The study can make a comparison among all other platforms, but since the 
technology is at the embryonic stage, these other platforms are yet to be fully experienced by the media consumers.

between policy maintenance and quality control based on variable sampling plan using process capability 
index. Integrated model is used to determine the optimum number of samples, critical values for 
acceptance sampling and to determined maintenance policy based on quality information feedback. The 
rejected lots are tendenced of deteriorate process so if the proportion of defects in the rejected lot reaches 
or exceeds on given threshold, the preventive maintenance is applied before the failure of production 
system occurrence. A stochastic mathematical model is developed and solved using an optimization 
approach to minimize the total incurred cost. Numerical examples is provided to illustrate the efficiency 
of the proposed integrated model. Compared to the acceptance of sampling by attribute policy which is 
widely used in the literature on integrated model, the result can be estimated that with economic design of 
acceptance sampling by variable using PCI in an integrated context can lead to important cost savings of 
more than 10% with decision result which is more accurate. 
Keywords : 
Quality based maintenance, process capability index, single acceptance sampling by variable, preventive 
maintenance.

Abstract 
Business strategy is indispensable to a company which can become more active and sensitive to future 
threats. For external factor, environmental uncertainty need to be consider for improving their strategy. 
This research will discuss the linkage among business strategy with uncertainty and performance in the 
field of freight forwarder Indonesia’s financial and non-financial. The required data are questionnaire 
survey and using the data from some companies to analyze with approach of porter strategy, before 
testing analysis, factor score of questionnaire will be calculated first and tested for linkaging 
of the factor with regression test , after that  ANOVA test allowing correlation, whether accepted or 
declined significantly.

1. Introduction
In business, for achieving goals and objectives will invariably demand meticulous planning and execution.
Business strategy is the way in which achieve competitive advantage (Shavarini, Salimian & Alborzi ,2013). For 
many observers  , Bastian & Muchlish (2012) , Business strategy and organizational preformance significant 
postively associated and having clear strategic vision serves as the key foundation for subsequent performance . 
According to Shavarini, Salimian & Alborzi (2013), to achieve such success, an organization usually develops a 
strategy (Wheelen   and Hunger, 2000). Strategy has vertical interaction between environment and performance to 
get competitive advantage. It’s already found in several study for case  hospitality industry, there’re significant 
interaction (Koseoglu, Topaloglu, Parnell & Lester, 2013). 
The linkage of strategy and performance is central in strategic management research of the numerous strategic 
typologies. Miles and Snow’s (1978) framework has been the most enduring, scrutinized and validated strategy 
classification. However, there is a need of further refinements in methodology for empirical validation and testing of 
its underlying assumptions in different contexts and with different measures. (Koseoglu, Topaloglu, Parnell & 
Lester, 2013). 
Wernerfelt (1984) said the performance of measurement, partial support was found a direct relationship 
between 
environmental 
uncertainty 
among 
both 
financial 
and 
non-financial 
performance 
(Koseoglu, Topaloglu, Parnell & Lester, 2013). As per Govindarajan (1984) argue that Environmental uncertainty is 
a factor that effects for performance evaluation, and their conclusion that environmental uncertatinty is considered 
high then information such as performance benchmarks based on more extensive external and future oriented,non-
financial aspects and the qualitative will manage uncertainty (Bastian & Muchlish ,2012).

Abstract  
The wisdom from Confucius has become the philosophy of life for Chinese people and it 
had been applied in dealing with business as well. The successfulness of commerce by 
Chinese ethic has a strong relation with implementing robust corporate culture.  
In Indonesia, Chinese ethnic descendants still applying the way of life from Confucius in 
maintaining their business. However, the employee and corporate staff were not entirely 
from Chinese race nor accustomed to Chinese culture. This research aims to analyze the 
present application of Confucianism culture in term of employee productivity, the problem 
during implementation and the strategy to strengthen the culture. Through qualitative 
measurement methods, data were collected from both employees and managers. The results 
were from the five dimensions of Confucianism social interactions, not all of them really 
take in account in the corporate professional life.  
If the employees already have the five basic of social interaction from Confucianism, it will 
increase the employee’s motivation. To train the employees to have that culture, the 
company should adopt the military method to fortify the loyalty towards the company, 
strengthen authority as hierarchy, show wisdom towards sub-ordinates, have good ethics of 
peer interaction, and improve trust toward the employees and company.

Abstract 
In the globalization era, competition pace among the industry has been becoming faster. This leads in 
changes on business process of many companies, including companies in Indonesia. Implementing 
international standards for management system becomes a critical step and decision for the companies in 
order to survive in the competition. This research will find the impact of requirements in the integrated 
management systems on the company operational performance. The object will be 30 manufacturing 
companies in Indonesia which have implemented the integrated management system. Literature 
study is conducted to show requirements shared in the integrated management system and 
operational performance criteria. Structural Equation Modeling will be used in order to analyze 
the relationship between requirements stated in three standards of ISO 9001, the ISO 14001, and 
OHSAS 18001 with operational performance criteria. The result of this research shall find the best 
strategies in implementing these systems specifically for Indonesian manufacturing industries in order to 
optimize the operational performances.

1. Introduction
The changes in the competitive landscape at quicker pace and the flow of the business process is the result of 
globalization (Martin, 2016). The implementations of quality management system (ISO 9001), environmental 
management system (ISO 14001) and health and safety management (OHSAS 18001) are some strategies in which 
companies within different countries around the world used to stay competitive (Nunhes, Motta, & de Oliveira, 2016). 
The needs of installation of more than one of these standards become urgent and integration of these standards 
becomes a critical competitive decision of firms (Savino & Batbaatar, 2015). In addition, the management systems 
implemented and certified share the same philosophy (continuous improvement by the adoption of the PDCA cycle), 
as well as the same principles and values (Domingues, Sampaio, & Arezes, 2016).

3. Theoritical Background 
 
Integrated management system defined in this research consists of quality management, environmental 
management, and occupational health and safety. 
Total quality is an effective system that integrates all efforts to define, design, fabricate, and install a product or 
service costing the cheapest possible while providing total customer satisfaction (Noori & Radford, 1995). This quality 
management indicates that the purpose of quality standards is to demonstrate to customers, the supplier chain and end-
users that the product or service concerned is subject to rigorous systematic evaluation and continuous improvement 
(Walker, 2000). 
Environmental management (EM) in industrial process is a particularly important issue. It has two general 
objectives: prevention of incidents or accidents that might result from abnormal operating conditions, and reduction 
of adverse effects that result from normal operating conditions (Sanz-Calcedo, Gonzalez, Salgado, Cambero, & 
Herrera, 2015). Many industries has invested interest in protecting the environment because attractive and safe 
surroundings are part of its core product (Chan & Hsu, 2016). This way of thinking concludes that environmental 
management is not just about being environmentally friendly, rather, it is about good business sense and higher profits 
(Prajogo, Tang, & Lee, 2014). 
Health and safety management is one of total quality management aspect that would imply a goal of an injury free 
and healthy working environment. Vasie (1998) has stated that organizations adopting this approach, therefore, need 
to recognize that proactive risk control, through an assured health and safety management system, is more effective 
than reacting to accidents and ill-health once they have occurred. 
Firm's operational performance are indicators of effectiveness, efficiency, and environmental responsibility such 
as, cycle time, productivity, waste reduction, and regulatory compliance (Business Dictionary, 2017). Also, it is stated 
that operational performance is usually measured as a composite of several performance dimensions and reflects the 
performance of the internal operation of a company in terms of product/process quality and inventory performance 
(Martin, 2016). 
 
4. Research Methodology 
 
The first step of the research will be identifying the criteria of operational performances that affected by 
implementing requirements of integrated management system. Literature study will be conducted in order to specify 
the criteria. After all criteria are listed, the next step is to obtain primary data. Questionnaire will be spread to 30 
manufacturing companies operated in Indonesia. After data has been collected, all factors that will be impacted by 
these standards will be analyzed by using SEM. By using SEM, the significance of these relationship and impact 
between the criteria and the IMS requirements will be identified and the result from integrated model will be used as 
main data to develop implementation strategy of integrated management system. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
The result has shown some impact of three standard certifications on industry operational performance. With 
implementation of these standards, operational performances such as production volume, production efficiency, time 
efficiency, and waste reduction have been developed positively. The connection between these operational 
performance criteria and the ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001 criteria is found with SEM analysis, 
becoming a benefit connection that can be achieved and applied as an optimal operational strategy.

Abstract 
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a route optimization problem. The current situation grows more 
complex so the VRP needs to adapt for being close to the practical problems. Perishable products are one 
example that need route optimization because perishable products require fast delivery time to maintain 
freshness. Often several companies has several distributors & some retailers (multi-depot), and often 
found that demand of customer that exceeds of the vehicle capacity so it needs to be visited more than 
once for each customer to meet customer demands (split-delivery) and with consideration of customer 
allowed service time (time-windows). In the traditional VRP, there are no consideration factors such as 
multi-depot (MD), split-delivery (SD) and time-window (TW). Therefore, we developed a model multi-
depot split-delivery VRP with time-windows (MDSDVRPTW), which is the relaxation of traditional VRP 
limitation, with an objective function to minimize the total travel time. 
Keywords 
Multi depot, Split delivery, Time windows, Vehicle  routing  problem 
1. Introduction
VRP is one of the solutions to logistic’s problem with its main purpose to find the best route to go through. 
In general, the benefit of using VRP is minimizing the total cost or the distance by using a bunch of vehicles to give 
the shipping services to the consumers.  
The term of vehicle routing problem was found by Dantzig & Ramser in 1959 when they were working on 
a project called Truck Dispatcing Problem; a shipping truck problem to manage/organize the shipping routes of fuel 
(Sharda & Voβ, 2007). Nowadays or about more than fifty five years after VRP was found, it experienced a drastic 
change and it became a research’s favorite topic in the whole world. Today, there are 498.000 results for vehicle 
routing problem search key in online search such as Google and about 78.804 results in sciencedirect. 
Beside the low cost of delivery, the shipping speed is one of the consumer’s requirements (Santoso et al., 
2012). VRP that is equipped with only one depot to serve group of consumers will not give satisfying results and 
will take a longer time to fulfill its duties. Therefore, rich VRP is needed; a VRP that resembles the previous VRP 
but with relaxation from the previous’ restrictions. According to Baldacci et al., (2008), “rich VRP” can be 
identified by the existence of some depots, some road’ routes, some vehicle types or other restrictions. 
In vehicle routing problem (VRP), the vehicle’s armada (the fleet of vehicles) can serve or fulfill the 
request of more than one consumer, each consumer can only be visited by one vehicle and the purpose to minimize 
total distances taken by the vehicle. In split-delivery vehicle routing problem (SD-VRP), the limits in accordance to 
the visitation of vehicle’s armada (the fleet of vehicles) to the consumer which only can be done once is removed, 
thus the consumer can be visited by the vehicle’s armada more than once (Sharda and Voβ, 2007). Split-delivery 
vehicle routing problem (SD-VRP) is a VRP model that allows visiting consumer more than once due to the request 
that exceed the vehicle’s capacity (Dror and Tredeau, 1989; Jin et al.,2008 in Santoso et al., 2012). The purpose of 
SD-VRP itself is to find a set of route that is passed by vehicle to serve consumer’s request with capacity lower than 
the capacity that can be carried by the vehicle and the total distance taken by the vehicle (Sharda and Voβ, 2007).

5. Conclusion & Future search
In this paper, we presented VRP model with cosider multiple relaxation of capability from traditional VRP. 
Relaxation of multi-depot is used because often several companies has several distributors & some retailers (multi 
depot), and relaxation of number of visit to customer is used because often found that demand of customer that 
exceeds of the vehicle capacity so it needs to be visited more than once for each customer to meet customer 
demands (split-delivery) and relaxation of customer allowed service (time-windows). On this paper, we develop the 
model only, so computational approach can become future research for this model.

Numerous small businesses failed to become big venture, as they could not be able to survive 
in the early stage of business development phases. The online platform is a reliable choice in spreading 
promotion for firms who have limited resources. In performing online marketing effectively during the 
initial stage, four key points of online media advertising should be maintained well. The conceptual 
model proposed from this research are SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and Promotion timing 
increases brand awareness, visual imagery and copywriting increases trust, and the brand awareness 
itself will later increase customers’ trust toward online retailer. 
Keywords: SME; online marketing; business growth; brand awareness 
1. Introduction
Nowadays, there is a growing concern regarding the marketing method through the online 
platform for business. The business of SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) plays a vital role in the 
acceleration of nation’s economic growth and the employment of workers in the productive age. The 
SMEs who are considered as the foundation of industrial development can widely gain significant 
benefits from e-commerce as time and space disadvantages could be overcome by using the internet-
based platform[7].  
In the tight competition environment, the newly started SMEs should be able to get used to e-
marketing for achieving profitability, differentiation and success in both local and global market[8]. 
Majority business would fall in their early years as shown statistically that approximately 80% of new 
business shut down during the first year of operation[33]. This study aims to develop the hypotheses 
about the relationship between influencing factors for SMEs survival in the early stage of business 
based on the propositions from previous research conducted by Setiaboedi, Sari and Prihatono[35]. 
Firstly, the paper will explain why the research is focused on the early stage of SME Growth. It is 
followed by the explanation about the construction of hypothesis and conceptual model, then 
conclusion and possibilities of future research.   
2. SME Growth and Trust
From the previous study, the most frequently used and representative indicator for success in 
SME is the growth [5],[2],[6]. The growth gives an important measurement for performance and 
achievement of the venture [2].  
The framework developed for small and growing business by Churchill and Lewis identified 
the growth stage not only from the amount of revenue, but also more widely factors such as diversity, 
index of size, and complexity, and described by five management factors: owner involvement in the 
business, managerial style, corporate strategies, organizational structure, and extent of formal 
systems[1]. The growth stages were divided into Existence, Survival, Success, Take-Off, and Maturity. 
The majority of business most likely would fall during their early years of operation[33], or translated to 
the Existence and Survival stages from the Growth Model by Churchill and Lewis. 
1872","marketing effort in the online platform is to strengthen the brand awareness[23]. Getting touch with the 
customer through online communities has been statistically proven has a positive influence towards 
brand awareness[22]. Das stated that online retail awareness is positively related to attitude toward 
retailers which later impacted the intention to purchase through online media[9]. In summary, literature 
has given insight regarding the correlation between brand awareness and online trust. So, this study 
proposed H5.  
H5. Brand awareness is positively related to trust. 
The research model is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Research Model

Conclusion and Future Research
Becoming a substantial and sustainable venture, a small venture should pass five stages of 
growth. However, the survival rate of business in the early stages is remarkably low. Online platform 
plays a significant assistance in foster the growth of SMEs. For small and medium businesses, which 
rely mainly on the use of online media as their marketing channel, five hypotheses are constructed that 
represents the model of online business for small firms. They are the application of SEO and perfect 
timing to post the promotion which directly impacted brand awareness, copywriting in the text and 
pictures with good quality which increase trust, and brand awareness is presumed impacted trust.  
The above hypothesis needs to be tested, whether the relationship is significant. Each point in 
the hypothesis could be a single variable and divided into several indicators in constructing a 
questionnaire or interview. The research objects have to be limited for the SMEs which belongs to the 
early stage of growth. In addition, the future study should also consider other stages of SME growth.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine delivery time of a set of customer orders in a repetitive make-to-order 
(MTO) manufacturing company that utilizes recycled waste products as raw materials. A simulation 
approach and flow-shop dispatching rules are applied to find minimum total flow time or makespan 
taking materials supply uncertainties into account which is then used to determine the delivery time of 
each order. As an industrial case study we consider a small medium repetitive MTO company that 
produces multiple products from plastic waste. The result of the study shows that in a flow-shop 
manufacturing system with probabilistic arrival time and quantity of materials shortest processing time 
rule does not always result in minimum makespan.

1. Introduction
Sustainable development is described as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WECD, 1987). The strategy to achieve the goal of sustainable 
development in the industrial sector is sustainable manufacturing. It can be implemented by closing the loop of 
product lifecycle by utilizing industrial waste streams as alternative sources of other needed material. In this regard, 
industry has a responsibility to provide sustainable goods by using waste materials, which can lead to technically and 
economically competitive products. 
Closed material cycle can reduce the use of virgin materials as resource inputs and reduce the volume of waste 
products requiring disposal. However, in practice the utilization of waste materials is limited by several factors. The 
factors include waste collection and transportation, the scale of the business, the industrial sector in which the 
company operates, the amount and type of waste produced, environmental regulations, and the level of development 
within a particular country (Linton et al., 2007).

show that Random 3 dispatching rule generated minimum makespan, i.e. 967.75 hours or 40.32 days if the 
production runs continuously (24 hours a day). The Random 3 rule executes the production based on the following 
sequence: black B nail - green S nail – red cup seal – blue cup seal – black S nail - green cup seal – silver cup seal.  
In flow shop serial machines, shortest processing time rule oftentimes results in minimum makespan and average 
completion time. However, that situation does not happen in this case study. This is because the starting time of each 
production is based on the probabilistic arrival time and quantity of the materials.  
Flow time resulted from the simulation can be used to determine order delivery time. Figure 5 shows 24-hours 
production schedule based on Random 3 dispatching rule. It can be seen that delivery time of each product offered 
to the customer are: 4 days for black B nail, 7 days for green S nail, 12 days for red cup seal, 19 days for blue cup 
seal, 23 days for black S nail, 32 days for green cup seal, and 41 days for silver cup seal.

6. Conclusion 
The result of the study shows that simulation approach can be used to determine orders’ delivery time in a repetitive 
flow-shop MTO manufacturing system that utilizes recycled waste products as raw materials. Unlike flow shop 
manufacturing in which SPT rule oftentimes resulted in minimum makespan, in this study SPT rule did not arrive at 
the minimum makespan. This is because the production will start just after the incoming materials are sufficient. The 
simulation procedure used in this study can be applied in the order management phase when the company must 
make offer of price and lead time for the order received. 
Further research direction includes the situation with more dispatching rules and multi resources. Inventory costs 
can be also taken into account when deciding production sequence.

Abstract 
The perceived risk is found to be a barrier for e-commerce application. It has been widely demonstrated in 
previous studies that the e-commerce is closely related with risk assessment. Taking into account of the 
scope of supply chain management, the activities of e-commerce system mostly deal with information 
flow, rather than either product or service flows. With regard to the rapid growth of e-commerce, there is 
imbalance between preparation and mitigation activities. More specifically, there is no formal model 
which shows supply chain risk in the e-commerce system, regarded as the research gap. Hence, one way 
to analyze and map out complex system as potential risk is to make Supply Chain Risk Management 
(SCRM) framework. This study is conducted to develop a framework about SCRM in the e-commerce 
area. Taking a case study on e-commerce based company, the SCRM framework is developed 
incorporating 8 perceived risk model in e-commerce: such as financial, social, time, performance, 
physical, privacy, security, and psychological risk. The expected contribution in theory and practice is 
discussed.

1. Introduction
At the moment, global competition is tight and supply chain be continues to be long and more complex 
(Tummala & Schoenherr, 2011). Not achieving the desired supply chain performance is expected to increase, 
especially because the risks. Supply chain risk can be defined as an explanation in terms of the causes of 
abnormality that affect the management of the supply chain efficiently (Ghadge et al, 2012 ).Companies are 
important to adapt the strategy of abnormalities especially on their network. Risk involved in supply chain as well as 
the relative the damage can be seen from the recalls and lawsuits for car toy (Story, 2007 ), animal food (FDA, 
2008), and recently withdrawal one of the products Samsung in 2016.  
According to Djojosoedarso (2003) risk management is the implementation of the functions management in 
risk reduction, especially risk faced by organization / company, the family and social. Function management it 
includes activities plan, organizing, composing, lead, and supervise (including evaluate) risk reduction programs.

5. Conclusions and Recommendation 
This study shows how perceived risk as e-commerce barrier can have an effect on e-commerce 
performance. It is obvious that consumers would have to look for evidence of the quality in means other than the 
physical inspection of the goods on offer. In this aspect, perceived risk as e-commerce barrier is given particular 
attention. E-commerce Performance Indicators consist of 3 constructs  and there are 9 indicators for measuring those 
constructs. Future research is expected to use a variety of methodologies and further research and development on 
the relationship between SCRM and e-commerce.

Abstract 
Deforestation increases the amount of CO2 gas in the atmosphere and is also a permanent destruction 
of forests. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 
18 million acres of forest are lost each year. Thus, regulations have been placed on forests’ clearance 
because the loss of forests causes global warming. Having identified the severe effects of greenhouse 
gases on the earth, this paper focuses on finding an alternative material for furniture manufacturing in 
order to reduce deforestation. With wooden furniture prices increasing due to the regulations limiting 
deforestation, the effect being significant in the education sector, plastics are studied as the alternative 
material to classroom wooden furniture. Instead of having a desk and a chair, the furniture is designed 
as a single combined plastic arm chair to save material. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is carried out 
on the selected polycarbonate arm chair using Solid Works, and it is observed that the maximum stress 
that the arm chair can be subjected to is less than that at which polycarbonate alloy (ABS-PC) fails. 
Hence, it is possible to replace classroom wooden furniture with cheap and easy to maintain 
polycarbonate arm chairs.

5. Recommendations and Conclusions 
5.1 Recommendations 
While it has been concluded that the replacement of wooden classroom furniture chairs with polycarbonate arm 
chairs is feasible, it can however be noted that wooden furniture remains the strongest as compared to plastic 
chairs. Hence there is need for reinforcements to be applied to the plastic arm chair in order to try and have it 
match the strength of wooden furniture. This can be done through heat treatment processes to the plastic that will 
make it more harder and thus stronger. Other alternative strengthening methods that can be used include the use 
of metal legs so that the overall force that can be supported by the arm chair is increased. 
This study used classroom furniture as a case study. Thus, it is important to note that wooden furniture in homes 
and other typical setups can also be replaced with plastic furniture if the correct studies of determining the forces 
setup are done.

5.2 Conclusions  
There have been several attempts to try and reduce the amount of wood used in the furniture industry. These 
include the use of combined desks and chair and also wooden arm chairs. However, it is quite evident that this 
was not the optimum solution in trying to save the world’s forests. Thus, the researcher has presented a solution 
that, if supported with further research and implemented, will have a tremendous effect on reducing deforestation, 
and ultimately reducing global warming.

The base metal in this alloy is steel so a material with better thermal properties than stainless steel may be used as a 
base instead.

Conclusion  
The results of the finite element analysis showed the flow projections of the nitrous oxide gases in the turbine, the 
pressure distribution, shear and thermal stresses induced. The researcher concludes that the acid compression

Abstract 
This paper is on the design for manufacture and assembly of a paper cup making machine for a 
developing economy which can be locally manufactured within an income and expenditure that suits most 
small to medium businesses (SMEs). The current problem is that current computer controlled paper cup 
making machines on the market are expensive and therefore not affordable for a developing economy. 
Through wide research of how current paper cup making machines work, it was possible to come up with 
a low cost effective solution. A deeper understanding of the paper cup making machine was conducted 
with the aid of the internet, scholarly journals and industrial visits to local companies. The manufacture of 
this paper cup making machine is advantageous to a developing nation by creating jobs and thus 
eliminating poverty.

1.0 Introduction 
A paper cup is a single-use cup manufactured from paper and to prevent the passage of liquid from a paper cup, it’s 
usually coated with plastic or wax. Paper cups are manufactured from recycled paper and  have various uses around 
the world {Kelley, 2001 #3}. In a wide range of customs and social classes their main use is to quench thirst. Paper 
cups have different distinctive appearances, sizes and designs with each type of design having an intended purpose 
depending on the type of liquid they hold and on occasions they are used. Some decorative patterns on paper cups 
are used at special events or celebrations to serve alcoholic beverages such as cocktail, liquor and wine. In situations 
where washing is unavailable or it is a time consuming process, it results in using paper cups in fast food restaurants 
to serve prepared food thus making sure that waiting lines and service costs are reduced. Hospitals and nursing

Abstract: 
Course timetabling is a multi-dimensional assignment problem which is the assignment of courses to 
faculty members, and then the assignment of these courses to time slots. Class scheduling, from the 
perspective of a school or a department, is a difficult problem. Typically, each course must be assigned 
an instructor, time slot(s) during the week, and a classroom. At any given time slot, at most one course 
can be assigned to an instructor and a room. The requirements and preferences of the instructors, 
estimated enrollment of students, and characteristics of the course must also be taken into account. 
The timetabling problem has become much more complex. This problem is solved based on many 
restrictions such as the period time, the available number of classrooms, capacity of the classrooms or 
number of seats in each, amount of the registered student and other restrictions from faculty members. 
Because of the reasons mentioned, a scheduler, a human decision-maker, consumes time to solve the 
problem. Furthermore, the assignment of the students to classrooms requires concerning the suitable 
number of students for the classroom since it may increase cost and waste opportunity for another 
appropriate classroom.

X1+X145+X289+X433+X577<=1   so on…for all teachers all days all time slots. 
(2) 
 Total no. of classes of a particular subject should be 8 in a week 
X1+X2+X3+X4+X25+X26+X27+X28+X49+…..X124 <=8     so on for all subject/class (3) 
 
 Maximum 2 classes of the same subject can be held on a day 
X1+X2+X3+X4 <=2        so on for all subject/day/class 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
 Total no of classes in a day should be 4 
X1+X2+X3+X4+….X24 <=4     so on for all days

 Avoid multiple classes in a single time slot for a class 
X1+X5+X9+…X21 <=1       so on.

The constraints and the objective function are coded in R are solved using package LP solve as it 
is a linear programming problem with binary decision variables. The variables are equal to 
n*t*c*d. 
Thus allotments are obtained for timetable scheduling through this for school classes. 
 
The allotments obtained have scheduled the timetable according to the constraints we used. This 
case clearly shows how well and easily can be scheduled a timetable in a time saving and 
effortless way reducing manpower. The algorithm so developed here will be used as the 
background for the timetable scheduling in the company tool for schools and colleges. The 
interface is under construction by the organization. A number of other constraints according to 
the complexity of case can be added to the program and can be modified, one has to design a 
matrix appropriately is the first important task at hand. The intention of the algorithm to generate a 
time-table schedule automatically is satisfied. The algorithm incorporates a number of techniques, aimed 
at improving the efficiency of the search operation. It also addresses the important hard constraint of 
clashes between the availability of teachers. The non-rigid soft constraints i.e. optimization objectives for 
the search operation are also effectively handled. Given the generality of the algorithm operation, it can 
further be adapted to more specific scenarios, e.g. University, examination scheduling and further be 
enhanced to create railway timetables. Thus, through the process of automation of the time-table problem, 
many an-hours of creating an effective timetable have been reduced eventually. A similar approach is 
used for college scheduling problem where a single faculty can teach more than one subjects thus 
another constraint along with the above for avoiding a single faculty being allotted different 
subject/class in a time slot is introduced. A college timetable scheduling algorithm is also 
developed on similar lines in R. 
 
IV. Conclusion and Future Scope: 
A timetable scheduling algorithm is developed using Hungarian method and LPP in R software. 
The constraints can be varied according to using simple programming logic. Various packages of 
R come handy while developing an optimal solution. The algorithm developed will be used in 
the company analytical tool for schools and colleges and will be inbuilt into the software adding 
more utility and ease for the user (management, faculty, and students). Another dimension of

allotting classrooms in case of college timetable can be introduced and coded making it a more 
informative solution. 
The work can be further extended to be used a college scheduling problem where which faculty 
is to teach which subject/subjects is already fixed. The allotment part in the school scheduling 
problem solved by Hungarian method can be skipped in this case and direct allotment matrix can 
be made and objective function realized and optimized. The only thing to keep in mind would be 
to add a constraint that would restrict the same faculty teaching different subjects to be allotted 
the same time slot. Also, the course preferences for classes can be incorporated by taking a 
different combination of large positive numbers in place of 5000 here. The dimension of 
classroom allocation is an important aspect that needs to be taken care of hence. This can be 
done by first obtaining the results of allotment and then optimizing it further on similar lines. 
Heuristic optimization methods are explicitly aimed at good feasible solutions that may not be 
optimal where the complexity of the problem or limited time available does not allow an exact 
solution. Generally, two questions arise related to how fast the solution is computed and how 
close the solution is to the optimal one? The tradeoff is often required between time and quality 
which is taken care of by running simpler algorithms more than once, comparing results obtained 
with more complicated ones and effectiveness in comparing different heuristics. The empirical 
evaluation of heuristic method is based on the analytical difficulty involved in the problem’s 
worst case result. 
Solving Timetable Scheduling Problem by Using Genetic Algorithms: Genetic algorithms are 
adaptive systems inspired by natural evolution. They can be used as techniques for solving 
complex problems and for searching of large problem spaces. Genetic algorithms are belonging 
to guided random search techniques, which try to find the global optimum. Genetic algorithms 
are working with the set of potential solutions, which is called population. Each solution item 
(individual) is measured by the fitness function. The fitness value represents the quality measure 
of an individual, so the algorithm can select individuals with better genetic material for 
producing new individuals and further generations. 
TABU Search Algorithm to Solve Class Time Table Scheduling Problem: Tabu search uses 
memorized ability to prevent from searching previously visited the area; therefore it is easier to 
obtain an optimal solution in a short time. Here we introducing modified approaches which do 
not allow violations of any hard constraints, and it produces only feasible solutions.

Abstract 
The recent manufacturing encapsulates the globally distributed enterprise resources which requires 
advanced technologies i.e., Internet of things, cloud computing, semantic web and service-oriented 
technologies to establish the effective global manufacturing network. This hinders issues of 
heterogeneous product information related to multi-disciplinary domains, which make the knowledge 
within documents irreconcilable. This paper presents, an automatic feature recognition based cloud 
service platform for a distributed manufacturing environment, which enables the networks to enhance the 
interoperability by seamless exchange of information. The proposed architecture acts as an integrated 
approach that consists of a three layers namely physical resource layer, local server layer, and cloud layer 
as services to meet the requirements of real time distributed manufacturing environment. Moreover, the 
most effective tools and techniques such as transfer protocols, ontology, heuristics, meta-heuristics, 
World Wide Web (www), and extensible markup language (xml) has been used to develop and implement 
the proposed cloud manufacturing platform. The integrated solution proposed in this paper can push 
forward this new paradigm from concept to practice for optimal service recommendation.

1. Introduction
Today’s advanced manufacturing enterprises are becoming worldwide competitors through collaboration, 
innovation, servitisation and sustainability by transforming the current scenario of production-oriented 
manufacturing to service-oriented manufacturing now (Li et al. 2012). Cloud computing, Internet of things, semantic 
web and service-oriented technologies have been identified as key business technology trends that will reshape 
enterprises to reach the world market. The success of many world market manufacturers relies on the distribution of 
their manufacturing capacities over the globe. With a worldwide integration of their distributed product development 
processes and manufacturing operations, they are realizing and taking advantage of the many benefits of resource 
coordination and sharing (Valilai and Houshmand. 2013). How to integrate all these new applications and 
information technologies in a single platform is the expected problem to address in order to establish world 
manufacturing networks of all distributed resources. The objective of this paper is to present a new platform based 
on current solutions to solve problems of integration of distributed manufacturing networks through cloud 
computing.

5. Conclusions and Future work  
 
Recent advances in cloud manufacturing can transform the way enterprises do business. The cloud customers can 
have access to on-demand services, such as design, production, assembling, testing, simulation, and management. A 
cloud based automatic feature recognition platform framework has been proposed in this paper for distributed 
manufacturing environment. To address the issues of heterogeneous knowledge integration, seamless data sharing 
and interoperability the proposed AFR.  In order to make the feature customization easier, the framework separates 
the feature representation and feature recognition, so that applying changes to feature library will not affect the 
feature recognition process. Moreover, the deployment of ontology techniques brings a great flexibility for 
customizing features. 
 
Future research interests may extend network level standardization work on product identification numbers, 
locations, factories, revisions, should be done. Manufacturing enterprises need to develop standard data to support 
working in distributed production. Performance analysis needed to ensure key functionalities of cloud platform  not  
to show any practical difference in long run. Further, data security remains an important research area related to use 
of cloud.

Abstract: 
Six-Sigma is a powerful business strategy that employs a disciplined approach to tackle process 
variability using the application of statistical and non-statistical tools and techniques in a rigorous 
manner. The process quality of six-sigma corresponds to a defect rate of at most 3.4 parts per million 
(ppm). The applications of six-sigma will continue to grow in the forthcoming years. The six-sigma 
concept of process capability indices such as Cp, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk have been considered in this 
research. It provides quantitative measures of process potential and performance. Moreover, based on 
the “sigma level” the various competitive levels have been categorized as world class, industry average, 
and non-competitive industry. It aims to identify the firm performance within these three competitive 
levels at the four process capability indices and see the consequences of these indices. Further, it does 
provide good understanding and foundation for future research. The practitioners and researchers can 
use the procedure to test whether the processes meet the capability requirement. We plan to undertake the 
vast study to verify the framework given in the paper.  
Keywords: Process Capability Indices, Six-Sigma Approach, Competitive Levels 
I. Introduction
The concept of six-sigma quality initiative was evolved in the early 1980s by Motorola. Six-sigma is 
defined by utilizing an extensive set of rigorous tools, advanced mathematical and statistical tools, and a 
well-defined methodology that produce significant results quickly (Raisinghani, 2005). Further, Koch et 
al. (2004) defined six-sigma is a quality philosophy at the highest level, relating to all processes, and a 
quality measure at the lowest level. Motorola was facing the problems related to the loss of quality cost 
which includes not only the 2,600 PPM (parts per million) loss in manufacturing but lost business due to 
defective parts and support of systems in the field that was unreliable (Raisinghani, 2005). To overcome 
on product failure levels, Motorola CEO Bob Galvin tried to address these problems in 1981.  
Later, an engineer at the company Bill Smith found that failure rate of the manufactured products and 
quality level associated with a measure of six-sigma. Subsequently, to minimize and ideally, eliminate 
defects from the manufacturing process, Mike J. Hary introduced six-sigma to Motorola to make their 
customer satisfaction. Thus, six-sigma yield improvement, cost reduction of poor quality, improve 
process capability and process understanding and measure value according to the customer are the key 
elements of result-oriented quality programs. Incidentally, six-sigma in the current manufacturing era 
becomes is being considered as potential and rigorous tools.

at various values. From the table 1, we see that world-class manufacturing firms provide efficient and 
effective way to reduce their product defect rate, increase the yield improvement and reduce the cost of 
poor quality in order to improve the customers need and customer satisfaction. For the adjustment of 
process capabilities of six-sigma on the other hand, the performance level of the industry average and 
non-competitive is lower than world class manufacturing firms. But they try to regulate and improve their 
processes opportunities through systematic measurement to sustain in the current competitive era. Their 
ultimate goal is to enhance the firm’s performance. 
IV. Conclusions and further scope of the study
When the firm levels move from non-competitive to world class, their cost of poor quality and defect rate 
decreases while increase the yield improvement. The study identifies the theoretical concepts of firm 
performance within world-class, industry average, and non-competitive industry over the four process 
capability indices that evaluate the ability of a process to attain within certain limits. The study of Cp, Cpk, 
Cpm, and Cpmk to construct with the more desirable capability and increasing higher values such as various 
range less than 1, equal to 1, range between 1-1.5, and 1.5-2 and greater than 2. After getting the results, 
use the following table below to present the non-conforming parts per million (ppm) for a process 
corresponding to Cp, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk values. We focus on histograms, control charts and probability 
plots for defect rate and Cp, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk and assess properly. Further, the study will focus when the 
difference between USL and LSL is very high, low and centered (centering and spread of the process 
variation). We plan to undertake to explore and verify the framework suggested in this study that will also 
provide a new dimension to the research. Further, it will definitely provide good insights and many 
contributions; through the findings and the results of this research which we will do in future.

Abstract: The horizontal strategy is recommended for conglomerates by Porter (1985) for competitive 
advantage. The conglomerate firms are categorized as ‘horizontal strategy’ and ‘non-horizontal strategy’ 
organizations. According to Porter (1985), there is no established or standard way to execute a 
horizontal strategy. However, it requires advanced organizational capabilities to the execution of 
horizontal strategy in an organization. In this study, we explored the extent to which organizational 
capabilities were related to the implementation of the horizontal strategy. Five novel hypotheses 
addressing primary constructs, namely, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and 
neuroticism are explored in this study. Based on 107 responses from firms across various manufacturing 
and service sectors, the firms are classified as ‘horizontal strategy’ and ‘non-horizontal strategy’. We 
argue through a theoretical analysis which shows that employee attributes (conscientiousness, 
extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism) will be contributing to the success of the 
horizontal strategy and lent good support to our hypotheses.  
Keywords: Horizontal strategy, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, neuroticism 
I. Introduction
The horizontal strategy is one of the most powerful ways to generate sustainable value. It can be defined 
as horizontal strategy is a way of identifying and developing those interrelationships that can create value 
for the organization. The development and execution of the horizontal strategy are not an easy task; it 
requires a strong infrastructure that can support it.   
Moreover, it is not a temporary or one- time activity but it must be executed continuously into the future, 
the otherwise current competitive advantage will disappear, and the firm will quickly lose its 
competencies. There is no standard or established away to execute horizontal strategy; rather it requires 
advanced organizational capabilities because different businesses and people rarely collaborate 
spontaneously without strong control from the corporate functions. From these statements, we perceived 
that organization needs supporting organization culture, structure and strategy for the development of the 
horizontal strategy and it is needed to sustain in the future that can achieve competitive advantage. So, 
organization culture, structure and strategy are the key factors for the development of horizontal strategy

VI. Conclusions and Limitations 
Due to the increasing competition in the business world, the organizations try to sustain their competitive 
advantage. On the other hand, the firms are focused on competing to survive in a complicated and 
uncertain business environment. Consequently, the horizontal strategy is provided the ways to generate 
sustainable value or competitive advantage of the organization. In the study, we considered employee 
attributes (conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism). Further, the study 
establishes the theoretical framework between these variables and horizontal strategic organization in 
conglomerate firms.  Based on the empirical investigation and its analysis, the findings suggest that 
horizontal strategy and non-horizontal strategy groups of conglomerate firms have their different 
identities. Employee behavior and employee attributes are the necessary things for the success of the 
organizations so; we can say that positive employee attributes have been considered as valuable keys to 
focus strategy implementation in any organization. Finally, the hypotheses support to this study that 
indicates the high score of consciousness; extraversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience are 
conducive to the implementation of horizontal strategy whereas a high score of neuroticism is detrimental 
to the performance of the horizontal strategy.  
The main limitations of this study as the business units have been classified based on the respondent’s 
response; that raised the doubt about the feasibility of the results. Another limitation of this study is the 
respondents belong to the top management from different departments of the sample of the conglomerate 
firms. However, to minimize the biasedness in the responses in the future studies, the data needs to be 
collected from multiple levels of organization such as bottom level and supervisory level also.

Abstract: The purpose of this research is to develop a twin objectives formulation considering cost and 
back order minimization of supply chain operational problem faced by Food Corporation of India (FCI). 
Cost minimization problem is a standard LP (Linear Programming) and we consider quadratic objective 
formula for the back order minimization problem which turns out to be NLP (Non Linear Programming). 
We attempt solving NLP by Langrangian relaxation. In this paper, few computational results have been 
given for the representative problems such as overall costs and the total back orders. Based on the 
empirical investigation, we discover many solutions which are obtained that make tradeoffs between 
overall cost and total back orders. In different instances of the problem, the proposed formulation with 
Lagrangian relaxation provides good bound in comparatively less computational time. These solutions 
are of practical value to supply chain managers. The paper will be helpful to any industry in making good 
tradeoffs between total back orders and operational costs. There is a variety of different approaches that 
different constraints of the supply chain problem be relaxed to generate different quality solutions. The 
research provides insight into the differences in the values of Lagrangian relaxation with total back 
orders and operational costs.

I. Introduction
The food grain distribution in India is channeled in two stages where procured or imported/exported 
grains are stored in about 2000 warehouses for the onward issue to the demand points. The base of this 
channel is mainly dependent on rail and road transport which helps to move the stored quantities to the 
necessary points like public distribution for poverty alleviation/employment or household development 
controlled by the state government or army and paramilitary organizations controlled by central 
government.   The public distribution system is established by the government of India for the welfare of 
the poor people by providing subsidized food and food processed items. As of now about 4.99 lakh Fair 
Price Shops (FPS) are distributed across India (Report on Public Distribution System, 2000), that is 
controlled by the ministry of consumer affairs, food, and public distribution and managed jointly with 
state government. But the biggest challenge faced in practice of the food grains supplied by the PDS is 
much less than the consumption needs of the consumer. Besides this, the delayed supply due to the lag of 
proper planning schedule is also a big issue. It has also come in the picture that the PDS has been biased 
to urban people ignoring the remote and poorer sections of the population in their needs. From 
procurement point Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, MP, and UP & Chhattisgarh. Punjab, Haryana, and 
MP are the major wheat surplus states where Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Haryana play the 
major role in rice surplus states in India. From state to more granular level, procurement is done either 
from the farmers directly or by the agents (Arhtias) in the mandis. At the starting of every season, the 
Government of India fixes the minimum support price (MSP) to procure the food grain to maintain 
uniformity across the country. In general, the greater the desired price stability, the greater the quantities 
that public agencies would need to hold in storage (Gulati et al., 1996). The implementation of the process 
is very old-fashioned. As of now, FCI is managing the entire exercise of movement by a manual process 
with the vast practical knowledge acquired by the planners over the years. So, in case of railways, the

V. Conclusion and future research 
We have proposed a solution set that optimizes both the values when the overall costs decreased then 
back orders are increased and vice-versa. This optimal solution is getting by using Lagrangian relaxation 
method. We decomposed the combined formulation into two different subproblems and solved it for 
different instances. Here the efficiency of decomposition approach for warehouse stages is shown in 
terms of the time and lower bound for backorder is obtained. In all the different instances of the problem 
the proposed formulation with Lagrangian relaxation provides good bound in comparatively less 
computational time. This method is compared to LDR rules (Holt et al, 1960) that it minimizes the 
quadratic problem statement into a linear function. From the results, we can see that quantity supplied to 
various big warehouses can be calculated. These values have been calculated considering the given 
constraints and they minimize the total backorder. 
For future work, different obstacles are still left, as we have mentioned in the research problem, which 
can be included in the model. Few of them are: (1) no proper number of warehouses to procure food 
grain; (2) no circulation of food grains; (3) delay of rail; (4) high lead time; (5) no manpower; (6) gap 
between planned and actual movement and; (7) poor infrastructure which are faced by FCI as well as 
Indian Railway. For these, we can suggest FCI and Indian Railway develop the new warehouses at certain 
places to fulfill the demand of PDS without delay and these changes will give a different feasible solution 
in order to minimize the wastage of food grain. We propose for future work that different constraints of 
the supply chain problem be relaxed to generate different quality solutions. These may be compared with 
Linear Decision Rule type of methodology applied to NLP by Singh (2012). Also, we can change 
different parameters of LR such as step size; starting values of multipliers, halving of a parameter of LR 
etc that are making good tradeoffs between back orders and operational cost.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to analyze the loss and improve the quality of bread process using 
techniques Lean Six Sigma. . Throughout Cooperative and Work Integrated Education Program (CWIE), 
CWIE members that included a student, an academic supervisor and a job mentor worked together for 6 
months for above matter. By analyzing current operations with Value Stream Mapping and rely on Failure 
Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to analyze the problem in the process. On dough cutting process with 
low process capability (Cpk), bread weight was lost due to reserved weight. In addition, the loss of 
packaging material, plastic bag, on automatic form-fill- sealing process. From two above steps, the design 
of experiment was applied to find the suitable working conditions. On dough cutting process, dough weight 
and block pusher distance were found as significant main factor influencing to the unequal of bread weight 
(α=0.05). On the filling and sealing process, improper labelling and sealing were found. Cause and Effect 
Diagram was deployed to analyze and determine potential factors. The strength of wind to open lip bag, the 
height of the sealer and hardness of bread were main significant factors affecting to the seal process quality. 
CWIE members together designed and performed experiments to find the optimal conditions on above 
processes. After implementing the result of study to process control, the standard deviation was decreased 
from 6.7 to 3.3, the average net weight was closer to target value. Process capability (Cpk) was improved, 
while packaging loss could be reduced from 3.45% to 1.725%.

Abstract 
The clogged pipe problem in thickness chicken soup manufacturing affecting to production time loss and 
microorganism contamination risk in food manufacturing. Moreover operators could be accidently injured 
during cleaning and changing equipment. The objective of this study was to improve filtering process in 
order to reduce ingredient clogged. Throughout Cooperative and Work Integaretd Education Program 
(CWIE), CWIE team mebers that included a student, an academic supervisor and a job mentor  worked 
together for 6 months for above matter. Cause and effect daigram was created for discussion before One-
Way ANOVA was applied. Rough grinding pepper contained in chicken seasoning powder used in 
thickness chicken soup production was found as the most serious reason. Alternative form of pepper, fine 
grinding pepper, was prepared and applied to improve filtering process. After using fine grinding pepper, 
number of times for cleaning due to clogged pipe problem was reduced. Products attribute with new 
ingredient was analyzed through sensory evaluation. Multi-sample test and 9-Point Hedonic Scaling test 
were deployed for different test and acceptance test respectively (=0.05) and we found that consumers 
accepted new products and no different between new product from control. Furthermore, production time could 
be saved and operators could work conveniently. In addition, likelihood for cross- contamination could be 
reduced.

Abstract 
In the new context of globalization, large manufacturing companies are forced to improve their 
production processes, so they need to design and apply methodologies that align with this trend. 
However, these practices are not applied in SMEs with similar problems, which mainly influence the 
timely delivery of their products and especially in the metal mechanic sector. 
Therefore, this article proposes the design of an integration model of Lean Tools and Knowledge 
Management, whose methodology is composed of 4 phases; in phase 0, the awareness and analysis of the 
current situation is carried out, in the first phase knowledge management is applied (design, development, 
implementation and sustainability), in phase 2, the Lean tools are implemented, initiating the application 
of the 5's, followed by standardized work and then by Total Productive Maintenance; finally in phase 3, 
the analysis and control of the results obtained. The model was validated in a metal-mechanic SME in 
Peru where an increase in production of 20% was obtained, an improvement of 30% in the training and 
training of the person and a 14% improvement in the overall efficiency of the team.

Introduction
The large companies in the manufacturing sector have continuous problems in their production process,
due to this, they believe in the need to be sustainable and sensitive to the demands of the market. These
manufacturing companies make such improvements in order to create more value for customers, increase
their performance and lower their costs.
Small and medium-sized companies are not unaware of these problems; however, very few of them
implement improvement tools or methodologies, although they are prominent among all organizations,
since they play an important role in the manufacture of products and services acquired by society and
large companies [1].
That is why SMEs are considered as the basis of economic growth in a country. In Peru, these companies
represent more than 90% of the total [2]; however, they have a higher rate of problems in their production
processes compared to large companies.
Despite the flexibility of SMEs, in the case of companies in the metal-mechanic sector, these problems
are manifested as follows: disorderly environment, low quality, defective parts, reprocessing and stock
breakage that generate low productivity [3]. Likewise, the lack of knowledge in the collaborators both in
the production processes and in the application of improvement methodologies also cause the
aforementioned problems.
For this reason, SMEs currently show great interest in issues of Continuous Improvement and the creation
of Knowledge. A series of studies indicate that a modern methodology for the improvement of the
aforementioned problems is the Lean Manufacturing, these studies indicate that their implementation

6. Conclusions 
The model applied had positive consequences for the company, because it added to its processes tools that 
helped improve the performance of the company, where the innovative contribution of the model was 
Knowledge Management because it allowed us to analyze the entire production process and employee 
training for the correct application of Lean tools. 
The application of the 5's allowed to have a suitable environment for workers and prepared the company 
for the implementation of the following tools.  
It was also shown that the application of the TPM pillar had positive results where OEE had an 
improvement of 72% to 86%. Likewise, indicators were developed to demonstrate the improvement in the 
company, the main indicator is the% on-time delivery which increased 14%. 
Finally, concluding with the validation of the model could get a nice and clean environment, operators 
were more reasons and engaged in productive processes since they had more knowledge of it.

Abstract 
Global warming is an environmental problem that is a major issue in the world. Alternative solutions to 
minimize the impact of global warming is the use of alternative energy or saving the consumption of 
energy, especially in the production process in the industry. Efficiency in energy consumption is expected 
to reduce production costs and solve problems of global warming. This study purposes to audit the 
consumption of electrical energy in weaving division AJL 2, PT. Damatex. In the weaving division AJL 
2, PT. Damatex alleged to happen waste of energy consumptions. This is indicated by the ratio of energy 
use 0.791 kWh per day. Meanwhile, the company's energy usage ratio target is 0.74 kWh. In these 
conditions, the weaving division AJL 2 only produced for 31 162 yards/day, while the production target 
of 34,500 yards/day. It is necessary for efforts to minimize the use of electrical energy, in order to know 
the profile of electricity usage, the intensity of energy consumption (IKE), the waste of energy and 
energy-saving opportunities. This study uses green value stream mapping to determine green waste, 
especially waste in the usage of electrical energy. Based on the audit results obtained IKE annual value of 
0.7789 kWh/yard, so we need to optimize energy conservation and lower the energy consumption of the 
company.

Abstract 
Our team has redesigned the 3 chips game into the 4 chips game. 4 chips game strategy is more 
complex than the previous 3 chips game. To do that extension, we fully utilized our knowledge 
of JAVA to create a program that could quickly and accurately represent each of our hypothesis. 
Three cases including the random pick, with 3 chips rules and with 4 chips rules are explored. 
We then compared the results of the program to our predictive model for further improvement. 
Our team still went through the standard Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing phases, 
though the time spent on each phase was greatly reduced. This project is excellent practice for 
how to apply Java programming and statistics for the complex real-world problems.

1.0 Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to expand the model our team created last year. This project, unlike our last one, forces 
us to fully utilize our resources, like the computer, since it is impossible for us to calculate everything by hand. In 
the previous paper, we had hoped that the program we had created could be used in medical research, but that was 
not possible.  However, since we could have more experience with the computer and JAVA this year, our program 
has become more advanced, and is able to incorporate more rules than before. 
2.0 Design of the “4-chips” Game 
For a quick review of the previous 3 chip game. The basic law is each 2 players play take turns to pick the one of 
more chips from the same color and who pick the last one is the winner. The sample space for the (6, 8, 10) 3 chips 
game is 480 and we can manually calculate the probability for each case. When we extend the game in to 4 chip 
game, for example, (6, 8, 10, 12) the sample space is 12X. The rules are more complex than 3 chips and the results 
are harder to predict. When we extend the game, the problem is more like real-world problem.  
Therefore, we have redesigned the 3-chips game to the 4-chips game and here are the basic laws of the 4 chips 
game:  
1.
There are four groups of chips with different number and color in each group as the initial game condition
(e.g.  12 Blue chips, 10 Red chips, 8 Yellow chips, 6 Green chips).  The initial condition can be randomly
assigned as long as there is NO identical number of chips in any two groups such as (X, X, Y, Z).
2.
There are three types of players (Player Type A, Player Type B and Player Type C) who will play each
other.  One player will go first, and then two players will take turns until completed the game.  Player Type
A is not aware of any game rules, which means it's chip selection is completely random.  Player Type B is
aware of the 3 chips game rule, and Player C is aware of both 3 chip game rules and the additional 4 chip
rules.

means it does not regard the whole group, the plays in which it affected was not as significant compared to 3 chip 
game model. As for Case III, with Player C knowing the newly added rule 5, which unlike rule 1-4, took in 
consideration of the whole chip set. With it evaluating the whole group, the chance of it being applied is greater than 
Case II’s rules. 
 
● 
Sequential Bias isn't as significant with a larger data space (chips) 
● 
The 3 chip game rules that only applied in the end affected the winning probability very much. As both 
players are randomly picking beforehand. 
● 
The 4 chip game rule, used in Case III in addition to 3 chip game rules showed more of a significant impact 
on the winning probability as it has more chance of being used, unlike the old 3 chip rules.

Team has successfully built a predictive model to simulate the winning probability on three Cases. 
●
There is no significant evidence showing the playing sequence would impact the winning result.  This
result is making sense since we are assuming all events are independent.  This independency should be
more accurate when we have more chips in the pool.
●
Player B (knowing four rules) has a much higher winning probability (> 95% chance) over Play A (playing
blindly).  Our predictive model can accurately predict the winning probability if we can take 5 or 6 rounds.
●
Team has conducted the sample size calculation in order to draw a statistical conclusion to verify the two
hypotheses.  Developing a Java programming has significantly reduced our effort to collect data to validate
our predictive model.
5. Future Work Opportunities
Team has built a very basic Java model to simulate the Powerball Probability.  Team could have done it better on the 
following future opportunities: 
●
Consider the Prize Model to adjust the expected value and the probability uniformity across bigger prizes
●
Search the historical tickets-sold amount distribution to more accurately simulate the No-Jackpot
probability
●
Analyze the Roll-Over pattern on the tickets sold amount to more accurately predict the Jackpot Amount
distributions
●
Build a model of two Mega Balls to create an even bigger Jackpot.
●
Compare Powerball to other Lotto like Mega Millions or Super Lotto

Abstract 
For an assembly line, one of the main concerns is how they distribute operations in order to achieve takt 
times. Nowadays the complexity of assembly operations don’t allow the company to maintain a work 
balance which affects the inequity of the work stations’ time and also generates non value added activities 
that is reflected in the total cycle time. The manufacturing plant of this study manually produces bus 
chassis, and has two assembly lines: urban chassis (UC) and foreign chassis (FC). Currently, the total of 
value added activities in the production process is 43%. The purpose of this research paper is to increase 
this value to 58% and balance the workload so each station operates within their assigned takt time (25 
minutes UC and 250 minutes FC). In order to achieve this paper’s main objective, the research team used 
a Lean Six Sigma approach and DMAIC methodology. The activities completed were the reduction or 
elimination of non value added activities to generate a balancing proposal and validate it through 
simulation. This paper is relevant for operations management professionals since it represents one of the 
most studied issues in manufacturing assembly lines, and provides an integrated approach combining 
different tools to solve this problem in a multinational company.

1. Introduction
1.1 The case study company 
PT XYZ is an Indonesia pioneer company which produces 13 types cement board in different thickness. In a good 
warehouse management, the layout of the finished good warehouse is a very important to support effective delivery. 
The first problem found in PT XYZ is the layout of the finished good warehouse was messy and irregular. The finished 
goods of many types which have been produced and ready to be delivered to customers will be placed in the finished 
good warehouse. The finished products which passed the sorting stage are placed irregularly by the warehouse 
operators and there is no barrier between one type product to another type. The best-selling product is scattered into 
multiple areas and quite far from input or output (I/O) point. The finished products are also placed without following 
the principle of first in first out (FIFO) so there is a possibility of expired or damaged then become rejected. The 
second problem found in The PT XYZ is warehouse operators scheduling. Three shift warehouse operators work five 
days follow with two off-days. In high customer demand season, warehouse management order operators an overtime 
and replace the off-day into next week. Warehouse operators scheduling is less likely to anticipate the possibilities 
that occur so the scheduling system has not been effective. In results, January 2017 the overtime spent 1083 hours. 
2 The Literature Review 
Warehousing can be defined by three functions: (1) receiving goods from a source, (2) storing goods until they are 
needed by a customer (internal or external), and (3) retrieving the goods when requested [1]. The successful warehouse 
layouts must accomplish the following objectives, regardless of the material being stored: (1) maximize the use of 
space; (2) maximize the use of equipment; (3) maximize the use of labor; (4) maximize accessibility to all items; (5) 
maximize protection of all items. The objective of this case study is to increase the efficiency and effective warehouse 
management thru reduce overtime. In order to reach the goals, several methods were combined. First, a combination 
of Class-Based storage, Dedicated storage policy and From-to-Chart method to a re-layout warehouse. Secondly, the

4.4 Warehouse operator Scheduling System with the Modification of Tibrewala, Philippe, and Browne 
Based on the current scheduling and the worker needed per day, the new scheduling of warehouse operator used the 
modification of Tibrewala, Philippe, and Browne algorithm was calculated, the result on Table 3, show that there are 
85 iterations which means 85 warehouse operators needed instead of 87. PT XYZ is advised to reduce two operators.

4.5. Discussion Result. 
Proposed layout has been implemented step by step in PT XYZ. Cycle time comparison per product taking per pallet 
using forklift with previous layout is 3,33 minutes and implemented proposed layout has been reduced cycle time to 
be 1,86 minutes. Overtime was reduced during implementation period February 2017 to June 2017. The monthly 
benefit of efficient and effective warehouse system for PT XYZ, among others are saving overtime cost 937 hours ( 
equivalent to IDR 38 million), reduce 2 operators ( equivalent to 8 million), reduce forklift distance and time. 
Table 4 Reduced overtime 
5. Conclusion, Research limitation and Future research
This research has been proposed new warehouse layout. The implementation of new layout and warehouse 
systems has been increased the warehouse performance. In June 2017, cycle time reduce to be 1,86 second, overtime 
only 146 hours and warehouse empty space increase 48,66%. 
This research was conducted only at Company PT XYZ, which is a popular cement board national company 
in Indonesia. The findings of this study cannot be generalized to the whole cement board industry in Indonesia. Small 
and medium-sized companies may have different layout and may even have different warehouse systems.  
Future research can be done to find the difference warehouse system and layout between small and medium-
sized cement board companies in Indonesia.

Abstract 
If there is an unexpected event in the supply chain, it will disturb material flow. The occurrence of such 
interference would have caused loss of both time and cost. In order to anticipate this situation, it needs 
proper supply chain risk management. Method are used in this research is Fuzzy House of Risk (FHOR). 
FHOR is combination of fuzzy reasoning risk assessment model and house of risk. House of Risk Method 
is used to identify the most potential risk agents, while the fuzzy reasoning risk assessment model is used 
to determine the risk severity by risk agents. The proposed method was implemented in a real case study 
in wooden toy industries which has wide marketing range. Based on the result and analysis, it is found 
that risk agent stock out of the product is the most potential risk agent. To reduce the impact, 
recommended mitigation strategies that can be used for stock out product risk agents in werehouse are 
flexible supply base, safety stock, internal coordination, as well as create and control production 
schedules.

Abstract 
Probit models with spatial dependencies were first studied by McMillen (1992), where an EM Algorithm 
was developed to produce consistent (maximum likelihood) estimates for these models. In spatial 
autoregressive probit model, the spatial dependent structure adds complexity in the estimation of 
parameters. LeSage and Smith (2001) use Bayesian estimation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods 
that sample sequentially from the complete set of conditional distributions for all parameters. Klier and 
McMillen (2008) have proposed a linearized version of the GMM estimator that avoids the infeasible 
problem of inverting n-by-n matrices when employing large samples. They show that standard GMM 
reduces to a nonlinear two-stage least squares problem. Martinetti and Geniaux (2017) proposed 
approximate likelihood estimation which based on the full maximization of likelihood of an approximate 
multivariate normal distribution function. We use some extensive simulation for these methods and show 
the best estimation method which can handle sample sizes with many observations and various value of 
coefficient spatial lag, provided the spatial weight matrix is inconvenient sparse form, as is for large data 
sets, where each observation neighbours only a few other observations.

Abstract 
Poisson regression is used to find the relationship between independent and dependent variables 
that is distributed by poisson and have equidispersion assumption where have same value for mean 
and variance. In its application, Excess Zero occurs in data, this will cause overdispersion such as 
mean value greater than variant, then the Poisson regression can no longer handle it, so that other 
method is needed to correct the deficiencies. Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression (ZIP) is a method 
that can handle the problem globally, if the data of each observation location influenced by spatial 
effects that are not always homogeneous variations at each location of observation or called spatial 
heterogeneity caused by several things such as differences in geographic, socio-cultural conditions, 
to different economic policies at each location. This will be a problem if the data is still analyzed 
without regard to both of them simultaneously. In this study consider these two things into a 
Geographycally Weighted Zero Inflated Poisson Regresion (GWZIPR) model to handle both of 
these. And applied to cases of infectious diseases in West Java province 2014, and compared with 
other models. From the calculation results can be that the value of AIC GWZIPR smaller than 
other methods.

Abstract 
Railway transit operations in the Philippines are affected with numerous operational problems such as 
service interruptions and insufficient train coaches.  These result to long queue of passengers in the 
station, passengers feeling anxious to be late in work and clamor of riding customers to replace the 
existing maintenance service provider of the railway transit.  These scenarios have been regular 
occurrences specifically in a Metro Manila railway transit that traverses from Quezon City to Pasay City. 
To reduce the occurrences of these problems, this paper proposes to establish a computerized 
maintenance management system for the railway transit. To implement this, the researchers assessed the 
current maintenance system of the railway transit; identified causes affecting its maintenance system; 
developed an improved maintenance system of the railway transit comprising the maintenance planning, 
maintenance scheduling, performance measurement and spare parts management, and proposed a 
computerized maintenance management system for the railway transit.  All of these were integrated to 
come up with a computerized maintenance management system for the railway transit.  This 
computerized maintenance management system can effectively reduce service interruptions and improve 
the railway transit’s service performance.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the Philippine government has been pushing to improve the transportation system in the country 
through various infrastructure project (Dato, 2010).  Rail transport in the Philippines is mostly used as to main 
transport mode of passengers in Metro Manila. Based on the data provided by the Philippine statistics authority on 
2010 to 2015, The Metro Manila railway transit has the highest number of passengers which is 174.5 million and has 
an average daily passengers of 369,838 (PhilippineStatisticsAuthority, 2015). 
Service interruption incidents during revenue hours are a common problem encountered by many commuters in 
riding the railway transit that affects the railway’s systems up time. Under the contract with the service maintenance 
provider and the transit railway’s management from January 2016 to February 2017, a total service interruption 
duration of 76 hours and 15 minutes from trouble shooting until getting the job clearance from the railway transit ‘s 
control center was recorded. Service interruptions causes delay of trips, long lines, and inconvenience (Ello, Paed, & 
De Goma, 2010).  
Many studies on railway systems have been conducted in other countries which include railway reliability and its 
effects, such as the relationship between reliability and productivity in railroad services (Huissaman, 2005), the 
importance of railway reliability to convince drivers of passenger vehicles to switch to public transport (Erhart & 
Palmera, 2006), the effect of unreliability on travel time (Marin, 2014), and the effect of reliability on the 
availability of the service (Cheng & Tsao, 2007). Railway reliability can be measured in different ways, such as the 
punctuality of the service, cancellations and delays, and the number of realized connections between trains.

availability of the repaired rolling stock cars was only 36%.  This signifies that almost 64% of the time the parts are 
broken down.  Table 5 shows the details. 
 
Since the service interruptions of the railway transit become a regular event, a survey was conducted to assess the 
quality service provided by the railway transit and the service maintenance provider.  The results are shown in Table 
6.  The results indicated that the majority of the service quality dimensions are critical to the users of the railway 
transit.  Reliability dimension showed the most critical both among the respondents of the railway transit and 
commuters.  This means that this aspect of service quality dimension is not given importance by management of the 
railway transit or by the service maintenance provider.      
 
In the why-why analysis, the main cause was the delay in preparing the needed spare parts and equipment for repair, 
information delay during service interruption and delay in preparing job order. The delay in preparing the needed 
spare parts for repair was due to unavailability of parts in the station because these items were not replenished on 
time.  Furthermore, this results the inadequacy of monitoring availability of supply of the spare parts in the station.  
This is further compounded by the fact that records are only inputted in the logbook.  The communication system 
between the railway transit and service maintenance provider is inadequate because the communication is only 
through two-way radio or phone call.  The delay in preparation of job order was due to the manual recording of 
service interruption incident reports.  Moreover, the compilation of maintenance records was done manually.  
 
The designated counter measures were elaborated through the use of how-how analysis as presented in Table 7.  To 
address these issues, an automated system is to be proposed in order to monitor the maintenance activities so that 
management is readily informed on issues that may happen on the day-to-day activities.    
 
In software design, the results of the house of quality was used to identify the customer requirements.  These 
requirements are convenience, easy access, monitoring of cars, scheduling of the cars, spare parts management, easy 
communication system and early responsiveness.  
 
The proposed spare parts repair/replacement decision of critical components was identified as shown in Table 8.  
Moreover, the economic order quantity of each critical components were also determine to maintain availability of 
parts at any given time. Also the scheduling of preventive maintenance and corrective measures were also 
determined.  These data are relevant in the development of the proposed computerized maintenance management 
system (CMMS).  
 
The proposed computerized maintenance management system has six corresponding modules for the system: 
Dashboard, workflow, spare parts management, scheduling, monitoring, and add user.  
 
All maintenance procedures conducted are automatically stored in the system once the job is done. Spare parts 
module contains the monitoring of spare parts when re-order point is reached by each component and the purchase 
order when needed for replenishment of materials. Scheduling includes the proposed schedule using the results of 
the mean time before failure (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) for preventive maintenance schedules and 
applying the Shinkansen Inspection System of Japan. The monitoring module includes the color-coded visualization 
of cars, green for running cars, red for cars interrupted and yellow for scheduled maintenance system for cars. Add-
user module includes the adding of users by the administrator which enable the user to login and use the system.  
These modules are shown in Figures 1 to 9 
 
The researchers provided a user manual which contains the step-by-step procedures on how to use the CMMS. The 
manual includes the eleven functions which are: Login, Dashboard, Work Flow: Rolling Stocks, Work Flow: 
Tracks, Work Flow: Overhead Centenary System, Spare Parts: Spare Parts Management, Spare Parts Purchase 
Order, Scheduling, Monitoring: Train Status and Add User. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
 
This paper presents the current maintenance system of the railway transit in Metro Manila. Based on the tools used 
to analyze the issues faced by the railway transit and the service maintenance provider, a computerized maintenance 
management system (CMMS) is proposed.  The CMMS provides a more systematic way of a faster resolution of 
service interruptions that will result to an increased uptime of the train operations.  Furthermore, the CMMS is only

a part of the improvement opportunities but there is also a need to look into the efficiency of the train system 
particularly in investing on new technology to improve the services of the railway transit.  These plan of actions will 
result to a higher satisfaction level of customers.   
 
To further enhance the application of the computerized maintenance management system, further study on the 
applicability of transforming the existing railway transit system to a more high technology based railway transit 
system should be looked into.  Moreover, it is important that a benchmark study on the railway transit systems from 
other countries should be considered.

Abstract 
The study aimed to develop an ergonomic intervention in manual material handling to prevent 
work related musculoskeletal disorder. This study also identifies the demographic profile of the 
respondents and it has found out that the most of the respondents were 31-40 years old, 1-5 years 
in service in the warehouse, and with an average of 56-60 kgs. The researcher evaluated the 
manual material handling activities and the results revealed that individual capacity and training 
had highest composite mean. The level of physical discomfort experienced was also determined. 
The results showed that lower part had the highest composite mean and experienced moderate 
pain, while the upper part had the lowest composite mean and experienced moderate pain. The 
(NIOSH) was used as ergonomic tools to assess the manual material handling and the result had 
composite lifting index of 1.33 which means that the lift grouping is risky Furthermore, The 
study also revealed that there is a significant relationship of lower and upper body discomfort 
and demographic profile and of the respondents who perform manual material handling task. 
And based on the findings of the study, the researchers recommend ergonomics intervention plan 
to improve the manual material handling activities.

Abstract: This paper critically investigates the various factors which influence the overall availability of 
the manufacturing plant. It also describes the different RAM tools, techniques and methods which are 
qualitative, quantitative and commercially available software(s) to support RAM studies and the 
integrated current approaches in conceptual process design. A number of concerned literatures taken from 
the last few decades that provide a detailed survey of topics including reliability-availability analysis 
methods. In the last section of paper, an attempt is also made to give directive model for research on 
focused area using an  optimal  reliability tools under certain  resource constraints. 
Key words: RAM Tools, Complex Process, Decision support system, Simulation.  
1. INTRODUCTION: The changing business environment and a long list of failures and associated effects
from history sheet drawn the attention of business leaders and practitioners to find the ways of cost savings, revenue
improvement, safe and highly reliable quality product available on demand. An estimate says the revenue lost due to
unexpected shutdowns of plant can range from $500-$100000 per hour (Tan and Kramer, 1997). This paper focused
on RAM tools that include variety of methods, both qualitative and quantitative, and commercially available
software supporting RAM studies.
Reliability is the ability of an item to perform a required function, under given environmental and operational
conditions and for stated period of time (BS4778,1991).
Maintainability is the ability of an item, under stated conditions of use, to be retained in, or restored to a state in
which it can perform its required functions when maintenance is performed under stated conditions and using
prescribed procedures and resources (BS4778, 1991). Availability, in general, is defined as the ability of an item to
perform its required function at a stated instant of a time or over a stated period of time (BS4778, 1991). Plant
availability is a function of the reliability and maintainability i.e., A=f(R, M). Therefore, it is clear from the
definition of availability that a process engineer can improve the plant availability at the design stage by either
increasing reliability or maintainability or both. Complex systems are characterized by large network of links
between components or by statistical dependence between the component states. Some typical examples of  process
industries  having  complex  systems are  food,  beverage,  chemical, pharmaceutical, consumer packaged goods,
biotechnology industries, gas-and power-distribution etc(Narendra & Tewari,2016).
2. LITERATURE SURVEY AND REVIEW
In literature a number of review papers have appeared in the last few decades that provide a detailed survey of topics

Abstract 
There are growing demands for Machinery health monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery to 
lower unscheduled breakdown. Gearboxes are one of the fundamental components of rotating machinery; 
their faults identification and classification always draw a lot of attention. However, non-stationary 
vibration signals and low energy of weak faults makes this task challenging in many cases. Thus, a new 
fault diagnosis method which combines the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), time frequency 
method, and self-organizing feature extraction machine learning approach is proposed in this paper. In 
particular, efficient feature extraction and feature selection is a key issue to automatic condition 
monitoring and fault diagnosis processes. To focus on such issues, this paper presents a research study to 
formulate an real-time prediction method using vibration signals of various gears conditions that uses 
empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique to extract features and select the predominant features 
by using various classification algorithms.

1. Introduction
Technology of solar and wind energies in recent years has progressed a lot and countries have often turned to one of 
these two energies in accordance with the position and potential of their region; So that in some regions of the 
world, a large percentage of the needed electricity supplied by the help of these energies (Garcia-Heller and Paredes, 
2016). On the other hand, in researchers’ idea, lead-acid batteries are the most suitable option for short-term energy 
storage which cannot be used for long-term storage (Solomon et al., 2016). So, in the long term, by converting 
electrical energy into hydrogen by electrolyzer, it can be stored as fuel for fuel cells for future usage (Giuseppe 
Mura et al., 2015). The high energy density of hydrogen has caused this element to be considered as a potentially 
reliable energy carrier. In addition, hydrogen is a clean fuel and this makes it extremely beneficial for achieving a 
sustainable environment (Ehteshami et al., 2016). The energy required for hydrogen production can be provided by 
traditional generators, nuclear reactors or renewable sources (Boudries et al., 2014). The use of alternative energy 
sources such as solar and wind power can be a good option for hydrogen production; but in addition to low energy 
efficiency and high cost, these systems are fully dependent on climatic conditions and this dependence complicates

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to provide a mathematical model for determination of optimal wind power 
price in the case of construction of new off-grid connected wind power plants is different areas. The 
proposed model is based upon 9 criteria including: construction cost, side costs (cost of replacement, 
maintenance, and repairs), pollution, electricity generation, profit, renewability level, green economy, rate 
of return on investment, and consumption. First, the inputs of the mathematical model were obtained by 
technical-economic feasibility evaluation of the study areas in the software Homer using the 10-year wind 
speed data (2006-2016). The optimal wind power prices were then determined in three different modes by 
solving the mathematical model with MATLAB. The modes considered in optimization were the 
construction of 1, 2, and 3 wind power plants in the study areas. Simulation of construction of wind 
power plants in each mode was conducted in the software Homer. The proposed mathematical model was 
found to have sufficient capability in determination of optimal wind power price

1. Introduction
Recent years has witnessed a steady increase in the share of renewable energies in the world's energy portfolio; an 
increase that has contributed not only to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but also to diversification and 
security of energy supplies and growth of business and employment in renewable energy industry (Qolipour et al., 
2017; Alavi et al., 2016). Despite the high potentials of a variety of renewable energies in Iran, inadequate pricing 
and access to relatively cheap oil and gas resources have impeded the progress of renewable energies in this country 
(Rezaei-Shouroki et al., 2017). In the past 15 years, guaranteed purchase of renewable electricity has been as 
common support measure in many countries. This practice is relatively new in Iran and investment in this sector 
under current situation is not cost-effective (Ghaith et al., 2017). It has been shown that pricing is one of the key 
factors of promotion and success of renewable energies. Renewable energy pricing is identical to fossil energy 
pricing except that it also takes account of environmental impacts of fossil fuel (Qiu et al., 2017). 
Price is a numerical quantity representing the value of a commodity relative to others, so pricing of a product may 
serve as an incentive for both investors and consumers (Wang & li, 2015). In addition, there is a close association 
between price, consumption, and sectorial development. This association also applies to wind energy, so proper 
wind power pricing leads to a stable power generation sector and better motivation and organization of small and

Mode 4: construction of more than 3 new wind power plants 
In this case study, this mode exceeded the applicant of areas, so construction analysis and power price optimization 
were not carried out. This mode can be used for simultaneous optimization of renewable electricity price and 
construction of new wind power plants in larger regions, which will be discussed in future study. 
5. Conclusion
The aim of the present study was to facilitate the simultaneous optimization of renewable electricity price and 
construction of new isolated wind power plants in different areas of a region with the help of mathematical 
modeling. In the case study, three areas, Taze-Abad, Sumar and Gilan-Gharb (in the order of their wind energy 
potential) were selected as candidate for construction of isolated wind power plants in Kermanshah. This study 
attempted to optimize the price of electricity generated from wind power plants such that maximum profit from the 
sales of new and existing plant and also applicant satisfaction would be ensured. For this purpose, a mathematical 
model was introduced for determination of optimal wind power price according to the number and capacity of wind 
power plants based on 9 features including: construction cost, side cost (cost of replacement, maintenance and 
repairs), pollution, electricity generation, profit, renewability level, green economy, rate of return on investment, and 
consumption. The case study was conducted by considering the possibility of building one, two or three wind power 
plants in abovementioned areas of western Kermanshah. Plant construction simulation was conducted by the Homer 
software, and all three modes of the mathematical models were coded in MATLAB. First, the 10 years wind speed 
data (2006-2016) of these three areas was used for evaluation of technical-economic feasibility of wind power plants 
by simulation in Homer, and then software outputs were used for solution of mathematical model in MATLAB. The 
results showed that building only 1 wind power plant will result in an optimal power price of 0.159 $ per kilowatt, 
and simultaneous construction of two wind power plants will result in an optimal price of 0.151 $ per kilowatt. In 
the third mode, simultaneous construction of three wind power plants was found to result in an optimal price of 
0.140 $ per kilowatt. In conclusion, the proposed mathematical model was found to have sufficient capability in 
optimization of wind power price.

Abstract 
Effective management of risks is essential for reducing the vulnerability of the supply chain. Supply risk 
management is the most basic concept of the supply-chain risk management; therefore, this study 
examines this subject by developing a mathematical model consisting of a set of equations to quantify 
typical risk such as delayed delivery, substandard quality, natural disasters, and financial risk of the 
supplier. This model designed to select and allocate orders to suppliers to minimize the supply risk 
imposed by the mentioned risk factors. A fuzzy order function is used to turn this crisp model into a fuzzy 
supply chain risk assessment model. The defuzzified solutions of the fuzzy model show significant 
improvements over the result of crisp model. Uncertainty in supply chain and intense competitiveness 
between organizations and managers create different challenges. New management approaches are used 
to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of organizations. The results show that the fuzzy model yields 
better results compared to the deterministic model. Moreover, it shows that the ability of the model for 
activities risk control is improved. The work presented addresses the same challenging problems that 
others have tried to address but the methodology presented in this paper is more efficient in terms of 
execution performance and accuracy.

1. Introduction
Due to the increased uncertainty in the supply chain and related factors such as politics, fluctuations in demand, 
technological change, financial instability and natural disasters to reduce vulnerability and increase the sustainability 
of their supply chain, organizations have to spend resources to predict demand, supply and internal uncertainty. 
These uncertainties and risk factors led to the introduction of risk management in the field of supply chain (Vanany 
et al., 2009). The presence of risk as well as failure in the supply chain can have significant impacts on short-term 
performance and long-term negative impacts on the financial performance of the organization. Therefore, supply 
chain risk management is essential to reduce the failures due to various risks such as uncertain economic cycles, 
uncertain customer demand and unpredictable natural and human disasters, etc. (Tang, 2006; Aven, 2011). Risk 
management involves identification, assessment and ranking of different risks. One of the pillars of risk 
management is the risk assessment aimed to measure risks based on various factors such as the impact and 
probability of occurrence; the higher accuracy in the results of this stage, guarantees elevated confidence level of the 
risk management process (Choudhry & Iqbal, 2013; Goh, 2013). Ranking risks is the key factor for this process; 
because ranking determines the superiority of a risk over others and thus the decision maker can plan about the

Abstract 
Solar Water Heating (SWH) refers to the process of providing hot water with the help of solar energy. 
There is a strong potential for implementing of solar water heaters in Iran. Yazd is a province in Iran 
which has a great potential for solar energy. The purpose of this research is to identify and prioritize the 
factors associated with the use of SWH systems in Yazd province. The required data is collected using 
questionnaire which is then processed with SPSS software and confirmatory factor analysis method. The 
suitability of data for factor analysis is investigated with KMO and Bartlett’s sphericity tests and then 
components (factors) and subcomponents (items) are obtained with the help of Scree test. The results of 
analyses on the factors associated with the construction and operation of solar water heaters indicate that 
environmental issues have direct effect on the use of solar water heater and the effects of other factors are 
indirect. Also, according to the results, financial support of the government has the biggest effect on 
implementation of SWH.

1. Introduction
While being economic and easy to use, traditional energy sources such as oil, coal and natural gas have well-known 
adverse effects on environment and human being. Fossil fuels produce pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), hazardous chemicals, and more importantly carbon dioxide, which 
has direct environmental consequences such as global warming (Ghobadian et al., 2009). The root cause of 
increasing greenhouse gas emissions is the steady growth of economic and industrial development without adequate 
means and motivation to offset the consequent environmental effects. It is estimated that continuation of current 
trends will lead to 2-4°C increase in the earth’s temperature and 30-60 cm rise of sea level in the coming century 
(Kalogirou, 2004). Iran is an energy-rich country with ample reserves of fossil fuels such as oil and gas, but it also 
has a great potential for solar and geothermal and wind energy (Mohammadi et al., 2014; Shamshirband et al., 
2015). Several research have been done to evaluate performance of passive techniques and find the reliability and 
viability of renewable energies in different location and climate of Iran. Goudarzi and Mostafaeipour (2017) carried

4. Conclusion 
The goal of this study was to identify and prioritize the factors affecting the use of solar water heaters in Yazd using 
the factor analysis methodology. This is the first study that uses factor analysis for investigating the factors affecting 
the use of solar water heaters; so its results can contribute to the progress and success of programs associated with 
further use of solar water heating systems. The factors affecting the design, construction and operation of solar water 
heaters and the risks that may undermine this process were identified by preliminary studies on solar energy and 
then solar water heaters, their components, functions of each component, and different types of these heaters. The 
most important results of this study are as follows: 
 
 In areas where there is a great potential for exploitation of solar energy, the people’s tendency toward the 
efficient use of solar energy and solar-based techniques and appliances increases with their awareness 
about available solar options and applications.  
 Finally, 74.62% of the participants expressed a positive view on the prospect of using solar water heaters in 
Yazd. The risks associated with the implementation of such project can be divided into three major 
categories: financial risks, construction risks, and external risks. 
 Classification of factors affecting implementation of solar water heater in Yazd indicates that there are six 
components which can be considered like: Geographic location and environmental issues; economic 
problems; financial support; infrastructures, technology, and knowledge; interaction; culture, society, and 
politics. 
  There are three main risks in implementing solar water heaters which can be divided into the following 
three categories: internal; external; and manufacturing risks. 
 Based on the results and the model obtained in this study, all factors affecting the design, construction, and 
implementation of solar water heating systems in Yazd were identified and prioritized. According to the 
results, to develop and promote the use of solar water heating systems in Yazd, government should focus 
on the economic issues, financial support, and infrastructure associated with this effort. Boosting the level 
of local engineering knowledge and technology related to manufacture and maintenance of solar water 
heaters and promoting the design and manufacturing techniques required for such efforts will allow the 
solar-based systems to be utilized with greater efficiency.

Abstract 
In this paper, an approximate and quick estimation model is proposed based on engineering oriented 
methodology to support the existing bidding practice which consumed more time due to Material Take 
Off (MTO) preparation. The cost estimation model is based on standard quantity of structural steel for 
superstructure/topside which calculated from the mean value of respective steel section and strength 
classification. 44 offshore structures were collected and analysed for model development and 5 for model 
verification. 7 steel sections consist of plate, welded tubular, seamless tubular, beam, miscellaneous steel, 
grating and stair tread with respective strength classification such that High Strength, Through Thickness 
Properties (TTP) and Mild Strength steel were identified that accounted for overall structural steel costs. 
The completed cost estimation model were validated through inter-rater agreement between Subject 
Matter Expert (SME) in the field and verified by comparing the estimated cost calculated by the model 
and the actual bidding cost. The result showed that the model yield an error range less than +8% and can 
be considered acceptable in construction of fixed offshore structure.

1. Introduction
In general, cost estimation are constructed by the estimator’s experience, imaginative abilities, and a wide range of 
assumptions including appraisals of previously conducted projects that are similar in scope. Cost estimators need to 
think ahead of the project development with the intention of identify any insufficient cost. To evaluate the 
alternatives at the bidding stage, quick and precise decision-making is needed under a limited information and time 
which become constraints to the cost estimator. The cost estimation approach in early stage of construction works 
can be seen in various fields of constructions. In oil and gas industry, cost estimation is crucial for offshore 
contractor/fabricator to compete with other competitors locally or internationally to win bids and generate profits. 
With the cost competence as key and primary basis during bidding stage, it is required an efficient method or 
practice which not only will yield an accurate cost, but also quickly to tackle stringent bidding duration set by

As a conclusion, this study met its objective to propose an approximate cost estimation model for bidding purposes. 
Also, this study has accomplished to developed a reliable standard quantity for cost estimation model of structural 
steel with model validation using inter-rater agreement by experts of Cohen Kappa (value of 0.643) and model 
verification by comparing model’s estimated cost with actual biding value which generated error range between 
+7.29& and -1.71%. 
 
6. Limitation  
 
There are very limited existing research or study on cost estimation method for oil and gas industry especially on 
individual discipline such that structural steel. Therefore, the study needed to be started from the ground level. 
Also, to access financial information is hardly possible for any contractor to reveal their price since the budget are 
used for bid purpose. Hence the name of contractor/fabricator and the name of bid projects are disclosed to ensure 
the discretion of bid value. 
 
7. Research Significance and Contribution  
 
There is a very limited research on cost estimation in oil and gas industry especially in EPCC Company. Therefore, 
this study is the first pioneering step towards cost estimation of structural steel for superstructure/topside of 
Wellhead Platform (WHP) by EPCC contractor/fabricator. The suggested method is expected to be used not only for 
accurate and quick cost estimation, it also can support to set target cost during early bidding stage as a criterion for 
management decision the possibility to earn projects based on design results. 
 
8. Future Works  
 
For future work identical to this area of study, there are recommendations which can be highlighted to improve or 
extend the study of cost estimation for structural steel of offshore structure in oil and gas industry.  
First, the study is only focused on superstructure/topside of Wellhead Platform, excluding substructure/jacket of 
Wellhead Platform (WHP). For a complete offshore structure of Wellhead Platform, future study can analyse the 
trend or pattern of structural steel weight for substructure/jacket to identify the standard quantity and propose an 
approximate cost estimating model for substructure/jacket to be used for bidding purposes. 
Secondly, future works can also focus on heavier structure such as Central Processing Platform (CPP) which can 
range to 18,000 MT to 22,000 MT for both topside and jacket. Using similar methodology, standard quantity for 
structural steel can be identified. Hence, an estimation model of structural steel for superstructure/topside and 
substructure/jacket of Central Processing Platform can be established.

Abstract 
The concept of supply chain management has today become a tool that both manufacturing and service 
organizations have been using to help win greater market share. Small-medium enterprises have found it 
difficult to measure their performance due to the complex external environment. In this paper, analysis of 
a single case study of an SME through survey and interview is done in order to measure the performance 
of its responsive supply chain. A system dynamics modeling approach is used to model the variables that 
have greater influence on the performance system through the development of a causal loop and stock and 
flow diagrams. Comparisons of the experimental results shows that the domestic purchase of the raw 
material and quality efficiency will help to reduce the future lead-time and import requirements which will 
help the company to achieve product availability which is the main competitive strategy of a responsive 
supply chain.

1. Introduction
In recent years, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs’) have contributed greatly to the economies of developed and 
developing nations. In Australia, they represent 97% of all private business and 47% of private sector employment 
(Barnes et al., 1998), while in Malaysia, they represent 97% of total companies and contribute 32% to overall GDP in 
2012 and projected to around 40% by 2020 (SME Corporation Malaysia: Annual Report 2011/12). Even though SMEs 
have played major roles in developing and developed economies, they have found it difficult to survive in today’s 
business environment due to the complexity associated with the operating business environment, evolving nature of 
information technology, rapid changes in customer demands, globalization, outsourcing and many other essential 
supply chain activities. This difficulty in survival is due to the complex external feedback that also results from 
business environment in which SMEs are said to operate. Many researchers have found it very difficult to measure 
the performance of small and medium enterprises as opposed to large enterprises. It is believed that the reasons for 
difficulties in measuring their performances are due to the fact that majority of the SMEs’ do not have the expertise 
(human resources and capital) to implement an effective measuring system or if they do, majority do not have the 
technical human resources to implement and purchase some of the performance measure models that are in existence.

5. Conclusion 
 
This study has investigated that domestic purchase of the principal raw material (cocoa powder) and producing quality 
products will help to reduce the lead-time by making products available at all times meeting customer demand, which 
is the main focus of a responsive supply chain and hence will improve the performance of the company. This study 
did not focus on cost involved in making the supply chain of the company responsive. From the analysis of the 
questionnaire, it is gathered that the lead-time, quality and product availability are the three main order winning 
strategies of the customers of the company. Most Small and medium sized companies do not have an effective or a 
performance measurement system due to the fact that most cannot identify their internal strength and weaknesses but 
more focus on external opportunities and threat. There are lots of competitors in the beverage market in Malaysia who 
are also trying to gain greater market share by producing quality products to the customers and also trying to make 
products always available. Therefore since the case study company has identified the various strategies they can use 
in winning customer orders, they must strive to be efficient and effective in their activities. In trying to purchase a raw 
material locally which is the best decision, the case study company needs to have good collaboration with its supply 
chain partners so as to integrate well to enhance on-time delivery. The use of IT in planning the operations of suppliers 
and customers in terms of deliveries is very important in a responsive supply chain. IT will increase collaboration,

process integration and delivery speed by making product available to the customers. From survey, it is evident that 
the current operating system of the case study company is not effective in terms of using IT systems. The company 
does not have a specialized type of software that can improve the ordering system of the supply chain and in most 
cases orders are done manually and in person. 
Two causal loop diagrams were developed from the questionnaire analyses. The first causal loop explained the inter-
relationship between each of the selected performance measurement variable helping to achieve the first objective of 
this research. The second causal loop diagram was developed after identifying the three main variables that have 
greater influence on the performance measurement system of the company. A system dynamics model is developed 
from the causal loop diagram of lead-time reduction. One of the main importance of system dynamics is to model the 
way in which information, actions and consequences interact to generate dynamic behavior. The system dynamics 
model can help develop a solution approach for small and medium sized enterprises that cannot effectively measure 
and maintain or continuously update their performance system due to the constant feedback they experience on regular 
bases because of the dynamicity of their operating environment. This SD approach can help managers and top 
management to know where and on what to make decisions to achieve their responsive supply chain objectives. 
However, it can then be recommended that the company must focus on getting raw materials locally than importing 
because lead-time is the greatest weapon in a responsive supply chain. In trying to achieve this goal, there have to be 
other factors that could aid this goal; process integration (good supplier and customer relationship), planning in 
collaboration with local suppliers to help them know the demand trend and forecast of customers of the company, 
training of workers to improve quality thereby avoiding reject/rework, good information technology structure, market 
sensitivity as a responsive supply chain so as to know the changes in the taste of customer desires.. 
 
6. Limitations and Future Research 
 
There are lots of other performance measurement variables that can be used to measure supply chain performance, but 
the variables selected in this study which were reviewed from literature and approval by some expert managers of the 
case study company are based on the concept of a responsive supply chain. However, if we are considering a cost 
effective supply chain, then most variables like delivery speed, delivery reliable may not be of significance (Chopra 
and Miendl, 2010). The variables; lead-time reduction, quality and availability that were selected as main variables 
that have influence on the performance system were based on the analysis of the respondents. Every enterprise, small, 
medium or large may have its own competitive strategy and what may be suitable for one may not be suitable for 
another. 
To the future analysis of this study, the present study is limited to a single case study company. The analysis is based 
on respondent from a case study company and hence future work could be done on multiple case study companies to 
know the most important variable or variables especially on a responsive perspective. Comparison could be done from 
multiple analyses before a conclusion can be manifested for application to various SME in Malaysia. 
There are several other approaches to measuring the performance of supply chains; strategic, practical and operational, 
but this work is limited to strategic approach because the model developed is meant to help managers take good 
decisions due to the complex and dynamic environment in which SMEs revolve. Future work can be done using either 
of the other two approaches to measure the performance of SMEs operating on a responsive supply chain.

ABSTRACT 
Every company that deals with the container company has its own rate structure (mentions 
which charges are to be paid to the company and which will be handled by the company), so 
whenever any new recruit form company starts to handle rate structure, it becomes difficult for 
them. Also, there is no document available to refer to regarding the rate structure and steps 
involved in handling it. So there is a need to create a document which will help the new users 
to develop an overall understanding about rate structure. Rate structure is used in tender 
department for negotiating freight rates with customers. This process is a part of back office 
activities done in the container company. Rate structure is used to calculate All in rate for 
placing bids to the customers. The main objective of this paper is to create a document on rate 
structure and also to check the understanding by preparing a questionnaire  
The procedure used to do this is to interact with all the users to get to know how they 
are handling the requests and then determine the best steps involved. After determining the 
optimised steps, mostly used rate structures have been identified. For this purpose, excel sheet 
is used. Optimised steps and most used rate structures have been used to prepare a document 
to explain the concept of rate structure. The questionnaire is made by referring to data provided 
by the company i.e. based on secondary research.

1. INTRODUCTION
The container company is a French container transportation and shipping company. It 
is the third largest container company in the world. It has 170 shipping routes between 400 
ports in 150 different countries.  The container company undertakes contracts from all the 
companies to transport goods from one place to another. They use rail, road and waterways for 
transportation, but their main mode for transportation is by ship.  
Any contract which comes from the customer is transferred to back office from the front 
office. Front office is more like the group which is involved in maintaining relationship with 
the customer and acts as a single point of contact between customer and back office. In back 
office, there are many departments. These are imports, exports, tender, dangerous cargo, out of 
gauge goods etc. Tender team is associated with providing rates to the customer while imports 
team is responsible for handling all the operations related to the consignee who is the person

6. CONCLUSION 
After going through all the operations carried out in the back office of the company and 
understanding the terms involved in the shipping industry, a training manual was created for 
making it easy for the new users to understand these terms and create a basic foundation of the 
rate structure. The main aim was to create a manual which is very simple and very easily

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of dynamic capabilities (DC), innovation capabilities (IC) and 
alliances capabilities (AC) on sustainable competitive advantage in digital disruption era for incumbent 
telecommunication firm in Indonesia, due to the phenomenon of incumbent companies that fail to maintain 
business sustainability. New entrants could bring new innovations with cheaper, simple and efficient technology. 
This phenomenon referred to as Disruptive Innovation. Then the incumbents have to find new ways to stay 
competitive. The study is conducted by cross sectional quantitative method. The unit of analysis is 
telecommunication firm in Indonesia with management of these firms as the observation unit. The sampe taken 
from the population is as many as 100 respondents from Senior Leader in Indonesia telecommunication firm. The 
analytical approach and the solution technique that is used as the analysis tool in this research is Partial Least 
Square (PLS). The result of hypothesis testing shows that DC, IC, and AC affects sustainable competitive 
advantage (SCA) of Indonesia’s incumbent telecommunication firm in digital disruption era, where IC has more 
dominant influence than AC and DC in increasing SCA. This research has implications for both the management 
of telecommunication firm in Indonesia in maintaining and improving sustainable competitive advantage in the 
digital disruption era, as well as the contribution to science and further research.

Innovation capability have a very dominant influence compared to alliance and dynamic capabilities . It 
shows that innovation capability  can improve sustainable competitive advantage in customer value, diffrentiation, 
and  organize   that supported by alliance and dynamic capabilities. 
Hence, the finding is in line with earlier study about the effect of innovation on sustainable competitive 
advantage as showed by Bharadwaj (1993) who examines the organizational resource differentiator and 
organizational skills in the context of sustainable competitive advantage in the service industry and the moderating 
impact of service characteristics, service industries and enterprises where innovation impacts sustainable 
competitive advantage 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
Based on the hypothesis testing, found the conclusion and recommendation as follow: 
 
5.1 Conclusion 
The finding of study supported the hypothesis that the dynamic, innovation, and alliance capabilities affect 
to the sustainable competitive advantage of incumbent telecommunication firms in Indonesia in the digital 
disruption era, where the innovation capability has a dominant effect than alliance and dynamic capabilities in 
improving the sustainable competitive advantage. 
 
5.2. Implication, limitation and further research 
The result of this study is expected to gives implication to the management of telecommunication firms in 
Indonesia, that in the current digital disruption era, to continue to develop sustainable competitive advantage, the firm must 
prioritize the development of innovative capabilities, in line with the rapid development of information and communication 
technology. Real actions that could be taken by telcos for example, strengthening innovation resource in terms of budget, 
human resource and organization structure. In addition, for the academic community, it is expected that the finding of this 
study can be the basis for preparing the premise for further research about the effort in increasing competitive advantage in the 
telecommunication network industry in particular, and generally in industry related to the information and communication 
industry 
Due to limitation of scope and sampling during the study, the further result can be expanded into larger sample that 
may the sample taken beyond Indonesia telecommunication market. Further more the study can be further improve to provide 
framework and strategy model for incumbent Telecomunication firm in facing digital disruptive era.

Abstract: 
The economic crisis has a significant effect on healthcare resources. The management of limited and 
shared resources such as operating rooms and beds is challenged by the uncertainty of demand, which 
can lead to unbalanced utilization of the resources through the healthcare units and decrease the 
satisfaction of the patients in terms of waiting Time in the hospital and the quality of the service. 
Therefore, healthcare services need a conceptual tool to clarify the complexity of the interactions 
between resources and their effects on each other. A conceptual model based on system dynamics tools 
is developed to figure out the factors affect the behavior of operating room theatre in a healthcare 
system.

1. Introduction
Long waiting list and delays for medical treatment results in human pain all over the world. Proper comprehending 
of the critical health care resources behavior and their effect on the overall performance of the system can result 
in decreasing such unnecessary human suffering by improving the performance of healthcare units and increasing 
their throughputs.  
Tools used in improving the performance of any healthcare unite can be classified as analytical, simulation and 
statistical or empirical [1]. Simulation modeling approaches are considered suitable in cases where a complicated 
network of facilities needs to be modeled. Different simulation modeling techniques have been applied to various 
health care problems including patient flow modeling and operational performance analysis [4]. Preston and 
Ingalls [5] have classified them into continuous simulation represented by the system dynamics (SD) approach, 
Monte Carlo, discrete event (DES), hybrid, and agent-based simulations. 
System dynamic approach used widely in healthcare improvement. SD was identified by Young et al.  [2] as an 
appropriate method for improving health care management and was used in healthcare environments to explore 
policies for ongoing operations such as emergency departments [3]. The key performance indicators and 
objectives differ from one model to another according to the field that the approach applied in it. Many researchers 
used SD approach to improve the quality of a healthcare unit services. 
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the methodology is defined. In Section 3 we formally define model 
conceptualization and causal loop diagram for a health care system and present the factors that affect the system. 
In the last section, the conclusion is concluded.  
2. Methodology
As the level of complexity increases, the need for a conceptual tool to clarify the way of how the system 
components affect each other is increased. Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) tool based on System Dynamics (SD) is 
considered more appealing to model complicated network of facilities. CLD aims to give a better understanding 
of the system structure and the relationships between the system’s factors. The components of the diagram are the

4. Conclusions
The developed Causal Loop Diagram based on system dynamics thinking helped to figure out new insights of 
understanding the complexity of the operating room theatre. This model also illustrates some of the effects on 
patients’ experience and on the quality of service that they receive. This framework is discussed with experts, and 
they approved the model. The model can be adapted to fit new assumptions, and it is considered as a start for 
using simulation to test different scenarios that will help decision makers to take the decision that has the most 
significant impact on the system performance.

Abstract 
In recent century, the rapid and dynamic changes in business environment leads the organizations to the re-
engineering of the business processes toward service-oriented ones; this phenomena requires agility. For 
this aim Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) is utilized for assisting of 
communication between process owners and the experts and formed the new way of cooperative business 
processes. Meanwhile all essential infrastructures for supporting resources (such as selective info, know-
hows, mental and professional skills, input and outputs, desired quality level and limitations, assessments 
and control) are taken into account for using the operational experiences (as an added-value knowledge) 
that perform inside the predefined business environment. This act leads to renovating the business model 
by selecting proper business services and demonstrates the basis for quickly capable “real-time” service-
oriented BPM. In this paper the case study has been performed for using BPMS in internal processes of 
National Iranian Gas Company technical inspection and control organization in CRM area in order to clarify 
the processes and effective work-flow as a managerial experience.

Introduction 
In recent century, the rapid and dynamic changes in business environment leads the organizations to the re-engineering 
of the business processes toward service-oriented ones; this phenomena requires agility. For this aim Subject-oriented 
Business Process Management (S-BPM) is utilized for assisting of communication between process owners and the 
experts and formed the new way of cooperative business processes. Meanwhile all essential infrastructures for 
supporting resources (such as selective info, know-hows, mental and professional skills, input and outputs, desired 
quality level and limitations, assessments and control) are taken into account for using the operational experiences (as 
an added-value knowledge) that perform inside the predefined business environment [1]. 
This is the basic preface of the paper: To explore about utilizing organizational tools supplied by proven management 
conceptions that helped us manage available resources.  
Our co-works believed that this approach could provide an effective structure by which our work would advance and 
grow up as well as promptly adapt to the business environmental changes at our affairs. 
An effective inherent organizational structure would supply the support for developing applied systems, 
technologies, and proper tools. This approach would help us to manage the limited resources (e.g. HR and the time) 
and everyday operations more effectively. Meanwhile doing this job in a systematic and strategic way was essential 
for both head-quarter management and customers. We understand and reviewed the management studies to help 
organize our everyday workflows in CRM related jobs. 
BPM is used for enhancement and development of processes within systems.

As it was mentioned before, the BPMS has several advantages for bulk and heavy work load, especially for repetitive 
processes when the resources are limited, and as per illustrated in the problem statement, based on the statistical data 
more than 50% traffic of transmission are due to the special process and it can be solved by applying BPMS and 
automation of the processes; We are at the mid-way of applying the system in our organization and it’s a bit early to 
talk about how useful it is for our organization, but based on the studies, it can optimize our resource management and 
increase the customers satisfaction and clarify the validation of 3rd party technical inspection companies (our major 
external customers) which is one of the main goal of our CRM. 
 
Conclusion 
 
BPM is a useful management techniques for assisting of communication between process owners and the experts and 
formed the new way of cooperative business processes. Based on studies of organizational environment and as per 
processes review in our organization, one of the new goal definitions was optimizing the process based on the customer 
satisfaction and better limited resource management. The BPMS provides the tools which can be utilize for the new 
goals of our organization. 
This paper provides a framework for the similar processes and similar organization to utilize the BPMS and improve 
the overall productivity of heavy load- repetitive processes.  
We are at the mid-way of applying BPMS and the final results and conclusion will be published after the test-run.

Abstract      
The surgery-room is one of the key medical care locations in hospitals and tools and material 
have prepared in the operation prepare room. The people of surgery team are medical doctors, nurses 
and assistants. Nurses, the majority of the team, have complained musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) 
problems. These problems originate from multiple factors. In this study, ergonomic analysis has been 
used to evaluate risk factors of musculoskeletal disorder. The objective is to estimate the risks of 
nurses and to redesign the tool carriage in surgery rooms. The subjects are the nurses at surgery rooms 
in a university hospital. The ergonomics analysis of nurse work was processed in the hospital. Not 
only professional observation has been done, but also camcorder and camera recorded key activities. 
The results of ergonomic job analysis and questionnaire show that muscle disorders are very common 
symptoms of low back; the results of checklist shows that the nurses and assistant people are under 
high musculoskeletal disorder or injury risk. The new carriage is suggested to reduce the problems of 
surgery tool lifting and moving. The layout of surgery rooms and preparation room should be 
redesigned to increase productivity and reduce lifting and moving activities. To provide 
standing-chairs and to train nurses with valid postures are recommended to decrease nurses' 
musculoskeletal disorders.

Abstract 
The increasing need for vegetable oil about 5 million a year accompanied by the human population 
growth with the average increase 0.9% requires a consistent effort for Indonesia as the largest CPO 
producer in the world.  The efforts to increase the palm oil plantation production faces not only the 
constraint of the low plantation product but also the lack of downstream palm oil industry development, 
in addition, there is not any special fund for the plantation. For that reason, it is necessary to make an 
improvement effort for the revitalization of the palm oil plantation in North Sumatera-Indonesian through 
the big potential benefits of North Sumatera by modelling palm oil plantation revitalization, to facilitate 
the relevant parties to find the solution of the constraints of palm oil plantation revitalization so that it can 
support the CPO agroindustry development in North Sumatera. The implementation of palm oil plantation 
revitalization in North Sumatera is very low, that is only 17.5% out of the planned one. It indicates that it 
becomes the constraint of the palm oil plantation revitalization in North Sumatera. The result of the 
research shows that several dominant factors influencing the success of the revitalization are among 
others the land availability and the replanting, the increased productivity of plantation and CPO 
agroindustry, and the plantation financing. Therefore, it is recommended that the relevant parties such as 
government, plantation companies, banks and-and farming community be able to synergize so that 
various influencing factors can be optimized and the increase in the revitalization is maximized

Abstract 
Lean IT emerged as a fusion between Information Technology (IT) and Lean thinking. This paper aims to 
contribute to a better understanding on how Lean thinking may be applied to the IT sector, through the 
study of the outcome from the application of Lean IT in two Portuguese banks. The paper will analyse how 
the Lean IT approach addresses the challenge of increasing competitiveness; analyse the Lean IT 
implementation methodology adopted by the 2 banks; and how are the banks maintaining the Lean IT 
approaches. The implementation process was surveyed through a series of interviews which uncovered 
differences in terms of Lean IT practices and tools used by both organisations. Empirical evidence made 
clear that the Lean IT adoption by the banking institutions made them more competitive. Moreover, it was 
also important to notice that Lean IT became part of the organisational culture thus justifying its 
permanence. This research shows examples on how the use of Lean IT may help other organisations become 
more agile and valuable to their customers, thereby, increasing their competitiveness.

1. Motivation
In the current economic-business context, organisations aim to be recognised as unique by their customers. Lean 
philosophy intends to address this challenge by focusing on creating customer value, eliminating waste, improving 
information flow, increasing internal processes effectiveness, as well as promoting the respect between all internal 
and external process agents. The application of Lean practices in Information Technology is called Lean IT.  
Lean IT is a new phenomenon in Portugal, and there is a lack of knowledge and literature concerning Lean IT 
principles. This work intends to contribute for the body of knowledge of Lean IT, particularly in the Portuguese 
context. This paper will describe the research work and results on the effects that the application of Leant IT practices 
may have in companies, using two Portuguese banks as examples. The research questions of this study are

Any organisational culture evolves; therefore, another important factor to take into account, regarding maintenance of 
Lean IT, is its ability to adapt to evolution. Considering this, company A implemented an operational Lean IT and 
defined the following strategy to maintain it: 
• 
Introducing new tools from Toyota Production System;  
• 
Creating new waves to implementing Lean IT in other bank departments. 
Considering that company B is oriented towards management, they are taking the following actions: 
• 
Planning to apply an agile methodology in combination with Lean IT; 
• 
Motivating team managers to identify IT internal waste. 
5. Conclusions 
Over the years, Lean has been adapted to several activity sectors, allowing a better understanding of different realities. 
Starting in the automotive industry, it then moved on to other sectors such as: construction, process industry, retail 
and distribution, financial services, healthcare and information technology. Each sector is defined by different types 
of stream value and all the knowledge that may be obtained from those sectors is relevant to adapt Lean to the IT 
industry (Bell S. , 2013). It is therefore possible to apply Lean to any organisation and system, as long as there is a 
product or service flow that can be driven by the client/ user demand (Hicks, 2007).  
Lean IT is still underdeveloped in Portugal, namely the adoption of its principles by organisations. Nevertheless, it 
was interesting to see how Lean is applied to information technology and how it is useful for organisations, as it 
generates benefits that maximize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through key performance indicators it was 
identified, in both cases, an increase of 20% in their effectiveness and efficiency and thus in their competitiveness. 
Despite the challenges of implementing Lean IT, these bank institutions were able to embed it in the organisational 
culture and therefore they are still maintaining Lean IT.      
Due to the relevance of the present study and because it is not yet developed by most Portuguese companies, it would 
be interesting to extend it to a significant sample through the application of questionnaires to other companies. This 
would allow a better nationwide understanding of the application of Lean IT.

Abstract 
The problem that generally occurs in methanol industry is auxiliary materials stock out, i.e. urea, NPK, 
and sulfuric acid. This condition leads to the production quantity only reach 75% of the target. Therefore, 
it is necessary to develop inventory control model so that the production target can be achieved. The 
estimation of auxiliary materials needs is done by forecasting method with the smallest mean absolute 
percentage error. Model of continuous review system with backorder case is used for inventory planning 
and control. With this model, the industry can determine the amount of safety stock and reorder point to 
avoid the risk of stock out or excess of raw materials so it can minimize the total inventory cost. The 
result shows that the model can reduce the total inventory cost up to 12,02% in the next one year planning 
period.

1. Introduction
Inventory along the supply chain have major implications for financial performance of an industry. Inventory 
management that best suits with industrial operation plays a vital role to achieving a competitive performance (Ogbo 
et al, 2014). A balance between carrying costs and ordering cost becomes the goal of inventory control (Kulkarni 
and Raihans, 2013; Onanuga and Adekulne, 2014). Production inventory control is categorized as one of the main 
decisions in supply chain (Gholamian and Heydari, 2017). To implement a reliable inventory controls, it should be 
noted that there are various factors related to inventory. These factors include material requirements scheduling, 
ordering frequency, efficient forecasting and supply chain integration (Mogere et al, 2013). Demand pattern also 
plays as important factor for inventory management (Wanke, 2014; Eriksen and Nelsen, 2016). 
Methanol industry is one of the industries that produce methanol. The main raw material is sugarcane drop which is 
a by-product of sugar factory. In addition, there are several auxiliary materials, i.e. urea (46% N), NPK (15% N 15% 
and K 15%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), super-floc, TRO (turkey red oil) and yeast. The problem that often happens is 
materials stock out such as urea, NPK and sulfuric acid in methanol production. This condition leads to the 
production quantity only reach 75% of the target. Therefore, this research is done by using inventory continuous 
review model system with backorder case so that material inventory can be monitored at any time. In backorder 
case, the unfilled item is completely backordered in the following period (Jaksic and Fransoo, 2015).  
A continuous review system or economic order quantity (EOQ) is the most fundamental concept adopted by many 
industries for inventory management practice (Appadoo et al, 2012; Islam, 2013; Drake and Marley, 2014).  The 
inventory system with EOQ can be more effective than a just in time system for probabilistic and stochastic demand 
(Min Wu, 2011).  The application of basic EOQ and material requirement planning (MRP) shows an effective cost 
saving for inventory management in a furniture industry (Zaidi et al, 2012). EOQ is used in multi- product case to 
determine the optimum order quantity for daily used products (Iwu et al, 2014). 
Some modification of basic EOQ model are developed to improve the model performance (Korponai et al, 2017). 
Two-item EOQ model with partial backordering and substitution is formulated to determine order quantities and

The calculation with continuous review system (Q) with backorder case is obtained at the second iteration with 
optimal order size (Q) of 1,489.26 kg for each order and safety factor (k) of 0.826 as shown in Table 2. The value of 
reorder point (r) is 397.09 kg which means when the amount of inventory equal or smaller than the reorder point, 
then reordered by a fixed order amount (Q). Obtained safety stock (ss) is 54.56 kg with the possibility of a shortage 
of inventory in a year (B) at 7.6 kg. The NPK order is made within a year (m) 10 times with a 25 days order time 
interval (T). The total inventory cost (TIC) generated is Rp 60,531,463 per year as shown in Table 3. 
While calculation with continuous review system (Q) with backorder case for H2SO4, best iteration is obtained at 
third iteration with optimal order size (Q) of 1,411.77 liters for each order and safety factor (k) equal to 1.8315 seen 
in Table 2. While the value of reorder point (r) is 325.87 liters. Obtained inventory safety stock (ss) is 92.14 liters 
with the possibility of shortage of inventory in a year (B) at 0.66 liters. Ordering H2SO4 done in a year (m) as much 
as 6 times with interval ordering time (T) 42 days each time order. Thus, the total inventory cost (TIC) incurred is 
Rp 15,758,880 per year as shown in Table 3.

5. Conclusion 
 
From the research on inventory management of auxiliary materials in methanol production process using continuous 
review system model (Q) with backorder case, it can be concluded that for urea Q is equal to 2,199 kg or 2.2 tons 
with decreasing inventory cost by 11.7%. NPK Q is 1,489.26 kg or 1.49 tons with an inventory cost reduction at 
12.1%. For H2SO4 Q is equal to 1,411.77 liter with decreasing inventory cost equal to 15.8%. The total inventory 
cost of the three auxiliary materials decreased by Rp 36,719,357 or 12.02% over the next one year compared to the 
current company policy.

Abstract 
The study reports face and head anthropometric measurements for Saudi Arabia females’ 
population.  Face and head measurement change with time due to environmental and geographical 
factors.  There are many applications relying on this measurements such as face Masks, head masks, 
glasses, respirators, helmets, clothing, medical and dental fields and  plastic surgeries. There hasn’t 
been any study on facial and head measurements on Saudi Arabia, therefore this study is considered 
as a reference and foundation for Saudi head and face measurements. The data is presented in a 
standard anthropometric format. 
Keywords: Female Anthropometry, Face and Head, Saudi Arabia 
1. Introduction
Anthropometry is the human science that deals with collecting and documenting human body measurements.  
Employing such data during the design stages would produce safer and more usable product (Croney, 1971). 
Anthropometry in product and workplace design has been applied by many researchers (Hansona et al, 2009; 
Gite and Yadav, 1989; Motamedzade et al, 2007; Luximon et al, 2016; Wuhrer et al, 2012).  Racial background 
differences and individuals lifestyles contribute largely on population body sizes.  Different anthropometric data 
have been reported for different races residing in different countries.  Some examples of anthropometric studies 
for different countries can be seen in (Ghanbari and Bayat, 2009; Wang et al, 2002; Lewin and Hedegård, 2009; 
Jahanshahi et al, 2009; Iseri and Arslan, 2009).  Head and face anthropometry are utilized in different areas such 
as equipment design and medicine (Zhuang and Bradtmiller, 2005; Al-jassim et al, 2014). 
Industrialization and the improvement of Saudi life style increase the demand of importing industrial and 
consumer goods.  A mismatch between the imported products and Saudi body sizes would likely to occur due to 
the lack of anthropometric data.  Saudi Arabia like other developing countries has limited anthropometric data. 
There have been some attempts to collect anthropometric data for different Saudi populations (Al-Hazzaa, 1990; 
Alrashdan et al, 2014) but it is relatively limited.  Anthropometric data of human head and face are scarce in the 
literature and practically non-existent for Saudi Arabia.   
The objective of this research is to report face and head anthropometric data of women in Saudi Arabia.  The 
sample contained 150 women. The data is expected to be utilized by designers to design safe, comfortable and 
highly usable equipment.  Moreover, health practitioners can utilize the data to identify face irregularities for 
such population.   
2. METHOD
2.1 Subjects 
A total of 150 healthy female subjects were recruited from different age groups.  Subjects were college students, 
government and nongovernment employees and housewives reside in Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia. 
It is to be noted that the population of Riyadh come from different areas of the kingdom, whether settled, or

4. Conclusion 
 
Face and head anthropometric measurements for female Saudi population are presented.  The data represent a 
population from 5 different regions of the country with age ranges between 18 to 65 years old. It was found that 
all face measurements are not affected with age and region differences.  The data were combined for all 
measurements across all ages and regions and presented in a standard anthropometric table. The data was 
limited due to budget constraints and cultural values that limit number of volunteers.  However, it is believed 
that this work is the first to report face and head measurements for female with this wide age range.  The 
intension is to have a starting point for collecting body sizes especially for females in the country.  The data is 
presented in a standard anthropometric table to assist in designing products that matches Saudi’s females face 
sizes and eliminate any potential hazard or inconvenient as a result of mismatch between their sizes and 
products’ sizes.

Abstract 
Surfactant are some of the most expensive chemicals used in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Thus, the 
reason of developing lignin based surfactant system for EOR is to lower the cost as it does not tie to the 
price of crude oil compare to other petroleum based surfactants. Besides, lignin could be extracted from oil 
palm waste that is available abundantly in Malaysia. The aim of this study is to determine the amount of 
lignin compound extracted from the oil palm Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) by using ultrasound-assisted 
technique, to determine formulations of lignin based surfactant for EOR applications, and to determine the 
oil recovery performance of lignin based surfactant through surfactant flooding. The results of the study 
showed that the extraction of lignin using ultrasound-assisted technique enhanced the extraction amount of 
lignin, though it did not alter the lignin composition and structure, compared to traditional pulping process. 
The formulation of lignin based surfactant at 2 % total active surfactant showed good stability phase 
behavior and interfacial tension. The oil recovery from displacement test also showed significant results 
where the best formulation lignin based surfactant able to recover 11% of Oil Originally In Place (OOIP) 
after waterflooding, and is comparable to commercial surfactant.

1. Introduction
According to U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA (2016), Malaysia held proven oil reserves of 4.0 billion 
barrels as of January 2014, the fourth highest reserves in Asia Pacific after China, India and Vietnam. Malaysia is 
Southeast Asia’s second largest oil producer after Indonesia. Petroleum and other liquids production (including crude 
oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, biofuels and refinery processing gains) in 2013 was nearly 670,000 barrels per 
day (bbl/d), hovering around the same level since 2011, down from the country’s peak production of 844,000 bbl/d in 
2003. The oil production has experienced overall declines as a result of maturing fields. 
The alternative ways to increase oil production can be done by finding new fields or using new technology for mature 
fields. Deepwater activities are expected to play a prominent role in the development of Malaysia’s oil and gas sector 
in the future. Petronas expects the deep-water sector to contribute 25 to 30 % of Malaysia’s oil and gas production 
over the next five years. However, finding and extracting oil in green fields involves a colossal capital outlay. In 2013, 
Petronas reported plans to spend more than USD 61 billion over five years in Malaysia’s oil and natural gas sector to 
boost oil and natural gas production and offset the current declines from ageing fields (EIA, 2016). Due to this

4. Conclusions 
The extraction of lignin using ultrasound-assisted technique does not alter the lignin composition and structure. This 
finding agrees with other researches by Nazir et al. (2013), Fahma et al. (2010), Mason et al. (2011), Yunus et al. 
(2010), Garcia et al. (2011). In addition, ultrasound-assisted technique enhanced the extraction amount of lignin 
compared with traditional pulping process (Ibrahim & Azian, 2005) and is supported by similar finding from Alriols 
et al. (2008), Nazir et al. (2013), Mason et al. (2011), Garcia et al. (2011). The formulation of lignin based surfactant 
at 2 % total active surfactant showed good stability phase behavior and IFT. The oil recovery from displacement test 
also showed significant results where the best formulation lignin based surfactant able to recover 11% of OOIP after 
waterflooding, and is comparable to commercial surfactant SDS.

Abstract  
The lifecycle of a construction project would start with the need for a new facility by an owner. Therefore, 
the construction projects are known for having unique characteristics, which stem from the diversity of the 
owners’ needs. The vast amount of the projects’ components is usually undertaken in uncontrollable 
environments. The unique nature of the construction industry makes it risky and competitive endeavor. One 
of the critical competitive advantages for a construction organization is its ability to implement the previous 
experience and to maximize the organizational learning. This would aid the construction organization to 
manage the expected business risk effectively. Information and communication technology (ICT) can 
provide efficient tools for adequate risk management process that would lead to successfully managing and 
responding to project risks. This paper is part of an ongoing research that aims to study the available ICT 
tools and techniques and discuss how the ICT would facilitate the success of construction risk management 
process.  
The main objective of the ongoing research is to reveal the areas where these tools and techniques can be 
implemented and its anticipated effectiveness if it were applied appropriately. The current paper discusses 
briefly the scope and the expected benefits from the study.  
Keywords 
Construction Industry, Risk Management, Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 
1. Introduction
The construction industry is a product based business. The construction projects are the main product of the industry, 
the type and the design complexity of these projects are derived from the clients. Accordingly, the diverse needs and 
requirements of the clients would lead to projects having unique characteristics. Moreover, there are many other 
attributes that make it impossible to have identical construction projects, for example the design, location, available 
resource, weather, and project team represent essential criteria that would have direct effect on the project outcomes. 
Accordingly, it can be argued that it is impossible to have identical construction projects. 
The nature of the construction industry makes it very risky endeavor, for a construction organization to succeed in this 
line of business, optimum utilization of its capabilities and resources is vital. Effective implementation of previous 
experience and maximizing organizational learning abilities are great assets for managing the risk that would be 
encountered while conducting business in the construction industry. Information and communication technology 
(ICT) can provide efficient tools for adequate risk management process that would lead to successfully managing and 
responding to project risks.

examples of these studies, which include the work of Bing and Tiong (1999) who developed a risk management model 
for international construction joint venture. Dikmen and Birgonul (2004) used Neural Network to create a model that 
would support international market entry decisions. Gunhan and Arditi (2005) study was related to international 
expansion decision for construction companies to facilitate the entry decision into foreign markets. Han, Diekmann, 
& Ock (2004) worked on a multicriteria financial portfolio risk management for international projects; to demonstrate 
their approach, they conducted a case study based on real projects collected from some multinational general 
contractors. In another study the same authors (2005) investigated contractor’s risk attitude in the selection of 
international construction projects. Bu-Qammaz, Dikmen, and Birgonul (2009) created a model for risk assessment 
of international construction projects using the analytic network process. Al-Azemi, Bhamra,  and Salman (2014) 
proposed a risk management framework for Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) Projects in Kuwait. Serpella et. al. 
(2014) implemented a kwoledge-based approcha to study the risk management in construction projects. To close with, 
investigating the listed examples and many other researches would reveal that the need for ICT is inevitable to 
implement the risk management process, and there is a need to propose risk management models for construction 
project success during the construction phase, which is one of the most critical phases of the project lifecycle.  
5. Conclusion and Recommendation
This paper is presented under a preliminary comprehensive research that focuses on the role of ICT in promoting for 
successful implementation of the risk management into the construction industry. Revealing the expected rewards 
would promote for implementing ICT into risk management, the feasibility for investing in the offered software and 
information systems need to be further investigated. The literature discussed both barriers and drivers for 
implementing the ICT in the construction process. It was found that the involvement and support of the top 
management is the most critical factor that would promote for ICT implementation. The ICT barriers include: high 
cost, complexity, business culture. On the other hand, the foreseen advantages for implementing ICT in the risk 
management process include: increased productivity, improved communication, integrated project information, more 
efficient decision-making process, controlled project performance. More work need to be done to investigate the areas 
where the ICT can assist and improve the construction risk management process and to assess the expected benefits 
from implementing the ICT in the managing construction project risks.

Abstract 
Road traffic accidents involving motorcyclists have increased steadily over the years in Malaysia. The 
causation of road traffic accidents is normally related to individual and environment factors. 
Therefore, this review aims to identify human risk factors for road traffic accidents among 
motorcyclists in Malaysia. We conducted a systematic review on the following electronic databases: 
Scopus, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Malaysian Institute of 
Road Safety Research (MIROS) from 1970-2017. A total of 1369 titles were identified and following 
the screening and review processes (i.e. title screening, abstract screening and full text reviewed), 
only four studies were included.  Results showed that motorcyclists’ traffic violation behavior is the 
main risk factor that contributes to road traffic accidents. This review paper helps to provide an 
understanding of the role of human factor contributing to road traffic accidents in Malaysia. It is 
suggested that an effective road safety campaigns could help in reducing the number of road traffic 
accidents in the future. More studies are needed to provide a better insight on the risk factors that lead 
to road traffic accidents.

1. Introduction
Road accident has become an alarming problem in Malaysia. Statistics by the Malaysian Road Transport 
Department, recorded a drastic increment of 31,860 cases in 2016 with a total accident of 521,466 cases as 
compared to 489,606 cases in 2015 (Gan, 2017; Official Portal of Road Transport Department Malaysia, 2017). 
Road accident involving motorcyclists are among the highest death contributors in the country, and this figure 
did not show any declining sign for the past years and predicted to be increasing in the near future (Abdul 
Manan, 2014; Abdul Manan & Várhelyi, 2015; Jamaluddin, Ho, Shabadin, Megat Johari, & Ameer Batcha, 
2015; Kee, Shamsul, & Goh, 2009). Statistically, Malaysia is among the ASEAN countries with the highest road 
fatalities based on the overall population (Sultan, Ngadiman, & Kadir, 2016). The highest road fatalities are 
recorded in 2016 with 7,152 deaths with a severe increment of 6.65% compared to the previous year (Gan, 
2017). For every death, the government is facing RM1.2 million losses from the economic contribution of 
human productivity (Lee, 2015). In 2016, Malaysia has recorded an estimation of RM9.2 billion lost due to the 
road accidents with a significant increment of RM581.3 million compared to 2015 (Gan, 2017). 
2. Literature Review
There are several factors that contribute toward road accidents, and human factors alone contribute 
approximately 80% of the road crash (Lee, 2015). Human factors that lead toward road accident are referring to

Traffic violation behavior which lead toward the occurrence of road accident  
A study conducted by Oxley et al. (2013) is aimed to identify the contributing factors involved in motorcycle 
commuter crashes. This study is undertaken using a telephone survey of 1,004 motorcyclists who were involved 
in crashes for the last 2 years (case group) and 746 motorcyclists who do not involved in crash in the last 2 years 
(control group). The findings showed that the use of mobile phone to check messages and texting while riding 
are among the contributing factors that cause motorcycle commuter crashes.  
Another study conducted by Abdul Sukor et al. (2016), aimed to explore motorcyclist’ risk perceptions of a road 
accident. A total of 138 motorcyclists who commute to work in Penang, Malaysia involved in this study. Results 
reveal that there are two main factors that lead toward road accident risk perception. The first factor is the 
motorcyclist’ behavior themselves and the second factor is the other road users’ behavior. For the first factor, 
motorcyclist’ aggressive behavior (28%), violation of traffic rules (27%), not paying attention to other road 
users (24%) and motorcyclists’ reckless driving (21%) are considered as the risks contributing factors of road 
accidents. As for the second factor, the risks that are causing road accidents are referring to other road users’ 
behavior of not paying attention to motorcyclists (26%), reckless driving (25%), aggressive behavior (25%) and 
violation of traffic rules (24%). Table 2 shows the detailed information regarding the selected studies. 
5. Discussion and Conclusion
Human factors are indeed played a significant role in explaining the occurrence of traffic accidents. Although 
there are other contributors such as the technical and environmental aspects, it was evident that human factors 
alone contribute 80% of the road accident causation in Malaysia (Lee, 2015). As compared to drivers 
unintentional mistake of slip and lapse, the intentional traffic violation behavior is more significant and 
becoming the leading factor that cause road accident in Malaysia. As can be seen from the findings, 
motorcyclists committed some traffic violation behaviors like over speeding, tail tailing, dangerous overtake, 
run over red light, drink and drive, taking drug, disobey the traffic signage, not stop at the stop line, use of 
mobile phone while driving and eating while driving. This violation behavior is among the highly risky behavior 
that can lead toward road accident causation. In addition, motorcyclists and drivers who fail to use helmet and 
seat belt will eventually put them in the severe traffic accident (Ambak et al., 2010).  This review includes data 
which was gathered from an observation and by interviewing road accident victims. It therefore provides a clear 
understanding of the risk factors of road accidents’ causation among motorcyclist. The data was gathered from 
the firsthand experience of road accident victims and in a natural setting.   
This review paper has several limitations, as the focus of the study is only investigates the accident risk factors 
among motorcyclists. Therefore, future studies should also address the accident risk factors among other road 
users such as the car drivers, truck drivers and bus drivers. Moreover, the other limitation is, there is only one 
cross-sectional study that used respondents of actual road accident victims. Thus, the data gathered might not be 
comprehensive and conclusive because it involves the general public’s perception rather than real experience. It 
is recommended that, future study should engage actual accident victims. Apart from that, it is also highly 
recommended for the future study to investigate other factors such as the role of attitude in explaining the road 
accident causation. 
As a conclusion, this review has provided a summary of human risk factors that can contribute toward road 
accidents among motorcyclists in Malaysia. Motorcyclists’ violation behaviour emerged as the main risk factors 
that contribute toward road accident. This information provided crucial use data for the local authorities such as 
the Malaysia Road Transport Ministry, Polices Department, MIROS and other related parties to develop the 
most suitable education and road accident prevention plan in the future. Apart from that, based on this review, it 
can also be identified that there is a limited number of studies about accidents involving motorcyclists’ in 
Malaysia. Therefore, this review paper will help to provide to date discussion regarding motorcyclists’ road 
accidents risk factors and add a new source of literature to the body of knowledge.

Abstract 
Traffic safety is one of major challenges facing most communities worldwide. To improve traffic safety, 
regulating traffic movement through markings, signs, channelization, and others is essential. Traffic signs 
are used either to regulate road user movements by highlighting priorities or to inform road users about 
traffic regulations and traffic conditions. In general, traffic signs are essential element in road operation. 
Thus, understanding these signs by road users is of prime importance for efficient and safe traffic 
operations. This study investigates the comprehensiveness of traffic signs by drivers and the impact of 
driver characteristics gender, nationality, age, language, and educational level. Clarifying the correlation 
between the understanding of traffic signs and driver characteristics will yield to recommendations and 
help in identifying proper countermeasures to enhance the communities’ knowledge of traffic signs and 
consequently improve traffic safety level. The study used an electronic survey as a research instrument for 
data collection. The results have shown significant impact of some of human characteristics on their 
ability to recognize the metal-plate and electronic traffic signals.

1.Introduction
Road safety is one of major challenges facing most of transportation and traffic departments worldwide. 
Driving has become an essential part of our daily life routine. People are often different in nature and 
have different personalities and skills, all which can influence the way that they drive and behave 
(Nazha et al., 2017 and Abdella et al., 2017). To improve traffic safety, regulating traffic movement 
through markings, signs, channelization, and others is essential. In general, road users are at high risk 
and vulnerable to many crashes. Drivers and pedestrians are all susceptible to fatal, sever, and 
slight injuries because of traffic crashes. Communities and organizations all around the world are 
investing to improve traffic safety by reducing number of crashes as well as their severities. 
Different techniques and tools are being implemented by traffic engineers. Traffic signs are one 
of the most important tools used to regulate traffic operations to provide smooth and safer 
operation. They are being used widely over the entire world to deliver vital information on right

49% correct response rate. 
Regarding the impact of educational level of participants, the data did not show any 
significant impact. This is expected since all the participants are from Qatar University; 
therefore, we do not have variations in the educational level. All participants either are enrolled 
in or have Bachelor or Graduate degree. To be able to investigate the impact of educational level, 
data need to be collected outside the university.

4.Conclusion   
This study mainly investigated the comprehensibility of a selected sample of traffic signs by 
drivers in the State of Qatar. The study shows that the average comprehensibility of all traffic 
signs is 80.9%. Moreover, the correlation between different human characteristics and the 
comprehensibility of traffic signs was studied. In this study, we could not identify different 
performance between static and variable message signs. In average 20% of the drivers fail to 
respond correctly to at least one of signs. This ratio is quite high and alarming especially with 
such simple, basic, and common traffic signs. Furthermore, it is important to remember that more 
than 70% of the drivers are fresh drivers with less than 5 years driving experience with good

educational level and thus it was expected to have higher comprehensibility of traffic signs 
compared to drivers with lower educational levels and longer driving experience.  
The comparison between male and female drivers showed that male drivers have higher 
comprehensibility in most traffic signs than female drivers. However, on the other hand, the data 
also shows that female drivers reported lower average crash record in the past three years 
compared to male drivers. This is reasonable if we know that only 12.7% of all active driving 
license holder in Qatar are female (Traffic Department, Ministry of Interior, 2016). This also is 
combined with the fact that female drive significantly less than male drivers (lower mileage) 
which means that their risk exposure is lower. On the other hand, the study shows that language 
capability of drivers significantly affect the comprehensibility of variable message signs with 
language text.

Abstract 
This article presents a social cognitive theory (SCT) framework and its interrelation in Human Resource 
Management (HRM) studies in aspects of HRM practices, Human Resource(HR) roles, and firm 
performances. This study developed a proposed framework, derived based on Bandura’s (1986) SCT, and 
supported by Bandura’s (2001) Human Agency Theory and Lent’s (1994) Social Cognitive Career 
Theory (SCCT) to explain the development of mediation linkage between HRM practices and firm 
performance through Ulrich’s HR roles. The purpose of this study is to understand the nature of HRM 
studies and its connection to employee’s psychological behaviour. Based on the findings on literature 
review, this paper proposed a framework to support the linkage between HRM practices and firm 
performance, with HR roles as key mediator for the relationship.

1. Introduction
When it comes to HRM studies, there has been considerable robust evidence in theories and empirical researches on 
its contribution to firm performances in the past 30 years. During this period, notable theoretical perspectives have 
been introduced where HRM and firm performances are first viewed in universalistic approach, and later have been 
refined and expanded into contingency and configurational approach. 
While the variety of numerous models introduced as an effort to demonstrate the connection between HRM 
practices and firm performance, the mixed theoretical findings proves that there are missing in the prospect to fill in 
the distinct value of ‘black box’ to support the relationship between these two variables. Previous studies in the past 
10 years suggested that the contribution of HRM to firm performance literatures has progressed far enough to 
support the theory to be crucial, but there were still lack of support both on theory and explanation (Paauwe, 2009, 
2009; Dimba, 2010; Marescaux et al, 2013; Theriou and Chatzoglou, 2015).  Singh and Kassa (2016) finds that

4. Methodologies 
 
The nature of this study is based on exploratory methodology which hypotheses obtained based on theory 
development through positivistic paradigm. Positivistic paradigm refers to methods where literature used to obtain 
instruments and variables to support hypotheses testing. As there is limited knowledge covering on psychological 
and human resource studies available from previous literature, this study is moving towards research based on 
explaining variance. Therefore, partial least square (PLS) statistical equation method (SEM) is viewed as significant 
method for statistical analysis for this study. This study will be using SmartPLS software for data analysis. It 
compliments with this study’s mediating framework which involve analyzing latent construct both reflective and 
formative analysis. 
 
Based on preliminary data analysis, reliability and validity analysis showed positive numbers with each variable’s 
Cronbach’s Alpha are above 0.89, Composite Reliability above 0.91, and Average Variance Extracted (AVE) above 
0.64.

Based on the discussion above, HRM studies are closely related to psychological and behavioural studies. The SCT 
model is an evolving construction, the subject of study can be related in any psychological entity regardless of the 
study background. HRM practices is one of interesting behavioural branch study where it involves people’s daily 
activity and at the same time to maximize organizational function. The logical view in this paper between 
behavioural and HRM subjects showed the uniqueness and complexities in social sciences studies. Our intent in this 
paper is to provide framework by explaining the missing value in HRM practices-performance relationship. With 
this present perspective, we hope this paper may contribute to more comprehensive, new insights, and understanding 
on HRM studies.

Abstract 
This article reviewed the relationship between organizational justice and organizational citizenship 
behavior. It was revealed that there are inconsistency of the findings in the past studies. This has triggered 
a need for further exploration on the linkage between organizational justice and organizational citizenship 
behavior. It is suggested that more empirical researches to be conducted in the future to provide a more 
concrete evidences on the linkage between organizational justice and organizational citizenship behavior. The 
new dimensions of organizational justice, namely Temporal Justice and Spatial Justice should be included 
in future study to yield empirical evidences on the linkage.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of Study 
Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) has been known as one of the vital factors that can affect the 
effectiveness of an organization (Podsakoff, Whitting, Podsakoff, & Blume, 2009). OCB has been quite a concerned 
problem in organizational behavior field and it has been commonly used as a dependent variable (Azmi, Desai, & 
Jayakrishnan, 2016). For the purpose to enhance the effectiveness and overall performance of organizations, 
managements had been searching for several methods (Ng, Ke, & Raymond, 2014). Among the methods, OCB has 
been recognized as one of the substantial contributors to the productivity and effectiveness of organizations (Podsakoff 
et al., 2009). Employees tend to have higher satisfaction when they are able to contribute to the organizations’ success 
through OCB (Schultz & Schultz, 2010). Furthermore, the environment of workplace will become more 
compassionate, healthy, and supportive which will develop organizations’ success when employees exhibit OCB (Day 
& Carroll, 2004). Employees who behave voluntarily without being recognized by the formal reward system is known 
as employees that exhibit OCB, which in turn, cultivating the performance of organizations (Salajeghe & Farahmand, 
2014). This suggests that, for the purpose to improve effectiveness of company, employees should exert more effort 
by working beyond the formal job scopes. Therefore, due to OCB’s importance on organizations’ success, scholars 
have been putting attention on OCB in different fields, such as engineering and nursing (Podsakoff, Podsakoff, 
Mackenzie, Maynes, Trevor, & Spoelma, 2014).

Abstract 
Prior studies proven that there is internal fit to support the theories regarding the relationship between 
HRM practices and firm performance. However, there are still lack of explanation on how exactly HRM 
practices support firm performance. This paper is designed to extend previous findings by examining 
what have been studied and found, and therefore to provide a framework that complementing all the 
previous models to explain how exactly HRM practices act as strategic elements to support firm 
performance.

1. Introduction
Over the past year, there were great deal of attention given when it comes to the study of Human Resource 
Management (HRM) and its efficacy to deal with the business issues within the organization. A considerable 
discussion in the link of HRM discipline and firm performance critically argues on how managing people in the 
right way may bring positive impact to the organizational success. HRM traditionally viewed as a branch of study 
solely focusing on running administrative tasks and managing people in a firm. However, as the modern study of

This study also proposed that there is no definite ‘best fit’ or a set of practices in order for HRM pratices to support 
firm performance. We are proposing HRM practices can be strategic by assigning certain roles on these practices to 
compliment with business strategy. 
 
A framework proposed in this study is an attempt to develop theory and also to provide explanation on what have 
been missing on the causal direction of these relationship. Future research of this study will be covering on data 
analysis where empirical data will be used as a reference for this theory.

Abstract 
Projects are considered successful when completed on time as per baseline schedule and within allocated target budget. 
Cost overrun is a worldwide challenge to successful completion of construction projects. To overcome this problem, 
earlier studies were conducted to investigate the main causes of cost overrun. Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD) 
and data mining techniques have been implemented successfully in other research areas to extract new and useful 
knowledge from historical data. These techniques can be also applied to projects’ historical data if this data is captured 
in an organized and consistent manner. First section of this paper applies a comprehensive literature review on 
previous research to detect the major factors causing cost overrun. This analysis resulted in selecting twelve major 
factors that can be easily measured and analyzed at construction projects. After that, a data acquisition model is 
developed to capture the relevant historical data and metadata from completed construction projects in a reliable data 
warehouse. The developed data warehouse would enable the implementation of KDD and data mining techniques to 
tackle cost overrun problem.

1. Study Background
Introduction 
In a construction project, usually the contractors and their project team focus their efforts towards handing over the 
project within an acceptable budget and schedule. While on the other hand most of the clients care firstly about the 
project’s cost then quality. A successful project means that the project has accomplished its technical performance, 
maintained its schedule, and remained within budgetary costs (Hammad, AbouRizk and Mohamed, 2014). Therefore, 
it is very important for both the contractor and the client to prepare the project estimates at the initial stages to provide 
the contractor by the ability to form the basis of cost-benefit analysis and to enable the client to take the “to-build-or-
not-to-build” decision. Moreover, it is well known that taking decisions during the pre-execution stage is less 
expensive compared to the massive cost of correction actions during the execution process. Effective cost estimation 
is, therefore, so vital, it can seal a project’s financial fate, Nicholas (2004) notes.

acquisition model that enable capturing the relevant historical data and meta data in a data warehouse. The developed 
data warehouse would enable the implementation of KDD model and facilitate the process of extracting the hidden 
knowledge using a suitable data mining technique. This KDD model would be applied in modern construction 
management as a key business tool to utilize the huge amount of daily generated data, extract the embedded knowledge 
and transform it into decision support systems. This model may supplement the traditional estimation methods and 
provide more reliable final cost forecasting to overcome the cost overrun problem. For future work, this research will 
be extended through implementing a prediction KDD model that uses a suitable data mining technique to analyze the 
cost overrun real historical data from construction projects at U.A.E., the tested data shall contain projects’ cost 
performance and the relevant data and meta data from the twelve suggested quantitative factors responsible for cost 
overrun.

5. Company Code of Conduct Affects the Role of Internal Auditors and Organization Equity 
Simultaneously on Fraud Prevention. 
Hypothesis 5 states that a code of conduct could affect the company's internal auditors and the role of 
organizational justice on the prevention of fraud in a positive and significant. At SPSS output results 
showed F count38.379 greater than F table on the significance 0.000 2.65 or less than 0.05. With the 
presentation value by 42.9% together may affect the prevention of fraud. 
  
Variable code of conduct of this company is adding a variable you want thorough and is an extension 
of previous research. From the test results F explained that the role of the internal auditor and justice 
organizations reinforced code of conduct companies jointly affect the prevention of fraud. Can be 
concludedwith justice organizations both in the enterprise can affect all individuals / employees to be 
able to comply with the code of conduct of companies so as to minimize and prevent fraud will arise, 
and all operations of the company did not escape the role of internal auditors as an internal control 
companies to the vision and mission can be achieved with good company. 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion about the regression model analysis of the influence of 
the role of internal auditors, justice organization and code of conduct of companies to the prevention of 
fraud. Variable research is the dependent variable, namely the prevention of fraud, the independent 
variable is the role of the internal auditor and justice organization and moderating variable that serves 
as a quasi moderation is the code of conduct of the company. Based on the results of this research can 
be concluded as follows: 
 
1. Based on the results of testing the first hypothesis we can conclude the internal auditor's role and 
significant positive effect on the prevention of fraud. The results support the research Taufik (2010) 
which states that the internal auditor's role is very influential on the prevention of fraud. 
 
2. Based on the results of testing the second hypothesis we can conclude positively influence 
organizational justice and significantly to the prevention of fraud. The results support the research 
Herman (2013), Fitrianisa (2014) and Cristofels (2010) which states that justice influential 
organizations on the prevention of fraud. 
 
3. Based on the results of the third hypothesis testing, code of conduct the company can influence the 
internal auditor's role in the prevention of fraud. So we can conclude a code of conduct companies 
able to moderate (strengthening) the relationship of the internal auditor's role positively and 
significantly to the prevention of fraud. 
 
4. Based on the results of testing the fourth hypothesis, the code of conduct can influence organizational 
justice to the prevention of fraud. It can be concluded the code of conduct of companies able to 
moderate (strengthening) the relationship of the internal auditor's role positively and significantly to 
the prevention of fraud. 
 
5. Based on the results of the fifth hypothesis testing, code of conduct could affect the company's 
internal auditors and the role of organizational justice simultaneously. So we can conclude the 
company code of conduct able to moderate (strengthening) the relationship of internal auditors and 
the role of organizational justice positively and significantly to the prevention of fraud.

Abstract 
The bitter experience of global warming has alarmed and compelled the mankind to change the way they 
operate on earth. Within the construction industry, the green building concept evolved and it is now 
gaining momentum rapidly across the world. Green Building involves a building which incorporates 
environmental considerations into every stage of the building construction with the objectives to protect 
occupant health, improve employee productivity, use wisely natural resources and reduce the 
environmental impact. This paper investigates the benefit of green buildings in Johannesburg using a 
detailed questionnaire. The study findings revealed that green buildings provide better health for building 
occupants due to the improved indoor quality, development of more energy efficient products and the use 
of less natural resources for the  satisfaction and welfare of building tenants, also to protect the 
ecosystem. The outcome of this research shows that green building benefits should encourage clients, 
consultants and contractors  invest in green buildings.

1. Introduction
Green Building Council South Africa website (2007) defines a green building as a “building that includes design, 
development and operational practices that essentially decrease or remove negative effect of growth on the 
environment and people. Green structures are energy effective, asset, productive and environmentally responsible. 
This building has taken oﬀ in the previous quite a long while due in extensive part to the creation and activities of 
associations, for example, the United States green building council U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and 
worldwide green building associations. Under a1999 Presidential Executive request and through projects encouraged 
inside a large number of its key organizations, the U.S. national government focused on building green. In 1990 
joined Kingdom built up a Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Eight 
years after the fact United States built up the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). In 2003 
Australia received the framework with ""Green Star”. Singapore and Malaysia embraced the framework with ""Green

5. Conclusion 
From the survey obtained from the respondents, literatures reviewed and the cas studies,  green buildings provide 
better health for building occupants due to the improved indoor quality, lead to the development of more energy-
efficient products and services increase luxury, satisfaction and welfare of building tenants ,improve the value of 
lifetime for individuals, the ecological and emissions costs are lower ,enjoy the support of climate change protocols 
and uses less natural resources and so as to protect the ecosystem, Economic life of green building is extended , to 
the reduction of annual water cost savings were identified as the top ten benefits of green buildings in Johannesburg. 
It can, therefore, be concluded that clients, contractors and consultants need to take consideration of the benefits of 
green buildings and start investing in green building construction. This study will bring more alertness to the public 
about the benefits of Green Buildings and why we need green buildings. 
Despite data limitations and the need for additional research in various areas, the findings of this research point to a 
clear conclusion: building Green building is cost-effective and makes financial sense today.

Abstract 
A fundamental change is sweeping the global economy today, the transition towards clean, innovative, 
low carbon technologies and infrastructures. Sustainability requires the reconciliation of environmental, 
social equity and economic demands which are referred to as three pillars of sustainability. Sustainability 
interfaces with economics through the social and environmental consequences of economic activity. 
Moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails international and national law, urban 
planning and transport, local and individuals lifestyles and ethical consumerism.Cities are facing a host of 
environmental problems, from air pollution to wastewater management and green space degradation.This  
paper investigate factors that are responsible for sustainable city development in developed countries, 
compare to the statu  quo of Johannesburg city development  using past literatures. Finally, some 
suggestions and implications beneficial to the sustainable city development were drawn from theoretical 
models and a systematic model was proffered for sustainable city development in Johannesburg and 
Africa at large.

1. Introduction
Sustainability is the capacity to endure. In ecology the word describes how biological systems remain diverse and 
productive over time. For human, sustainability is the potential for long term maintenance of well being which has 
ecological, economic, political and cultural dimensions. Sustainability requires the reconciliation of environmental, 
social equity and economic demands which are referred to as three pillars of sustainability.  
Since the 1980s sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has 
resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability and sustainable development, that of the Brundtland

Abstract 
The trend of employees leaving a company and recruiting of new employees has become a global 
issue in many organizations worldwide. This recurring situation, know as employee turnover, has brought 
to the concern of human resource managers, especially in Asia and Malaysia is no exception to this 
perturbing situation. High turnover rate is considered a major disadvantage to any organization considering 
the cost of replacement and work disruption. Losing good employees can negatively affect an organization’s 
competitive advantage, lowering the morale of other staff, as well as reducing productivity and work 
quality. Several factors contribute to the employee’s decision to leave a job. They include management, 
organizational configuration, an employee’s attitude and potential, external job demands, employee’s own 
assessment of job related organizational decision, pay, job satisfaction, experience in the organization, job 
enrichment, job stability, job prospects, pay compensation, social support of the supervisor and 
organizational politics. These strong factors may cause behavioural inclination that influences the 
evaluation of one’s job satisfaction to remain in the organization hence. Thus, his paper tries to explore a 
possible factor that can give significant impact to turnover intention of employees in an organization. Base 
on a review of the literature, majority of the studies had identified a negative relationship between 
leadership style and employees’ turnover intention in various fields of industries. The objective of this study 
is therefore, to investigate the implication of transformational and transactional leadership styles on 
turnover intention.

1. Introduction
High turnover rate in private sectors in Malaysia has become a common unhealthy trend in the work setting 
nowadays. High turnover rate is considered a major disadvantage to any organization considering the cost of 
replacement and work disruption (Cao et al., 2013, Rahman and Nas, 2013). According to Low et al., (2001) it is 
highly important to prejudge the employees’ turnover intention in order to minimize its negative impact on 
organization’s performance. This is crucial as it can highly affect both the organisation and employees in many 
negative ways. The most significant impact of employee turnover is visible in the financial sector because overhead

Abstract 
Retaining employees in an organization has become a growing challenge for most corporations in 
current modernized world. Ironically, the turnover among employees is prevalent within the well-educated 
and highly skilled employee group. Retaining optimistic staff with excellent job performance is important 
for the growth of the organization as turnover of critical employee is deemed as major hindrance to the 
development of the organisation in relations to cost of replacement and work disruption. In this competitive 
world, retaining admirable workers is essential because losing them can disrupt an organization’s 
competitive advantage, lowering the morale of other staff, as well as reducing productivity and work 
quality. Lack of social support of the supervisor is a major reason for employees leaving an organisation. 
Having engaged employees results in greater profitability, shareholder returns, productivity and customer 
satisfaction. Transformational leaders are motivating leaders who initiate their subordinates by empowering 
the identification of the group members with each other and with the organization, and by instilling hope, 
trust, optimism, and positive emotions. The absence of positive support and motivation from their superiors 
contribute to employees’ decision to willingly leave their jobs. This paper tries to explore a possible factor 
that can give significant impact to employee retention in an organization. Based on the literature review, 
studies conducted on different fields of industries, revealed that there is existence of a positive relationship 
between leadership style and employee engagement. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the 
implication of transformational and transactional leadership styles on employee engagement to foster 
employee retention.

1. Introduction
The success of an organization highly depends on the active employee engagement due to the fact that it 
improves performance and productivity. These key factors contribute highly in generating the most vital part of a 
business; profit. The business revenue influences the growth and survival of a business. Keeping employees happy is 
the misconception many superiors have about employee engagement whereas, engagement is basically encouraging 
employees to perform above par in achieving the aims of the organization. Many dependable researchers and human 
resource specialists have found that high-spirited workers with enthusiasm are deemed as an added advantage to the 
growth of an organization (Kompaso and Sridevi, 2010). Prior research has found that individuals strive for 
meaningful everyday work which is different from their daily life routine (Mishra et al., 2014; Ugwu et al., 2014).

Abstract 
Researchers are recognizing that the robustness evaluation of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) 
is of great importance for reducing the impact of disruptive events. Yet, very few methods to measure 
the robustness of WDNs have been developed. These methods mainly focus on topological attributes 
and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of the robustness characteristics of WDNs. The work 
described herein proposes a new robustness index to measure the heterogeneity of WDNs drawing 
on informational entropy theory. The paper attempts to shift away from an exclusive topological 
viewpoint or a pure hydraulic approach, towards a combined topological and hydraulic analysis. The 
main emphasis is on the influence of an individual node on the overall network performance. The 
use of the proposed index is illustrated with a real-world WDN of an Australian town. The results 
highlight the significance of integrating the topological and hydraulic metrics for a reliable 
assessment of robustness in WDNs.

1. Introduction
Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are among the most significant critical infrastructures with high degree 
of complexity. Disruption and dysfunction of WDNs would have debilitating effect on different aspects of 
human life such as safety, economic, security, public health and social well-being (Gunawan et al., 2017). In 
this respect, it is imperative to have proper measures to evaluate the robustness of WDNs in order to reduce 
the impact of disruptive events.  
There is no unique interpretation of the robustness in complex networks and extant literature has presented 
multiple and rather contradicting definitions of robustness. Carlson and Doyle (2002) define the robustness as 
the ability of a system to fulfil its desired characteristics despite fluctuations in its components behavior. In the 
work of Li et al. (2008), robustness is seen as the ability of the system to avoid malfunction when a fraction of 
its components are failed. Cuadra et al. (2015) regards the robustness in complex networks as the opposite of 
vulnerability, which accounts for the reliability of the system. Ferrario et al. (2016) define the robustness as 
the capability of the network to provide the required level of supply of good, when the system is exposed to 
partial failures. Robustness is also defined as the ability of a network to cope with faults during operations

nodes in the network, results in loss of overall performance at values of less than 1%, thereby confirming low 
heterogeneity of the studied network.  
As above discussion attests, the high value of 𝑅𝑆𝐼= 0.963 is not entirely surprising and, indeed this value is
in consistent with the fact that the Bordertown WDN is a spatially organized network with low heterogeneity, 
where most of the nodes have comparable influence form degree and demand perspectives.   
4. Conclusion
The method described herein represents a new step toward measuring the robustness of WDNs. The authors 
advocate the idea that the behavior of a network can be characterized by assessing the influence of each 
individual node in the network (Singh et al., 2015). Different authors have developed topological perspectives 
to evaluate the robustness of complex networks by assessing the influence of individual nodes. The present 
research emphasizes that persistent focus on topological properties fails to realistically measure the robustness 
of WDNs. To remedy this weakness, rooted in entropy theory, a new robustness index is proposed, which 
combines the topological and hydraulic attributes of the network. The proposed index not only explores the 
structural heterogeneity of the network by using an entropy-based degree distribution metric, but also 
incorporates the demand fraction entropy which accounts for the hydraulic attribute of WDNs. This integrated 
approach yields more useful insights to evaluate the robustness of WDNs in comparison with the conventional 
approaches.  
The paper posits the informational entropy theory as a tool to measure the robustness of WDNs. The work also 
measures and analyses the robustness of a network from the character of its heterogeneity (Wang et al., 2006). 
On this premises, the joint entropy of degree distribution and demand fraction is employed to measure the 
network’s heterogeneity, which in turn can be interpreted as the measure of robustness. The entropy-based 
analysis reveals that a uniform demand distributed network with diversity in its degree distribution is less 
heterogeneous and thus exhibits more robust behavior against random failure of its nodes.     
The use of the proposed index was illustrated with a real-world case study. The paper compared the 
effectiveness of the demand fraction entropy-based metric with the degree distribution entropy-based metric. 
The numerical results confirmed that the nodal degrees in WDNs span over a small range of values, 
consequently the degree distribution entropy-based metric is not informative enough and therefore stand-alone 
use of this metric hinders a reliable assessment of the robustness in WDNs (Giustolis et al., 2017).   
Though the degree distribution and demand fraction are good indicators of topological and hydraulic 
(respectively) performance of WDNs, these metrics don’t entirely characterize the structural and hydraulic 
behaviors of the network. Further research can build upon our current study by incorporating more topological 
(e.g. centrality measures) as well as hydraulic (e.g. pressure head at nodes) metrics into our method. 
Furthermore, since nodal demands are one of the main sources of uncertainty in WDNs (Sanz and Perez, 2014), 
it would be helpful if future research could engage in reducing the uncertainty in model outputs induced by 
uncertainty in nodal demands.   
The authors believe that the robustness evaluation of WDNs requires incorporating more factors than is 
presented in this paper and hope the current study further encourages researchers to develop more innovative 
methods.

Abstract 
Steel is one of the most in demand product to be manufactured every year for it is the mainly used 
material in building infrastructures and households. Musculoskeletal Disorders and its discomforts is one 
of the reason why many company losses profits, for it affects the workers’ joints, tendons, muscles, 
nerves, limb and back which results to decrease in productivity of the workers. Through observations, 
interviews, distribution of questionnaires and through the application of various statistical tools and 
software, data were gathered in order to find the main factors that contributes to MSDs and where do they 
experience discomforts. From the data gathered, it shows that 100% of the respondents experiences body 
discomforts in the lower back due to continuous operating of machines yields, various work postures and 
forced movements to the workers. Also, the data gathered shows that due to MSDs there is a 6.35% 
difference to the the expected output given by the company compared to the output produced the workers. 
The result of this paper aims decrease the 17.34% of the lower back discomfort and optimize the 6.60% 
decrease of outputs.

1. Introduction
With an annual mortality rate of 1.2 million and annual years of healthy life loss of 1,518 per 100,000 people, the 
Philippines ranked fourth out of twenty-one in the annual mortality rate in Asia during the year 2013, resulting to 
annual years of healthy life lost of 24% since year 1990. [1] In years 2011 and 2013, the Philippines’s most common 
type of occupational disease affecting workers is back pain which is accounted for 35.5% (30,374) and 31.6% 
(54,244) occurrences in both manufacturing and service industries, resulting for the number of musculoskeletal 
disorder cases to double from 85,483 in year 2011 to 171,787 cases in year 2013, yielding a 50.24%. [2] With the 
economic performance of the Philippines over the past years, from 5.1% in year 2011 to 7.2% in year 2013, the 
construction sector is one of the major contributor driven by demand for private residential, office buildings and 
infrastructure spending by the government, leading to an upswing in demand for steel products with a consumption 
growth of 61% from year 2010 up to 2013. [3] With this, the number of musculoskeletal disorders experienced by 
the manufacturing workers increases from 31,096 in year 2011 to 51,110 in year 2013, resulting to an increase of 
39.16%  in occupational disorders.[2]. In the subject company, the researchers were able to gather a 100% response 
rate of the workers who experience musculoskeletal discomfort; the response rate was gathered from the overall 
results of the questionnaire distributed by the researchers to the workers in the production area. The results showed 
17.34% of the total workers experienced lower back discomfort. Furthermore, thirteen out of forty of the workers 
answered an average rating of eight out of ten from the questionnaire or 32.50%. Moreover, other body discomforts 
the workers experience are the neck, upper back, shoulder arms and legs with an overall cumulative frequency of

The table above shows the data results of standardized of regression weights of steel workers in expected and actual 
outputs, where the expected output has a value of 58% in total estimates value while the actual output has a 40.3%.

In Table 5 it shows the total estimates in expected output value of 0.580 or 58% while the total estimates of actual 
output value of 0.456 or 45.6% that are the unstandardized regression weights. In Table 6 it show the value of 
standardized regression weights in expected outputs of 0.58 or 58%, while the actual output value of 0.403 or 40.3

a difference value of 0.1293 or 12.93% while the actual output has a difference value of 0.1162 or 11.62%. Which is 
the 12.93% of Expected Output is need to increase, 11.62% of actual output is need increase in production. 
 
5. Recommendations 
 
Based from the previously conducted Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire answered by the structural iron 
and steel workers, the lower back region of the body was the main factor that contributed to the pain that the 
workers experienced. The researchers proposed exercises and stretches in order to help the workers of the company 
in order to prevent the discomforts and illnesses relating to MSD’s. Factors mostly related to the neck and shoulders 
and the rest of the upper body down to the lower part. Some of the recommended exercises include back/side stretch, 
middle/upper back stretch, back curl, standing stretch, and hip stretch; this is to minimize the MSDs of the workers 
in the company and to increase their capability to produce the expected outputs. The researchers also recommended 
the maintaining and controlling of the weight of the workers in line with the capability of the worker to the various 
work movements, postures and forced movements that they do. Furthermore, it helps to fit the job to the workers 
and their various tasks in the work area such as the operating of the machines, lifting of boxes, carrying of materials 
from one machine to the other and material handling of the assistance equipment present in the company. Having 
such inappropriate weight will hinder and bottleneck the process of finishing the outputs required by the company. 
Also, the researchers recommended a stricter implementation of PPE’s this was recommended due to most of the 
workers in the production area do not wear the appropriate PPE and lastly, the researchers recommended to the 
company to place ventilation and cooling systems in the production area mainly because the area is naturally hot and 
the overall work schedule is operating continuously and it exposes the workers to excessive heat, this slows down 
the process and tasks due to exhaustion. To minimize physical workload the researchers recommends that on their 
eight working hours, adult’s employee takes a recovering time-out of one and half hours in a working time that will 
have at least seven and half minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the afternoon.  
 
6. Conclusions 
 
Results from the questionnaires showed that 100% of the respondents experienced body discomforts and has 
decreased their productivity by not fully producing the desired outputs needed by the company. Results generated 
from the normality testing and multiple regressions indicated the critical factors that affected the expected outputs 
and actual outputs done by the workers; results from multiple regression generated the significant factors for 
expected outputs which were physical workload, lower back, neck, upper back, shoulder, and legs, while critical 
factor for the actual outputs was the physical workload. Moreover the 17.34% lower back pain and it decreased the 
outputs done by the company by 6.60%. Furthermore, the percent difference of the expected outputs from the actual 
outputs showed a negative relationship which indicates that in order to minimize the instances of experiencing 
discomfort the company will decrease the expected outputs by 12.93% to increase the actual outputs done by the 
workers by 11.62%. Moreover, to decrease the instances even further the researchers also recommended the proper

exercises needed to prevent and minimize these illnesses; these include exercises for the upper body, neck and 
shoulders, chest, back, side and legs. The researchers also recommended to the workers to monitor their weight 
regularly, these ensures that the worker will be capable of handling the various tasks that can contribute to the 
MSD’s and its health risks.  Furthermore, this research can also serve as basis for future research by applying other 
ergonomic topics and tools such as Rapid Entire Body Movement (REBA), Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) 
and the NIOSH Lifting Index, these can aid as tools for determining specific movements of the different parts of the 
body and how it can affect the steel and iron workers. Manual Material Handling can also function as the proper tool 
for future research since material handling can also serve as a factor for experiencing MSD’s.

Abstract 
The systematic review in this study is looking at the causes of stress in the workplace. The authors will 
identify the most leading causes of work-related stress, as well as their impacts on employees’ physical 
well-being, mental health and work performance. In addition, the stress factors arising from work 
environment or atmosphere, workplace relationships, organizational culture, career growth, role conflict, 
and work-life balance are highlighted. Finally, the authors discuss on several stress coping approaches, 
namely getting social support, attending stress coping or stress management programmes, upgrading work 
environment, and reforming organizational culture.

1. Introduction
Stress is a regular state that happened to everyone. Numerous studies have been done by many researchers and 
experts in relation to stress, particularly stress which occurred in the workplace. According to Sengupta and 
Sengupta (2017), stress is defined as mental, emotional, and physical reactions to a difficult situation. Besides, stress 
is also described as a physical and mental condition which influences the individual’s productivity, efficiency, health 
and work quality (Comish and Swindle, 1994).  
In terms of stress occurred in the workplace, Colligan and Higgins (2006) stated that the workplace is the change in 
one’s mental or physical state in response to workplaces that pose an appraised challenge or threat to that worker. 
Besides, Ramli (2016) stated that the pressure from one’s workplace is a very critical phenomenon and is regularly 
associated with the employees’ work performance, health and productivity levels. This kind of stress may threaten 
the person or the worker’s quality working life. Stress may also vary according to the type of work, position or 
responsibility held by the worker (Ramli, 2016).  
Different kind of work scope or type of job will definitely gives different stress levels. This is agreed by Lazarus 
(1991), whom mentioned that stress and also distress differ according to occasion or setting involved with the 
individuals. Furthermore, stress can also vary according to age, socio-economic variable, personality and job 
category (Lazarus, 1991). In this paper, a systematic review on the most leading causes of stress in the workplace 
will be identified. Then, the impact of stress and ways of coping with stress will also be discussed. 
2. Related Theory
There are many theories on stress have been broadly discussed and mentioned by researchers. The stress 
physiological model, General Adaptation Syndrome Theory was introduced by Hans Selye (Bullare et al., 2009). 
The theory explains that stress is a human body’s response towards the cause of stress. According to Berry (1998), 
few hormonal mechanisms and human body’s nervous system are being continuously activated when the person

6. Coping with Stress 
 
According to Lazarus (1991), there are three strategies that can be taken in handling and reducing stress at the 
workplace. The strategies are related to the managers’ important role as the leader in the company or department. 
The first one is the managers need to adjust the working conditions to be more conducive and comfortable. This can 
be done by eliminating obstacles like overloaded tasks, environmental irritations, and isolation. The second strategy 
is to assist the employees in improving their environment condition, by giving them an employee support program 
or stress management resources. Furthermore, the next strategy is to identify and help them by constructing some 
solutions in removing the tension in their stressful condition or relationship. From these strategies, it can be seen that 
the role of managers or leaders are very critical in maintaining a healthy or stress-free environment in the workplace. 
 
Other than that, Burke (1993) discussed on the coping strategies in reducing stress, which typically involve getting 
family and social support. For instance, the person can take few strategies namely attending support group meetings, 
sharing stressful incidents with other people, and also participating in religious-based support groups. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Stress in the workplace is a very critical issue and a real challenge to the employees as well as the employers. 
Therefore, it is essential that every party in the workplace, be it employer or employees, cooperates with each other 
in managing the stress in the workplace. For instance, some stress coping strategies that can be used are getting 
social support, attending stress coping or stress management programmes, upgrading work environment, and 
reforming organizational culture. 
 
In addition, it is essential that the workplace is being continuously monitored so that the stress problems will not 
spreading or expanding to a broader and more harmful ones. A healthy working place and stress-free environment 
need to be promoted, while managers play a significant role in the identifying and finding ways to intervene the 
unceasing workplace stress.

Abstract 
The aim of this descriptive and correlational research is to explore the relationship between 
employee’s personality and career achievement. This study involved 126 respondents ranging 
from grades 1 to 54 in the Land and Mines Office, Nusajaya, Johor. The respondents were selected 
using stratified random sampling method. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire was 
designed to evaluate the respondents’ personality, while the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire 
(MSQ) was developed to measure their career success. Then, the collected data was analysed using 
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. The results indicated that the 
‘openness to experience’ personality trait was found high in the majority of respondents as 
compared to the other four personality dimensions. In addition, the respondents scored higher in 
intrinsic career success as compared to extrinsic career success. Furthermore, the Pearson 
correlation test revealed that the dimensions of agreeableness, extraversion, openness to 
experience, and conscientiousness are associated to the intrinsic career success. However, the 
findings related to extrinsic career success showed a positive relationship with the 
conscientiousness dimension, and a negative relationship with the neuroticism dimension.  Finally, 
the findings from this study will make a significant contribution to the field of personality and 
career success.

Abstract 
Organizations want to deliver more for less, thus they could establish, implement, maintain and continually 
improve an asset management system, in line with the requirements of the international standards to achieve 
their objectives. Implementing ISO55000 can add significant advantages to any organization by increasing 
the asset’s uptime, and reducing maintenance costs. This paper discusses the challenges faced in 
implementing the requirements of ISO 55000 through a case study. The case study considers the 
maintenance department of an educational institute in United Arab Emirates, which is responsible for all 
assets and their maintenance at the institute’s main campus. The results of the study indicate that with the 
current situation, the institute needs a lot of changes and efforts in order to satisfy the requirements of 
ISO55000.

1. Introduction
Every organization has different types of assets, tangible or intangible, financial or non-financial. These assets are the 
backbone of a company that keep it in production. They create value to the organization, thus need to be used 
efficiently and effectively to get the best value compromised between a set of competing objectives throughout the 
asset lifecycle. Asset management helps the organization to realize that value through monitoring and maintaining 
these assets through their lifecycle.  
 The Institute of Asset Management (2012) states that “asset management is not new, people and organizations have 
been managing assets for thousands of years. What has changed, however, is the cumulative recognition of what good 
asset management involves the optimization of cost, risk, performance, resources and benefits over the whole asset 
life- within any absolute constraints”. The understanding of the principles of assets management has developed 
significantly over the last decade and a number of approaches, standards and models have been developed across the 
world. In January 2014, an international standard which is called ISO55000 (International Organization for 
Standardization) was published by ABNT (Brazilian Technical Standards Association). This standard could be applied 
to all types of assets in any organization regardless of its type and size. In 5 February 2014, the International 
Organization of Standardization launched ISO5500X series. The first document in the series is ISO55000, which 
provides an overview of the standard with  definition of principles and terminologies of asset management. The second 
document is ISO55001 that specifies the requirements to asset management, and finally ISO55002 that provides 
guidelines to implement ISO55001.  
The implementation of these international standards will add many benefits such as increasing efficiency and 
effectiveness, improve level of the provided services, enhance the reputation and help in managing risks (British 
standard Institution, 2014). The ISO5500X standard series are frameworks  that provide organizations with what needs 
to be done but not how to accomplish it therefore it requires using the correct policy, procedure and actions to achieve 
excellence of asset management (Sondalini, 2012, Minnaar et al., 2013).

improvement. While observing the current system used in the maintenance department, it was shown that the 
department does not have enough indicators, which measure the performance of the entire asset managed by the 
department. On other hand, the used indicators were not useful to identify patterns and obtain information regarding 
the performance of the department.  
 
3.4.3 Inadequate risk management approach  
The maintenance department provides a wide-range of services at the institute’s main campus. Providing these services 
needs to set plans that include the required activities and resources.  During the implementation of these plans, different 
types of risks might occur. Such risks can affect the level of the provided services. ISO55001 requires a risk 
management plan that will minimize the probability of having such risks during the implementation process. The 
department has failed to meet this requirement due to the lack of awareness of all the risks that may prevent its 
objectives from being achieved.  
 
3.4.4 Inadequate documentation process for the required information  
One of the main requirements of ISO55001 is the determination and documentation of the information which is 
necessary for the effectiveness of the department performance. This information should be created, updated, and 
controlled in a way that ensures its availability and suitability for use, whenever it is necessary. During the assessment 
process, it was found that the department did not use a systematic approach to identify the necessary asset information. 
Moreover, the current documentation process was not useful to restore the information easily.  
 
3.4.5 Difficulties in controlling the outsourced activities 
Due to the large number of services provided by the maintenance department, the department has to outsource some 
of these services. Outsourcing does not violate the requirements of ISO55001. However, the main requirement is to 
control the outsourced services by ensuring the ability of the service providers in providing these services at the 
required level. This requirement was missing within the department because of the absence of people who are 
experienced in the field of the provided service. Thus, the department faced difficulties in monitoring the performance 
of the service providers and evaluate if they provide the services at the required level. 
 
3.4.6 Lack of competence 
ISO55000 defines competence as the ability to apply knowledge and skills to achieve intended results. It requires the 
department to map its current competences to its required competences to determine any gaps. Such gap analysis was 
missing within the department. During the assessment process, it was found that the in general the department is 
lacking for competent persons at medium and lower levels who can manage the services provided by the department 
itself and at the same time who can evaluate the level of the outsourced services. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper discusses a methodological framework for identifying the challenges faced by the maintenance department 
of an educational institute in UAE to meet ISO55001 requirements. The study was implemented by using the Self-
Assessment Methodology software (SAM) and the results were represented in a radar chart. The results were analyzed 
to identify the gaps in the current assets management system of the maintenance department, and identify the 
challenges in implementing the requirements of ISO55001.

Abstract 
Since 2007 Indonesian governments try to encourage every region to develop their regional innovation 
system (RIS) based on national innovation system (NIS). Lamongan is one of the regencies located on the 
north coast of East Java, it has long coastline along 47 km. Realize of potential Lamongan in their maritime 
sector, Ministry of Industry Indonesia and East Java Government has established the northern region of 
Lamongan Regency especially in Brondong sub-regency as a special economic region for maritime industry 
sector land with ± 450 hectares that will be developed soon. In order to develop their Regional Innovation 
System, Lamongan Regency government agreed to using theme “Development of Sustainable Maritime 
Industry Based Mina-Agro-Tourism”. Leading sector of maritime industries in Lamongan is shipbuilding 
yard and fisheries. Bring the sustainable concept to shipbuilding industry can increase competitiveness of 
a shipyard and increase opportunity to reach new market. Maritime industries involving various supporting 
industries that made maritime industries become a complex industrial estates, therefore this research choose 
system dynamic approach to formulate linkage between each parties for establishing the appropriate policy 
for development maritime industry with environmental sound in order to strengthen regional innovation 
system in Lamongan regency.

Conclusion and Suggestion 
As the result of analysis that already done, sustainability of maritime industries in Lamongan regency are really needed 
to boost regional income and create more jobs for local people. Sustainable shipyard have advantages in increased 
their reputation in market, due to their “sustainable” labels as differentiate to their competitor who just using 
conventional business. By concerning on development sustainable maritime industry and process innovation support 
with green managerial innovation, will lead to potential of cost savings, efficiency, increased productivity and better 
product quality. Development of sustainability is an effort to exploit all the potential that exists in Lamongan regency. 
This Regional Innovation Capacity Model captured which one regional systems source of knowledge they need to 
perform innovation, convert the knowledge into an innovation capacity manage innovation processes and then utilize 
innovation outcome to establish growth and development in their regions. For the further research will be needed for 
calculation in feasibility of ship dismantling and recycling facility investment and then calculate how much land 
needed for fish cultivation to support blue growth in Lamongan regency.

Performance of class aggregation in a 
multiple class inventory rationing problem 
Sugoutam Ghosh 
Singapore University of Social Sciences

Abstract 
Researchers have shown that inventory rationing is possibly the best technique to deal with inventory 
systems with multiple demand classes, ordering the same product. The classes are prioritized based on 
the penalty cost of not fulfilling a demand immediately upon arrival. In order to fulfil the demand from 
different classes, the system rations inventory using a critical level policy in which each class has a 
critical inventory level associated with it. Under this policy, when the inventory is below the critical 
level for that class, the demand for this class and all the lower classes is backordered. Deshpande et al. 
(2003) showed that inventory rationing performs better than other policies for 2 demand classes. What 
happens when there is more than 2 classes?  Do we really need to consider multiple classes? In this 
presentation, we, numerically, investigate the impact of collapsing a 5-demand class system into a 2-
class system by aggregating several demand classes together and present our findings.

Abstract 
Within an Entrepreneurship ecosystem companies are divided in three phases of development: startup, 
scale up, and unicorn. This paper addresses the scale up phase and focuses in a bottleneck of transition 
stage from startup to scale up and consider various challenges from point of view of risk management. 
This research presents a risk identification framework based on some best practices. The method 
proposed is supported by established risk management concepts that can be applied to help scale up 
companies to gain awareness of the risks especially during transition period.  
This paper contributes for research on entrepreneurship’s risks by applying risk management for 
transition performance of scaling up companies by identifying the relevant risk factors that should be 
considered. Subsequently, these risks should be evaluated in order to executing proper actions. In 
addition, it gives to entrepreneur’s insights on how the adoption of the growth will affect the enterprise 
scaling, and how it can increase the assurance of transition stage. The paper concludes with a summary of 
key ideas and promising directions for future work.

1. Introduction
Early recognition and understanding of risks of business failure are important for establishing, sustaining and 
growing a business (Hyder,2016). Although, some recent researchers’ concentration are on learning from failure  
(Atsan, 2016) and failure management through experimental approach to support entrepreneurs (Lee & Miesing, 
2017); this research focuses on risk management process for presenting a systematic approach to help 
entrepreneurship stakeholders such as founders and investors in identifying, assessing and treating the risks.  
This research aims to support scale up companies by identifying the risks in transition stage. Therefore, the 
consternation of the research is based on a new classification of risk factors special for this stage and not classic one

5. Conclusion 
This research investigated the possibility to utilize risk management in identifying the risks of transition stage of 
scaling up companies. A state‐of‐the‐art literature review was performed to establishing the context as first step in a 
risk management process. The main objective was to find a risk classification as best practices that should be 
managed to obtain the relevant risk events and risk consequences that support the development of a risk model 
focused on the integration of best practices and risk profile attributes. For this purpose, the authors have applied 
eight classes of hurdles during scaling up period as a basis of risk categories because of being relevant and 
comprehensive in explaining the research problem. 
Briefly, it has presented a pragmatic risk registry that can be used to identify risks in scaling up firms. Noticeably, 
identifying the risk is just the first step of a risk formwork and it is important to complete the risk assessment 
process and risk treatment as well. In the future researches, the authors are looking to investigate these steps and 
presenting a more complete risk model and also using “empirical examples” of actual companies to study and 
demonstrate the core constructs and ideas. Afterwards, we are able to show the potential of using risk management 
process, which, if managed properly, can be helpful in preventing the company’s failure.

Abstract 
Prior to commercializing a product of interest, techno-economic principles are used to determine viability 
of the process flow. The aim of this paper was to conduct a desktop research on the process flow of interest 
(the technology and the raw material of interest) using techno-economic approach thereby determining the 
commercializing a product. As much as Silicon Nitride based materials that are sintered through the 
application of Spark Plasma Sintering SPS technology have grasped the interest of researchers for 
commercial possibilities, a techno-economic study of commercializing Silicon Nitride based materials 
using SPS technology was not found during the desktop research. The results obtained indicated that there 
is a common agreement among authors about techno-economic application. It was therefore concluded that 
techno-economic approach/ principle(s) can be used to determine the commercialization of any product.

1. Introduction  
Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technology was first 
developed by FCT Systeme GmbH in Germany, for 
the production of powder metals, ceramics products 
and as a replacement for the traditional method of 
sintering, that being, Hot isostatic press (HIP) and Hot 
press (HP). SPS has been a growing technology that 
was further manufactured by the United States of 
America, Japan and China (Guillon, 2014).  
James, (2017), indicated that Powder metallurgy (PM) 
as a method of processing metal powders of specific 
shapes and size had improved specimen properties 
through the use of SPS technology as compared to the 
traditional methods. PM was inspired by the 
deficiencies that were experienced in the traditional 
method of metal casting, and the inability of the 
casting method to producing required sized and shaped 
parts  
PM was introduced as a solution to stand in the gap 
that the casting method could not fill. In PM, 
traditional methods of sintering such as (HP) and 
(HIP) were used, but the economic viability were not 
as friendly until SPS technology was introduced 
(Berroth, 2010). The incorporation of SPS in the PM 
process flow, showed to be economically efficient 
while deficiencies that were produced in the traditional 
methods were either being minimized or eliminated.        
By determining a process flow of producing the 
product of interest, a techno-economic approach can 
be used to determine the economic viability of 
commercialization through project investment (Peters, 
1991). In the literature review conducted it was shown 
that the capital investment, working capital, and fixed 
capital can be determined using different techno-
economic principles. The latter includes, cost 
estimation and profitability measures to determine the 
viability of production through sensitivity analysis, 
process optimization and the return on investments. 
The objective of this paper was to conduct a techno-
economic modeling desktop research based on the 
viability of manufacturing advanced ceramic materials 
using SPS technology.

outlines the processing method, technology of interest 
along with the raw material of interest, and section 2","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Bandung,

(Peters, 1991) and (Lin, 2017), are not mentioning the 
application of any software, they emphasize that the 
application of techno-economic principle are basics of 
the study. In supporting the latter authors, a techno-
economic study can be successfully employed without 
the aid of software’s.     
5. Conclusion 
According to the techno-economic literature review in 
this paper a desktop research was successfully 
conducted. It is therefore concluded that the economic 
viability of manufacturing/ commercializing silicon 
nitride based material using SPS can be determined by 
the application of techno-economic principles without 
the aid of software(s), unless software’s are used for 
simulation purpose. As much as the raw material is of 
economic concern in techno-economic, Silicon Nitride 
was found to have suitable properties of interest for 
military, 
medicine, 
and 
automotive 
industry 
application.   It is also concluded that the questions of 
interest were answered in statements made by different 
authors presented in Table 1.

cost estimation method was employed along with 
quotation requirements. By using this hybrid method, 
total capital investment, operating expenses, direct and 
indirect cost were determined. In the study, it was 
mentioned that the technology used could be improved 
to favouring the economic viability, and that the 
optimization of the process flow could also be of help 
in lowering production cost. 
By supporting the afore mentioned authors, (Shafiee, 
2016), uses Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS software’s 
to simulate a process flow of producing hydrogen 
using a thin layer membrane reactor. The study 
focuses on commercializing the process, but 
uncertainties are considered as a challenge of 
upscaling. By incorporating the use of MATLAB 
software to simulate process optimization, it is 
mentioned that uncertainties can be manipulated by 
changing one operating variable at a time. In so doing, 
economic measures shows that the technology of 
interest can be used viably to produce hydrogen. 
3. Methodology 
Desk top research was conducted, and research papers 
from year 2010 to date were studied to answer the 
research questions. The literature review was carried 
based on the basis of techno-economic, which outlines 
the technology of interest and its economics. The 
literature review of techno-economic that was done, 
showed that there hasn’t been an extensive work that 
was carried out on SPS. Rather techno-economic 
studies were conducted on different technologies in a 
processing 
plants, 
either 
from 
grass 
roots, 
development, and replacement level, but not that of 
SPS technology.  
In the review that was conducted, only the literature 
based on techno-economic (modeling, analysis, 
evaluation), technology of interest (SPS), and Silicon 
Nitride was considered to be of interest due to 
alinement of the study title. Common agreement 
among authors was analysed and considered to be the 
baseline that the study would be based on, thereby also 
answering the question of interest.    
4. Results and Discussion  
In the literature review carried out, the techno-
economic approach of commercializing silicon nitride 
based material was not found. Although the literature 
reviewed shows that principle of techno-economic can 
applied to study the commercialization of any product. 
This was done by analysing a common ground that 
appeared in different papers. The latter is shown by

Abstract 
This paper presents the results of anthropometric data collected for Saudi male workers working in 
different occupations in Riyadh the capital city of the kingdom.  A set of 15 body measurements are 
collected for 154 subjects aged 25-60.   Anthropometric tables were constructed that can be utilized by 
designers, healthcare professionals and private and government agencies.  It is believed that this is the 
first anthropometric study for the working men in the country and availability of such data will allow for 
safe and convenient work place design. 
Keywords: Male, anthropometry, Saudi Arabia, ergonomics 
1. Introduction
Anthropometry is the human science that deals with collecting and documenting human body measurements.  
Employing such data during the design stages would produce safer and more usable product (Pentikis, 2002). 
Anthropometry in product and workplace design has been applied by many researchers (Al-Ansari and Mokdad, 
2009; Oyewole et al, 2010; Ghaderi et al, 2014; Reis et al, 2012; Sutalaksana and Widyanti, 2016).  Anthropometric 
measurements are mainly varies by race and ethnicity.  Anthropometric data have been collected for many countries. 
Examples of anthropometric studies for different countries can be seen in (Wang et al, 2002; Chuan et al, 2010; Hu 
et al, 2007; Iseri and Arslan, 2009; Kothiyal and Tettey, 2000; Barroso et al, 2005).  Anthropometry was also used to 
design tools and equipment for different occupations as seen in (Agrawal et al, 2010; Dewangan et al, 2010; Chan 
and Jiao, 1996; Prado-Lu, 2007). 
Saudi Arabia is one of the top twenty world economies and the world's leading oil exporter.  The government 
undergoes many reforms to reduce its dependence on oil.  Industrialization is one of the efforts exerted by the 
government to convert its wealth of crude oil into lasting industrial development. This initiative demanded the 
construction of infrastructure and a supply of the necessary devices, equipment and machinery from different parts 
of the world.    Moreover, Oil wealth has increased the standard of living of most Saudis increasing the demands on 
importing consumer goods such as electronics and furniture from China, Russia, Europe and North America.  Lack 
of anthropometric data will likely create a mismatch between the imported products and Saudi body sizes.  Saudi 
Arabia like other developing countries has limited anthropometric data.  There are some attempts to collect 
anthropometric data for different Saudi populations for product design applications (Al-Hazzaa, 1990; Alrashdan et 
al, 2014).  Other studies were mainly conducted in the medical field as seen in (Al-Qattan et al, 2012; Al-Shehri et 
al, 2005).  
The main objective of this study is to determine the anthropometric dimensions for Saudi male working population 
aged 25-65. The data was collected from individual working in different occupations.  This study is believed to be 
the first to report Saudi body sizes for this age group.

4. Conclusion
Body dimensions of Saudi working males aged 20-65 years are presented.  15 standard body dimensions were 
collected.  The subjects were arranged in 7 groups of 5 years a part to detect any measurement differences among 
subjects as age increases.  It was found that the changes of means across age groups are not statistically significant 
for all of the 15 measurements.  Consequently, data are combined for each measurement across all age groups.  The 
extreme values (5th, 95th) percentiles were found and documented in a standard anthropometric table.  Data is 
expected to be utilized by ergonomists to design safe and appropriately fit products for the Saudi males. 
Furthermore, this data is believed to be the first to present body dimensions for the age domain under study.  It can 
be used a reference for future study.

Abstract 
The aims of this research are to benchmark individual innovation excellence and performance of 
innovation indicators in selected industries in Oman. It also identifies the emerging trends of innovation 
across various types and sizes of industrial sectors (both manufacturing and service) in Oman. The 
methodology adopted to conduct this research was mainly case study along with quantitative analysis. 
This article presents the initial results from an ongoing research project and future research will carried 
out to get the actual results.

1. Introduction
Innovation is a multidimensional approach but the basic definition of innovation is that process which translate the 
new idea or solution into service to meet the requirements and add value to their people needs (Bossink, and 
Vrijhoef, 2009). Innovation one important domain which appeared recently and could be a sustainable successful for 
a long period. Innovation is the main driver of the nation economy in developed countries (Visnjic et al., 2016). 
Innovation could be the reason behind the sustainability of the long-run businesses. Nowadays the needs of 
innovation activities becoming more important than before since it provide the requirements needs and added value 
to people’s life. In addition, the innovation activities extend the employment base by create new jobs. It is enhancing 
the quality of the life to make the world better for the next generations (Cui and Wu, 2016).  
In general, the innovation activity is based on many pillars, which are products, process, service and technology.  
These pillars are used to as the baselines to measure innovation level in any specific industry or organization (Balka 
et al., 2014).  The purpose behind this research paper is to offer an overview of innovation, measuring the main 
important dimensions on it and to find out the relationship between the levels of innovation and how do them 
affecting the sales of the firm focusing on selected industries in Oman.  
Along with the measurement of innovation, this research also made an effort to identifying the drivers and barriers 
of innovation, which lead to conduct an innovation index. The objectives of this research therefore can be outlined 
as follows: 

To conduct an index to measure level of innovation practice and link it with the industry’s sales.

To create an innovation index based on collecting relevant information in innovation activities within
Omani industries.

To find out limitations and bottlenecks on innovation to identify prospective drivers and barriers of
innovation Omani industries

To provide recommendations to improve generic innovation practices in Omani industries.

To be successful in overall industrialization growth, industries need to be as innovative as possible in order to 
survive in today’s competitive business environment. Without innovation activities whatever the types or formats, 
industries cannot be able to sustain in the market with goodwill and profitability. From time to time, it is necessary 
for industrial organizations to measure their innovation levels. Such performance measurement helps industries to 
improve their existing activities on innovation activities. It also support industries to look out their limitations or 
bottlenecks on innovation and helps to motivate them to perform better in innovation activities.  
 
Measuring innovation is a critical process and many countries found the process of measuring innovation is difficult. 
The lack of adopting innovation is due to the lack of measurement approaches. It is found that innovation can be 
measured in industries based on the understanding of firm’s motivations to innovate and the need of innovation.  
 
Since innovation is poorly practiced in Omani industries, this could affect the sales of large firms and may destroy 
the start-up ones. To ensure a high level of innovation practices and sales, Omani industries have to follow the 
innovation index that is based on scientific knowledge and experience. This index includes all three pillars of 
innovation, which are product, process and service and can be applicable for all type of industries in Oman whether 
it is manufacturing industry or service industry. In addition, the index is considering the three main dimensions of 
innovation such as economic, environment and social.  
 
Measuring the innovation level based on the three pillars, helps industries to sustainability issue is the main core of 
nowadays investment. This project will focused more about how firms reach a high level of innovation and how 
does innovation led sustainability.    
 
Applying an extensive survey in Omani industries to assess the potentials of innovation activities, considering the 
existing challenges/bottlenecks in innovation. Preliminary study found that there is no specific information/database 
of the industries in Oman involved in innovation activities. Keeping this research gap in mind, the aim of this 
research is to conduct an innovation index to study the practice of innovation in selected Omani industries and link it 
with the company sales. 
 
6. Discussions and conclusions  
 
Innovation is an important factor of keeping performance of firms improving. In addition, it is one of the main 
reasons of getting competitive advantage in the market. In industries, cost is a critical consideration and need to be 
monitored along with the profit gained. Innovation practice helps increasing the profit incrementally. 
 
Measuring innovation is a one way of rising the awareness of innovation benefits. However, Omani industries 
lagging behind in this field due to different reasons like the lack of specialties in this field. Also, the absence of 
measuring format that can evaluate the level on innovation practice then provide the appropriate action to identify 
the reasons and start solving them. 
 
The aim of this research was to understand the current situation of innovation practices in Omani industries, 
identifying drivers and barriers in order to improve the economic situation to end with designing or improving an 
index of innovation practice in Oman.  
 
As we have noticed that innovation index has to contain the three pillars of innovation, which are product 
innovation, process innovation and service innovation. Due to these aspects, questionnaires SMEs and large 
industries will prepare, and relevant data must be collected from different selected industrial sectors in Oman (e.g. 
product design, manufacturing, sales and service).  
 
In future, the work will continue to identify the indicators which are drivers and barriers/bottleneck of innovation 
based on the result of the questionnaires. In addition, the collected data will be analyzed using descriptive statistic 
tools and to develop and construct the innovation index for Oman industries for measuring the level of innovation in 
both SMEs and large industries and compare the results. It is hoped that the future research outcomes will provide 
guidelines for conducting and reaching sustainable innovation.

Abstract 
Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) has increasingly been applied in diffusion of innovation 
research. The ABMS method is successfully implemented to different domains in business networks to 
study the diffusion of their innovation activities. This research therefore applies such ABMS method to a 
case company at Muscat, Oman with the objective to study the diffusion of its innovation activities to the 
public. The case company is a famous real-estate company in Oman, where it successfully diffused its 
innovative project to the public by using ABMS method. The results from the ABMS method were analyzed 
by using a common used platform like MATLAB - MathWorks software. This is an ongoing research and 
this paper presents the initial results from the model. Since the acquirement of data took too long for this 
specific project, the incorporation of real world data and validation and adaption of the model are tasks for 
further research.

1. Introduction
Diffusion of innovation is a critical activity that can be used to measure the likelihood that an innovation will be 
adopted by members of a given society or culture. It is considered as a theory that seeks to explain how, why and at 
what rate an innovation or new idea and technology spread. It examines how ideas are spread among group of people.  
Rogers (2003) proposes four main elements to spread innovation: the innovation itself, communication channels, time 
and a social system. An innovation activity is diffused in multi-step, where an opinion leader known an as adopter 
exerts a large influence on the behavior of individuals. 
The adoption of an innovation depends on the relative advantage, its compatibility with the pre-existing system, its 
complexity or difficulty to learn, testability, potential for reinvention and its observed effects (Greenhalgh et al., 2005). 
The adoption of an innovation also depends on the fuzziness of the boundary of the innovation. An individual known 
as agent encourages an opinion leader to adopt or reject an innovation (Infante, 1995). In general, an innovation or 
new idea is defused by human interaction through interpersonal networks. If an innovation adopter discusses it with 
two individuals of a given social system and these two individuals become adopters of the innovation it then diffuses 
in a binomial expansion (Rogers, 1971). 
The rate of innovation diffusion can be defined as the relative speed at which participants adopt an innovation. In case 
of diffusion process, some people are more apt to adopt innovation than others are. Several studies found that people 
who adopt an innovation at early stage have different characteristics that people who adopt a later stage (Valente and 
Davis, 1999; Wejnert, 2002; Rogers, 2003; Barker, 2004). It is therefore, important to understand the characteristics 
of target audience that will support or adopt of the innovation. The diffusion of an innovation is measured by the time 
necessary to adopt a specific percentage of the members of a social system (Choi et al., 2010). As some point in time, 
the innovation reaches a critical point or critical mass, when the number of adopters assure that the innovation is self-

5. Discussions  
 
A complex model including for the specific case important data was successfully implemented. The results are mainly 
as expected however; the graph indicates a few weaknesses of the model. Firstly, for a still relative small agent 
population of about 1000 agents and 100 time steps the execution time is over one hour. An increase of the population 
as planed to over a million agents is therefore not possible. Secondly, the rise until the saturation happens within only 
few time steps. This is however likely to be an effect of the for this consideration too small agent number. Additionally, 
the curve of visitors per time step shows an unsteady behavior which cannot be eliminated by simple parameter 
changes. This weakness in addition to the generally high number of parameters indicate how difficult it will be to 
adapt the model to the real application. 
 
The model is based on a huge number of parameters. Whereas, some parameters can be detained from statistical data 
most of them are not that easily identifiable. Especially, the parameters describing individual decision making and 
personal preferences are not objectively quantifiable. This could partly be counteracted by creating customer surveys. 
Even though this would include a high effort, it would be not only helpful for this model but for general strategic 
decisions concerning the case project. 
 
Therefore, a rather big part of the data has to be estimated, while at the same time the full model is very sensitive to a 
change of parameter values. The same is valid for the design of the networks structure. This is a big downside of the 
modelling process, which induces both an uncertainty of the validity of the model and a high specification on the 
current application. 
Finally, there are many other features which could be included depending on how detailed the model should be. For 
instance, the chance of visitor number during the seasons or more detailed personal characteristics of the agents such 
as income level. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
This paper describes a possible structure of an agent-based innovation diffusion model, where simulating a process of 
visitor development employing an agent-based approach. Interconnected small-world networks are used to describe 
the social structure. Furthermore, a complex decision making processes considering the static and dynamic 
characteristics of each agent is included. The results from estimated values is promising. However, due to time-related 
difficulties in data acquiring the model is not yet adapted to the real world values. This paper covers only the building-
up of an agent-based model for a development in the past. This model was not yet employed for forecasts or marketing 
mix analysis. These are possible topics for further research. Overall, despite some downsides the potential for future 
research is apparent.

Abstract 
Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is a systematic process used to ensure that any physical facility 
will be able to meet its designed functions continuously in its current operating context. RCM suggests 
the appropriate maintenance strategies for performing the maintenance actions at the right time for a 
particular system. One of the important factors in developing an RCM within an organization is the 
adoption of a suitable framework that provides the required flow of various stages for proper selection of 
a maintenance plan based on reliability analysis. Several authors have proposed different frameworks for 
RCM. A comparative study has revealed that most of the frameworks are unique and mainly focused on 
the suggestion of the maintenance strategy only. This paper develops a framework based on strength, 
weakness, opportunity, and threats (SWOT) analysis of the existing frameworks using ISM-MICMAC 
approach.   
 Keywords:  
Framework;  RCM; Reliability analysis; FMECA; ISM-MICMAC 
1. Introduction
RCM originated in the airline industry in the 1960s as a systematic process for development and 
optimization of the maintenance requirements of a physical resource in its operating context to realize its inherent 
reliability by logically incorporating the maintenance strategies like reactive, preventive, condition-based and 
proactive maintenance. Since RCM implementation is a strategic decision and assumes that managers tend to utilize 
a framework for implementation, they cannot afford to take a wrong step in the implementation process. In our 
previous work, 19 RCM frameworks collected from literature and categorized into four groups based on SWOT 
analysis Gupta and Mishra [1]. In addition, based on the SWOT analysis, it was found that most of the frameworks 
followed the qualitative analysis and few frameworks were followed quantitative analysis only. However, none of 
the framework available as comprehensive framework, which can implement based on qualitative and quantitative 
analysis together at a time. 
In this paper, we have identified 10 elements, which can represent comprehensiveness with respect to 
qualitative as well as quantitative analysis out of the 33 elements, based on the SWOT analysis of these frameworks. 
In addition, contextual relationships among the identified elements are established and a new framework for RCM 
proposed with the help of interpretive structural modeling (ISM). ISM is seen as a useful tool for those who wish to 
exercise careful, logical thinking in approaching complex issues, and then to communicate the results of that 
thinking to others [2]. This paper is organized into 5 sections. In Section 2 a brief literature review of RCM and ISM 
2383","5. Formation of ISM model and discussion  
 
Level partitioning of each factor will lead to the formation of ISM model. Initially, a digraph is portrayed 
with the help of final reachability matrix. Diagraph used to represent the elements and their interdependencies in 
terms of nodes and edges or it is the visual representation of the elements and their interdependence. The final ISM 
model for RCM framework determined by removing the transitivity links from digraph and shown in Fig.2.It has 
found from MIC-MAC analysis that none of the factors comes under autonomous factor category, which indicates 
all factors identified from the literature review are essential for RCM framework and organizations should pay 
attention to all of them. System selection and information collection have the highest driving power and least 
dependence play a pivotal role in RCM implementation. This data collection will make the foundation of system 
description and functional block diagram. This leads to a criticality analysis of the subsystems/components 
effectively, which is the basis of FMECA. The FMECA helps in determining the best possible maintenance strategy 
for any organization. This maintenance strategy further assists implementation and management review phase 
followed by the final recommendation of managerial judgment. Based upon recommendation, the final maintenance 
program can be prepared, followed by the continuous revaluation after implementation of this. All these elements 
are essential for the development of RCM in various organizations. The main objective of this methodology is to 
create a clear structural view of contextual relationships of different elements, which will help the organizations to 
implement RCM successfully.

6. Conclusion: 
 
The interpretive structural modelling (ISM) is used to determine the interrelationship of identified elements 
for RCM framework development. In addition, it is used to  prioritized and categorized these elements based on 
their importance, preference, and causality over and among each other. The multilevel hierarchy framework model 
has developed from which, management/ managers who want to implement RCM, can easily visualize step by step 
procedure of RCM and can identify elements which required the highest attention and will pay stress accordingly.

validated statistically. To validate it, Structural equation modeling (SEM) can be considered as a future work. The 
significance of this study is that, Proposed comprehensive framework for RCM process, can be implement including 
qualitative and quantitative analysis together at a time. However, in existing RCM procedure, the frameworks, 
which are available in literature, can implement either based on qualitative or quantitative analysis only.

Abstract 
In the Philippines, the population of autism is vastly growing; males are most likely to be diagnosed with 
autism compared to females. Special Education (SPED) teachers experience difficulties in teaching 
autism diagnosed students due to their uncontrollable physical behaviors which is a major challenge for 
SPED teachers nowadays. Further assessment shows that ninety-percent (90%) of Filipino autism 
diagnosed students are using gadgets mostly and behaves through it. With an aim to help SPED teachers, 
researchers identified the factors significant to enhance the current learning system. To measure the 
learnability, learning preference checklist was deployed. After a keen assessment, autism diagnosed 
students were most likely to learn through visuals and video models. Through normality testing, data 
gathered implies a normal distribution with a p-value of 0.190. With correlation, the positive strong side 
are Adaptability (0.638), Illumination (0.753) and Phonics (0.679). With the aid of structural equation 
modelling (SEM), it resulted in the following estimates of significant factors: Adaptability (0.28), Sounds 
(0.32) and Videos and Films (0.14) preference. Recommendation presented in this research is an 
ergonomic design system which has an intention to promote life skills among autism students by 
eliminating uncontrollable behaviors thus making communication and learning process easier.

1. Introduction
Children with autism spectrum disorder can be distinguished by social interaction difficulties, communication 
challenges, and repetitive behaviors. In connection, autism diagnosed-students experiences difficulties as interaction 
with people around them take part. Based on article “Person with disabilities in the Philippines”, ninety-seven 
percent (97%) are not reached by the public school system; therefore it is evident that there is a large percentage of 
autism which needs educational achievement. [1] The children with autism are considered out of sync in terms of 
their sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch which may seem ordinary for people but are painful for people with autism 
spectrum disorder due to their sensory differences. According to an interview with special education (SPED) 
teachers, SPED teachers experience difficulties in providing instructions to autism-diagnosed students due to 
individual differences. In addition, children with autism are literal thinkers when it comes to communication, as 
these students are nonverbal people and visually oriented in terms of the mode of instructions. Autism diagnosed-
students show signs (e.g tapping, pinching, and body language) to show or express what do children intend to tell 
and in terms of social capabilities, children experience difficulty in dealing with emotions and expressions. 
Based on National Health Society (NHS) report in the year 2012, sixty to seventy percent (60-70%) of people which 
are diagnosed with autism disorders also experience learning disabilities which yield to a higher chance of learning 
deficiencies [2] as teachers experience difficulties in teaching because of the uncontrollable physical behaviors (e.g. 
naughty, hyper, distracted, tantrums etc.) manifested inside the classroom. A study conducted in the year 2013 states

Abstract 
The internationalisation of banking operations has significantly contributed to making the supervision of 
cross-border banks much more complicated not only at a national level but at a regional level as well. 
The main purpose of this paper is to take a first step towards a characterization of cross-border banking 
supervisory systems to help design and manage them successfully following an integrated and holistic 
approach, including a description of processes covering the regulation, supervision and resolution of 
financial systems and the linkages between the key different processes. This paper constitutes a 
compilation of literature’s review on cross border banking supervision. 
The results collected through a general review of the available literature and the case study of the 
Moroccan banking supervision framework attempt to outline the possibility of proposing a supervisory 
system organized around key macro-processes.  
The first part of the paper presents an overview of cross-border banking.  The second part describes the 
supervisory system adopted in Morocco as an emerging country and highlights the processes set up within 
the different agencies constituting a whole system to be monitored in an integrated way to ensure the 
same shared objective which is none other than the financial stability. 
Keywords  
Cross-border banking, Regulation and supervision, Moroccan banking supervision, Micro and Macro 
prudential policies, resolution and safety nets. 
Introduction 
The banking system has expanded widely with the internationalisation of banking activities and the integration of 
new services and diversified products world widely. It has become more complex to manage by bankers thus so 
complex to regulate and supervise by banking authorities. 
Cross-border banking activities bring many opportunities and benefits for banks, host countries and supervisors but 
also challenges and costs for all of them. 
Generally, there is a relationship between the regulatory and supervisory activities and banking development, 
efficiency, and soundness (Barth, Caprio and Levine, 2002) particularly in a cross border context. 
In this respect, it is highlighted that cross-border banks have contributed actively and have had a key role in the 
dynamics of the last global crisis of 2007-2009 (Allen, Beck, Carletti, Lane, Schoenmaker and Wagner, 2011).

The “national council of credit and savings” deliberates on any question concerning the development of savings as 
well as the evolution of credit institutions. 
An Africa Committee, composed of the Central Bank and the three cross-border banking groups, was set up to 
ensure compliance with the provisions of a code of good conduct and cooperation adopted with banking groups.  
This Committee is organized on annual basis and provides an opportunity to cover many key issues at a high level 
including an update on Moroccan banks presence and activities in Africa, the evolution of the macroeconomic and 
macro-financial conditions of the countries of presence, examination of each entity implemented abroad and the 
development of its activity and the risks highlighted and the measures to be taken to mitigate them.  
If the warning issued to the bank remains ineffective, the Central Bank asks for an opinion from a dedicated 
committee in charge of banks disciplinary as a legal body comprised of representatives from the Central Bank, two 
representatives of the Ministry of Finance and two magistrates. This committee helps the governor of the Central 
Bank to choose the appropriate option among the possibility to suspend one or more managers, to prohibit or restrict 
the exercise of some banking operation, to appoint an interim administrator or to withdraw the bank license. 
3.7 Qualitative analysis: Some key elements 
The IMF reported that since the FSAP mission achieved in 2007, the Moroccan banking landscape has deeply 
changed with a significant development of the foreign branches and subsidiaries of the three banking groups. Some 
of these subsidiaries have become systemically important banks in the host countries. This international expansion 
strategy has a direct impact on the implementation of effective banking supervision as cross-border activities require 
strengthening the consolidated supervision, monitoring of the key local entities of the banking groups and 
reinforcing cooperation with the regulators of the host countries. The supervision scope of Bank Al-Maghrib also 
extends to the implementation of the regulatory framework of Islamic finance, new services, new products and risks 
associated (FSAP, 2016). The IMF reported also in 2016, based on a stress testing performed on the Moroccan 
financial system, that Moroccan banks showed good resilience to the global financial and economic crisis and that 
cross border shocks has a very low impact. It is indicated that Morocco’s insurance sector has expanded strongly in 
recent years, with close links with the banking sector. The insurance sector would be able to withstand a 100 basis 
point increase in interest rates 
Conclusion and future work 
Following what have been described above, it appears that to ensure the financial stability while maintaining 
adequate balance with the other policies, the supervision at micro and macro levels of banking activities, insurances 
and securities must be conducted in an integrated way, as part of an interrelated system, which still remains a very 
critical mandate, complicated and challenging especially with the cross border side of the regional and international 
banks operating abroad.  
The future work, aiming to enrich the expanding literature and dealing with a not yet exhausted theme, should focus 
on the characterization of a whole supervisory system based on a risk approach, the breakdown of this system into 
components interconnected in a complementary way, the description of the underlying processes and the definition 
of key performance indicators at both operational and strategic levels to set up an effective and global monitoring 
system.

Abstract 
Learning Management System (LMS) is an accommodating technology to instructors wherein lessons, 
quizzes, and other usable features in teaching can be conducted online. There is an LMS used in an 
engineering institution which won many awards for continuous improvement for the past few years. Yet, 
students are having difficulties in using the system which can affect their academic performances. In order 
to certify that there is a problem regarding the usability of the system, an initial data gathering of SUS 
Questionnaire was conducted to the 100 participating students. The said LMS requires improvement based 
on the SUS score of 51.75 which is below the marginal average scale of 68. On the other hand, the data of 
SUS Questionnaire, QUIS, checklist of tasks, and SEQ gathered from 425 students were used for Structural 
Equation Modelling (SEM) – path analysis to determine the factors affecting the usability of the LMS. The 
results are the following: (1) effectiveness – usability, (2) screen – usability, (3) task level – usability, (4) 
terminology – usability, (5) learning – usability, (6) system capabilities – usability, and (7) efficiency – 
effectiveness. Hence, this research modifies the user interface to increase the usability, and user satisfaction 
of the said LMS.

1. Introduction
Usability refers to users who can effectively utilize a tool or system to accomplish a particular assignment with 
fulfillment and simplicity (International Organization for Standardization, 1998). On the other hand, learning 
management system (LMS) is one of the expanding trends nowadays which involve the utilization of technology in 
teaching providing a platform of learning environment by facilitating activities, sharing of educational resources, and 
recording of learning assessments using web or servers. The ease of use and greater satisfaction of the users with the 
tools and features included in the LMS delivers better human computer collaboration (Thuseethan, Achchuthan, & 
Kuhanesan, 2014). Usability can enhance the learning background for students (Tselios, Avouris, & Komis, 2008) 
and as well as in improving one’s academic performance. An LMS secures the learning experience more firms for 
students to increase the participation of students and facilitates educators a personalized learning system. 
The center of this study is a usability evaluation of an LMS used in an engineering institution in the Philippines. Based 
on the computed mean of System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire of the 100 participating students result to 51.75 
which is below the 68 marginal average scale, thus requires improvement. The main cause of the low SUS score 
observed by the researchers are (1) difficulties in remembering names and use of commands, (2) unclear help messages 
on screen, (3) not designed for all level of users, and (4) difficult to learn to operate the system. Moreover, this research 
paper aims to improve the usability and user satisfaction of a learning management system through modifying the user 
interface from the gathered information of concepts and works of ergonomics.

Abstract 
Wood-based furniture is a well-known leisure item in a household for it can be utilized or can be further 
improved to meet customer standards with wood as the main material. Value Analysis and Value 
Engineering is used to improve the process and lower the cost of the product but maintain its quality. The 
process VA/VE and Design of Facility is used to optimize the existing processes of a wood 
manufacturing company in the current application of the woodworking processes in the existing facility 
layout. This paper demonstrates the application of ProModel Simulation, process VA/VE and Design 
Layout in the existing processes of the woodworking company in the current application of the 
woodworking processes in the existing facility layout. In order to analyze the two designs of the 
recommended design of facility the researchers applied ProModel simulation. The results aim to satisfy 
the proposed VA/VE approach. Overall the existing layout was able to generate an increase of 80% in 
production.

1. Introduction
Wood is being used by the humankind as the oldest renewable natural resources and the most environmentally-
friendly ecological material. It is the most well-known natural material that exists and has one of the most important 
roles in developing the human society due to the influential promotion of environmental protection in the current 
society. It is primarily used in making furniture because of its relatively easy to gather materials and easy to work 
with. In current generation, wood in modern design houses helps make the indoor design more environmental, 
resource saving, sustainable development and pollution reduction. [1] Furthermore, it is published that one of the 
biggest business between the years 1995 to 2000 the furniture business for it grew faster than world merchandise 
trade. The furniture contains local curved-based businesses and it has conventionally been a supply and intensive 
labor in the industry. [2] In addition, woodworks furniture constructors preserved their principal role in the 
marketplace which is mostly for expensive, high-end and project products. These produced products manage to 
acquire the local industry while mass producing the large volume of products that are sold for export and locally.  
In the Philippines, 95% of furniture companies in the country are considered as small and medium enterprises. But, 
it still ranked as fourth from the top five most exported products in terms of wood furniture industry, with recorded 
$3.334 million of export as of years 2014 to 2015 but instantly dropped to $3.128 million resulting to 6.2% potential 
profit loss. [3] Wood furniture industry is considered to be one of the four key contributors to the Philippine export 
with a 5.6% of percent share to the total receipt of, yet recent data shows that export sales reversed a downward 
trend. To be able to solve the problem this paper considered the mentioned industry to help small and medium scale 
enterprises using a VA/VE approach that can eventually help the society at large. [4] Furthermore, it is used in 
different kinds of application for the company where it will further help the workers to be more creative. Value

Defect Control via Forecasting of Processes' Deviation as JIDOKA Methodology 
Dr: Ahmed M. Abed (1)and Dr: Adel Abd Elmo'z Ibrahim 
Department of Industrial Engineering, Zagazig University, Egypt 
 
Abstract 
 
This paper aims to provide an approach to JIDOKA (machine's autonomation) implementation via compute the 
proficiency value that based on processes' deviation monitoring to besiege any defects chance weaken 
competitiveness. The product produced after operating multi-surface spaces (OSS), which prone to deviation 
during its processes and may lead to defect. The proposed methodology interested in controlling processes' 
deviation via improving the spatiotemporal model with SARIMA via using 72 observations to study and predict the 
deviation's behavior to stop machine before defect appears (i.e., JIDOKA methodology). A case study of the 
manufacture of a lawn mower (carburetor's valve) is presented to explain the JIDOKA methodology results that 
demonstrate it accurately and effectively, whether in forecasting or defect suppression to face the evaporative 
emissions. The approach is guided by a six-sigma methodology to obtain improved proficiency. The model’s fitting 
and forecasting results are compared with the SES to prove the ability of applying JIDOKA. The proposed 
methodology implemented in one of the lawn mower Co. Egypt, which gain defect reduction by 0.7 % or rescue 
7000 product every one million via SARIMA(1,1,1)x(0,1,1)6 to improve the spatiotemporal methodology. 
 
Key words: JIDOKA, Machine controlling, ARIMA model, deviation forecasting 
 
1. Introduction 
Egypt participated in the climate conference with the aim of providing industrial solutions to 
reduce the problem of global warming. The political will decided that the beginning was to 
control the quality of products that might cause the problem via its evaporative emissions to 
reduce the pollutants. This agreed by the industrial engineering goal in proposing means of 
quality control to achieve this goal. The evaporative emissions of a volatile fuel reduced via 
controlling in carburetor's valve actuation device, which prohibited the fuel flow in its paths, 
prelude to drained during engine shutdown [8, 18]. Therein lays the importance of manufacturing 
this valve with minimum deviation or errors. Since the end of the 19th century, the evaporative 
emissions is in top of manufacturing agenda to reduce the global warming phenomena, which 
caused via manufacturing a bad carburetor valves in its compressor [24]. Therefore, the design of 
these valves have subordinated to continuous improvement methodology [22] to emissions 
suppression to become no-contaminant. The higher proficiency is related with designs that have 
minimum deviations, which calls for develop and accurate prediction methodologies.  The 
evaporative emissions influenced by valve's unit  of compressor shown in Figure-1, which may be divided to three units, the motor, 
piston/cylinder unit and valve unit, which concerned for verifying the proposed prediction manufacturing methodology. It is 
extremely difficult to develop a zero defect in manufacturing process in a high-volume environment, which has many 
manufacturing processes for each part. The continuous monitoring is a viable option via ability to predict how a part manufactured 
[3]. The spatiotemporal monitoring procedures [2] aided with ARIMA will improve the production planning [20], fault finding and 
improve proficiency. The processes' capability index is a common standard parameter illustrates the quality level, but it's not 
sufficient in human intervenes [1]. Therefore, the proficiency index is suggested to measure the efficiency plus effectiveness of the 
machines and laborers together. The deviation measurement is done after finish every step in the studied process's and hope for do 
that during process progresses in the future without stopping. 
The lawn mower compressor as illustrated in Figure-1 consist of a piston moving back and forth in a cylinder, with suction 
and discharge valves and cause evaporative emissions in failure function [18] due to a bad manufacturing especially in holes radius 
or thickness dimensions. The suction and discharge valves open and close due to pressure differences between the cylinder and inlet 
or outlet manifolds respectively. Proficiency is important issue in top agenda of manufacturing process for quality improvement. 
Because it concerned with main objective, which is producing good product from first time and every time that may be difficult and 
costly without machine's autonomation approach. While jerky demands (i.e., small different orders) become marketing features 
[10]. Every stage of products' operation is confronted with numerous errors happening every time [11] and this has brought a big 
trouble for defect suppression. Many new types of defects striving appear in Egyptian corporates via deviation control. So in this 
way, accurate deviation forecasting is desired. Any product consists of many operating surface spaces (OSS) that based on many 
sequential processes, (i.e.,         ∑
      
 
   
. each of them     ∑

Figure-26 motivate to reduce the number of operating surfaces to 5 or 
less if the operating surface span fitted between 10 mm and 13 mm, or 
between 20 mm and 24 mm. The optimal output obtained when the operating 
surface span set at 12 mm and the number of operating surfaces at 9, in this 
case the deviation will be less than 0.1 and the evaporative emissions will 
suppression. Therefore, re-run the proposed STAM code, and set the number 
of operating surface between 3, 5 and 9 and activate the ARIMA to predict 
with the deviation in time to stopping the machine and rescue the product. 
4.   Conclusion 
 
In this paper, time series model of SARIMA is used to make short-term 
forecasting of deviation behavior aided for spatiotemporal for selected part 
in specific product share in global warming phenomena in Egypt. The fitting 
and forecasting results are compared with the other forecasting tool (SES) as 
illustrated in Figure-24. The result shows that STAM fits the data well and 
makes higher accurate forecasting than the other model.  This  work  is  proved  to  be  very  helpful  to  the quality department in 
improving  the  efficiency  of  decision-making  and emergency management. This paper presented a general framework for the 
statistical modeling of spatiotemporal count data. There is nothing special about deviation events, and early experiments using our 
methods to forecast 311 (calls for non-emergency services like potholes) have been promising. In the application of this framework, 
a series of modeling decisions which would be worth exploring in more detail in future work was made. The use of spatiotemporal 
leading indicators—other deviation (errors) types, weather patterns, other events measured online or offline—might provide 
measurable improvements in our forecasts.  
Table-3 illustrates the comparison between proposed methodology and recent reported results using SES statistical models [1, 
12, and 14] is also needed.

The proposed framework does incur computational burden done via Matlab r2009a. There is much field for the further 
development of approximation techniques and new formulations of methodologies for ﬁtting spatiotemporal data online. The 
proposed framework based entirely on measurements data that collected to compensate for modified Matlab code, should 
considered in the future as a baseline for comparison.

Abstract 
Rice is the staple food in Sri Lanka. The impact of the rice mills to the environment is considerable issue 
currently. The rice production process consumes energy, water, bio mass and other environmental resources 
and adds air and solid emissions, effluent and wastages back to environment which cause environmental 
impacts. It is very clear to understand that the large amount of energy consumption, waste water and solid 
waste to the environment and the very large capacity machines and engines used by the mills are the causes 
behind the issue. Therefore, the total environmental effect of each and every step in the life cycle of the 
production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly rice 
production method. Mainly the parboiling and polishing processes are associated with harmful environment 
discharge such as emission to air, fossil fuel and affect the natural resources. Therefore, proper 
environmental management practices need to be sustained in the rice production industry. The objective of 
the research is to evaluate the environmental impact through the life cycle of rice production in Sri Lanka. 
Based on LCA approach (ISO 14040 series), the environmental impacts by the rice industry was analyzed. 
The impacts on environment was assessed through “SimaPro” software. The results interpreted that the 
most harmful processes among the rice production are the parboiling and polishing process.

1. Introduction
Rice has a long history in Sri Lanka and south east Asia. Its importance goes far beyond its status as a primary food 
source in this island nation. Synonymously, rice plays an important role in the country's cultural identity, tradition, 
and politics. The estimated paddy production for 2015/2016 Maha season was 2,902,693 MT. The highest production 
was reported from Anuradhapura District about 13% of the country. The contribution to the national paddy production 
from Ampara, Kurunegala and Polonnaruwa Districts were recorded as 12%, 11% and 10% respectively ( Paddy 
statistics 2015/2016 Maha season). For 2015 Yala season was 1942408MT. The highest production was reported from 
Ampara District about 16%. The contribution to the national paddy production from Pollonnaruwa, Kurunegala and 
Anuradhapura districts were recorded as 14%, 11% and 10% respectively (Paddy statistics 2015 Yala Season). 
There are two major types of rice: raw and parboiled. Approximately 70% of produced rice is going through the 
parboiling process in Sri Lanka (Ariyarathna et al., 2016). Parboiled rice has been soaked, steamed, and dried before 
the milling process. Parboiled rice does not take as long as raw rice cooking-wise, because it has been partially pre-
cooked already. The parboiled rice may cook in one-third the time needed to cook raw rice (Goyal et al., 2012). The 
rice production process consumes energy, water, bio mass and other environmental resources and adds air and solid 
emissions, effluent and wastages back to environment which causes heavy environmental impacts (Nadeeshani, 2015). 
The environmental impact of each paddy varies depending on water management, usage of pesticide, and intensity of 
production. Paddy cultivation has atmospheric impacts. Paddy fields produce methane that is a powerful greenhouse 
gas (Gathorne-Hardy et al., 2013). Regarding atmospheric emissions, the environmental impact was lower for raw 
3417","4. Conclusions
The efficient utilization of energy is a great challenging task to the researchers. The rice industry is one of the most 
energy consuming industries. Saving of husk could also lead to co-generation of thermal energy in furnaces for boilers 
and dryers in the rice industry. Thus, energy conservation in the rice industry would lead to reduction in the use of 
electricity for parboiling process. According IPCC 2007 GWP method, the parboiling process plays a significant role 
in rice industry. While comparing both rice mills results, RAYIN rice mill generates more global warming potential 
due to the electricity usage. Electricity generation has become a major impact in generation process. ECO indicator 
99 implies that the impact from parboiling and polishing processes, in which the first is deemed to be the major 
contributor with significant impact, highly affect the environment. Among the impact categories, the Human health 
and Eco system are which is mostly affected by parboiling process and the Resource category is mostly affected by 
Polishing Process. Specifically, the parboiling process leads the impacts to environment. In total, parboiling and 
polishing are the most influencing processes towards the environment respectively. Corrective action needs to be taken 
to minimize the CO2 eq emissions to convert the products towards being carbon neutral.

Abstract 
Qatar University is the largest public educational institution in the State of Qatar. The university 
community has diverse committed faculty who not only teaching but also conducting research studies 
contributing actively to the needs of the society. Qatar University aims to improve the transportation 
network inside the campus and reduce the traffic congestions. This work aims to provide the 
transportation department at Qatar University with a unique network design integrating the rail terminal 
with the in-campus shuttle system. The new design mainly aims to facilitate the transition of students, 
faculty members, staffs, and visitors between Qatar University Campus’s buildings and Qatar Rail 
terminal leading to encourage customers to use the Qatar rail service. Consequently, shuttle stations 
locations are optimized, routes are designed, and sufficient number of buses is specified for each route 
based on the density in each building inside the campus. The performance of the new network design is 
evaluated using ProModel® software.

4.2 Future Work 
 
To improve quality service, a mobile-based application can be designed that will let customers know where is 
the nearest station and at what time the shuttle will arrive at any station. Further, this mobile-based 
application will help the shuttle service’s customers in 1) real-time tracking of the shuttle movement, 2) 
identify the nearest shuttle station, and 3) providing the shortest route for customers to arrive a certain station.  
 
The implementation of the proposed design could be improved by designing stations with solar panels to 
ensure sustainability of these stations that could work for longer time, reduce the billing cost by reducing the 
amount of electricity used, and using clean electricity that is eco-friendly rather than the electricity coming 
from the fossil fuel.  
 
For further environmental benefits, the implementation of the designed solution could have electrical buses 
rather than the regular ones that use fuel. This will save the atmosphere by reducing the emission of the 
hazardous gases coming from the fuel in the regular buses.

Abstract 
Digital collaboration which involves the interaction between the construction world and the digital world 
in recent times, has gained increasing interest within the South African Architecture, Engineering, and 
Construction industry. This is because the construction business is at the edge of a digital revolution and 
countless technologies are promising inventive answers to age-old issues of conveying project on-time, 
within budget, and to customers’ determinations. Despite these enticing benefits of digitalization, the 
problem of full implementation is still evident within the industry. This study reports the challenges of 
digital collaboration and the possible strategies for enhancing the use of digital tools in the country. The 
study adopted a survey design and data were gathered through the use of questionnaire administered on 
construction professionals in Gauteng province. Data gathered were analyzed using appropriate 
descriptive statistics. Result reveals that the major challenges of digital collaboration are lack of training, 
expensiveness of digital technologies, poor adoptability of standards, and challenge of interoperability. To 
remedy these problems, there is need for; the creation of avenues for proper education and training on 
digital collaboration, management encouraging digital collaboration usage in workplaces, and ensuring 
easy access to loans from financial institutions for companies to implement digital collaboration.

Introduction
All around the world, new technologies are being developed and this is transforming and revolutionizing all, from 
the basic to the intricate functions of life, and the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is no 
exception. According to Halim (2010) there is no profession that can effectively succeed in solving its 21st century 
development challenges unless the professional visions, aspiration, mission and strategies are fundamentally 
anchored in the realm of knowledge creation and strategically driven by technology. Using the guide of digital and 
collaboration technology the construction businesses around the world has turned out to be less intricate, projects 
being done on time, profitability expanding, better nature of work and more customers’ satisfaction is being attained 
(Van Leeuwen, 2003).  
Digital technology which helps in the generation, stockpiling, data treatment, encouragement of distinctive types of 
correspondence amongst people and automatic frameworks, and also between electronic frameworks, is today a 
popular concept among construction professionals around the world (Ibem and Laryea, 2014). This popularity can 
be attributed to the recent attention given to the concept of building information modelling (BIM). BIM utilizes

Abstract 
The Nigerian Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry suffers from poor performance 
especially in the aspect of sustainable construction. Using diverse construction practices available to 
achieve successful construction- without posing any danger to the environment, society and the economy 
- is necessary to rectify this menace. One of such practices is Value Management (VM), which has been
adopted by some developed and developing countries around the world and has proven to be highly
beneficial. This study therefore assessed the adoption of VM and its benefits in the delivery of sustainable
construction within the built environment in the country. The study adopted a survey approach in which
construction professionals within the six geo-political zones of the country were sampled. Data were
collected through the use of questionnaire, while percentage, mean and one-samples t-test were used to
analyse the data gathered. Findings revealed that construction professionals have a considerable amount
of knowledge as regards VM practice, however, the level of usage of the practice is still on the average.
Some of the benefits of the adoption of VM are; ability to identify possible problems early, eliminating
unnecessary designs, reduce waste, and ensuring that the project is delivered in the most cost-effective
way.

Introduction
The Nigerian Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry faces problem of delivering sustainable 
construction projects; one that serves not only the present but also future generations (Alabi, 2012; Aje, 2016). This 
situation is contrary to the recent movement of most countries towards sustainable development through the delivery 
of sustainable construction. If this is to be adequately addressed, a radical change to the approach of delivering 
construction projects is needed, while the adoption of diverse tools that will help manage projects and deliver them 
sustainably is necessary. One of such tools that is gaining popularity among most developed and developing 
countries in recent time is Value Management (VM).  
VM is a structured approach to establish what value means to a client while trying to meet a perceived need, through 
clearly defining and agreeing on the project objectives and establishing how they can best be achieved (Construction 
Industry Board, 1997). Mariathasan (2002) viewed the discipline as a process which allows all stakeholders in a 
proposed construction project to be involved in the decision-making process. The process constitutes a scrutiny of 
all relevant options for the design and construction of the project, leading to an improvement of the design brief and 
identification of any budget constraints. Abidin and Pasquire (2005) further observed that in VM, although clients 
tend to put pressure on cost reduction, their vision would still be the same i.e. value for money, better quality, 
profitability and positive business image. 
Past researches have placed separate focus on VM and Sustainability. However, in the late 90’s, researches relating 
to the importance of sustainability in improving value and the potential of VM to deliver sustainability in

Abstract 
This paper presents the level of accomplishment and consideration of green supply chain management 
(GSCM) and demonstrate the economical and environmental influences of green supply chain 
management on the outcomes of a food-manufacturing factory in Malaysia. Questionnaires consist of 40 
questions have been developed from previous studies and literatures. The questionnaires were sent to 
different departments of a company. Normality, reliability, t-test, correlation, and regression were used to 
analyze the data. The results represent that the company’s current consideration and implementation of 
GSCM is in moderate level, and it is also found that despite the fact that applying green supply chain 
management requires additional costs, it provides benefits and advantages for the company, and the value 
of the benefits is known to be higher than costs of implementing GSCM. The highest effect of GSCM is 
on brand image of the company, and the return on investments, meaning that it not only makes good 
business sense, but also creates opportunity to stay competitive in the market.

1. Introduction
Since the early 1990’s, manufacturers were under pressure to consider Environmental Management (EM) in all 
supply chains [1]. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) has emerged to cover environmental issues of supply 
chain and is generally defined as implementing environmental management throughout the entire supply chain [2]. 
Green Supply Chain is then the attempt to measure, analyze and improve performance among various members to 
ensure that companies are operating in environmental friendly manner [3]. All food products move through a “food

c. GSCM outcomes 
 
This section evaluates affects of implementing green supply chain management on the four dimensions: 
i. 
costs and expenses, 
ii. economical and financial benefit 
iii. company’s brand image 
iv. affects of green supply chain implementation on pollutions and waste caused by the company. 
 
Table 2 shows the mean value for dimensions of GSCM outcomes. It shows costs, benefits, and brand image 
dimensions are above the mean of scale, which means that they are above the moderate level, and in this section of 
survey, the average value of scale has the meaning of “no effect”. So in the respondents’ point of view, by 
implementing green supply chain management, the outcomes would be increase in cost, increase in benefits, and 
increase in brand image of the company. It is witnessed from Table 2 that benefits are more likely to increase, 
compared with costs, as the mean value of this dimension is higher than other two dimensions. The same result is 
acceptable for brand image. But for pollution, the mean value is lower than the average level, and according to 
previous analysis, it should be considered as the previous scale, which is “slight decrease”. So it is concluded that in 
respondents’ point of view, by implementing green supply chain management the pollution caused by the company 
will decrease.

5. Conclusion 
 
The conclusions from this study are: 
 
1. The company has an average level of green supply chain management consideration and implementation. The 
results of assessment of green supply chain management in the company shows that within the activities related 
to GSCM, the consideration of environmental standards such as ISO14000 and total quality environmental 
management practices are in a better situation compared with commitment of managers and executives to 
GSCM, green purchasing practices and eco design consideration. 
2. Although the implementation of green supply chain management will increase costs, such as manufacturing 
cost, raw material purchasing cost, inventory cost, training cost, and costs occurred by increasing 
manufacturing lead-time and maintaining the on-time delivery, it also will increase the benefits of the

company, such as profit and return on investment and total sales, and it was seen in the figure of mean values 
of dimensions that after implementing green supply chain management, the changes in benefits is more than 
the changes in costs. 
3.
By comparing the mean value of the effects of implementing green supply chain management in different
dimensions, it was observed that the brand image has the highest mean value, meaning that implementing
GSCM practices in the company strongly improves the brand image of the company.

Abstract 
Qatar is one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of per capita food waste; which ranges from 584 
to 657 kilograms per year. The combination of high food consumption rate and very low food waste 
recycle rate, results in mountains of food dumped into landfills where they get burned and therefore 
produce harmful gases. In this paper, we are introducing a practical solution for every household to 
recycle the food waste instead of sending it to the landfill. The solution is to design an eco-friendly 
machine that converts food waste to fertilizer. The use of recycled food waste as compost improves the 
soil health and structure, increases drought resistance and reduces the need for supplemental water, 
fertilizers and pesticides. The composting process is fully automated, it consists of several steps under 
controlled environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity) to fasten the process. A mechanism is 
designed to reduce food waste volume by over two-thirds. Also, experiments were conducted to figure out 
the best conditions of temperature, moisture content and the bulking agent that would result in a high-
quality homemade fertilizer within hours. The aesthetics aspect was considered by designing an elegant 
and socially accepted machine with a suitable size to be placed in any kitchen.

1. Introduction
Food waste is becoming a critical global problem due to the continuous increase in the world population. 
Figure 1, shows that If food wastage were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country in the world 
(WRI’S Climate Data Explorer). It is stated that one-third of the food produced in the world for human 
consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tons — gets lost or wasted (UN reports). While in Qatar, 
around 3,002 tons of domestic waste is generated on a daily basis (ministry of development planning and 
statistics reports, in 2015). Aside from the social, economic, and moral implications of that waste—in a 
world where an estimated 805 million people go to bed hungry each night—the environmental implications 
of food waste to climate change is catastrophic. Thus, there is an urgent need to take appropriate actions to 
reduce food waste burden by adopting new combating practices. The benefits for the environment and 
agriculture are represented in protecting the quality of groundwater and reinstating the structure of soil after the 
natural soil. In addition, disposing food waste into the landfill can cause the organic matter to react with other 
materials and create toxic mixtures (Risse and faucette, 2006). Thus, recycling food waste to compost is 
preferred more. Moreover, composting food waste will reduce the volume of the disposed waste and the 
disposal cost (A Guide to Composting Yard & Food Waste, 2013). In addition, it has a big environmental 
benefit, which is the absence of synthetic chemical fertilizers in compost. Thus, with all the benefits that the 
compost we get when recycling food waste holds makes it healthier for human usage than the man-made 
compost sold in the market.

1. Visibility: Good visibility indicates that it should obvious for the user what the control is used for. The 
controls on the touch screen allows the user to turn on, turn off or stop the machine to add more food waste. 
the function of each control is written on their touch buttons as shown in figure16. 
 
2. Affordance: It means that it should be obvious how to operate a control. The user should know how to use a 
control just by looking at it. To design the touch screen with high affordance the touch buttons looks like real 
buttons with 3D design.  
    
3. Feedback: Indicated that once the user has used a control, the system should clearly communicate what has 
just been accomplished. The feedback on the touch screen consists of four parts. First, when starting the 
machine, it shows on the screen that the machine started processing the food waste. Second, if the user 
pressed the pause button after 15 minutes of starting the machine it will be shown on the screen that the 
machine cannot be opened until it finishes the composting process. Third, when turning off button is pressed a 
conformance message will appear on the screen to ask the user if he is sure want to turn off the machine, if the 
user confirms turning off a feedback message will appear on the screen to inform the user that the he will not 
be able to open the machine until it cools down. Lastly, when the machine finish composting the food waste a 
message appear on the screen along with a peeping sound to notify the user that he can pull out the compost 
container. The temperature degree inside the machine will be always shown on the screen.  
 
For children protection, turning the machine on and off or pause it, requires the user to enter a small four 
numbers password.

5. Conclusion  
All in all, this paper aim is to show the importance of recycling food waste and helping the environment by 
building a machine that converts food waste into compost. The machine is completely manufactured in Qatar. This 
food waste recycler machine is to be built and used at home safely. The design methodology and the engineering 
solutions that will be used in this project were explained in the engineering design process. Followed by the 
identifying the customers, knowing their needs and taking their feedbacks, which are considered important since our 
purpose is to satisfy the customer’s needs. Furthermore, a quality function deployment was used to translate 
customer needs into design specifications. In addition, the external and internal constraints and the design standards 
were identified. Moreover, the conceptual design for the machine, the design alternatives, alternatives evaluation, 
and the machine’s final design all were discussed briefly and shown in detail in this paper. Since the world is 
seeking sustainability, our machine aims to lessen the food waste that is thrown into the landfills, which pollute the 
environment by recycling the food waste and turning it, in less than 24 hours, to compost that can be used in 
fertilizing the soil to plant healthy and organic food, and contributing in creating a safe and sustainable world.

Abstract 
Forecasting is a method used to determine the path of future trends.  Historical data is significant 
for any forecasting technique.  Organizations utilize forecasting to determine how to allocate 
their resources or plan for projected payments for an upcoming period of time. This is normally 
based on the projected demand for the goods and services they offer. This paper will used 
forecasting technique by integrating genetic algorithm for lambda assessment.  This paper 
resulted that the GA lambda assessment approach will give better predictability.

Abstract 
Medical Emergency Service (MES) or commonly known as ambulance plays a very important 
role in the possibility of mortality of a patient. MES has become an important issue in the world 
of health because of the possibility to survive a person. MES itself is preserved as an event 
occurrence ranging from for patient pick-up in a medical emergency to transfer of patient to 
hospital, but the main role of ambulance is to provide quick access to those in need or known as 
response time. This paper will conduct a literature review of the types of approaches that 
previous researchers have done to address MES-related issues. In the end can determine the 
direction of further research on MES. 
Keywords: Ambulance, Hospital Management, Medical Emergency Service (MES), Pre-hospital, Response 
Time. 
1. Introduction
Medical Emergency Service (MES) or commonly known as ambulance plays a very important role in the possibility 
of survival of a patient. Singer & Donoso (2008), Aboueljinane et al. (2013), Knyazkov et al. (2015), Su et al. 
(2015), Aringhieri et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2016) agrees with the statement where MES has become an 
important issue in the world of health because it involves the possibility of survival. Sarier et al. (2016), states that 
almost all developed and developing countries have MES, which consists of pre-hospital handling and transfer to 
hospital facilities. MES itself is defined as a sequence of events ranging from notices to patient pickups in a medical 
emergency to transfer of patients to the hospital, but the main role of ambulance is to provide quick access to those 
in need. 
The adage ""time is money"" feels right on the Medical Emergency Service, where each person is willing to pay any 
amount to increase the probability of mortality in an emergency. Jaldell et al. (2014) reveals that the time factor is 
one of the most decisive factors that a person will be able to survive, so there is a certain amount of cost or cost that 
would be willing to bear someone when in an emergency. According to Su et al. (2015) and Aringhieri et al. (2016) 
one second also has a tremendous influence in the probability of survival in an emergency case.

Abstract 
Activities in the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) relate to the repeated delivery of a product from one 
facility to multiple destination sources. Logistics of bulk oil product shipments are part of the IRP. The 
transport process in the logistics of bulk oil products through the sea lane is very complex because it must 
consider the inventory level of destination ports. The optimization process is carried out to avoid stock-
outs at the destination port while keeping track of the smallest freight and waiting times of the vessel. 
Problems in IRP include NP-Hard. The exact method used to solve it is by the meta-heuristic method. The 
Partial Comparison Optimization (PCO) algorithm is a new method developed to solve bulk oil logistics 
optimization problems. This algorithm is effective enough to get optimum bulk oil product logistic in 
IRP. 
Keywords  
IRP, Optimization, Meta-heuristic 
1. Introduction
The logistics activities in the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) will create high costs that will reduce the level
of corporate competition. Therefore the selection of models in logistics must be optimized. While often the 
processes in IRP logistics are only done through the intuition of the user. Experienced users and have a high flying 
hours in managing the process in the inventory routing system are quite capable of delivering good assignment 
results. But it is still not enough, especially if the user does not have a high level of experiences. It is still necessary 
to process calculations through good methods to solve the optimization problem. 
The decision in the optimization process within the IRP will be able to benefit some sides (Santos, Ochi, 
Simonetti, & González, 2016). In addition to minimizing costs both in warehouses and travel, the optimization 
process can improve the quality of service (Santos et al., 2016). The selection of the path to which the vessel will go 
and what products will be taken will determine the shortest route of the vessel while avoiding the stock-out 
warehouse. 
IRP as one of the variants of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is included in the NP-Hard (Kumar & 
Panneerselvam, 2012). To address the problem, this problem must be solved by a heuristic or meta-heuristic 
algorithm (Etebari & Dabiri, 2016). Several studies have used heuristic and meta-heuristic methods to solve 
problems in the IRP. Siswanto, Essam, & Sarker (2011) combine mixed integer linear programming and one-step 
greedy heuristic to complete a ship inventory routing and scheduling problem with undedicated compartments 
(sIRPSP-UC). Santos et al. (2016) offer an iterated local search (ILS) method with neighborhood descent variable 
with random neighborhood ordering (RVND) to complete the multifariate inventory routing problem (MIRP). Peres, 
Repolho, Martinelli, & Monteiro (2017) use the Randomized Variable Neighborhood Descent (RVND) hybrid 
method to complete the Inventory-Routing Problem with planned transshipment (IRPT) multi-product. Zhang, 
Nemhauser, Sokol, Cheon, & Keha (2018) offers the Lagrangian heuristic algorithm for obtaining flexible solutions 
can accommodate unplanned disruptions in maritime IRP. 
IRP on bulk oil delivery is related to the continuous distribution of bulk oil from source ports or depots to a 
number of destination ports within a specified time horizon (Siswanto et al., 2011; Savelsbergh & Song, 2008). 
Assignment of bulk oil delivery is done by keeping the supply level of bulk oil at the port of destination will not be

Ship that has been assigned, based on the destination and the product carried, will be determined when the ship 
returns to the source port to resend. The process will be repeated again to the ship until the time horizon is exceeded 
 
 
4. Result 
The result of calculation of bulk petroleum transport optimization process in IRP is ship assignment. The 
calculated data generates assignment data for each vessel serving bulk oil transport from the source port to the 
destination ports as shown in fig. 2. 
 
 
Figure 2. Ship assignment 
 
Sistem will provide result of assignment for every ship in time horizon. The result is when the ship is assignmented 
to deliver oil bulk. Every data of ship will show which port will be visited by the ship for refill the storages of the 
port. This data also show type of product brung by ship in every compartment. 
 
5. Conclusion 
IRP is a very complex process. Optimization in IRP can only be solved by meta-heuristic method when IRP is 
classified as NP-Hard problem. PCO is a new meta-heuristic algorithm that is attempted to solve problems in the 
IRP. PCO provides good results to achieve optimization objectives within the IRP.  
The result of research in oil bulk logistic give optimum result in considering inventory of every port. Every 
calculation of PCO algorithm will consider fitness of subject such as transportation cost and demurrage. 
In further research. IRP cases can be further developed with the establishment of several source ports that are 
also supplied by other source ports. PCO is classified as a discrete optimization algorithm. In further research, PCO 
may be further developed to resolve other discrete optimization cases.

Abstract 
Sustainable service quality (SUSSERV) is crucial to identify how far the company able to meet customer 
expectations will determine its sustainability. SUSSERV model with six independent variables namely 
tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and sustainability has been developed by 
modifying the SERVQUAL instrument. This research employed a survey with quota sampling technique 
through 500 questionnaires comprised of 250 each to the customers of water (WC) and sewerage (SC) 
companies in the state of Selangor, Federal Territory (FT) Putrajaya and FT Kuala Lumpur. The study 
found the respondents dissatisfied towards services rendered by both companies. WC’s perceived service 
quality for all SUSSERV dimensions much lower than SC. There were no significant differences between 
the mean of perceptions except 8 from 31 variables and 3 from 31 variables each in the Category of 
Services and in Living Status respectively. The importance performance analysis indicated the Assurance 
and Responsiveness dimensions were at high levels but Sustainability dimension was low for both 
performance (perceptions) and importance (expectations). The findings not necessarily generalizable to 
other company in other states of Malaysia. Future research should focus on using this instrument in other 
states to further validate and test this instrument.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to identify and prioritize the most important indicators of quality management 
practices using a multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) is applied as a systematic methodology for constructing the hierarchy structures evaluation the 
model of study. This paper also utilizes the Hierarchies Consistency Analysis (HCA) theory for 
calculating of the criterion relative weights, rating the measures and obtaining quality performance score. 
The study has gone through set of steps for structuring the AHP model, collecting data, and determining 
the normalized priority weights of criterion. Results of consistency analysis showed the leadership and 
management commitment as top criteria for quality management assessment that will help organizations 
to investigate their current quality management practices by organizations. Ranking of the proposed 
criteria derived from this study will provide a better understanding of organizations on the direction and 
targets for improving organizational performance.

1. Introduction 
Quality management as a multidimensional concept has been widely adopted by various organizations for 
many years. In response to this, a variety of quality management approaches have been proposed as the prime driver 
for enhanced organizational performance. Organizations around the globe adopted quality management approach as 
one of the most important means for achieving competitive advantage.  
The history of quality management philosophy began initially with a narrow focus on a systematic approach 
known as a vehicle to understand variation and to develop strategies for improvement based on philosophical, 
scientific and statistical foundation (Juran, 1995).This concept later became known as the philosophical foundations 
of continuous improvement process under the term Total Quality Management (Dahlgaard-Park et al., 2001). In 
order to improve organizational performance, companies have utilized self-assessment approach aim at long-term 
success through continuous quality improvement. The origin and key concept of self-assessment is referred to the 
initiation of national and international quality assessment models/frameworks (Doulatabadi & Yusof, 2015). These 
models provide guidelines to organizations for effective self-assessment. Quality assessment models are mainly 
developed to measure organiztional performance through leadership, innovation and continuous improvement.

Reward System) is considered as the most important one with the weight of 0.343, followed by criterion R3 (i.e. 
Recognition and Involvement) which is weighted at 0.330. The same calculations done for RER matrix was 
subsequently carried out for each factor and its associated sub-factors derived from pairwise comparisons matrices 
to obtain their priority weightings using Expert Choice (EC) software. Table 5 illustrates a summary of result for

Each factor is ranked according to the CI value of major criteria as shows in the last column of the table. 
Based on the results, the CR values ranged from 0.0223 to 0.0913, which means that all the pairwise comparisons 
are perfectly consistent since the values obtained are within the acceptable level recommended by Saaty. Based on 
the consistency test, the entire CR of the pairwise matrix for each main criteria is calculated less than 0.10, 
indicating that the respondents have given their weights consistently in determining the importance weights of the 
each factor. The sum of the relative weights of all the factors adds up to 1. The target values for the indicators should 
be set. 
 
 
5. Conclusion and Implications 
 
The main purpose of this paper was to identify and prioritize the most important indicators of quality 
management practices using a multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. The proposed indicators were 
developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology. A hierarchical structure of AHP was mainly 
formulated to identify the necessary composition and rating them. For this purpose a set of steps were conducted in 
applying the AHP methodology for the purpose of identifying and rating of the indicators. The results of the study 
show that leadership/management commitment is the most important criterion which is followed by strategic quality 
planning and recognition and reward. The indicators generated through this study allow the organizations to assess 
their quality progress based on the proposed factors of the organizations. Through rating the current level of quality 
performance organizations can actually get a quick overview on where they are in their quality journey to excellence 
and where improvements need to be made. The proposed AHP model and its methodology will hopefully provide 
guidance to organizations for measuring quality and business excellence performance. The importance weights also 
can be used for assessing the quality performance. In this manner the indicators for each criterion must be defined 
with their importance weight.

The competitive position of a business entity heavily depends on its ability to manage the supply chain productively that 
may maximize the overall value creation. Organizational buyers have identified, developing their suppliers, which is 
called as ‘Supplier Development Practices’ as a rewarding and emerging way to maintain the competitive position.   
This study aims at exploring from suppliers’ perspective whether there is an impact of implementing supplier 
development practices by retailers and maintaining buyer supplier relationship on suppliers’ performance in the clothing 
industry in Sri Lanka. The central research problem of this study is ‘What is the impact of supplier development practices 
of retailers and buyer-supplier relationship on the performance of suppliers in the clothing industry in Sri Lanka?’ and this 
is followed by five research questions. The research questions have laid the path for the following five research 
objectives; to access the degree of business performance of suppliers, to assess the degree of supplier development 
practices initiated by retailers on suppliers, to examine the impact of supplier development practices initiated by retailers 
on suppliers’ performance, to access the nature of buyer-supplier relationship practice in suppliers and to examine the 
mediating effect of buyer-supplier relationship on the relationship between supplier development practices of retailers and 
suppliers’ performance in the apparel industry in Sri Lanka.   
An explanatory research was carried out by employing a structured survey research questionnaire collecting data from a 
sample of 100 (n=100) clothing manufacturers in the Sri Lankan apparel industry. 
The survey data collected is first used to validate the measurement properties and then hypotheses were tested. A 
significant relationship between supplier development practices and supplier performance was observed. Further, this 
study reveals that the degree of supplier development practices, buyer supplier relationship maintaining and supplier 
performances are high. In addition, the mediating impact of the buyer supplier relationship on the causal relationship 
between supplier development practices and supplier performance also examined and found that there is a partial 
mediation.  Accordingly, the results of this study support the view that supplier development practices do influence 
supplier performance, and initiating supplier development practices improve buyer-supplier relationship status but 
maintaining buyer supplier relationship will not significantly improve supplier performance.  The key findings were 
compared with prevailing literature based on developed and developing economies and managerial implications were 
drawn as to how and what type of  supplier development practices can be initiated by retailers in future for better supplier 
performance, which would lead to yield competitive advantages for both parties involved.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the influence of culture, job satisfaction and motivation on the performance of 
lecturers/employees in universities. Respondents numbered 180 people. Valid questionnaires amounted to 
146 pieces. Data were analyzed using 2 methods, namely: 1). Descriptive analysis, and 2). Multivariate 
regression analysis with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results showed that (i) culture and job 
satisfaction affect motivation; (ii) culture also affects job satisfaction; (iii) job satisfaction affect the 
performance; (iv) culture does not affects the performance;   (v) culture and job satisfaction affect the 
performance through motivation. Thus, job satisfaction factor is an important factor to be managed in 
order to increase motivation, which will ultimately improve the performance. However, although 
organizational culture does not contribute directly to improvement of the lecturer/ employee performance, 
it has increased motivation. Moreover, the performance variable shows the average interval value of 2.90 
to 3.53, with an average index of 3.30, which means the performance of lecturers/employees, is good 
enough. Understanding the relationship between culture, job satisfaction and motivation toward the 
performance will enable the leader to enhance the performance of lecturers/employees.

1. Introduction
The success in managing an organization is influenced by human resources. That is why many experts say that 
human resource is one of the most important capital and wealth of every human activity. Therefore, human 
resources as one of the most important elements should be analyzed and developed, in order to increase the 
performance. Performance is affected by several factors: 1) job satisfaction; 2) motivation; 3) work value (Begley 
and Czajka, 1993). Therefore, this study aims to analyze the influence of job satisfaction, motivation and culture on 
individual performance. 
Organizational culture is an important key that managers can use to determine the direction of their companies 
(Yiing and Ahmad, 2009). Organizational culture is generally defined as a set of key values, assumptions, 
understandings, and norms that exist among the members of the organization (Daft, 2003). These values and norms 
show the proper way to relate each other, thus they should provide the same understanding to all of the organization 
members in carrying out their work (Saranya, 2014). Organizational culture is the special atmosphere or belief 
created by the members of an organization, and it could not be imitated by other organizations (Rohaizah, et.al, 
2015), (Sekaran, 2003).  Organizational culture is also the behavioral principles and expectations influencing the 
interaction and cooperation between individuals, groups, and teams in the process of carrying out organizational 
goals. Schools which have culture fit to the organizational strategies and have abilities to increase the commitment 
of teachers and other employees will become good learning organizations (Schein, 2005). When employees describe 
organizational culture of their firms, they tend to describe the traits of rational, hierarchical, group, and

improvement of the lecturer/employee performance, it has increased motivation. Therefore, this research supports 
the importance of organizational culture, because the organizational culture is the guideline for the desired way of 
thinking and behavior to achieve organizational goals. College as a learning organization needs to strengthen its 
organizational culture. This is because organizational culture can support organizational learning in improving 
employee motivation. This is in line with the study conducted by Schein (1993) that a supportive organizational 
culture is essential in promoting a learning organization where there is a positive and significant relationship 
between learning organization and the management of motivation level. Therefore, organizations need to identify 
appropriate ways to create organizational culture, which could be understood and used as a guide to establish proper 
behavior of the organization members in order to achieve organization’s vision and mission. Organizations should 
have control tools to see clearly the expectations from agreed cultural values that underlie the behavior of 
lecturers/employees in improving their performance. The role of top management in this regard is very important. 
This is in line with Sağnak (2017) study which states that the behavior of a leader has a powerful effect on followers' 
behaviors. 
This study also found that the factor becoming the leverage to improve performance of the lecturers/employees is 
job satisfaction, especially comfort work environment, altruism, and rewards to employees will increase the 
motivation, so as improve their performance. Therefore, job satisfaction factor is an important factor to be managed 
in order to increase motivation, which will ultimately improve the performance.  The research also shows that the 
improvement of the performance of lecturers/employees primarily driven by factors that directly affect the 
lecturer/employee. On the contrary, intangible factors that underlie the productive work ethic have not directly 
affected.  
The performance has an average interval of 2.90 to 3.53, with an average index of 3.30. This indicates that the 
performance has a category of quite good measurement score. Factors that become the leverage of lecturer/employee 
performance are job satisfaction, culture and motivation. Therefore, to improve the performance of 
lecturers/employees, it is required to manage job satisfaction, culture and motivation because these three factors 
affect the improvement of lecturer / employee performance.

Abstract 
Tannery industry is considered as one of the major growing business segment around the world. This 
industry occupies a promising place in the global market place due to its enormous export, growth and 
employment opportunities. In Oman, currently there is no tannery industry, which can be established with 
the objective to diversify its economic growth outside mostly oil-based industry. This study therefore, 
explores an opportunity to design and develop of an entrepreneur model from the perspective of tannery 
industry in Oman. In order to develop such entrepreneur model, necessary data were collected from various 
regions within the Sultanate of Oman. In addition to develop such the model, this study also considered the 
total leather production system starting from collecting the raw materials to all stages of treatment and 
finally physical distribution to the market. 
1. Introduction
Tannery industry commonly known as leather industry is considered as one of major industry around the world. The 
leather industry occupies a promising place in the global economy in the perspective of its enormous export, growth 
and employment potentials (Gangi and Timan, 2013). For maximizing the returns and improving the utilization of the 
raw materials, there needs strategic planning and development of this industry. 
There are many definitions for the leather tanning process, which carry the same goal. According to Wikipedia: 
“Tanning is the process that converts the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable material, which will not putrefy 
and is suitable for a wide variety of  end  applications”. On-the-other-hand, the Columbia University Press defines 
it as a process by which skins and hides are converted into leather. Therefore, tanning is the process through which 
rawhides and skins are converted into leather as a final usable and sellable product (Nazer et al., 2006). It is used as 
the basic raw material for the production of various leather commodities (i.e. shoes, bags, etc.). Actually, there is 
no absolute procedure for the leather production. Raw material (hides, skin) and the final product needed decide on 
which techniques to be used (Zhang et al., 2016). There are several techniques of tanning but the most common are 
Chrome and Vegetable Tanning (4). The tanning process  usually passed through several steps, which can last from 
as short as a few minutes or hours to as long as several months  for some kinds of vegetable tanning techniques. 
The term ‘ hide’ in the tanning industry is used for the skin of large animals (e.g., cows or horses), while skin 
is used for that of small animals (e.g., sheep).  Hides and skins are mostly by-products f r o m  t h e  
slaughterhouses, although they may also come from animals that have died naturally or been trapped and hunted. 
Tanning industries are usually located near the regions where high amount of raw material is available. However, 
hides and skins may be preserved and transported prior to tanning (Balkau and Scheijgrond, 1996; Sumita et al., 
2015). 
This research study explores the idea to establish leather industry in Oman. In this avenue, the paper explores the 
possibility of establishing complete leather industry in Oman from collecting the raw materials and ending up with 
commercial leather products through all stages of treatment and finally physical distribution to t h e  market. Since

will be obtained from debt finance since the upper ceiling for investment loans in Oman  does not exceed one 
million Omani rails while the other 70% of the required funds will be obtained from an external investor. 
 
The debt finance will be used as a capital investment and the investor funds will be used as annual expenses for the 
first year in the form of monthly payments.

From the table 9 it has been seen that the net invested cash flow is negative up to year 5 and in year 6 it is positive. 
That means the payback period is located between year 5 and 6, which is short period compared to the amount invested. 
 
6. Conclusions  
 
This project attempted to identify and design an entrepreneur model for tannery industry in Oman, which gives a 
value added benefits for unused hides. Establishing such new idea and find the opportunity for tannery industry in 
the market will have a good impact to the community. In addition, the project will open new horizon for this local 
industry. It will help Omani government's quest to find an employment opportunities for Omani youths. Tannery 
industry has undeniable advantage for the country, where there are human labor force, sufficient water and 
abundant raw hides and skin. The industry will become one of the sectors significantly supporting economic 
development of the nation by generating foreign currency and employment opportunity for the citizens and 
locals. This project can offer a chance to open another related business industry in Oman like factories, which are 
using the treated leather to produce other products, which can be exported   to   outside   Oman   and   consumed   in   
local   market.   
 
As tradition, people disposal the animal hides by throwing it away which leads to harm the environment (Dettmer et 
al., 2010; Crudu et al., 2014). Therefore finding a way to recycle the leather will reduce the pollution and will have 
a good impact on the environment. However, tannery industry includes environmental issues associated with leather 
tanning and leather finishing with respect to wastewater, emission of pollutants in the air, solid waste and hazardous 
materials. Therefore, there is a need of additional study to overcome issues of hazardous waste that is a byproduct of 
tannery industry.

Abstract 
In order to expedite preparation and tender process, design and build contract is used for Mixed Use 
Building Project. In practice, many claims are raised by contractors, causing dispute among related 
stakeholders that should be minimized by proper contract management. This study aims to find out the right 
construction and design construction contract management strategy in the Mixed Use Building project 
based on Contract Management Body of Knowledge by conducting surveys and interviewing experts. This 
study obtained a contract management for design and build which is risk based.

1. Introduction
In order to expedite tender process, design and build contract was chosen for mixed use project. But in
its implementation, there are so many claims that leads to dispute. There is a weakness in design and
build contract system. In this research, evaluation for design and build system in the mixed use building
project is based on Contract Management Body of Knowledge 4th Edition.
The purpose of this research is to explain the project design management system (design and build) in
the Mixed Use Building project based on Contract Management Body of Knowledge.
This research will show the process of design and build contract in mixed use building projects. It also
explains the objectives of each contract management activity based on the Contract Management Body
of Knowledge and able to identify the risk factors that exist in the management of design contracts that
has an impact to dispute.
2. Literature Review
Mixed Use Development is a smart development where the same land is being used with different type
of buildings and  functions. Among them can function as apartments, retails, hotels, hospitals, offices,
and schools. This research will evaluate design and build contract system for mixed use building
project.
NCMA has issued a guidance for contact management in the end of 2013, it is known as CMBOK
(Contract Management Body of Knowledge) 4th Edition. In this research, evaluation for design and
build contract system will be based on CMBOK 4th Edition. We can find the outline competencies from
CMBOK as shown in the figure below.
2564","future the financing project must have clear steps and if the project is in progress, it should be possible 
to terminate the contract to reduce the idle claims of the contractor that can lead to dispute. 
2. Economics 
The risk of uncontrolled budget can be caused by the increase in rupiah exchange rate and the owner 
does not conduct a proper feasibility study. Therefore, the preventive action that can be done is by 
hedging / limiting the exchange rate that is set in the construction contract and a proper study must be 
done and prepared before the work begins. As a corrective action can be done by negotiating in case of 
claims and can stop the work to reduce overhead claims from contractors. 
3. Payment by Owner 
To prevent the late completion of the project caused by late payments made by the owner, it is necessary 
to take preventive actions such as the owner should make sure all funding is ready before appointing 
the contractor. In addition as a corrective step, the owner must immediately find a solution acceleration 
of payment and the owner must ensure the funding has been there first in order to implement the new 
project. 
4. Permit management 
To prevent the occurrence of claims caused by no building permits, then the preventive action that 
should be taken is not to start the works if there is no permits. And in the future, every project should 
have permits during the process of management of contract management in order to avoid dispute in 
the future. 
 
5. Conclusions 
From the obtained research results it can be concluded that: 
1) There are 5 variables of contract construction process design and build for mixed use building 
project: 1) Pre award; 2) Acquisition Planning & Strategy; 3) Post Contract; 4) Specialized 
Knowledge Areas and 5) Business. 
2) There are 9 (nine) sub-activity variables in the process of construction contract design and build 
design in the mixed use building project that influences the emergence of claims that lead to dispute, 
namely: 1) Payment; 2) ambiguous contracts; 3) Clear contract method; 4) Using the right type of 
contract; 5) Delays due to design changes; 6) added work; 7) Change order document; 8) 
Economics; 9) Management. 
3) There are 4 (four) variables of subcontracts of design and build contract management having high 
risk factors which influenced the emergence of the claim that lead to dispute on the mixed use 
building project. The high risk factors are: 1) The risk of unclear contract financing system can 
hamper the execution activity of the work; 2) The risk of uncontrolled budget due to lack of sound 
economic considerations; 3) The risk of late completion of the project due to late payments made 
by the owner; 4) The risk of obtaining IMB if it violates central government regulations. 
4) From final validation by experts, preventive and corrective actions taken from sub-activities with 
high risk factors to develop a design and build contract management system that has the most 
influence on the emergence of a dispute-based claim in a mixed use building project based on the 
Contract Management Body of Knowledge .

Abstract 
The industry involvement in the higher education institutions (HEIs) has been existing for a long time 
ago. Somehow, the involvement was passive and mostly touched the strategic level such as curriculum 
development. After the industry suggested the curriculum development, they can’t actively check the 
implementation of the curriculum. They only can check the curriculum result after the students graduated 
on a recruitment process. In the Education 3.0, industries are encouraged to involve more active in the 
learning processes. Therefore, this research explores deeper from the industry and suggested the solution 
from industry’s perspective and combined with the information technology capabilities owned by the 
HEIs. The research used a case study method and conducted a qualitative research with a semi-structured 
interview. The interview analysis has found that the industry can’t actively involve because they didn’t 
have access to the learning processes. Therefore, this research suggests providing access for the industry 
in the integrated academic information system (AIS), since the integrated AIS has covered the e-learning 
and academic performance during the semester. With the access, the industry can actively involve and 
collaborate in the learning processes and also can choose the prospective candidates before they 
graduated.

1. Introduction
Education 3.0 as a new paradigm in education has been directing educational institutions toward better educational 
experience (Lengel, 2013). They can implement the characteristics of Education 3.0 one-by-one based on their needs. 
One of the characteristics is industry involvement. In Table 1 below is a listed of whole characteristic of Education 
3.0.

5. Conclusion 
 
The analysis of the interview data has been revealed some interesting facts. The industry has the same point of view 
and nearly matched with the concept of Education 3.0, even the industry did not aware that the concept of Education 
3.0 is existing. The facts proved the concept of Education 3.0 very suitable for 21st-century education from the 
industry’s perspective. Furthermore, the suggestions from industry were aligned with the characteristics of 
Education 3.0, especially the industry involvement characteristic. 
 
The analysis result of SIAk UNLA can be used as a guide for the AIS to support the implementation of Education 
3.0. The future involvements suggested by the industry can be supported by the AIS. The AIS can provide the access 
to the student’s achievement and portfolio. With the access, industry can more active to collaborate with the HEI. 
Moreover, since e-learning was actively used in Education 3.0 concept and some of the student’s achievement and 
portfolio were stored in the e-learning, this research suggests to integrating the AIS and e-learning system. The 
integration will be useful to provide more comprehensive data. 
 
Finally, the research suggests to the HEI for preparing the tidy procedures before providing the access to the 
industry. The HEI must be aware of confidentiality and reliability. The tidy procedures can guide us to identify what 
kind of data can be shared or not shared. Furthermore, since the users of the AIS will increase time-by-time, 
therefore the improvement of hardware capability and internet bandwidth capacity must be considered wisely.

ABSTRACT 
Improving hospital supply chain performance has become increasingly important as healthcare 
organizations strive to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost (Chen D Q, et al, 2013). 
Existing research highlights that internal integration of organizational functions is not only 
expected to enhance performance but also makes external integration with the supply chain more 
beneficial (Schoenherr & Swink, 2012). But surprisingly, there is a strong indication that firms 
and its supply chain managers emphasise more on external collaboration than on collaboration 
with internal partners and business units (Poirier, 2008). The profound influence of physicians in 
healthcare organizations is a big challenge in various supply chain initiatives for the firm’s 
managers. There is often some disconnect between those who make the buying decisions 
(physicians) and those who actually perform the buying activities (purchasing officers) (Stark & 
Mangione, 2004; Ford & Scanlon, 2007) emphasising the criticality of involving and engaging 
physicians in purchasing & supply management processes. This paper identifies collaborative 
mechanisms, termed as ‘physician-engagement in purchasing’ that would reduce the physician-
manager disconnect by fostering the coexistence of competing logics of both actors and thereby 
allowing health care organizations to redirect physician’s autonomy and knowledge towards 
improved performance of purchasing and supply management. The paper defines physician-
engagement in purchasing at two levels, task and organizational and further examines the 
moderating effects of physician-engagement on the positive relationship between strategic 
purchasing and performance. 
Key words:  health care supply chain, physician-manager disconnect, physician engagement.

ABSTRACT 
Hospitals play a vital role in the health and well-being of people. In recent times there has also 
been an increase in the number of patients visiting the hospitals owing to various reasons. In a 
country like Indian where the hospital to patient ratio is very high it is essential to focus towards 
improving internal processes in order to attain maximum efficiency levels. With the increasing 
numbers of cancer and related incidents in India, radiology departments in the hospitals play a 
critical role in the diagnosis and treatment process. Besides, radiology Department also one of 
the important source of revenue generation for hospitals. The radiology department provides 
imaging services like X-ray, CT, MRI and Ultrasound scans and this has contributed to enhanced 
diagnosis of patients and consequently improved medical treatment world over. With the 
increasing numbers of patients visiting the radiology department in hospital followed by lack of 
advanced support from IT that can be used in radiology, coupled with lack of trained 
administrative and technical staff has created bottlenecks in the Radiology department’s process. 
This operational bottlenecks or inefficiency increase in the waiting time of patients and report 
generation time has caused inconvenience and dissatisfaction to the patients and has resulted in 
inefficient utilization of existing services to a number of deserving patients.  
In this context, our attempt in this paper is to understand and analyze the requirement of 
Radiology services in Karnataka and measure the (in) efficiency in terms of process flow and 
waiting time through a primary survey in a hospital with radiology department in Karnataka. Our 
results and analysis suggest that there is substantial scope to improve the efficiency of radiology 
departments in Karnataka that not only help in catering to more patients but also help increasing 
revenue for the hospitals.

Abstract 
Provision of roads provides access for rural and marine communities to health, education, employment and 
other necessary social services. A road construction project with the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) as 
a result of poor planning can affect the quality of the project. WBS is very important in the management 
planning process by turning it into phases, and work packages. Risk-based WBS standardization is one that 
can be a reference in road construction projects to achieve project quality. The most dominant risk variables 
were chosen using questionnaires and analyzed using SPSS (Package Statistics for Social Sciences) then 
added to the WBS arrangement in order to obtain results that were accurate results. 
Keywords 
Quality, Risk, WBS, Road Construction 
1. Introduction
Establishing a work breakdown structure known as the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is taken as a fundamental 
task by professionals and researchers in project management (Echeverry et al., 1991). The WBS can then be 
established to align the appropriate workflow, material flow, and cash flows for detailed planning in the construction 
schedule (Echeverry et al., 1991). The WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) is the starting point of a project planning, 
implementation and control (Globerson, 1994). It can be argued that WBS has an important role in project quality, 
making WBS an obligation in project planning (Burghate, Burghate, & Burghate, 2015). The efficient work 
breakdown structure (WBS) has proven to be very important in the project management planning process by turning 
it into stages, and work packages (Burghate, Burghate, & Burghate, 2015). In sequence, it can positively impact other 
project management processes, such as activity definition, project schedule, risk analysis and response, control tools 
or project organization (Burghate, Burghate, & Burghate, 2015). 
In the project, regardless of how well they plan and carry out their work, project component failures can occur, often 
due to poor WBS (Burghate, Burghate, & Burghate, 2015). A poor WBS construction can lead to adverse projects 
such as messy work, frequent scope, budget overruns, deadlines and problematic procurement (Burghate, Burghate, 
& Burghate, 2015). The standardization of WBS in Indonesia is an important thing that can be a reference in the 
construction of sustainable road construction in order to obtain the quality of a project (Irdemoosa, Dindarloo, & 
Sharifzadeh, 2015). Just few research has been published on the methodology or tools that can develop WBS to be 
appropriate for a project, and limited to certain construction areas such as apartment building construction and boiler 
manufacturing (Irdemoosa, Dindarloo, & Sharifzadeh, 2015).

for project managers in controlling other performance such as time and cost (Rianty, 2017). That way, the hypothesis 
proposed in this study has been proven. Future research is expected: 
•
This study analyzes the BQ of road construction projects in Indonesia, then it would be better to analyze the
archive of road projects not only from BQ.
•
This research only analyzed the archives and spread the questionnaire in Indonesia, then it can be spread
widely not only in Indonesia.
•
For future, similar studies of road construction projects improve other performance such as time and cost.
•
WBS development This research is risk-based, for the future can be developed with other things, such as
software.
•
The WBS approach developed using the pareto method, then the next research can use another approach.

Abstract 
Affective aspect analysis on online games from user’s point of view using Kansei Engineering. Currently, 
Indonesian government and industry players give serious attention to the fulfilment of economic needs in 
the field of creative economy. One of the subsectors that contribute to the growth of the National GDP is 
interactive game. However, this subsector contribution is very low compared to others. In recent years, 
some researchers have focused on researching the interaction between products and users to produce more 
effective and ergonomic game designs. This research intends to know the relation of online game from 
affective aspect by utilizing the voice of consumer (game user) specifically game user of DOTA 2 by 
using Kansei Engineering method formulated through Kansei words specializing in games. The purpose 
of this research is to analyze the affective aspect in the use of online game DOTA 2, to group the affective 
aspect indicators according to the desire/perception of the user for the product, and to give 
recommendation in the form of affective aspect information contained in game which can be considered 
as important aspect in the next game development. Based on the discussion and analysis, it can be 
concluded that the affective aspect is one of the vital aspect which can identify the desired game by the 
user. The information obtained is a collection of Kansei words or affective aspects which are grouped by 
using cluster analysis.

1. Introduction
Currently, Indonesian government and industrial figures give serious attention on the fulfilment of 
economical needs in the creative economy field. Creative economy has a few sub-sectors considered to have great 
potential in improving national economy, namely architecture, art, interactive game, music and also computer 
services and software. This is shown through the PDB growth of these five sub-sectors, reaching above the average 
national PDB growth in 2006 (Department of Commerce, Republic of Indonesia, 2008). 
One of the sub-sectors that contributed to the National PDB growth is interactive game. But this subsector 
contributed lesser than other subsectors. The interactive game subsector consisted of creative activities related to the

The number of clusters used was obtained by using Ward method in SPSS 22. According to Santoso & 
Tjiptono (2004), cluster number inferred from Agglomeration Schedule (attachments) and dendogram as a result of 
clustering. Dendogram is read from left to right. The vertical line indicates merged clusters and the line on the scale 
shows distance of the combined clusters. The number of clusters formed were assumed as much as 3 cluster units. 
This number of clusters will then be used for cluster analysis using the k-means method. 
4.4.2 Cluster Analysis Results 
 Based on the analysis of cluster using k-means method on SPSS 20, the distribution of respondents in each 
cluster was obtained. The number of respondents obtained on each cluster is not distributed evenly. The number of 
respondents in each cluster can be seen in table 3.

The following are the average results of the questionnaire according to the perception of users towards online 
game DOTA 2, which can be seen in figure 3.   
Figure 3 Questionnaire Average Results 
In the picture above, it can be inferred that Cluster 1 has average questionnaire value above 0 and some 
under 0. This shows that the respondents on cluster 1 have a tendency to select positive kansei word perception and 
a few that selected negative perception. Cluster 2 has average questionnaire value above 0 or positive, while cluster 
3  gravitated toward the negative position.

Based on the analysis and discussion can be concluded that there are 5 elements in a game is as many as 34 
pairs of perceptions. But the valid and reliable perception is 4 elements with 29 pairs of perceptions. 
Cluster analysis formed respondent in to 3 clusters. The users on cluster 1 and 2 tend to choose positive 
kansei words compared with cluster 3. The number of respondents in cluster 1 and 2 is greater than the cluster 3. It 
can be concluded that the affective aspects perception/desire in cluster 1 and 2 can be used as the aspects the vital 
aspects to be noted in developing future online games, especially for game developers or designers in Indonesia so 
the games will be preferable and known by the wider community, given the opportunity and  great advantage in the 
development of online game industry.

Abstract 
Human Errors were attributed as one of the main causes of many industrial incidents and 
accidents in work place particularly in petrochemical, oil and gas plant’s operation. One of the 
main contributors of human errors is fatigue, and fatigue occurred either due to insufficient sleep 
or disruptions in normal sleep cycle. Ultimately, the shift workers has high tendency to 
experiences fatigue due to shift rotation. Petrochemical, oil and gas plant adopted shift work 
schedule to ensure the continuity and to optimize the utilization of workforce. It is critical to 
analyse the relationship between fatigue and human errors to prevent accident/incident at 
workplace. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research was conducted using 
questionnaires for collecting primary data and a survey of literature related to fatigue and human 
errors for collecting the secondary data. The study was carried out to investigate the possible 
types of human errors and their causes that lead to incident/accident in petrochemical, oil and gas 
plant’s operation and to evaluate the relationship between fatigue and human errors. Sample was 
taken from shift worker of operation team that consist of field operators, DCS operators and shift 
controllers. The study results demonstrated that there is a clear link between fatigue and human 
errors, human errors prevention done by preventing the fatigue. There are four types of human 
errors were investigated (lapses, slips, mistakes, and procedure violation). Fatigue can be 
prevented by modifying the working hours, reducing working hours, improving the working 
environments (lighting, display, noise, colour similarity, appearance similarity), simplifying the 
tasks, proper ratio between manpower and workload. The responsibility to manage fatigue 
should be taken by both employers and employees.

1. Introduction
Human Errors were attributed as one of the main causes of many industrial incidents and accidents at 
workplace (Ness, 2015; Jahangiri, 2016; Konstandinidou et al., 2006; Besnard and Hollnagel, 2014; 
Bridges & Tew, 2010; Taylor, 2013). Yeow et al. (2014) stated that 90% accidents that occurred in 
workplace are due to human errors, while Bridges & Tew (2010) argued that human errors caused 99% of 
accidental losses. The impact of those accidents are really huge. For example, The Formosa Plastics Corp. 
incident in 2004 killed five workers and seriously injured two others due to the operator overrode an 
interlock that led to a release of hot pressurized VCM, Bhopal incident (1984) kill more than two

questionnaires. The questionnaires were written in English, hence the researcher and participants non-
British citizens it could be some limitation in interpreting the statements in questionnaires. The researcher 
cannot be sure that the participant’s interpretation of the variables is the same within the study or across 
the different plants. Future research can consider and reduce or eliminate those limitations, analyze the 
fatigues in relations to the geographic, climate at which the plants situated. 
4. Conclusion
All in all, the research results displayed very clear links between fatigue and human errors for shift 
worker in petrochemical, oil and gas plant’s operation. Prevention of human errors can be done by 
reducing fatigue. Fatigue can be reduced by modifying the working hours, reducing working hours, 
improving the working environments (lighting, display, noise, color similarity, appearance similarity), 
simplifying the tasks, proper ratio between manpower and workload (tasks). The practical implication to 
organizations, the findings suggest that company needs to provide training or workshop about fatigue and 
human errors preventions to shift workers on how effectively to maintain the fitness of shift worker, 
modify the existing working environments, job characteristics, having a proper manpower planning to 
ensure proper job and worker ratio. On individual level, the findings provide insights to shift workers, 
health and safety professional, students, the impact of shift rotation, circadian factors, time since awaking, 
sleep quality, sleep quantity, and sleep disorder to fatigue and human errors.

Abstract:  Development of construction in Indonesia  per annum to increase. However, not in line with the 
normative basis of maintenance, impact on the acceleration of damage to building construction. The purpose of 
this paper is to identify the key aspects of performance measurement for maintenance management building, 
objects within Parliament Building and Environment Indonesia, to improve the quality of performance.The study 
was conducted qualitatively, by analyzing data on the perception of the questionnaire to the respondents who had 
experience in the project, and then the data were processed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to get priority 
indicator factors. The study results showed that there were 63 events of the indicators which were identified as 
potentially dangerous, and 29 dominant indicators that affected the measurement performance. Furthermore, The 
results of the study are expected to improve the performance management and maintenance more efficiently and 
improve the economic, techical, social and environmental value.

Introduction
Today’s asset managers and asset owners need to know the relationship between the outputs 
of the maintenance process for assessing their contribution to the business goal. Effectiveness of 
maintenance and its quality need to be measured for the justification of investment in maintenance [1]. 
According to Indonesia Central Statistics Agency Data in 2015, Construction buildings in Indonesia 
increased from the side of building work amounting to Rp 340.7 trillion, up 53.7%. It is increasingly 
recognized that maintenance has a huge impact on economic, technical, environmental and social 
performance. In Industrial Ecology, maintenance is considered from the perspective of the whole 
product life cycle. In a holistic or system thinking approach, it leads to the integration of system 
complexity and a multidisciplinary vision to manage assets as a whole [2]. Benchmarking of 
performance indicators were undertaken by the benchmarking committee (now known as European 
Maintenance assessment Committee) of the European Federation of National Maintenance Societies 
(EFNMS), from 1998 and the best practices committee of Society for Maintenance and Reliability 
Professionals, USA (SMRP) from 2004. Since 2006, these two organizations have been working on a 
harmonized process, comparing the existing indicators for formulas and term definitions. [1]. 
measurement maintenance can be defined as all required processes for ensuring the acceptable 
assets condition by eliminating negative environmental impact, prudent in using resources, concern for 
the safety of employees and stakeholders, while at the same time economically sound [3]. Therefore, 
maintenance people at functional level can perform their maintenance daily activities and improve their 
value created aligned to their company objectives in becoming a performance government. 
2. Literature Review
Performance Maintenance 
In determining the performance maintenance of the building required a measure of performance. According to 
Mahmood Shafiee (2015), maintenance performance is divided into four dimensions based on sources that have 
been collected, ie economic, technical, social and environmental aspects. 
Management system maintenance is
Maintenance is defined by the European Standard as ""a combination of all technical, administrative and 
managerial measures during the life cycle of an item intended to defend it, or return it, the circumstance in which it 
can perform the required function."" (Eesti, 2010) 
The criteria described reinforce the idea that measurements should incorporate internal maintenance functions 
with their interactions with external factor, especially clients. At the same time, the measurement should involve 
the objectives of management, since the management will propose improvements afterwards reading the 
indicator. (parida, 2013)

Conclusion
Indonesia has high number of poor maintenance management building. Some aspects should
be considered when selecting the maintenance management system strategy. First, it is stated that 
the system developed and presented here is shaped and influenced by the author's opinion and level 
of knowledge. In order to provide a comprehensive system to the fullest extent possible, steps are 
taken to consider as many systems as possible. Next Step maintenance managers are the people 
who use the most systems and they also know the maintenance operations as well as possible. 
Therefore they are in a good position to determine which indicators will be useful in maintenance 
management. They are accustomed to such systems today and therefore it is difficult for them to see 
other possibilities than they are already used. To obtain an overview of broader maintenance 
performance indicators in the MPM system formulation process, EN 15341 (CEN, 2007) or SMRP 
Good Practices (SMRP, 2011) main indicators of maintenance performance are considered key 
sources for formulating performance indicators. Based on these findings, we hope the theoretical 
basis that has been exposed and conducted further analysis, then obtained the initial hypothesis of 
research that is by conducting the development of maintenance and maintenance management 
system will improve the performance of maintenance and maintenance of government buildings in the 
parliamentary environment of Indonesia.

Abstract 
Cellroom as work station is located electrolyser that produces chlorine gas with a stable and continuous 
electrolysis process, the chlorine gas produced as the main raw material along ethylene gases for the 
manufacture of ethylene dichloride or EDC in the DC Reactor. Cellroom has a very large number of 
valves that vary greatly in terms of model, service and size but in one place that is not wide so that the 
valve location is often close together sometimes even coincide. The objective of this research is to 
analysis work posture using RULA method on operator cellroon electrolyser. Valve layout that is difficult 
to reach and heavy rotation to operate also sometimes the operator must squat and bend when operating 
most of the valves. The results shows, RULA identified the high risk in performing job task in cellroom 
electrolyser. A survey method developed for the usefulness of ergonomic investigations in the workplace, 
in which occupational upper body muscle disease is identified. This tool does not require special 
equipment in providing posture measurements of the neck, back, arms and upper body as the function of 
the muscles and the external burden of the body. As a result, several design and tools were proposed to 
increase the operator’s performance in cellroom electrolyser.

1. Introduction
Industrialization will always be followed by the application of high technology, the use of increasingly
complex and complex materials and equipment. Application of high technology and the use of materials
and equipment that are diverse and complex in need of good human resources (HR) and quality as well as
work facilities that support workers in doing their work so that workers can perform their duties with the
maximum because workers as humans would have many limitations. These limitations in humans are
often the determinants of workplace accidents and can even lead to greater calamities such as: fires,
explosions, environmental pollution resulting in material harm to the company, spiritual or physical to the
worker that is the occurrence of occupational diseases.
In the workplace, there are several factors that affect work stations such as: layout of work 
equipment, noise, temperature, lighting, vibration, smells, radiation, toxic hazards, ventilation and others. 
All these factors can cause interference to the work atmosphere and affect the accuracy of work, health 
and safety. A comfortable working environment is needed by workers to work optimally and more 
productively. 
Complaints and problematic work that is often experienced operators in the chemical industry 
such as eyestrain, headaches and musculoskeletal disorders arise due to work environments that do not 
support ease and comfort in the work. Optimal performance will be met if maximum working 
environment conditioning, improvement of equipment and work facilities, repair of work stations and 
work procedures designed and adapted to ergonomic approaches and principles. The denial of ergonomics

The 5th working posture with the highest score is 7 because the valve location is difficult to reach 
because there is no access or no special place to operate the valve. There may be other interests so that the 
valves are so important in operating the electrolyze is not given adequate place or access even foot just 
leaning on the stairs while the body is held back by the safety fence, regardless of the circumstances that 
all ergonomic intervention will encourage operators to work safely and comfort not even just operator, 
maintenance technician will be easier in treating the valve-valve. Based on data from the 4th posture 
which is almost at the best posture position the isolation valve will approach ergonomically if the handle 
valve is made as high as the ideal location of the operator. The consideration of elevating the stem from 
the valve is because it is simpler to make modifications, of course the cost is also less and modification 
work can be done when the valve is in operation. 
 
The 6th working posture with score 6 has a difficulty level of operation that is similar to the case 
of the 5th job posture. The difference is that the valve is more accessible because it is closer to the 
platform so that the body is not too bent and the foot can also be footing to withstand the burden of the 
body. The ergonomic intervention is performed by lifting the hand wheel valve upward using a high stem 
according to the operator's height.

Table 5 list the proposed repair action in order to carry out work posture problem. Proposed repair work 
on work posture no 1 is to provide a step footing as high as 60 cm so that operators work without shrug. 
From table recommended dimension for stair ideal height riser height is 17 - 18 cm. If the height of the 
venting valve is 210 cm while the height of the shoulder 142.9 cm then with the height difference of 67.1 
cm it takes 4 step foot to reach a safe work posture. Extending and elevating the hand wheel is the most 
economical way among the options of improving the work posture to the 2, 3 and 4 work postures, so that 
the hand wheel height can be reached by maintaining a straight standing posture and the upper arm is 
angled under 200 and lower arm below 1000. 
 
Based on the anthropometry data the minimum height of the hand wheel valve is 1074 mm, so to 
improve the working postures 2 and 3 the hand wheel location which is only 30 cm from the platform 
must be elevated to a minimum height of 107.4 cm. In the work post 4 the height of the hand wheel is 
only 90 cm and should be raised to a minimum of 107.4 cm to reach the optimum height.   
Working posture 5 and 6 is fixed by replacing valve type with long stem model and hand wheel equipped 
with gear so that hand wheel position can be pushed close to the platform that is between 10 -20 inch 
from stand operator position. The ideal hand wheel position at a minimum height of 1074 mm and a 
maximum of 1429 mm. If the operator has to stand on the ladder then the base of the count (platform) is 
from the footrest of the operator. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Based on the results of data processing from posture assessment result based on RULA method, it can be 
concluded that operating the valve with squatting position and bending has the highest risk level and 
based on risk level RULA is ""very risky, do the improvement now"" (investigate and implement change), 
while operating the valve with a standing position is best along the body posture can be maintained 
straight up with the arms in the position below the shoulder.

Improved work posture is done in the simplest way by adding a step ladder tool, extend and elevate the 
hand wheel position and the more difficult is to replace the stem valve with a longer stem type and hand 
wheel equipped with a gear. This option remains the most economical and easy to work without too 
complicated preparation and relatively short working times.

Abstract 
Transjakarta is one of the public transportation that is managed by the Jakarta Government as a solution 
to reduce congestion. To be a solution, support for aspects of the facility must be fulfilled. This will affect 
the level of comfort and safety of passengers. This study was conducted to evaluate and propose 
improvements to the handgrip facilities provided by Transjakarta, where the handgrip is a tool for 
passengers who do not get a seat. The result shows that 52.47% of passengers had uncomfortable while 
standing and holding the handgrip for long period of time. The collection of data to support this research 
was conducted through questionnaires, observations, and direct measurements. This study focuses on 
ergonomics aspect as a basis for data processing facility as proposed improvement of Transjakarta 
handgrip facility. The result shows the number of handgrip facilities insufficient the number of 
Transjakarta passengers, so that became the basis for the proposed additional amount of handgrip 
facilities. In addition, the proposed improvements to the high-range handgrip on women carriages based 
on Anthropometric data, that is the average height of Indonesian women in 2016.

1. Introduction
Jakarta as the capital of Indonesia is a city that has heavy traffic. According to Badan Pusat 
Satistik, the people population in Jakarta is around 9.6 million inhabitants with a population of 
productive age (15-64 years) is about 7 million inhabitants. The flurry of population in the 
productive age and the use of private transport to support their activities will affect the 
congestion. The use of four-wheeled private vehicles increased by 4% and for two-wheeled 
vehicles increased by 11% within one year (Febriani et al., 2010). It is supporting the 
exacerbation of the congestion that occurs in Jakarta, especially at rush hour, as the time to go to 
work and return to work. 
The problems are faced by the capital, encourage the Governments are increasingly 
expanding the number of public transportation and improve the facilities of each transportation. 
Improving the facilities for public transportation services are intended for people to switch to 
using public transportation. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) presents a significant opportunity for the 
public transit industry to enhance the set of transportation options that can be brought to bear on 
the mobility problems experienced by urban areas across the county (Polzin, Steven E., 2002). 
Transjakarta is one of the public transportation is managed by the Government and officially 
opened for the first time from February 2004. According to PT INKA for Inobus models, 
capacity for Transjakarta feeder models are 135 passengers supported by 40 pieces of seat and 90 
pieces of handgrip.

Figure 3. The Proposed Improvements of Transjakarta Handgrip on Woman Carriage 
The proposed improvements above refers to the science of Ergonomics, that the work done 
should be close to the body, if it is too far it will cause tension in the arms. Then, avoid reaching 
too far and the most important is the movement of the operation must be within approximately 
50 cm upwards or downwards. Therefore, the proposed improvements to the handgrip facilities 
made as Figure 3 with the aforementioned considerations. 
4. Conclusion
Based on the results of data processing and discussion of results, some conclusions 
obtained in this study, namely the average Transjakarta passengers who used to support the 
activities during rush hour (7:00 to 10:00 or 16:00 to 20:00) sometimes do not get facilities such 
as seat or handgrip, with a percentage of 66%. Therefore, it takes a handgrip facility addition of 
at least five to meet the specified capacity. Then, to provide solutions to the grievances felt in the 
hands of passengers, the high-range of the handgrip decrease in women carriage, as many as 2.31 
cm.

Abstract 
Airports are expanding their facilities in respond to increasing number of passengers. 
Airport connectivity is one of indicators to evaluate airport performance. Airport connectivity can 
be define as the airline network of airport, related to frequency of flight and number of flights from 
origin to destination. Airport with good connectivity is attractive for passengers. This paper aimed 
to evaluate airport connectivity of medium sized airports in Thailand, which are Sakon Nakhon 
airport (SNO), Nakhon Phanom airport (KOP), Nannakhon airport (NNT), Phitsanulok airport 
(PHS) and Trang airport (TST) by using NETSCAN model during October, 2017. It was found 
that Phitsanulok airport (PHS) has the highest connectivity unit, with more frequency of flights.

1. Introduction
Air transportation is one of the important factors of life quality improvement. It plays an important role in 
the economy and society of the world. It is a convenient, faster and safer transportation service than other mode of 
transportation. Nowadays, air transportation industry is growing rapidly, and customer are attractive to travel by air 
more than the past. Air transportation industry in Thailand also expands their capacity to fulfill the customer need. 
There are six airports that operated by Airports of Thailand Public Company Limited (AOT) and twenty-seven airports 
operated by the Department of Airports Thailand (DOA). According to Figure 1, the number of passengers that 
travelling by air in Thailand has increased 123% within this decade, there were 60 million passengers in 2010 and 139 
million in 2016 (AOT and DOA, 2017). This phenomena emphasize the importance of air transportation in this decade 
with a bright future for business extension. The main players of the air transportation in supply chain encompasses 
aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, ground services and related industry. The airport serves the service for aircraft 
take-off, landing, passenger embarking and disembarking. To fulfil the customer satisfaction, the airports need to 
improve their performance of service quality, operational performance, airport connectivity and their facilities.

5. Concluding remark 
 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the airport connectivity of medium airports in Thailand, which are 
Sakon Nakhon airport (SNO), Nakhon Phanom airport (KOP), Nannakhon airport (NNT), Phitsanulok airport (PHS) 
and Trang airport (TST). The destination of medium airports is Don Muang Airport only, because the medium airports 
are operating only domestic flights and the flight distance is not too long, therefore the indirect connection is not 
necessary. The direct connection which is flown directly from origin to destination is attractive for passengers than a 
flight with transfer at intermediate airport. Because the medium airports operate only direct connection, thus the value 
of quality index of every connection from medium airports to Don Muang Airport is closer to 1, it represents the routes 
are attractive for passengers. 
 
The connectivity unit can measuring the attractiveness of the airport and can define the competitive position 
of airline networks. The future study might select the airport which has many destination into account. The airport and 
airline can apply the airport connectivity concept to plan the strategy to improve the airline networks.

Abstract 
In this paper, our objective is to present the results of a reconfiguration of the medication distribution 
process in favor of a resuscitation service in a public hospital in Morocco. We begin by modeling the 
distribution of drugs in its current state; we then highlight the anomalies posed by this process and this 
through a performance indicator ""the rate of advances"". We end by proposing a reconfiguration of the 
process in such a way to eradicate the anomalies noted while clarifying the specifications of its 
implementation.

1. Introduction
In hospital area, drug is a critical element considering all the constraints that surround its management. It is an 
essential and vital product for any act of care, the availability of medicines in the units of care in sufficient quantity 
and at the desired time is imperative for the accomplishment of this act. The prices of medicines in Morocco are 
expensive, their acquisition by hospitals is subject to an operating budget allocated by the Ministry of Health, 
pharmacists in hospitals are forced to optimize their use while covering the full annual requirements in medicine. 
Replenishment of care units is the stage preceding medicines administration to the patient. This replenishment lead 
to the constitution of a stock of medicines in the care units. The process of replenishment, of which the supplier is 
the pharmacy and the client is the unit of care, is qualifies as performing when it allows the immediate satisfaction 
of any demand for medicine while avoiding their stockpiling. 
In this article, we aim to improve the performance of a process of replenishing a resuscitation service within a public 
hospital in Morocco. To do it, we have adopted a three-step approach. A first is devoted to the study of the existent, 
it consists in modeling the process, highlighting the actors, the activities, the data and the documents conveyed. A 
second step is to assess performance through two indicators, advances rate and the sold-out rate. The analysis of the

Demonstration  
To illustrate the synoptic, we present in table 2, the result of a simulation of RS. we remark that on 18 articles 
distributed to the service resuscitation, only 11 was below the normal threshold. But the quatity to resupply does not 
correspond have exactly in the difference but in the available stock in the pharmacy. 
 
Tableau 2: result of RS simulation 
 
Conclusion 
 
The replenishment of units of care with drugs exactly according to their needs is the step that ensures the availability 
of medicines for each patient and which conditions a rigorous management of the stocks. Advances rate allowed us 
to analyze the reliability of distribution mode. We conclude that the mode applied is a pushed-flow, is too standard, 
and does not take into account the differences between drug categories and irregular drug consumption, or the 
storage space available at care units. Such functioning, which lacks flexibility, is detrimental to the supply chain of 
medicines, it favors breaks as well as overstocks. 
 
The implementation of the personalization approach for medicines distribution requires certain conditions, mainly 
the training of human resources, ie preparers and nursing leaders, which must lead to the appropriation of the system 
by these actors, because without their involvement reconfiguration can not succeed. The adaptation of the storage 
rooms of medicines, the resizing of the storage drawers must be done according to the endowments of each drug, 
this dimensioning is to be reviewed periodically according to the evolution of the consumption.

Abstract 
To support the maintenance and repair of building, it requires reserve goods inventory that usually stored 
in warehouse. Reserve goods inventory becomes very important because it determines the amount of 
investment to create a effective management. The absence of of rules to govern the reserve goods 
inventory risks slow down the duration of work and also enlarge the cost of work. Several delayed 
occurred in maintenance and repair work in government building caused by unavailability of reserve 
goods needed. As a consequence, it interferes worker activity. The purpose of this study is to establish 
Standard Operating Procedures on risk basis in processing of reserve goods inventory on government 
building. The method used in this research is Delphi Method and respondent survey. The result of this 
research is the compilation of ten standard operating procedure on risk basis of reserve goods inventory 
for maintenance and repair on government building.

1. Introduction
Government building requires maintenance and repair to extend the life of building so that service to the community 
can be fulfilled indirectly (Ministry of Public of Works Decree No 24, 2008). It requires a warehouse to store 
reserve goods inventory to support the maintenance and repair. According to John Warman (2010), warehouse is a 
building that is used to store goods. Reserve goods inventory related to maintenance and repair stored in the 
warehouse are lights, cables, locks, door handles, screwdrivers, nails, braso, wood chisels and lubricants. One of the 
government building in Jakarta had blackout in several times at the employer meeting (Tribunnews.com, 2017). 
Consequently, the working activities could be disturbed. The speed of handling during the event of blackout beside 
dependent on the officer, also depends on the reserve goods inventory in the warehouse. Therefore, if the reserve 
goods inventory is not done well, it will risk to disrupt the activities of employees. This requires a technical 
guideline in the form of standard operating procedures on risk basis to govern the inventory process of the reserve. 
Technical guidance on reserve goods inventory is expected to be the basis and guidance so that the implementation 
of reserve goods inventory to support the maintenance and repair of the building has clear and measurable purpose. 
It is expected there will no be complaints resulting from the user’s dissatisfaction of the building maintenance and 
repair work.

Abstract 
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  is a breakdown of project works into smaller components so it can 
be better managed. It is also known that the quality of project works is also important to controlled in 
order to avoid mismatch. The approaches of risk considerations are now required for the whole process 
on quality management. Therefore, the development of risk-based standardized WBS is proposed for 
quality planning of flyover works. The conducted research consists of several stages with qualitative risk 
analysis method. The result indicate that standardized WBS consists of 5 primary levels and 2 
complementary levels, with 5 dominant risk variables on quality performance and recommended risk 
responses as the development of standardized WBS.

1. Introduction
Construction activity is an important element in development. In developing countries, in order to 
improve the standard of living of their people, the demand for construction project activities will 
be felt. The rapidly growing construction project demands the importance of building on demand 
from the owner, where the flyover building (Flyover) is part of the construction industry that is 
influenced by economic parameters and psychological parameters. . The contribution of the 
construction sector to the formation of gross domestic product (GDP) is also quite significant, is 
10.38 percent, ranks fourth after the industrial, agricultural and trade sectors. and placed this 
activity as one of the economic supporters of the capital [1 ]. 
In the current development of the construction world, there are a lot of projects emerging in 
various types, especially in the field of infrastructure, such as the construction of toll roads, 
flyovers (Flyover), and tunnels. Construction of the construction project requires knowledge, 
expertise, insight, and experience in the construction world is not small. This should all be owned

elements, namely Structural Work. Analysis of Causes, Impacts, Preventive Actions and 
Corrective Actions against these dominant risks generates recommendations or additional 
activities for the Structure underlying the importance of developing the WBS Risk-based 
standards, since responses to those risks can be recommendations for action on improvements to 
WBS in project management . 
The process of breaking down the risk and handling it from developing this WBS standard can 
help project implementers to become the basis for quality planning, identifying jobs to the 
smallest items and setting each quality or quality objective in more detail, accurate, and specific. 
Risk responses are also considered so that risk-based WBS can be used as a control tool to ensure 
work has already considered the requirements to respond to quality-related risks. Then the proven 
research hypothesis. 
6. Conclusion
The purpose of this research are: 
1. Make WBS Standards in flyover work.
2. Identify the implementation methods and technologies used of each flyover work package.
3. Identify activities based on the WBS-based method of implementing flyover work.
4. Identify resources based on activities on flyover work packages.
5. Identify risk-based activities and resources that affect the quality performance of each flyover
package.
The first research objective indicate that standardized WBS consists of 4 primary level and 2 
complementary level; The second research objective generates 5 dominant risks towards quality 
performance after qualitative risk analysis, the highest risk score obtained from the category of 
WBS Level 7 Labor Resources. The third research objective shows that not every risk 
responses can be adopted directly into related WBS structure. Risk-based standardized WBS can 
be utilized for the basis of quality planning, helping project executor identifies project works to 
the smallest items and setting quality objective for  each items in greater  accuracy as a tool 
to ensure every work has considered  the requirements to respond quality-related risks.

Abstract 
Protection is fundamental to transfer the risk of loss. The way to protect financial losses caused by car 
damage is car insurance. Owners of motor vehicles bind themselves to insurance companies, to protect 
their vehicles, by purchasing insurance premiums. The amount of premium depends on various aspects, 
including location, year of manufacture, and the contents of the engine cylinder and so on. To claim as a 
benefit of the premium already paid to the insurer, the amount of net premium can be estimated through 
the large expectations of claims and the number of possible claims. Therefore, it is necessary to specify 
the types of dependent variables and independent variables. In this research, modeling is done with Linear 
Model Selected reverse selection. The model is used to estimate the premiums to be offered. More 
expensive premiums can cope with some unexpected possibilities.

1. Introduction
Humans are faced with various risks in life, such as mental and / or physical health disorders and property damage. 
If not properly anticipated, such risks may result in losses, especially in financial terms. The risk of damage to assets 
or property, whether or not moving, can be transferred to an insurance company by paying a certain amount of 
money. The transfer of risk to the object of this kind of insurance is non-life insurance. One of the non-life insurance 
products is car  insurance (David and Jemna, 2015) 
Insurance companies, often referred to as insurers, are obliged to pay claims rights in the form of sum insured 
in case of loss to the insured party according to mutual agreement or policy (Hoog and Craig, 1995; 2005). In non-
life insurance, this claim may occur repeatedly within a period of coverage (Sukono et al., 2017.a; 2017.b). The right 
of this claim is not provided free of charge, but the policyholder is obliged to pay the premium to the insurer. This 
premium is divided into two types, namely net premiums and gross premiums. In practice, it is very important for 
the insurer to estimate the net premium in order to account for the actual premium that will be offered to the 
prospective policyholder (David and Jemna, 2015; Sukono et al., 2017.a; 2017.b). 
In non-life insurance, one of which is motor vehicle insurance, claims can occur repeatedly in a period of coverage. 
The right of this claim is not provided free of charge, but the policyholder is obliged to pay the premium to the 
insurer. In practice, it is very important for the insurer to estimate the net premium in order to account for the actual 
premium that will be offered to the prospective policyholder (gross premium) (Agresti, 2007). 
To estimate the net premium of car insurance, the insurer can analyze the model of the number of claims and 
models of the amount of claims of claim data that have been realized in the past by taking into account the variables 
that affect. These variables are usually categorical. In addition, the data is usually not normally distributed. In this 
study, the Generalized Linear Models can be used for such data as the dependent variable, i.e. the amount of the

Thus, the net premium to be paid by insurance participants in this case is IDR 947.828,00. 
 
Case 2 
Suppose a woman with the initials B residing in Bandung insured the Toyota car manual 
transmission in 2015 with a capacity of 1200cc ABC Company. His car was hissed so he filed a claim 
to the company. Then the net premium assessment is as follows. 
𝜇1
̂ = exp⁡(15,2983 −0,6854𝑥𝑃1 −0,7116𝑥𝑃3 −0,8413𝑥𝑇12)  
𝜇1
̂ = exp⁡{15,2983 −0,6854(0) −0,7116(1) −0,8413(1)}  
𝜇1
̂ = exp(13,7454)  
𝜇1
̂ = 932290,74  
𝜇2
̂ = exp⁡(−0,7893 −0,7055𝑥𝑊2 + 0,4724𝑥𝐶2 + 0,8823𝑥𝐶4 + 0,6456𝑥𝐶6 + 0,6619𝑥𝐶7)  
𝜇2
̂ = exp⁡{−0,7893 −0,7055(0) + 0,4724(1) + 0,8823(0) + 0,6456(0) + 0,6619(0)}  
𝜇2
̂ = exp⁡(−0,3169)  
𝜇2
̂ = 0,728  
𝑁𝑒𝑡𝑡⁡𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑢𝑚𝑠= 𝜇1
̂ × 𝜇2
̂ = 932290,74 × 0,728 = 678707,65 
 
Thus, the net premium to be paid by insurance participants in this case is IDR 678,707.65. 
Keep in mind that two examples of such cases are some of the possible cases that are expected to occur within one 
calendar year of insurance. In both cases researchers suggested the company to apply a net premium of IDR 
947,282.00 to avoid future losses. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Based on the analysis and discussion that has been done then it can be concluded that: The modeling in 
this study begins with the selection of distribution and link functions of each dependent variable. 
Furthermore, the regression process is done by forward selection method. The tests used to test the 
significance of the independent variables are the Likelihood Ratio test and the Wald test. The best model

selection is done by looking at the value of AIC owned by model in every regression process. The 
independent variables that contribute significantly to the variable magnitude of claims are the cause of the 
loss and the year of the car, while for the number of claims are the region and the car cc. After going 
through these processes, the model for the number of private car insurance claims, namely ln 𝜇1
̂ =
15,2983 −0,6854𝑥𝑃1 −0,7116𝑥𝑃3 −0,8413𝑥𝑇12, while the model for the number of private car insurance 
claims is ln 𝜇2
̂ = −0,7893 −0,7055𝑥𝑊2 + 0,4724𝑥𝐶2 + 0,8823𝑥𝐶4 + 0,6456𝑥𝐶6 + 0,6619𝑥𝐶7. Based on the 
two case studies in this study, the estimated net premium of ABC corporate private car insurance is IDR 
947.282,00. This price is the highest price among the premiums generated through case studies. This price 
is chosen to anticipate future company losses.

Abstract 
In health insurance knowing the length of the patient contracting a disease is important, due to the handling 
and maintenance costs. This paper analyzed the mean and variance estimator duration contracted dengue 
fever based on data on the number of cases of dengue fever in the Bandung city in January-April 2017.  A 
person suffering from dengue fever symptoms is called Dengue Suspect. This Suspect has 2 opportunities, 
namely the chance of recovery or positive chance of contracting dengue fever. Opportunities suspect dengue 
fever to healt was analyzed by using survival model. The standard estimate in survival function was 
proposed by Kaplan and Meier in 1958, called Product-Limit Estimator. While the probability of suspected 
dengue fever to be positive contracted dengue is analyzed by using cumulative hazard function based on 
Nelson-Aalen estimator. Based on the survival function it is found that the time of suspect dengue fever to 
heal continues to decrease, while suspect dengue fever to become positive contracted dengue fever 
continues to increase based on cumulative hazard function. From the calculation results obtained average 
duration of dengue fever is for 8 days after suspect dengue fever, with variance 0.0758. Based on the 
average estimator and this variance can be used as consideration in the treatment planning and maintenance 
cost.

1. Introduction
Cases of Dengue Fever in Bandung increased. Until December 2016, Bandung Health Department recorded as many 
as 3,389 cases of dengue fever that occurred throughout Bandung. Efforts from the start of the precautionary measures 
to the treatment of dengue patients have been done by the government. Treatment of patients generally financing is 
done through health insurance program (Sukono et al., 2017.a; 2017.b). The problem that often arises is the budget 
reserved is not sufficient, because one of them is not known exactly how long the patient contracted dengue fever will 
be treated until healed (Camerron and Trivedi, 2005; Hanif et al., 2015).

4. Conclusions 
The Product-Limit estimator can be applied to estimate the survival function and cumulative hazard function in 
calculating the average duration of dengue fever in the city of Bandung from January to April 2016. In addition, the 
Nelson-Aalen Appraiser can also be applied to estimate the cumulative hazard function. Estimated survival function 
and cumulative hazard function is obtained by entering data on the number of dmam cases of bloody, so that the 
calculation results obtained the average duration of dengue fever in the city of Bandung in January to April 2016 is 8 
days.

Abstract 
This paper analyzes the risk measurement using CVaR when return follows the liability asset model with 
an unstable volatility approach. An unstable flat model is estimated using ARMA models, and the volatility 
model is not constantly estimated using GARCH models. The surplus return is estimated using the asset 
liability model. The prediction value using flat models and unstable volatility, is then used to determine the 
mean and variance of surplus returns that follow the asset liability model. Next, the average value and the 
variance of surplus returns are used to determine the magnitude of VaR and CVaR of each surplus return. 
The results of VaR and CVaR calculation of surplus return can be used as information in considering 
investment risk policy on each assets and liabilities analyzed.

1. Introduction
Investing in financial assets is an activity that contains uncertainty. Investors cannot know exactly how much the 
expected rate of return will be earned, and cannot take into account how much of the deviation that occurred on the 
investment (Jaaman et al., 2013). The uncertainty that can lead to such deviation is a risk, which is usually faced by 
investors. It should be realized, however, that it is difficult to separate between returns as investment benefits and 
possible risks (Sukono et al., 2016a; 2016b). There is a correlation between the return and risk, as generally, the greater 
the return offered by an investment asset, the higher the risk content in the investment asset. That is, any future 
expectations of an investment, there must be a potential risk of investment. Moreover, the future contains full of 
uncertainty, while uncertainty is a risk (Boudt et al., 2013; Sukono et al., 2017a). 
Risk measurement is very important in the analysis of investments in financial assets, considering this is related to 
investment with substantial allocation of funds (Tokpavi and Vaucher, 2012). Risk is usually measured by using 
standard deviation or variance. Note, however, that standard deviation or variance is a measure of average risk. So it 
cannot accommodate any risk events that may occur. Given that, it develops that risk is measured using quantitative, 
or better known as Value-at-Risk (Sukono et al., 2017b; 2017c). Despite its wide use, Value-at-Risk is also known to 
have unattractive properties, among them that Value-at-Risk is a measure of risk that is not strong and unconventional 
(Sawik, 2011). It thus encourages the use of the Conditional Value-at-Risk. Using Conditional Value-at-Risk allows

4. Conclusions 
In this paper we have performed an analysis of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) under the asset liability 
model with unstable volatility. The data used in the analysis covered the prices of INDF, LSIP, HDMT, 
UNTR, and BBRI assets. While the liability price data used is generated simulation, this is because the data 
liability used in the analysis here is not obtained. From result of analysis, surplus return

Abstract 
We present a branch and bound algorithm for the maximum clique problem in arbitrary graphs. The main 
part of the algorithm consists in the determination of upper bounds by graph colorings. Using a modification 
of a known graph coloring method called heuristic greedy we simultaneously derive lower and upper 
bounds for the clique number. 
Keywords:  
Maximum Clique problem, Exact Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, Heuristic 
1. Introduction
Clique problem, refers to the problem of finding a complete set of sub graphs (cliques) in a graph, i.e. a set of elements 
that are mutually connected. An undirected graph G = (V, E) has V and E ⊆ V × V as a set of vertices and a set of 
edges, respectively. A clique is a set of vertices C ⊆ V that there is an edge for every of pair of vertices (Bomze,1999). 
Maximum clique and maximal clique are different. A maximal clique isn’t subset any other clique, but maximum 
clique is a maximal clique that have most number of vertices.So a maximum clique is maximal but a maximal clique 
might be maximum clique (Babel,1990). 
If P ≠ NP for any ε > 0 there is no multinomialtime algorithm for estimation the maximum clique within a factor 
of  𝑛1−𝜀3. This feature makes MCP difficult to solve. Bomze provided an overview of the algorithms (such as Local
Search Heuristics, Neural networks, Genetic algorithms and Tabu search) and applications of the MCP’s types (such 
as undirected, unweighted and weighted) (Bomze,1999). 
Most of the known exact algorithms are based on Branch-and-bound (Suyudi et al., 2016). This algorithms, first 
recursively expands clique size using addition of vertices from a candidate set. Then, by pruning based on applying a 
simple constraint, separates unused vertices of the search tree. This algorithm loses its effectiveness when the number 
of vertices increases (Beigel,1999). Bit Parallelism improved these algorithms (Bomze,1999). Another solution for 
solving MCP is using genetic algorithm (GA) that using a simple GA is not suitable to solve MCP. To solve this issue, 
GA needs to be combined with other techniques to improve performance (Bron and Kerbosh,1973). In heuristic 
genetic algorithm (HGA), a meta-heuristic greedy approach, first expands subsets of vertices by adding randomly 
picked vertices, then it decrease it to a single clique, then expands it to the largest clique (Carmo, 2012; 
Carraghan,1990). EA/G Algorithm is accompanied with a mutation operator that uses statistical information relating 
to local information (Babel,1990). Ant-Clique algorithm is a solution to MCP using ACO algorithm in which a greedy 
sequential heuristics creates maximum clique by frequent addition of vertices to partial cliques (Cook, 1971). A two-

6. Conclusion 
Based on the review of various algorithms, in the view of exact solution of MCP, further enhancement may be done 
by applying better coloring algorithm to estimate upper bound. In the view of local search technique, we can see that 
hardly a algorithm dominates on all other algorithm, it is because of diverse structure of graphs. One possible way to 
overcome this deficiency may be to incorporate multiple search operators within a single algorithm and incorporating 
dynamic capability to decide the most permissible operators to be triggered during the search process. The use of 
branch and bound method is advantageous, because it provides an alternative perspective to solve the maximum clique 
problem, as well as the optimal method of solution requires no software optimization. Branch and bound method has 
been used to the search the maximum clique problem. To determine the chromatic number (G) of a graph G has been 
sought by the greedy heuristic, chromatic number (G) is the upper bound (UB) on G and by branching procedure 
obtained lower bound (LB) is the maximum clique (G) on G. Results of the maximum clique the search also shows 
that the maximum clique (G) is less than or equal premises chromatic number (G).

Abstract 
There are nine variables affecting the production process of RS 10 SY-C9 yarn production. So we need 
analysis using Multivariate Statistical Process Control by forming T2 Hotelling control chart. The results 
show that there are 6 points beyond the control limits with the main causes of TPI, Neps, and CSP. The 
calculation of process capability index of 1.456007 shows that the process is able to produce a product in 
accordance with the quality characteristics of the company.

1. Introduction
Multivariate process control is one of the most important parts of statistical process control. Keep in mind, in industry, 
there are many situations where monitoring or control should be carried out simultaneously, of two or more interrelated 
quality process characteristics are required (Busababodhin and Amphanthong, 2016). Monitoring these quality 
characteristics independently can be very inappropriate and misleading. A process monitoring problem in which 
several interrelated variables are collectively known as Multi-variate Statistical Process Control. A very useful tool in 
multivariate statistical process control is the quality control chart (Frisen, 2011; Williams, 2004). This tool can also 
be used in the control of yarn production process at PT. Grand Tixtile Industry. 
One of the yarn produced by PT Grand Textile Industry is RS 10 SY-C9 RS yarn. This type of yarn is one of the 
excellent products because of its high production amount, so there needs to be strict supervision in guaranteeing the 
quality. To monitor the quality of yarn RS CD 10 SY-C9 Grand Textile Industry company using univariate control 
diagram. This method is not considered appropriate because the existing data structure is multivariate, where there are 
nine characteristics measured by the company. This univariate method impact happening return (return) yarn, and 
repair of yarn (rewind). It was found that in June alone there were 72,814 cones returned, with production costs IDR 
90,000.00 for each cones, then in June 2016 alone the company spent IDR 6,553,260,000.00 to produce the return 
yarn. This is certainly detrimental to the company, then more precise monitoring techniques are needed. 
The T2 Hotelling control chart, is a control chart that can be used in a joint control process, with quality 
characteristics that are examined more than one. The T2 Hotelling control chart is used when both or more

Using equation  (3.1) is obtained  T2 Hotelling for  164 data observation of RS CD 10 SY-C9 . The Upper Control 
Limits (UCL) and Lowr Control Limit are  (LCL), UCL = 18,361161 and LCL = 0 so as to form the following control 
diagram: 
Figure 1 Control Chart  of T2 Hotelling Yarns Quality 
From the control chart, the points that are within the control limit of 158 points and the number of points beyond 
the control limit are 6 points, ie at points 6, 73, 99, 138, 145, and 146. Tracking is done at points is out of control to 
identify assignable causes. The most contributing variables make the point out of control be tracked using the 
decomposition control chart. 
After all points are within the control limit, a capability analysis of the current process is performed. This analysis 
can answer whether the process is able to produce a product in accordance with the characteristics set by the company. 
From the normality test it is known that the data is normally distributed so that process capability analysis is done 
using equation (3.2). the calculation process in equation (3.2), is done using software R which produce 𝑀̂𝐶𝑝𝑚 =
1.456007. Because  𝑀̂𝐶𝑝𝑚 > 1.33 then  the process is considered capable of meeting the specifications set by the
company. 
5. Conclusions
Based on the analysis results, it is known that the quality of RS CD 10 SY-C9 in December 2015 to July 2016 is 
uncontrollable, as many as 6 points are out of control. The main causes of points beyond control are TPI, Neps, and 
CSP. The process capability index of 1.456007 shows that the process is capable of producing products that match the 
characteristics of the company's quality. PT Grand Textile Industry measures the quality of RS 10 SY-C9 yarn threads 
in a multivariate way so that the suitable method is Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) by forming a T2 
Hotelling control chart to monitor the quality of the yarn as it is multivariate structure, thereby reducing the return

yarn.The results of the analysis show that the main cause of RS SY 10 C-C9 quality is beyond control limits are TPI, 
Neps, and CSP. Therefore, companies should pay more attention to the factors that influence the measurement of these 
three characteristics.

Abstract 
This paper develops a mathematical economic optimization for urea solution tie-in system in the urea 
fertilizer plant. The urea solution tie-in system can be used as an effective strategy to increase the urea 
production and the company revenue as well. The relevant data for the model are obtained from Pupuk 
Kaltim Fertilizer Company in Indonesia. The mathematical formulation of the model is solved using the 
General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted on 
the optimal solutions of the model. It is concluded that, with the present model, decisions can be made with 
different strategies and their influence on company revenue. Furthermore, this model will be highly useful 
for corporate decision making to achieve maximum profit while meeting certain production targets.

1. Introduction
Urea (NH2CONH2), containing 46% N, is greatly importance to the agriculture industry as a nitrogen-rich
fertilizer. Urea is made from the of ammonia with carbon dioxide in a chemical process in the form of a
solid urea prill (sizes 1 to 3.35 mm) or granules (size 2 to 4.75 mm). A urea fertilizer plant is a complex
engineering system consisting of several systems, i.e., synthesis section, purification section, waste water
treatment, and finishing section including urea crystallization and urea prilling / granulating (Meessen and
Petersen, 1996). PT Pupuk Kaltim (Pupuk Kaltim) as the biggest urea fertilizer manufacturer in Indonesia
currently operates five units of urea plant with total capacity of 3.43 million tons of urea per year. As a
company that became the foundation of strategic industries that support National Food Security Program,
Pupuk Kaltim always strive to develop every opportunity to make the plant viable for operation. Moreover,
the on-stream factor (OSF) of the plant shall be maintained at 100% to prevent loss of revenue during
downtime as well as maintaining the reliability level of the plant (O’Connor, 1991). Therefore, an effective
strategy needs to be framed out to achieve effective performance and expected urea production while
maximizing revenue.
In this paper, the work deals with the modeling and optimization of urea solution (US) tie-in system. The 
urea solution is a semi-product of the urea plant which will be further processed to produce a solid urea 
product in the form of prills or granules. The US tie-in system is built in order to maintain the production 
of urea continuously and the opportunity to increase the production of urea prill or urea granule depending 
on the selling prices in the market to achieve a high profit margin. Considering of its benefit, the main 
objective of the present paper is to develop a mathematical economic model for urea solution tie-in system 
at Pupuk Kaltim fertilizer plant with the aim of optimizing the urea production and the company profit.

5. Conclusions 
 
The urea solution tie – in or integration system has an important role in integrating the five urea plants in 
Pupuk Kaltim which can be optimized to achieve a maximum profit by utilization of the urea solution 
distribution. A superstructure optimization model has been developed to determine the optimal urea 
solution distribution path for production of urea prill and urea granule that gives a maximum net profit. 
Optimization results show the optimized path of utilization of urea solution when the selling price of urea 
prill is higher than urea granule is achieved by sending the urea solution to the urea prill plants to maximize 
the urea prill production and then the remaining urea solutions are sent to the urea granule plants with a 
lower operating cost. The findings of the sensitivity analysis reveal that the selling price of urea products 
(prill/granule) is very sensitive and show significant influence on both optimal distribution path and the 
objective function value. When the selling price of urea prill is higher than urea granule, the maximum net 
profit is achieved by sending the available urea solution to urea prill plants to produce urea prill up to the 
maximum capacity of the plants before maximizing the urea granule production. On the other hand, the 
urea granule plants will be at its maximum production capacity when the selling price of urea granule is 
higher than urea prill. However, since all urea prill plants have a lower operating cost compared with the 
urea granule plants, maximizing the production of urea prill become the most profitable option to increase 
the profit margin. Furthermore, the cost of urea solution will also affect the distribution of urea solution to 
certain plants which ultimately result in higher economic benefits. The developed optimization framework 
in this study is recommended to be practically used in the corporate decision-making process with the goal 
of optimizing the urea production and maximizing corporate profits.    
 
For future work, it is recommended to extend the modeling framework to perform the analysis of the 
operating cost of urea production and the cost of urea solution. These parameters are directly related with 
the utilization of urea solutions in obtaining the optimal distribution path. The improvement in these 
parameters can further increase the economic benefits while increasing the productivity of the urea plants.

Abstract- We consider a situation where a mining company operates a number of remanufactured trucks (as a 
fleet) for transporting mining materials (such as coal, ores) from several mining fields to processing units.  A 
high availability of the fleet of trucks is critical factor for achieving a monthly production target of the 
company. A usage-based maintenance contracts with coordination and non coordination between two parties 
is applied to the truck operated in a mining industry. The situation under study is that an agent offers service 
contract to the owner of the truck after warranty ends. This contract has only a time limit but no usage limit. If 
the total usage per period exceeds the maximum usage allowed in the contract, then the owner will be charged 
an additional cost. In general, the agent (Original Equipment Manufacturer/OEM) provides a full coverage of 
maintenance, which includes PM and CM under the lease contract. The decision problem for the owner is to 
select the best option offered that fits to its requirement, and the decision problem for the agent is to find the 
optimal maintenance efforts for a given price of the service option offered. We first find the optimal decisions 
using coordination scheme and then with non coordination scheme  for both parties. A usage-based 
maintenance contracts with coordination and non coordination between two parties is studied in this paper.

1    INTRODUCTION 
Dump trucks are important equipment in an open-pit mining system. The dump trucks are used to load 
mining materials (such as coal, ores) at a mining site and then tranport the mining material to an unloading 
site. Usually a mining company operates a number of dump trucks (as a fleet) to fullfil a daily production 
target. A high availability of the trucks is critical factor for achieving the production target. Preventive 
maintenance (PM) is an effective way to keep the trucks in a high availability and the PM can be done using 
age based or conditioned base maintenance. When a truck fails, corrective Maintenance (CM) action is 
performed, which restores the failed truck to the operational condition. 
All dump-trucks operated in a mining industry are sold with a two-dimensional warranty. For example, a

This is as expected since the agent performs a more effective PM (with 𝜹∗ (= 1.09)) and the PM in turn will 
decrease the number of failures and hence the total maintenance cost and downtime. Compare with the profit 
resulting from the Nash bargaining solution (Case 2), the profit for the agent (OEM) and for the owner always 
equal. This is due to the bargaining strategy that maximize both profits. Since the number of failures increase 
as the usage increases then it in turn decreases the profit for both players. The similar result exists for the 
MSC prices, it decreases as the usage rate increases. 
Tabel 2 shows the results (expected profit for each option, optimal option, and S*(N)) for =1.2, 1.6, and 
2.0 coresponding to light incline, high incline and very hilly, respectively. 
For a given usage rate 
(y=1.6) and land contour, S*(N) increases with N. This is to be  expected since the set up cost for carrying out 
maintenance increases with S as the number of trucks increases. Note that if S >S*(N), then the OEM ‘s 
expected profit decreases due to increase in the set up cost and operational cost. 
 
For the OEM’s and the owner, the maximum expected profit for Option 1  and Option 2 decrease with the 
increasing in land contour ρ . This is due to the equipment’s availability decreases as the land contour 
influences the degradation of the truck (which increase the number of failures). Also shown in Table II, the 
optimal option for the OEM’s and the owner are  Option 2.

6 CONCLUSION 
In this paper we study a usage based MSC for dump trucks after the expired of a two-dimensional warranty, 
where the MSC is characterized by two parameters – age and usage limits which form a region. An imperfect 
PM (which reduces the age of the equipment) is performed during the MSC and the optimal imperfect PM is 
obtained by maximizing the expected total profit for the both players. The paper models the contract using the 
cooperative and non-cooperative game approach with one dimensional approach. One can models using  a 
bivariate approach with multi players, and considers other shapes of a contract region. This is one topic for 
future research.

Abstract 
There are various methods available to control sand production from oil and gas wells, among them is 
through the application of downhole screen. However, conventional screens have their own operational 
issues such as erosion due to production of fines through the screen openings leading to development of 
localized high-velocity hot spots in the screen filter media and subsequent failure of the media. The aim 
of the present work is to investigate the chemical resistance and temperature stability of geotextile 
material as screen filter media through exposure to reservoir fluids and temperatures. Limited studies 
exist on examining geotextile material as screen filter media as its applications generally revolves around 
civil, coastal and marine engineering. In this study, woven polypropylene and woven polyester geotextile 
samples were selected and exposed to crude oil for a period of 1 to 5 days through immersion test and 
temperatures ranging from 150°F to 219°F through thermal stability test. The samples were then analyzed 
and characterized by the use of analytical equipment such as Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy and 
Scanning Electron Microscope to observe deformation after the exposure. Results revealed that the test 
samples were remained in their original state and did not degrade after the treatments.

1. Introduction
One of the toughest hydrocarbon extraction related problems faced by the oil and gas industry all over the world for 
decades is sand production from wells. Sand production is defined as the migration of formation sand caused by the 
flow of reservoir fluids such as water, oil and gas in unconsolidated formation (Naz et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 
2014). The production of sand is initiated when rocks around the perforations fail and the loose grains are thrusted 
by fluids into the borehole. Generally, it occurs when the stresses in the formation rock exceeds the rock material 
mechanical strength due to high drawdown, reservoir depletion, change in wellbore fluid composition and wellbore 
cyclic loading (Zhou and Sun, 2016). Before flowing into the wellbore, the sand particles are disintegrated from 
their parent rock. This happens when the reservoir rock has low formation strength and fails under the in situ stress 
conditions and the imposed stress changes due to the hydrocarbon production. 
The problems of sand production range from short term to long term effects. Among the issues are downhole sand 
accumulation downhole, sand accumulation in surface and subsurface equipment, erosion of surface and subsurface 
facilities and collapse of formation (Naz et al., 2015). One of the common methods to control sand production is by

5. Conclusion 
This paper presents a qualitative characterization study of geotextile samples after being immersed in crude oil and 
exposed to reservoir temperatures to study its chemical resistant and thermal stability. Woven polypropylene and 
polyester geotextile samples have been used in this study. The samples were immersed in Tapis crude oil solution 
for 5 days at room temperature and exposed to different ranges of reservoir temperatures. The test samples were then 
analyzed using SEM to quantify its molecular surface structure and EDS to identify changes in the material 
constituent components before and after the experiments. The SEM images of geotextile samples from thermal 
stability test show that both polypropylene and polyester samples did not deform after being heated at 150°F to 
219°F. The post-experiment samples appear to be similar with the unexposed samples indicating that no deformation 
occur on the test samples. The SEM images of geotextile samples from immersion test also show that both 
polypropylene and polyester samples remain unchanged after contact with the crude oil for a period of 1 to 5 days at 
room temperature. The EDS results of polypropylene samples from immersion test show presence of 100 wt % of 
Carbon (C) element from a test period of 1 to 4 days except for polypropylene samples immersed for a test period of 
5 days. The EDS results reveal the presence of 0.1 wt % of Aluminium (Al) and 0.1 wt % of Silicon (Si) and the 
remaining is C component after the 5 days. However, it is believed that the changes in the percentage of constituent 
components may not be due to polymer degradation but due to present of contaminants in the crude oil. Further 
numerical and simulation approaches are required to quantify and validate the findings.

Abstract 
Economic considerations determine the selection of low-cost steel material such as carbon steel in oil and 
gas industry. However, there are situations where carbon steel is replaced by stainless steel especially when 
encountering aggressive brines that contains weak acid such as acetic acid. Stainless steel is known for its 
corrosion resistance. However, the erosion resistance of stainless steel is not well understood. The purpose 
of this paper is to investigate the effect of sand particle size and velocity on the stainless steel erosion rate 
using sand blasting technique. Scanning Electron Microscope and Universal Scanning Probe Microscope 
were used to evaluate the erosion on the surface of the plates. The experimental results revealed that larger 
sized sand particles and higher gas flow velocity caused more severe erosion on the surface of the plates. 
The severity of the treated stainless steel plate was represented using the USPM cross sectional micrograph. 
The medium sized sand particles can cause 25o deep crater compared to fine sand with only 7o deep crater. 
Besides, high sand impact velocity of 22 m/s caused more erosion of 13o depth in the USPM cross sectional 
micrograph compared to 17 m/s which causing 7o deep erosion in the USPM micrograph.

1. Introduction
Sand production is a common issue especially in weak, unconsolidated sandstone reservoir during oil and gas 
abstraction. The sand particles can be detached from the reservoir and are produced during the extraction of oil, water 
or gas. Sand production may occur at the very beginning of the flow or later when the reservoir pressure has fallen or 
water breakthrough (Carlson, Gurley, King, Price-Smith, & Waters, 1992).  Not all sand production needs action 
depending on its degree of severity and sometimes, continuous sand production is tolerated. Being known as one of 
the toughest oil and gas production related problem, sand production is the main cause of many flow assurance 
problems which include sand impact erosion (Islam & Farhat, 2014).  Erosion is defined as the material loss from the 
metal surface that is impacted by a flowing fluid which carries tiny solid particles with a sequence of mechanical 
actions (M. Y. Naz, Ismail, Sulaiman, & Shukrullah, 2015; Rauf & Mahdi, 2012). Erosion can cause severe damage 
to pipelines, disable production and surface equipment. Many cases have been previously reported in the past where 
catastrophic accident happens due to sand impact erosion in flow lines as shown in Figure 1.

4. Conclusion 
This study investigated the effect of sand particle size and velocity on the erosion of stainless steel plate using sand 
blasting technique. The effect of particle size on the stainless steel erosion was elaborated in two sand particle sizes: 
medium sand size (63 µm to 150 µm) and fine sand (<63 µm). It was found that the bigger the sand, the more severe 
the erosion caused on the surface of the facilities and equipment. USPM micrograph results show that the erosion 
caused by medium sized particle was deeper compared to the erosion caused by fine sand (25.1o and 7o respectively). 
Apart from that, the sand particle accelerated at 22 m/s eroded the stainless steel plate more severely compared to the 
particle hitting the stainless steel surface at a velocity of 17 m/s. The USPM cross sectional result shows that higher 
velocity sand, 22 m/s can erode the stainless steel 13o deep compared to 17 m/s sand particles which eroded the 
stainless steel plate with only 7o.

Abstract 
The study investigated the prospects of incorporating solar thermals together in conjunction with existing 
traditional sources in the curing of tobacco. Field work was done to assess current practices by small new 
tobacco farmers and the average space sizes of barns they were currently using. Effort was made to utilize 
solar during the day for this process, to reduce on coal/wood consumption rate. The research went on to 
look at the sizing of the solar field, and environmental impact assessment on the current curing barns of 
Zimbabwe.  
Key words 
Tobacco curing, solar thermals, hybrid system, environment, sustainable energy 
1.Introduction
According to the International Journal of Agriculture Innovations and Research tobacco curing accounts for 5% of 
Africa’s total deforestation, 12% of deforestation in Southern Africa, and 200 000 hectares of forest are cut down 
each year for tobacco production. The majority of this (69%) is used as fuel, whilst the remainder (15%) is used for 
constructing barns and racks, including those used for air cured tobacco which does not require fuel. Zimbabwe is 
ranked the fourth leading producer of high quality flue-cured tobacco which constitutes 64% of all tobacco grown 
worldwide. The use of energy with less impact to the environment is required to assist in the preservation of the 
environment. The use of petroleum, coal and natural gas resources as energy sources is limited, and hence it is 
unsustainable. The gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels have a negative impact on the environment as they 
contribute to global warming.The current burning of fossil fuel like coal and firewood in a tobacco curing barn in 
Zimbabwe emits carbon dioxide (CO2). It is against this background that a feasibility study of tobacco curing using 
clean sources of energy which are safe, efficient and economic, is pursued to reduce the emission of flue gases, 
deforestation, pollution, land degradation and a host of other effects they cause.The study explores the 
implementation of a solar – wood/coal fired hybrid tobacco curing system as the energy solution for small scale 
farmers. The coal/wood being made available when solar energy suffer from intermittency of day/night cycles, and 
reduced irradiation periods during winter, cloudy days, and short transients.  
2.Background Literature
A growing number of small scale farmers have moved to tobacco farming. The attractiveness of the crop is depicted 
by general increase in the price per kilogram on the market in Table 1. Tobacco is now the mostly grown cash crop 
as farmers see high prospects of improving their living standards in a depressed economy. These farmers have 
turned to natural forest as the cheapest source of energy to cure their tobacco leaf.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations
From the study that was done it was recommended that a flat plate air collector of a size 22m2 facing North at a tilt
of 22 degrees could be used in conjunction with coal/wood in tobacco barn.The collector will be coupled to a 200W
fan or blower which would be powered by a photovoltaic system of solar invertor size of (230V, 480W). The solar
inverter would have its own 4m2 solar panel for energy supply.
Table 12. Flue gases mass reduction achieved by design 
The potential use of solar energy to complement the heat energy requirement for small scale farmer tobacco curing 
in Zimbabwe is feasible and economically viable. According to design if a curing barn is properly insulated, wood 
energy required is 28MJ/kg instead of the traditional 32,2 MJ/kg to fully cure a kg of leaf tobacco. So by 
implementing a flat plate air collector of a size 22m2 to an insulated barn will make a contribution of 30.5% of the 
energy required for tobacco curing.According to this investigationit was shown that solar could be used to produce 
heat that could be used in the curing barn. Hence this studywas vital in assessment of solar energy potential is 
reducing emission of greenhouse gases.

Abstract 
This research work was done to study an existing industrial area in South Africa with the view to initiate 
work to develop it into an eco-industrial park.The scope of this work was to establish the current resource 
efficiency practices, challenges and opportunities as well as support and interest by operators in eco-
industrial park development. The survey sought to also identify the need for capacity building in form of 
training interventions and government/municipal infrastructure facilitation. The resource efficiency and 
cleaner production (RECP) assessment of Alrode Industrial area was carried out in conjunction with 
National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC) in South Africa, hence prospects of implementing eco-parks 
across the country were explored.    
Keywords 
Eco-industrial, cleaner production, waste management, green industry, industrial symbiosis 
1. Introduction
Organizations around the globe, particularly in developing countries, are experiencing challenges in dealing with 
waste that they generate during their production processes. In such manner, eco-industrial parks (EIP) offer a path 
for firms to end up plainly greener and in addition help support their industrial operations ( Welle , 2015). It is 
common to see dumped waste disgracefully in most industrial areas around Johannesburg. This could be addressed 
by EIP introduction in converting existing industrial areas, which are over 30 years of age and home to several little 
and medium sized firms crosswise over the city, for example, chemicals, nourishment handling and building. The 
retrofit among others would incorporate including present day sewage frameworks, solar based lighting, green 
finishing and tempest water drains(Welle , 2015). 
2. Justification
South Africa at present uses million tons of characteristic resources consistently and imports million tons from 
abroad. All things considered, there is a general developing worry that as resources and space for landfill turn out to 
be all the more rare and waste transfer costs increment, advance monetary development might be hampered by 
developing resource wasteful aspects. South Africa produces millions tons of waste every year. This is for the most 
part industrial waste from the handling of regular resources into modern items, and the rest is metropolitan waste. A 
colossal level of this waste is either burned or dumped in landfills. Regions and industry are therefore in a 
troublesome position, testing them to discover waste management contrasting option to cremation. Waste lessening 
and minimization endeavors should be expanded and the issue obviously calls for going above and beyond by

8.5 Creation of waste sinks 
Waste should never again be viewed as something that is harmful, but as a potential resource for use by the industry 
processes. The centralization of waste, with the exception of landfill and cremation locales, has been extremely 
limited by anticipating well being and on security grounds. Nonetheless, similarly as most ventures pick up 
advantage from the area externalities, there are chances to be picked up from waste recycling. The production of 
waste sinks or focus on industrial parks makes economies of scale, progression of supply and basic stream mass of 
waste materials or energy. Waste reprocessing and energy recovery ventures can be invigorated to create savings in 
dealing with waste. The businesses change over waste into materials and administrations that are sold to makers and 
processors in a similar area or somewhere else. 
 
8.6 Incentives for industrial ecology 
Utilizing industrial nature as the premise of streamlining or advancing material or energy streams, cyclic conduct 
inside the assembling hubs (administrators) can be accomplished by outlining procedures to advance materials reuse 
inside same modern parks. Particular examinations should be possible to connect different conceivable activities or 
cooperative energies accessible in the current in SA modern zones. A multi-disciplinary and incorporated way to 
deal with the arranging and administration of assembling regions is required to encourage modern environment. It 
must be key and long haul. Industrial biology advancements take numerous years to sustain, however the key 
components of foundation must be set down ahead of schedule in the vital arranging procedure to support the 
brooding of new firms. 
.  
8.7 Way forward 
There should first be an expansive city or locale wide practicality focus to survey waste streams, markets, transport 
costs, foundation, open dispositions, social and monetary effects and dangers. Second, there ought to be point by 
point making arrangements for the plan, advancement and administration of the site. This arranging ought to 
incorporate various factors, for example, advancement designs, hierarchical courses of action, consolidating an 
industry impetus to inspire and pull players together, money related and hazard restriction systems venture groups, 
site plan and tenure agreements. To this end, new uses and imaginative procedures for abusing waste materials 
should be distinguished in South Africa. This is the area of modern biology that draws on some vision of a natural 
system of interconnected on-screen characters trading materials and energy. The environmental representation 
prompts the use of specific apparatuses, for example, material stream investigation (MFA), and life-cycle appraisal 
(LCA). Frameworks can in this manner be determined that better utilize the discharges and waste streams of 
industry and local utilization. Waste could be limited by applying a transfer framework for industry by means of an 
environmental system, whereby results are changed over into re-usable items or resources, for instance, scrap metal 
could be utilized for assembling processing balls for the mines in South Africa. The change in perspective underway 
and utilization is expected to reuse and trade side-effect materials and catch and trade waste energy in an economical 
way. 
 
9. Conclusion 
Various challenges have been identified that should be overcome to encourage the promotion of industrial park 
establishments in South African. In light of a legitimate concern for monetary savings, strategies that advance the 
recuperation of industrial wastes, must be started through instructing people in general and private to energize 
modern beneficial interaction. More accentuation ought to be on the improvement of components that would all the 
more adequately urge singular organizations to oversee waste streams successfully while permitting them the 
essential opportunity to grow new and beneficial utilization for the same. Mindfulness preparing on eco-frameworks 
is required as a few organizations do not recognize what is required and what they should do. Working through 
public private partnerships between nearby experts who are involved with waste treatment and landfill locales, 
ventures that release issue waste to these destinations, waste organizations that have practical experience in waste re-
utilize and reusing, and national government that is in charge of authoritative rules ought to set up a platform to lead 
the EIP improvement activity on existing framework. For future industrial parks, they ought to be organized in a 
roundabout or U-shape arrangement to make sharing of resources and facilities simple.

Abstract 
The two fields of operations management and project management are widely practiced in industry. 
However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there exists no specific study that highlights the 
differences and/or similarities between the two in the understanding of the practitioners. Thus, this study 
is undertaken to identify and study the differences between project management and operations 
management from the perspectives of practitioners in industry at the Sultanate of Oman. This paper aims 
to have a better and a deeper understanding on each field's definition, characteristics, responsibilities and 
key personnel roles and required skills. Accordingly, a set of hypothesis were drawn from the literature 
and a specific survey was designed to test these hypothesis. The survey is then distributed to practitioners 
in Oman and results from 100 respondents were collected, analyzed and discussed. The study has 
revealed that indeed there exists a strong Alliance between project management and operations 
management. This Alliance may cause practitioners to mix between the two fields.

1. Introduction
Travelling two different paths that leads to the same destination may be a suitable way of describing project 
management and operations management, yet, a logical concern will raise regarding the differences between both 
paths. Project management and operations management are mutually related to each other, however, level of 
interaction and intersection between them depends on the perspective of how things are seen or defined. In a very 
broad sense, though simple, projects focus on deliverables while operations care about the processes of making 
deliverables in mass (Moore, 2015). According to Kwak and Anbari (2009), when the interaction level of both fields 
are evaluated based on academics and practitioners it may be revealed that the level of alliance between project 
management research and operations research disciplines are ranked second among the highest disciplines allied 
with project management. 
This study seeks to identify and discuss the differences between project management and operations 
management from several different perspectives in order to have a better & deeper understanding on each field's 
definition, characteristics, responsibilities and key personnel roles and required skills. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review. Proposed Hypotheses 
are introduced in Section 3.  Research Methodology and the collected Results and Findings are covered in Sections 4 
and 5, respectively. Section 6 is dedicated for the discussion and the interpretation of the research results. Finally, 
the conclusions and future work are presented in Section 7.

6. Discussion 
Interaction level between the two compared fields found to be high, as 48% of the responses agreed that is it is 
strong, besides 11% evaluated it alliance as very strong. We can understand from this that project management and 
operations management may be integrate-able to each towards their common goals or targets. This finding falls in-
line with the finding of Kwak and Anbari (2009). This result verifies hypothesis 1. 
Hypotheses 2 to 4 infer the definitions of each field and general explanation of them, results found to be 
strongly supporting with proposed hypothesizes. Hypothesis 2 supported by 71% against 18% disagreed, Hypothesis 
3 got the highest support by 83% as well as the lowest disagree level of 4% only, while 74% agreed with hypothesis 
4 against 12% disagreed. It is therefore obvious that operations management is more known and definable compared 
to project management, considering that projects properly defined by specialized accredited organization compared 
to operations that does not have the same. 
Precedent hypothesizes verifications shows that project management and operations management are two 
different fields, yet they are interacting. Based on the results regarding the five most important characteristics for 
each field out of a set of twelve characteristics, it found to be that both fields does have only one mutual 
characteristic in their each top five. This reinforce the literature and verifies hypothesis 5. 
Test of hypotheses 6 finds that key roles in both fields finds that there are two mutual roles. Communication is 
ranked first based on the results for both, project manager and operations manager. This emphasizing that being able 
to communicate effectively is a vital skill to be present in key responsible people, despite their field. Importance of 
communication is due to its contribution on the success and ease of delivering outputs by providing a medium of 
sending or receiving information. In addition, Control work changes/swings also found to be a mutual role as per 
respondents perspectives. This confirms that key personnel should be able to manage alternatives during production 
or execution. This requires them to be good decision makers as well. 
 
7. Conclusions and Future Work 
Comparison between project management and operations management is carried to study three aspects, namely, 
definition, characteristics and key personnel roles. Study used survey instrument results from 100 respondents 
directly & indirectly related to one of the fields. The results presented not only the differences between project 
management and operations management, but also the characteristics of each field, in addition to project manager 
and operations manager roles, which found to be having mutual required skills on the top three for each. Current 
research adds knowledge to the field discussing project management and operations management differences and 
similarities.  
Extending the research to provide additional information about project management and operations management 
may consider including more characteristics/responsibilities to be studied. In addition, a deeper investigation of key 
personnel roles and the relation of the required skills with the outputs is necessary. Following different approach to 
indicate the ranking of characteristics importance could be useful to identify detailed level of importance of every

responsibility and the factors affecting them. Lastly, targeting more respondents would be beneficial as well in order 
to minimize error percentage, also to widen the coverage of population, which positively affect results validity.

ABSTRACT 
Mackerel fish crackers is a product made by home industries, one of the local products which 
potentially could increase exports from Indonesia to other countries, especially for ASEAN 
markets. Being able of competing in the industry, it should  improve its product quality and 
production efficiency. There are some issues in the production process, such as heating oil 
inefficient time, packing process, and the calculation period of the finished goods after the 
packing process. It is also sometimes exacerbated by the occurrence of reject products. These 
issues cause the product storage and labor costs become higher.  
This research aims to improve the effectiveness of productions process of mackerel fish 
crackers using 7 waste and VSM method. The 7 waste analysis intends to find the problem in 
every work stations by eliminating waste and speeding up the production process time. 
Followed by VSM method to reduce the transportation time at some work stations so that at the 
end of the research resulting 0.33% of production time improvement.

Abstract 
Current competition requires supply chain to be able to manage its risks proactively as one of the 
competitive advantage supporting factors. Supply chain risk management aims to develop various 
approaches to identify, assess, analyze, and deal with vulnerable and risky areas in the supply chain. This 
study was conducted to implement the integrated supply chain risk management in ready mix batching 
plant. We applied House of Risk (HOR) to identify risk events and risk agents. From HOR, we identified 
22 risk events and 21 risk agents. Moreover, we utilized Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to 
examine the interrelationship among the risks. In risk analysis phase, Analytical Network Process (ANP) 
was used to calculate the weight of risks by considering its interrelationship. Given the weights, Risk 
Priority Number (RPN) can be calculated as the multiplication of consequences and likelihood value of 
risk events. After we mapped the adjusted RPN in Pareto diagram, several risks that should be prioritized 
to be mitigated were E20, E9, E16, E18, E14, E6, E5, E10, E11, E1, E21, and E8. We recommend supply 
chain contract as the mitigation strategy to reduce the risks as well as to improve the supply chain 
profitability.

Introduction
In line with the development of business environment, the competition climate has transformed from inter-
company into inter-supply chain competition (Faisal, 2006; Trkman and McCormack, 2009; Yoo, et al., 2010). 
Therefore, supply chain management plays a significant role (Jain, et al., 2010), particularly in terms of building, 
improving, and maintaining sustainable competitive advantage (Shukla, et al., 2011). Effective supply chain 
management enables companies to improve their organizational competitiveness and performance (Khan and 
Burnes, 2007; Vanany, et al., 2009), such as increase the inventory turnover, revenue, product availability, 
responsiveness, economic value added, and capital utilization. Furthermore, it also serving as an instrument in 
lowering costs, order cycle time, and time to market (Shukla, et al., 2011). 
A long and complex supply chain system reflects a dynamic and global market (Asbjørnslett, 2009). The 
increasing of business dynamics and uncertainties leads the organizational’s focus on the importance of proactive 
supply chain management (Singhal, et al., 2011; Zegordi and Davarzani, 2012). Unexpected risk sources enacting 
the risk management as a critical component in the successful supply chain management (Han and Chen, 2007; 
Lavastre, et al., 2012). 
Risk can be defined as an event that has negative and detrimental impacts that may occur over a period of time. 
Risk that occur in supply chain could seriously disrupt overall supply chain performance and satisfaction level of the

Abstract   
It’s known that business has several risk that might be happened. An enterprise should manage their risk to 
minimize the problem that will be faced. Bunga Mawar is a company which runs sand mining. There are 
some conditions might be potential to be a problem such as wrong maintenance planning, mismatch the 
amount of sand, broken sucking tool on mining activity, and difficulties destination to be achieved. This 
research aims to list the risk in sand mining enterprise, identify, control, and solve the biggest risk that 
might be happened using fuzzy FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis). Supply Chain Operation 
Reference (SCOR) used for classify the risk and fishbone diagram will shows cause and effect of highest 
rank risk in enterprise. It’s founded that Bunga Mawar has 14 risks which consist in 4 plan activities, 3 
procurement activities, 3 mining activities, and 4 shipping activities. There are 4 risk that included very 
high, 1 high-very high, 1 high, 4 moderate, 2 low-moderate, 1 low, and 1 very low-low. In conclusion, all 
very high risk will be analyzed and managed.  The risk control strategies in this research analyze 3 accepted 
risks, 7 mitigated risks, and 4 avoided risks.

Introduction 
Risk exist in every business activities and caused by many conditions. It is a threat to life, property, or financial profit 
due to its perils (Kusumadewi et al., 2017) . Hopefully, risk management will help companies to manage all of their 
risks and minimize their problems. Risk management is a method to identify, to analyze, and to control the risk in 
every company activities to run effectively and efficiency (Hanafi, 2014). Risk can be defined as a combination of 
probability or frequency of occurrence of a defined hazard and magnitude of the occurrence (Wang et al., 2009). 
Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is one of the risk analysis techniques recommended by international 
standards such as MIL-STD-1629A in U.S. Department of Defense 1980 (Abdelgawad and Fayek, 2010). Failure 
mode and effects analysis (FMEA) widely used in engineering technique for defining, identifying and eliminating 
known and/or potential failures, problems, errors and so on from system, design, process, and/or service before they 
reach the customer (Stamatis, 1995). FMEA proves to be one of the most important early preventative actions in 
system, design, process or service which will prevent failures and errors from occurring and reaching the customer. 
The main objective of FMEA is to identify potential failure modes, evaluate the causes and effects of different 
component failure modes, and determine what could eliminate or reduce the chance of failure. (Liu, Liu and Liu,

Figure 4. Fuzzy Inferences Process 
 
Each rule in the fuzzy knowledge base would be dealing with a fuzzy relation. Compound statement which is used in 
developing the rules on fuzzy logic is the implication function (if-then rule). In fuzzy IF-THEN rule, the IF-part is 
antecedent as the fuzzy input variables, and the THEN-part is consequent as the fuzzy output variable. Thus, minimum 
inference engine is used to combine the fuzzy IF-THEN rules in fuzzy rule base and implicate the fuzzy conclusion. 
In this research, defuzzification process used centroid method, which crisp solution is obtained by taking the center 
of a fuzzy area. 
Risks can be sort based on FRPN value that have been processed before, the risk sequence at Bunga Mawar company 
shown in Table 9.

Based on the table 9, the risks are classified as very high to moderate which must be mitigation. Flood in the river risk 
(code M3) has the highest FRPN value. It means that the risk is a crucial condition and has to be manage to minimize 
company’s loss. In fact, flood is a circumstance caused by natural condition. It is something that company can’t 
control. Accept the condition is the only react to manage the risk. To minimize the loss, company needs to add an 
inventory sand when this risk happen.  Further process with fishbone diagram to find out the cause and improvement 
suggestion. Risk priority to control based on the highest rank of FRPN value. As limitation, firstly, risk which is 
accepted by company doesn’t analyzed with fishbone diagram. Secondly, only the highest FRPN is analyzed for the

root cause which shown on Figure 5.  
 
 
Figure 5 Fishbone diagram suction machine breakdown 
 
The suction machine breakdown risk caused by method, material, machine, and manpower. From the interview, 
mitigation is the best way to control the risk. In method, uncertain maintenance is the main cause that might shorter 
time between failures. To mitigate this problem, the company need to strict the action plan of maintenance, follow the 
schedule, and fulfil the need of material component in maintenance. It is related to material cause which is dealing 
with insufficient funds. This is the common matter of preventive maintenance which is including periodic 
maintenance. The company needs to change its mindset about funds for maintenance. Money that company spent for 
maintenance is not wasting, but something that makes lifetime machine longer. In the other side, based on interview, 
lack of funds caused by payment regulation in company trade. Some cases, buyer paid the transaction months later. It 
makes unbalance financial company. In machine cause, limited machine lifetime restrict the use of the machine. 
Additionally, the maintenance are not scheduled. After almost ten years of using, it is proper that the machine has low 
reliability and low durability. To mitigate this problem, predictive maintenance in needed. Finally, the man power has 
become the crucial causes of the breakdown condition. Careless worker while operate the machine could cause 
significant damage. Moreover, maintenance activities is not being the habit for the workers. Company need to train 
their worker about the importance of maintenance and safety in operation.  
 
4. Conclusion  
In conclusion, identification the type of risks in companies using the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) 
method gives 4 risks in plan, 3 risks in source, 3 risks in make, and 4 risks in deliver. So, there are 14 risks in the 
company. There are 4 risks that very high. There is 1 risks that classified as high-very high. 1 risk is high. 4 risks are 
moderate enough. 2 risks that classified as low-moderate. 1 risk included low and 1 risk included very low-low. The 
risk control strategies in this research analyze 3 accepted risks, 7 mitigated risks, and 4 avoided risks.  Improvement 
suggestion that can be done is to perform routine checks, allocate fund in accordance with the needs, worker and 
payment regulation, and add a sand reservoir to add existing sand stock. 
For further research, analyze risk map based on the mining process and be focus on mining section will sharpen the 
risk management and control. To expand the research, researcher could analyze the reliability of suction machine to 
solve the risk.

Abstract 
Purpose-built office (PBO) market in Malaysia has shown progressive growths and increasing level of 
competitiveness. The increasing competition in the PBO’s market would entail greater needs on their 
level of business sustainability. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research in the country that had actually 
studied in detail the level of sustainable locational of PBO in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Therefore, the 
purpose of this paper is to establish the sustainable PBO’s location in the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
Delphi Method was selected as a reliable qualitative method based on the local context in developing 
sustainable business location’s ranking through the viewpoints of local expert panels. It is believed that 
the viewpoints can deliver guidance to the researcher in recognising the quality of each PBO’s sustainable 
business location in local environment. GIS-based decision-making approach was applied in this research. 
It is a comprehensive method that can combine the data between weightage of importance and score for 
each PBO’s location characteristic. The study was successful in evaluating the sustainability of PBO 
location with different results in each study area and it is expected to provide insights to the stakeholders 
in improving their investment and business decision of the PBO market in Malaysia.

1. Introduction
Over the past century, sustainable development concept has emerged to reach equilibrium between physical, 
economic and social aspects in urban design and planning (Dehghanmongabadi, et al., 2014). Most of the previous 
studies stated that location is one of the key factors to achieve the goal of sustainable development (Dixon, et al., 
2009). Based on the Guideline for Sustainable Building published by Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature 
Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), location aspect of a building has affected the sustainability and 
quality of a building through the evaluation of locational characteristics.  
Findings in the summary report by Dixon, et al. (2009) ranked location of an office as an essential influence on the 
decision in selecting a suitable office. The locational characteristics of an office building can be used as a

6. Conclusion
This research has utilised GIS-based decision-making approach to fit with the local environment in quantifying the 
level of sustainable location characteristics that usually involved more subjective element. Through the justification 
on the current GIS-based decision making approach, it has given its own uniqueness on the research where the 
occupants’ orientation of the sustainability measurement method for locational characteristics of PBO was 
introduced. In this research, the researcher has introduced GIS-AHP method. Findings obtained through the 
application of this method are in index form that can be used as an indicator in identifying the sustainability level of 
each PBO location’s characteristic evaluated.

Abstract 
The future of any student depends mostly on choosing the right place to study after graduating from high 
school. Most high school graduates are lost in choosing their right path. This project helps high school 
fresh graduates to choose the best university or college in Kuwait based on their preferences. To choose 
the right place to apply, there are many decisions that should be taken into considerations. Those 
decisions are related to variety of universities/colleges and the students’ preferred criteria. Decisions upon 
which university should be chosen depends on a list of criteria’s, this makes it a decision-making system 
based on multiple criteria. A Decision Support System (DSS) is developed to take this problem into 
consideration. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process 
that is chosen to provide alternative solutions for the students based on several criteria’s. Microsoft excel 
is used in applying AHP, and a Website was built to represent our future business.

Abstract 
In this simulation study, we simulate patient arrivals and their flow within a hospital with the objective of 
improving patient waiting times and effective usage of health care resources such as nurses, physicians 
and other healthcare personnel. Our simulation model includes the following departments of the hospital. 
Registration, Triage, Emergency department, X-ray, Labs, Clinics, and the Surgery department. We, first 
collect the arrival data, map out the processes in each department, and collect processing time data for 
each operation. We also determine the type and number of nurses, physicians, their alternates needed to 
perform each operation. In our simulation study, we first simulate the current situation in the hospital and 
establish a baseline for several key performance indicators such as waiting time, number of patients 
served, nurse and physician utilization. As an improvement attempt, we develop several scenarios which 
focus on resource sharing among several departments, changing staffing levels of departments during the 
day based on patient traffic and provide recommendations to the hospital management.

Abstract (12 font) 
Crowdsourcing is popular for two reasons. It draws from a global pool of talent and it is 
where people are acknowledged for the quality of their ideas rather than for their formal 
academic qualifications. All that matters is the final product, not the backgrounds of those 
who contributed to it (Howe, 2006). However, in order to make the tasks be able to be 
carried out by the crowds, the tasks should be modularized. In order to to reduce problem-
solving inter-dependence among tasks, the tasks themselves need to be specified. The more 
independent or disconnected a component/task is, the more modular it is.

Crowdsourcing tasks, online business, digital economy 
1. Background
Crowdsourcing is an upcoming trend where tasks that are traditionally 
performed by employees of companies are now increasingly performed by people 
who use their spare time for these tasks (Geerts, 2009).  
The name ‘crowdsourcing’ first appeared in Wired Magazine in June 2006 in 
an article by Jeff Howe who defines it as ‘the act of taking a job traditionally 
performed by a designated agent (usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an 
undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call. So 
crowdsourcing stands literally for outsourcing to a crowd.  
The main idea is to outsource tasks to undefined public rather than to official 
organization or expert group. It departed from the intriguing question: ‘What if the 
solutions to our greatest problems weren’t waiting to be conceived, but already 
existed somewhere, just waiting to be found, in the warp and weave of this vibrant 
human network?’ (Howe, 2006) 
As the tasks are carried out to public, Howe put this situation into terms that 
‘new breed of amateurs has arisen’. This new kind of amateurs are people who are 
knowledgeable, educated, committed and networked (Howe, 2006). Crowdsourcing 
directly attracts this new breed of amateurs who dedicate their leisure time to work

The task ownership decision consists in the choice of a governance structure for task 
execution. The task execution can be assigned to the development group, other development or 
functional groups within the firm, or to external suppliers. 
The execution of a development task has associated two types of effort, which are 
technical problem solving and coordination effort (Gomes and Joglekar, 2008). 
From figure 2 (DSM), we can see that the technical problem-solving effort required for 
each task (production effort) is represented in the diagonal elements of the DSM. 
Given a defined task aggregation, there may be the need to perform some technical work 
within the development group even for tasks that are outsourced (Gomes and Joglekar, 2008). 
For example, a task such as specification of software system requirements can be contracted to 
an external supplier, while a sub-set of this task, such as defining security principles and 
communication protocols may still be defined internally. 
The non-diagonal elements represent coordination effort associated with task execution. 
 
Three types of coordination will result from task ownership decisions:  
1.  
Coordination within group, such as planning the internal work execution 
2.  
Coordination within firm but across development groups, such as negotiating 
agreement on standards; 
3. 
Coordination across firms, such as resolving conflict managing iterations between 
external partners and internal team members. 
When selecting a particular interface, managers have the choice to either: 
-   
place coordination between development tasks within a production unit,  
-  
increase modularity,  
or 
-  
allow coordination to occur across task boundaries, decreasing modularity.  
According to Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) view, the coordination across 
boundaries is more costly to the organization than coordination within boundaries (Gomes and 
Joglekar, 2008). A greater level of task modularity should result in a lower level of endogenous 
uncertainty. The TCE theory conceptualizes uncertainty as a key driver of transaction costs. 
Task modularity is conceptualized as an architectural decision that defines how project 
endogenous uncertainty gets resolved.  Task ownership decisions impact the distribution of 
coordination effort among internal versus external interfaces. The ownership decision may 
moderate the impact of architectural choices on coordination (Gomes and Joglekar, 2008). 
The modularity requires more cross-firm sharing of design and knowledge. (Parente, 
2005). The more independent or disconnected a component is, (the more degree of freedom a 
component has), the more modular it is (Sosa, 2007).  
 
4. Conclusion 
4.1. 
Findings and Implications 
 
Crowdsourcing allows the power of the crowd to accomplish tasks that were once the 
province of just a specialized few. It is conducted by taking the principles which have worked for 
open source software projects and apply them right across the entire spectrum of the business 
world (Howe, 2006).

In order to send out activities to be crowdsourced, first we elaborate the types of 
crowdsourcing according to some experts. After that we tried to comprehend the motivation and 
role of human in the crowdsourcing process. Before sending out tasks to be solved by a type of 
crowd, it is better to understand the types of tasks based on degree of complexity (Zigurs and 
Buckland, 1998). 
 
Then, in order to to reduce problem-solving interdependence among tasks, the tasks 
themselves need to be specified. The more independent or disconnected a component/task is, the 
more modular it is (Sosa, 2007). 
 
A design of Design Structure Matrix (DSM) proposed by Gomes and Joglekar (2008) 
may help explaining the modularization process. The finding explained that modularization 
involves technical problem solving and coordination effort. 
 
4.2. 
Limitations and Suggestions for Further Research 
This paper is intended to conduct conceptual study about crowdsourcing, its task characteristics 
and modularization method. However, limited research due to limited time to further understand 
this broad topic has made this paper far from perfect. Our suggestion for future researchers is to 
be more focused in specific crowdsourcing issues, therefore any required literature study can be 
narrowed down and related observations can be conducted

Abstract 
In this paper, Lean and Six Sigma were applied to a Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME), 
Company XYZ for plastic manufacturing in Kuwait, to reduce the variation in their injection molding 
process. Variation exists within any process and when this variation goes beyond certain limits, non-
conforming parts are produced and the company will face increased percentage of waste, operational cost, 
and reduced customer’s satisfaction. Many of the XYZ Company plastic fittings were rejected as they 
were defective or having defects such as internal surface marks, flash, and bubbles. Floor Traps 6x4x2 
fittings accounted for the highest rejection rate in XYZ Company. Six Sigma DMAIC combined with the 
5S were applied to tackle this problem. DMAIC is a general engineering design approach that can be 
applied for many production or service problems that need practical solutions. It is an acronym stands for 
Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. Results show that by implementing Six Sigma 
combined with the 5S program, Company XYZ achieved an improvement in its Sigma Level and Defects 
rate (DPMO) which lead to significant cost savings and increased its competitiveness.

Introduction 
Manufacturing is the action of making things. It is the process of transforming materials into items with greater 
value. Most materials used in manufacturing are classified into four categories: metals, ceramics, polymers and 
composites. Polymers are divided into two categories: plastics and rubbers. Thermoplastics and thermosets are two 
types of plastics. Unlike thermosets, thermoplastics can be subjected to heating and cooling cycles repeatedly 
without degrading. This property allows thermoplastics to be used in plastic injection molding, which is the primary 
focus of this study (Valles, Sanchez, Noriega, & Nunez, 2009).  
“Injection molding is a process in which a polymer is heated to a highly plastic state and forced to flow under high 
pressure into a mold cavity, where it solidifies. The molded part, which is called a molding, is then removed from 
the cavity,” (Groover, 2013, p. 238). Within any process there exists variation. When this variation goes beyond 
certain limits, defected parts, and waste may be produced. Lean and Six Sigma are principles that aim to reduce 
variation and eliminate waste as much as possible (Montgomery, 2013). 
Lean is a way of thinking that aims to reduce waste, improve throughput, promote work standardization, and 
organize the workplace to be more effective and efficient (Lee & Wei, 2010). While Six Sigma is a principle, an 
idea of improving a process by reducing process variation related to the quality characteristics of the product; it 
describes how a process deviates from the target. 
The main idea of Six Sigma is to fit six standard deviations between the mean (target) and the specification limit 
(Blount et al., 2000). Anything out of the specification limits is considered as defective and is measured by parts per 
million (PPM) or defects per million opportunities (DPMO).

Control Phase 
The fifth and final phase is control. The purpose of the control phase is “to complete project work and hand off 
improved process to process owner, with procedures for maintaining the gains” (George et al., 2005, p. 17). An 
attribute control chart shown in Fig. 10 was constructed (Mishra, Mishra, & Sachendra, 2015). No assignable causes 
nor patterns were present in the control chart, and since all points fall randomly within the control limits, we have 
concluded that the injection molding process is under control and exhibits common cause variation. 
Following the execution of phase-one of the control charts, phase-two should be done by Company XYZ to monitor 
the performance of their process. An Out-of-Control-Action Plan (OCAP) was formed as a corrective action plan. It 
consists of checkpoints and terminators. Checkpoints are the potential assignable causes while terminators are the 
actions that should be taken to eliminate these causes.

After completing the five phases of DMAIC, a sign off ensured that the project was accomplished on time, while 
meeting the outcomes of the project’s scope and quality (Wankhade, Gride, & Bandabuche, 2014).

CONCLUSION 
In this project, the concepts of Lean Six Sigma were successfully applied to Company XYZ to improve its injection 
molding process (Dwivedi, Anas, & Siraj, 2014). DMAIC was used to tackle the problem of the rejecting poor 
quality products. We found that the consequences of producing poor quality products affected the reputation of the 
company; money, time and effort are lost when rejected products are scraped, reworked or recycled.  
We started off by selecting the product with the highest rejection percentage which turned out to be Floor Trap 
6x4x2. We then classified the types of defects and defectives produced in this type of product. The current 
performance of the injection molding process was evaluated in terms of sigma level, and DPMO. This acted as a 
baseline for our study. In order to find the root causes of the problem, a Fishbone diagram was constructed. 
Brainstorming sessions were useful in selecting the most appropriate causes that had an influence on the number of 
defects produced. 
Following that, DOE was used to find the optimum parameters of the injection speed, injection pressure, and 
melting temperature that would produce the minimum number of defects. Other causes such as the operator’s 
behavior, mold surface and so on, were considered in the FMEA. Actions that would reduce the number of defects 
were implemented, and recommended to Company XYZ.
After improving the system, the sigma level increased from 1.4σ to 2.3σ and DPMO decreased from 516,500 to 
190,000. This improvement accounts for more than 50% of process improvement. A control chart was used to check 
for stability of the process, and an Out-of-Control-Action plan was provided to the company for maintaining process 
improvements. The improvement that we have made will increase profits made by the organization and improve the 
overall performance of the injection molding process.

FUTURE WORK 
After successfully improving the process of injection molding for the Floor Trap product, further Six Sigma projects 
can be applied in the same sector to induce further improvements. For future work, the same project can be replicated 
to the other fittings that are produced such as applying Lean Six Sigma to the Coupling UPVC 63 mm fitting. 
Moreover, the same project can be applied to the same product (Floor Trap 6x4x2) but concentrating on variable 
Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) characteristics, instead of attribute CTQ.

Abstract 
This paper presents literature study for oil and gas offshore platform decommissioning in Indonesia and 
other country. The paper centralizes its explanation to regulatory, technical, and financial issues related to 
offshore platform decommissioning.  
Benchmarking study is taken to compare progress of oil and gas offshore platform decommissioning in 
Indonesia with country such United State and international recommended practice. Comparison of cost 
estimation shows range of estimated cost for platform decommissioning options in Kalimantan Offshore 
Region and in Pacific Offshore California Sea Region (POSCR).

1. Introduction
Offshore platforms in Indonesia were built since 1970’s. To current date, these platforms age have achieved 
two or three times of a platform standard economic life. An assessment to existing platform is required to 
determine whether it is still met fit-for-purpose criteria of an oil and gas platform according to industry 
standard and practice. This assessment is known as preliminary step in screening candidate of to-be-
decommissioned offshore platform. 
Despite of technical issue, offshore platform decommissioning also deals with strict regulatory and 
financing. Due to its location in the ocean, the oil and gas offshore operation (include platform facilities) is 
regulated by Continental Shelf (Geneva, 1958) and Law of the Sea (Montenegro, 1982) Convention. This 
brought concern to environmental impact of offshore platform decommissioning to ocean. With respect to 
the environmental impact, the offshore platform decommissioning removal options vary as per approved 
method by all related stakeholders. The method determines amount of fund needed for the execution. 
2. Permit and Regulation
Indonesia 
In Indonesia, decommissioning issue emerged first time in Decree No. 017/1974. Article 21 Clause 1 of the regulation 
stated that unused mining installation should be completely dismantled within the period stipulated by the General 
Director, by taking appropriate measures to ensure job security and the shipping lane [1]. 
Specific information for offshore platform decommissioning were not stated in year 1974 regulation yet. In 2010, 
Indonesia Oil and Gas Task Force (SKKMigas) released Code of Conduct (PTK) No. 040 about Abandonment and 
Site Restoration (ASR). One year later, Indonesia Government established Ministry Energy and Mineral Resource

Decommissioning cost by removal chart shows 3 platforms with heaviest estimated removal tonnage have the highest 
decommissioning cost among others. Those platforms are Harmony (129,842K USD), Heritage (128,654K USD), and 
Hondo (77,052K USD). Decommissioning cost of those 3 platforms are also the highest compare to rest of platform 
by water depth.

* Estimated Removal Weight includes the weight of the jacket, deck, piles, and conductors and assumes that they 
are removed to a depth of 15 feet below the mudline. 
These informations reflect that the higher the estimated removal weight and the deeper the water depth of a platform, 
the higher the decommissioning cost. These two factors are considered to be primary concern in estimating cost for 
offshore platform decommissioning.  
5. Conclusion 
The literature study shows that Indonesia is already has provided relevant regulations, technical guideline, and the 
financing mechanism for offshore platform decommissioning. Until today, no informations regarding offshore 
platform decommissioning execution is documented in country. The practice is limited to Join Study which conducted 
by government organizations and University.  
Consideration for economic risk is exclude from PTK SKKMigas No. 040/2011 as financial guideline for offshore 
platform decommissioning and API RP2A WSD as international recommended practice on how preliminary 
assessment for existing platform is conducted before decommissioning decision is taken. The determination of an 
acceptable level of economic risk is left to the operator’s discretion. This issue is suggested to be explored further in 
the future.

Abstract 
This paper deals with the maximization of the synergy within a carrier’s transportation network. This key 
concept of synergy is particularly important when participating in combinatorial auctions for the 
procurement in full-truckload transportation service. Our ideas derive from the advances achieved in the 
field of graph theory and are based on the technique of minimizing the distance between the booked and 
auctioneed lanes. We develop two optimization formulations that mainly differ in the objective function 
and that have been described by using an illustrative example that has taken from the literature and 
suitably adapted for the purpose of our application.

1. Introduction
Transportation is one of the major activities in supply chain management. It represents also an important share of the 
cost of most of the products or services. Reducing transportation costs means not only optimizing the vehicle routes 
but also trying to avoid the useless empty movements needed for repositioning. According to Eurostat data 2012 
almost 24% out of all the distance travelled for the freight transportation in Europe is performed by empty trucks. 
Moreover, the average load of the traveling trucks amounts to only 56% of their weight capacity (Palmer et al., 
2012). This paper has the objective of trying to avoid such inefficiency by employing some the advanced techniques 
achieved in the field of graph theory. More specifically, this study represents an attempt to adapt the optimization 
models of Ishihara and Kobayashi proposed in the context routing with interference constraints (Ishihara & 
Kobayashi, 2015) to the field of full-truck transportation networks.  The objective is to develop optimization 
formulations for the maximization of the synergy among the lanes to be served by a transportation company (or 
carrier). Such models may be considered as an extension of the recent work of Triki who proposes an optimization 
scheme for the synergy approximation in combinatorial auctions for the transportation procurement (Triki, 2016). In 
his paper, Triki has developed a mathematical approach based on the use of the minimax location approach typically 
employed for the facility planning. The resulting approach belongs, thus, to the approximation techniques since no 
exact models have been proposed for the synergy maximization. Besides the above mentioned work, we are aware 
of one other single paper that takes explicitly the synergy into account in order to define bidding strategies in 
combinatorial auctions. An et al. proposed, indeed in (An et al., 2005), a mathematical expression that incorporates 
the pairwise synergy between each pair of loads in order to estimate the value of the bundles. This paper represents 
an attempt to feel this gap by suggesting two integer formulations that allow the exact solution of the problem under 
exam. 
We suppose here that the carrier has already a set of committed (or booked) lanes L0 that the transportation company 
is obligated to serve on the bases of previous shipping contracts. On the basis of the underlying transportation 
network, the carrier has already defined a set of trucks paths that cover all the booked lanes. Consequently, we 
denote such k trucks paths as (s1, t1), (s2, t2), …, (sk, tk) where si and ti represent the begin and end vertex of truck 
path i, respectively. Such paths i=1, …, k will inevitably include some empty movements that the trucks must cover

This model is similar to the previous one. The two models share most of the constraints and differ mainly in the 
definition of the objective function. In this model (8) attempts to minimize the flow along all the arcs of the network. 
However, the interference between any auctioneed lane e’ and booked lane e is weighted by the distance factor in 
order to involve as much as possible of the auctioneed lanes having a distance value dist(e, e’) ≤ D(e, e’). This will 
maximize the overall synergy within the carrier’s transportation network. As a consequence, the constraints related 
to the distance restrictions (5) introduced in the model (1)—(7) are not needed anymore here and have been, thus, 
omitted.  
 
It is worth noting that both the models can have as output the same auctioneed lane to be selected by two or more 
different truck paths because of its strong synergy with different booked arcs. In this case, it is necessary that the 
carrier makes a posteriori decision on which path fits better the selected lane. Moreover, he should also take into 
account the new clusters of (booked and auctioned) lanes in order to define the new trucks routes. 
 
 
3. Illustrative Example 
 
The network shown in Figure 2 is an example that has been adapted from Ishihara and Kobayashi (2015) for the 
purpose of our application. More specifically, the black paths represent the 8 pre-defined trucks routes with their 
corresponding origin and destination each. Some of the involved arcs in the paths belong to L0 and the others are 
empty movements for repositioning. It is to be noted that the original example does not specify any direction for the 
paths but that have been introduced here in order to adapt the network to suit our application. Moreover, the blue 
short arcs represent the set L of auctioneed lanes. The output of the IP formulations and the corresponding post-
processing procedure will result in a new set of trucks paths that include, possibly, all the auctioneed lanes that have 
strong synergy with the booked lanes. The oval red forms show some examples of booked and auctioneed lanes that 
are close enough to form a cluster with strong synergy. The models will suggest a new truck route that integrates 
them either on the basis of the revenue or the synergy maximization. However, it is the responsibility of the carrier 
to check a posteriori if the proposed detour is acceptable or should be modified. 
 
4. Conclusions 
This paper has dealt with the problem of maximizing the synergy within the transportation network of carrier that 
would like to minimize its empty movement through participating in combinatorial auctions. Two integer 
programming models have been proposed having two different objective functions. The first one maximizes the 
profits of the transportation company defined as the revenue minus the traveling costs. The second attempts to 
maximize the synergy within the carrier’s network minimizes by minimizing the lanes distances. The paper has 
shown the scope of the models through an illustrative example but did not include rigorous experimental results that 
are left for future investigation. Moreover, it would be interesting to integrate such models within a bid generation 
optimization approach in order to discover how the synergy maximization will affect the procedure of defining the 
carrier’s bids while participating in a combinatorial auction.

Abstract 
Service learning is widely becoming as a very important experiential practice in Higher Education 
Institutions (HEI) around the world. In part of Malaysian Higher Education Strategic Plan the growing 
popularity of service learning has been a response to create graduates who are holistic, entrepreneurial 
and balanced. In this context students must be prepared to become lifelong learners to gain the skills and 
knowledge required for our modern knowledge society. There has been many research conducted among 
undergraduates use service learning in traditional way. Not much study have shown to foster online 
learning environment in service learning. Due to lack of conceptual framework that can guide this 
implementation, this research aimed to develop a conceptual framework of service learning in online 
virtual learning environment. The presented conceptual framework for online educator could benefit all 
who are involved in supporting quality online education, in an effort to develop and impactful online 
practice that aligns with the corresponding educational needs, services, and resources.

1. Introduction
Service learning a form of experiential learning practices is very important in Higher Education Institution (HEI). 
According to Malaysia Education Blueprint (2015-2025), Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) has 
included service learning in one of the 10th shift statement to create graduates who are holistic, entrepreneurial and 
balanced. The pedagogy teaching tool is well underway in Malaysia HEI since MoHE encourage HEI to take 
advantage of service opportunities in order to apply or observe principles learned in the classroom outside in the 
community. The Centre for Co-curriculum Courses and Service Learning (CCSL, 2017), Universiti Teknologi 
Malaysia has come out with the initiative to implement the National Higher Education Strategic Plan beyond 2025. 
The overall planning of CCSL (2017) is to provide an experiential learning that provides students the opportunity to 
apply experiences gained in serving people in the local community to their understanding of material learned in the 
classroom. Therefore, the students are trained to develop their graduate attribute skills such as communication skills, 
thinking skills, scholarship, leadership & team working skills, adaptability, global citizen and enterprising skills 
(CCSL, 2017). 
Learning by doing facilitated through an effective experiential learning practice which is full of activities that have 
direct association to students graduate attribute skills. The concept of service learning can be traced back to Dewey’s

Abstract 
Under price uncertainty, the decision on how long a supply contract for a certain commodity should be, is 
an important question a decision maker has to address. The length of supply contract will affect both the 
financial aspect as well as the risks. This research will discuss about the selection of 3 (three) procurement 
strategies namely long-term procurement strategy, short-term procurement strategy, and mixed strategy by 
considering uncertainty factors such as commodity price, supplier delivery time and quality in which the 
three factors are considered to be uncertain. We compare the benefits, costs and risks associated with each 
strategy. We use the Monte Carlo Simulation method to represent the level of uncertainty of all variables. 
Cost-Benefit Analysis is used to calculate the economic aspects while the procurement supply risk analysis 
is used to determine the risk associated with each strategy. The results show that the mixed strategy of 24-
month and 6-month outperformed other strategies.

1. Introduction
With the uncertainty in commodity prices, an important question to address is whether a company will sign a
supply contract for a longer term or for a shorter term. Each could be associated with financial as well as risk 
consequences. Long-term procurement with a single supplier has several advantages, for example, if a pure decision 
is made due to cost considerations, working with one supplier may be more preferable as it can minimize costs arising 
from uncertainty and suppliers have the potential to provide cheaper prices because the sale is assured (Peleg et al., 
2002). With long-term contracts, the average price may be lower than the short-term contract, and is more stable but 
less flexible (Inderfurth & Kelle, 2011). Several studies have discussed the procurement strategy. Peleg et al. (2002) 
compares the use of short-term procurement in the form of strategic partnerships, short-term procurement in the form 
of online search and combined both. Kleindorfer & Wu (2003) studied channel coordination by integrating long-term 
contracting and short-term contracting within the Business-to-Business (B2B) framework in solid industries capital 
(capital-intensive industries). 
The choice of procurement strategy that will be used by companies other than determined by commodity type is 
also determined by several variables. Peleg et al. (2002) stated that generally procurement decisions are influenced by 
several things such as delivery time, price and quality. In the case of procurement of commodities with large quantities 
(volume or tonnage), sea transportation is the most appropriate mode of transportation given the ability to transport 
large quantities of goods / commodities on a single trip, for example coal, raw materials, fertilizers and other goods in 
bulk form. With regard to the use of sea transport in this delivery, there is certainly a lot of uncertainty that can be a 
risk for both the seller and the buyer. For example, port congestion density and sea-weather changes may result in 
delays in delivery of goods to the destination of the buyer. This is a risk for the buyer that the possibility of shortage 
of inventory which can lead to decreased of production levels or even the termination of factory activity due to the 
absence of raw materials.

cost of procurement administration is influenced by the frequency of ordering and total consumption of coal per year, 
where the higher the frequency of ordering the higher the cost. 
From the calculation of Net Present Value (NPV), we obtained that the highest value is in the long-term 
procurement strategy of 12 months (LT-12) of Rp. 2,021,206.74. This means that if only considering benefits and 
costs, the 12-month long-term procurement strategy (LT-12) is the best strategy to apply in this case study, in 
accordance with predetermined limits and assumptions. 
 
5.2   Risk Analysis 
Based on the results of data processing and calculation, the highest risk factor (R) in the procurement process is 
Operational Risk on the internal risk aspect of the risk level 4 and is at medium risk level, while other risk factors are 
at low risk level. Overall, the highest level of probability / likelihood risk was on a 4-month short-term procurement 
strategy (ST-4) of 1.63 and the impact of risk (severity / consequences) was on long-term procurement strategy 36 
month (LT-36). Based on the value of the risk level, the mixed 24 and 3-month mix strategy becomes the strategy 
with the lowest risk value with value 1.15 and is at low risk level. This means that if we only consider the coal supply 
procurement risk analysis, a mixed 24 and 3 month mix strategy is the best strategy to apply in this case, in accordance 
with predetermined limits and assumptions. 
 
5.3  Aggregation of CBA and Risk Analysis scores 
This study aims to determine the best combination of procurement strategies by considering the cost and benefit 
analysis aspects as well as the procurement supply risk analysis. For this purpose, the aggregation calculation of the 
values resulting from the two analyzes is obtained so that the best procurement strategy is a 24 month long and 6 
month short-term mixed-term procurement strategy (MT-24/6) with the final value of 1.60 which is the highest value 
compared to other procurement strategies. The decision is possible because the strategy has a value of Net Present 
Value (NPV), which tends to be high, which is Rp. 1,752,136.96 and the low risk level value that is 1.50. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper we evaluate three strategies with respect to procurement contract periods for coal. Evaluation was 
based on both financial performance and risks. The Monte Carlo simulation was used to obtain the performance of 
each alternative strategy and the Cost-Benefit analysis was applied to make comparisons. The procurement lead time 
and the coal quality was taken into account in the model. The results suggest that 12-month contract period provides 
the lowest in terms of the total costs, but not necessarily the best in terms of the risks. The mixed strategy combining 
the portion of supply volume with 24-month contract and the rest is covered by a shorter term (6-month contract) is 
proven the best from risk point of view. This mixed strategy also outperformed both other strategies when we evaluate 
the alternative strategies based on both financial aspect as well as risks. The results are sensible. As the uncertainty 
arises in the price of commodities, putting long-term contract could be harmful for both sides. On the other side, too 
short contract period is costly since the company has to process too many procurement contracts. The exact 
combination, however, may vary from case to case. A more comprehensive experiments may be needed to obtain a 
recommended range under wider situations.

Abstract 
Deterioration prone or wear components identification and technical analysis of functional loss 
characteristics entail a detailed analysis of the failure characteristics of components through the 
understanding of their failure modes and the technical characteristics of their failure patterns. 
Maintenance actions are then prescribed to prevent functional failures or to proactively repair the 
components in a bid to prevent failure(s) in the operational field. The determination of ensuing 
maintenance actions focusses on those actions that are vital to monitor and eradicate unreliable conditions 
on the components under consideration. Deterioration prone machinery components afford maintenance 
practitioners with the openings to improve physical assets reliability, and this study was embarked on to 
explore reliability amelioration prospects that are availed through identified components deterioration.

1. Introduction
Installations such as petrochemical plants have physical assets that are multifaceted and operate under arduous 
circumstances, and their deterioration over time is imminent, and this is brought about due to age, wearing, 
corrosion/erosion, fatigue and other factors (Hameed and Khan, 2014: 18). There are many asset reliability 
improvement opportunities that can be capitalized on the deterioration prone or wear components of physical assets

Forced/Accelerated deterioration – caused by human factors and occurs over a much shorter period. Forced 
relates to assets abuse or operating the asset harshly like over-speeding. Accelerated relates to neglect or doing 
nothing like not lubricating the rotating components. 
 
Out of the total failures, further stratification of the failure data yielded that 83% of recorded failures were attributed 
to natural deterioration, whilst 17% was considered as forced/accelerated deterioration.  Forced/accelerated 
deterioration was mostly attributed to lubrication starvation, dirt accumulation on equipment, and incorrect 
dimensional fits. This resulted in a project to review all preventative maintenance (PM) schedules for all assets that 
were analyzed and to make sure that appropriate maintenance tasks such as routine lubrication were being carried 
out as per the scheduled PM.   
 
PM schedules review was carried out on 92% of physical assets that were under study, and 8% of the physical assets 
underwent modifications related to structural make-up, dimensional changes, design changes, material strengthening 
and lubricant specifications changes. 
 
The maintenance actions taken in response to components deterioration witnessed a downward trend in monthly 
downtime hours from an average of about 30 hours per month down to around 16 hours monthly.  This was a drastic 
47% drop in total plant downtime due to the targeted maintenance actions that were taken to lessen the impact of 
equipment failures due to deterioration. 
 
  
5. Conclusion  
 
The key to improving physical assets reliability in any industrial set up is firstly, undertaking an analysis of the key 
drivers of equipment unreliability. The dominant failure modes need to be unveiled and further stratified in order to 
reveal the underlying causes of functional failures of the physical assets. The case study that was undertaken 
illustrated that without accurate data analysis, it is highly possible for a business to focus its resources on 
nonexistent or insignificant issues that do not address the inherent reliability issues that are relevant during that time. 
The data analysis showed that components deterioration was the major contributor to equipment failures within the 
processing plant, and it was prudent to develop reliability improvement strategic models that aimed at eradicating or 
diminishing the impact of deterioration on the components of physical assets. 
 
Deterioration is inevitable in physical assets components, whether they rotate, slide or are stationary during their 
operational status, because one way or another, the agents that cause deterioration will attack them. Unless the 
physical assets operate in a vacuum, that is the only scenario that maybe have them spared from deterioration. 
Different types of deterioration were examined during this research, and prominently corrosion and erosion types of 
deterioration were reviewed, with techniques of counteracting their progression discussed as well. More research 
need to be undertaken in developing scientific models to counteract deterioration in the industrial setup.

Abstract 
Criticality optimization for physical assets maintenance is meant to warrant high plant reliability for the 
processing plant. This is a vivacious trait that a bulk of industrial establishments discount and calamitous 
effects are typically encountered such as lessened reliability of installed equipment owing to wrong 
maintenance priorities. Equipment criticality ranking constructed on diverse impacts of equipment 
failure(s) on the businesses need to be carried out so that the businesses do not take a blanket approach to 
applying the same maintenance strategies and allocating resources unrestrained on all processing physical 
assets. Maintenance resources allocations need to be apportioned and prioritized as per equipment 
criticality ranking, and the various facets to consider encompass safety, environment, operations, 
financial, customer service and quality focused elements, and this is vital for securing cost-effectiveness 
in maintenance and high reliability in physical assets. Derivation of the processing plant’s physical assets 
spares is consequential to assets criticality analysis and the related parts are managed according to their 
impacts on the businesses according to the laid-down criteria. This research was carried out to establish 
the priorities that businesses take at physical asset maintenance level to warrant equipment reliability.

5. Conclusion
The results of the case study shows that though there are variants of physical assets criticality optimization models 
that various businesses can apply, it is feasible to apply a specific model that can give consistent results when a 
systematic approach has been undertaken. Even though the use of the numerical decision-making techniques had 
some limitations in the absence of the likes of fuzzy based AHP decision making systems, it was shown that the key 
aim of every asset criticality optimization model is to cost-effectively maintain physical assets to upsurge their 
reliability in an economically optimum manner.  
The criticality optimization model, whichever is selected, for instance, TAHPP, should ultimately create a priority 
hierarchy of assets constructed on specific applicable criteria. The quality of input data is crucial to prevent 
ambiguity of the decision process, and this is key to the ensuing processes as maintenance resources can be 
eventually wasted on non-critical assets as a result. The consequence or impact of equipment failures is a critical 
aspect that always needs to be considered during the criticality optimization process, and aspects such as impact on 
maintenance and operational costs, impact on health, safety and environment are paramount. 
At the end of the day, the criticality optimization model computes the significance of physical assets according to 
assigned criteria weights, and the resultant priority rankings are utilized to formulate asset care strategies for 
physical assets to mitigate the overall impact on the business as a whole. The overall business impact or 
performance is ameliorated when the physical assets attain high reliability in the operational environment, thus 
heightening assets availability for operational viability.

Abstract 
The environments in which the various industrial equipment operate in mostly limit the operational life of 
the equipment. The operational environment ranges from hot, cold, corrosive, non-corrosive, strong 
forces, etc. and no universal material selection is ideal for all operating conditions. A lot of effort needs to 
be put into the material selections and designs of industrial equipment in order to withstand the relevant 
operating environment. Physical assets reliability is highly affected by the operating conditions and the 
applicable maintenance actions need to be deployed to prevent catastrophic equipment failures. The 
magnitude of failures is also sometimes heavily determined by the operational conditions and the 
maintenance actions that are taken to counteract the impact of failures are vital considerations for the 
physical assets reliability. The study is an exploration of reliability aspects pertaining to physical assets in 
the various operating environments.

Environment, maintenance actions, material-selections, corrosion-erosion 
1. The operational environment and equipment
The field of reliability engineering considers that machine part failures are broadly categorized in three segments, 
and these comprise of infant mortality; stochastic and wear- out failures (Hall and Strutt 2003:233). This gives birth 
to reliability modelling that takes cognizance of uncertainty concomitant with stochastic variabilities of the 
functional effects and strains (Hall and Strutt, 2003:234). A corrosive environment degrade ferrous mechanisms and 
this is propagated by salts, chlorides, acids and hydrogen among other corrosive agents, while aluminum is prone to 
corrosion due to salts and alkalis, and rubber materials are affected by hydraulic-oils and ozone  (Pakale and 
Tuljapure, 2015:413). Different equipment operate in varying conditions and this poses maintenance challenges for 
practitioners, for instance offshore wind turbines are located in deep water and harsher conditions compared to 
onshore wind farms, and therefore the maintenance strategies definitely differ in such instances (Sørensen 
2009:493). The performance of the likes of wind-turbines is dependent on a multitude of uncertainties which 
embody the operating environments, constructional material features and environmental settings (Sørensen, 
2009:495). The maintenance considerations for such physical assets such as wind-turbines take cognizance of such 
uncertainties into attention, as they will intensely impact on the futuristic performance of the assets (Sørensen,

Figure 8. Geared motor assembly that replaced rubber 
coupling  between motor and gearbox (Muganyi 2017) 
The criteria applied for selecting the physical assets should always consider the type of application, technical factors 
like torque or misalignment and stiffness, service factors, costs, and most importantly, environmental factors. Each 
criterion must be individually assessed to ensure that the physical asset is suitable for the application and  does not 
result in premature failures, and this process of evaluation must be repeated for any change in conditions throughout 
the application’s lifecycle. 
Any system’s maintenance necessities and tasks are commonly a function of the particular application, duty cycles, 
operating parameters, environment and other factors. Any maintenance or service plan for the system as a whole is 
envisioned to evade equipment failures wherever within the system, and it is affected if other system parts’ 
functional features force them to operate external to the design specifications. Thus a maintenance system need to 
ascertain among other aspects that environmental conditions are always met by the physical asset and that all system 
components fall within the environmental design constraints in order to uphold the asset reliability. In the event of 
an asset’s functional failure, it is imperative to determine and document the conditions within the system in which 
the failure occurred and this allows for appropriate corrective action, including specification of a different physical 
asset to address any changes in the application. 
6. Conclusion 
All physical assets ought to match their intended purpose and application parameters, including several diverse 
performance, environmental, application and service factors. All must be met for the physical asset to operate 
reliably and properly. When selected with these design parameters in consideration , and when installed and 
operated correctly, a physical asset should have no reliability issues over its lifetime, but when one of the factors like 
environmental factors are not met, then the asset can prematurely fail, resulting in reduced asset reliability and high 
maintenance /operational costs incurred by the firm. The two primary environmental issues that cause physical 
assets failures are temperature-related (above or below the rated temperature of the asset), or chemical-related 
(where the asset is not compatible with a chemical present within or around it). Over temperature conditions can 
manifest as heat stress cracks on the material, whilst chemical attacks generally make the asset swiftly deteriorate 
and fail, sometimes breaking-off in pieces. Therefore compatibility of assets with environmental factors is a crucial 
aspect when it comes to ensuring reliability.

Abstract 
In many instances, maintenance engineers arrive at a point where the maintenance decision calls for the 
redesign of the physical asset in order to address the reliability issues encountered during the course of 
operating and maintaining the asset. One of the most effective and broadly applied techniques is Design-
Out Maintenance (DOM) and many researchers in Maintenance Management have alluded to this 
technique as highly effective and widely applied in the field of asset maintenance. The drivers for 
physical assets modifications are diverse and situational as various factors are considered when it comes 
to such endeavour, and the cost of the modification or re-design being one of them. A systematic 
approach to this engineering phenomenon is imperative to give guidance and credence to this noble 
approach, followed by evaluation techniques for the effectiveness of the exercise. This study pursued an 
industrial set-up analysis to examine the pros and cons of the DOM technique.

1. The triggers for design-out maintenance
There exists in the world of asset maintenance a practice that is referred to as “Improvement Maintenance” whose 
chief objectivity is to curtail recurrent asset failures, through application of  comprehensive investigations and the 
unravelling of  failure causes and then prescribing sustainable counter measures to prevent repetition of failures 
(Danish and Siddiqui, (2016:5). The resultant counter measures may possibly necessitate considerable design 
changes to an asset with the aim to eliminate the prevailing failure patterns; and design-out maintenance is the 
maintenance strategy that is used in cases where it is obvious that the existing design is not capable of withstanding 
or muddle through the expected reliability standards (Danish and Siddiqui, 2016:5). A life-time-extension tactic can 
also be deployed as asset care engineers assess options to elongate equipment life by subjecting it to modifications 
to its structure, materials of construction or augmentations by applying the likes of protective layering (Danish and 
Siddiqui, 2016:5). Failures riddance is a crucial aspect of Improvement Maintenance, and all functional failures 
should be regarded as prospects for reliability amelioration with sustaining actions modelled relative to the failure 
cause findings.  Considering the maintenance approaches available to asset intensive industries, three dominant 
strategies stand out, and these are life improvement, proactive and reactive maintenance strategies, whereby the life

5. Discussion of design-out maintenance implementation results
After implementation of the recommended solutions as stated in the sections above, the performance derived 
from the pulp chest agitator with regards to the static gland packing seals was as follows: 
❖
The gland packing seal leakages were experienced after 8 weeks compared to 1 week previously
❖
The cost of product loss and maintenance time was reduced by over 80%
❖
The design-out maintenance strategy that was applied to solve the problem of high frequency of failure
of the agitators’ gland packings was effective in improving the MTBF (1 week to 8 weeks) and
therefore improving reliability.
This research revealed that design-out maintenance does embrace different techniques and technologies 
to attain the desired results, and the broad types of design out maintenance can involve, among other 
aspects such as structural design changes, material of construction changes, dimensional changes, 
environmental change, technological changes, coating changes and throughput performance changes. 
6. Conclusion
Design-out maintenance strategy is still being applied by many industrial establishments and it is 
effective in improving equipment reliability when it is applied correctly. The case study results have 
shown that for deriving design-out maintenance benefits, firstly a structured methodology for 
3415","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

understanding the root cause of failures is imperative before embarking on a design-out exercise. 
Secondly, the alternative solutions options need to be assessed and an optimum solution need to be 
reached on based on a systematic selection criteria. This will prevent a repeat of the same exercise on a 
solution that has already been implemented. Thirdly, the design-out maintenance strategic 
implementation results need to be measured and compared against the established project objectives and 
the results should be used as learnings for future projects or endeavors. 
Future research efforts should focus on the relevance and the wide systematic application of design-out maintenance 
as an effective reliability improvement intervention.

Abstract 
Dairy market in Indonesia has good demand trends. However, the domestic supply is still below the 
consumption level. Thus, this country used to import dairy product rather than use the domestic one. On 
the other hand, dairy supply chain has its own uncertainty both in upstream and downstream process due 
to the durability of raw materials, such as tropical climate, unpredictable seasons, and lack of cold 
storage. It raises challenges for overland transportation. Selecting right supplier is one of the upstream 
area which affected the quality of dairy product and mitigate the supply chain risks. This study aims to 
develop a framework for supplier selection process. It determined main criteria through interview, pair 
wise comparison using AHP method, then deployed into some sub-criterias based, then been ranked. The 
result is a supplier selection assessment based on local company requirements. It can be concluded that 
the main criteria for supplier selection are quality, quantity, delivery, warranty, and pricing with sub main 
criteria which already deployed. The output could help most of the Indonesia dairy industries, which 
mostly small to medium scale, to achieve competitive advantages by solving one of the critical stages.

1. Research Background
Food supply chain, in which dairy is included, has its own characteristics of product because of the natural attributes 
that has a big impact on customer’s health. It also has its own uncertainty both in upstream and downstream process 
(Aung, 2014) [1], (Pedrso, 2016) [2]. In the upstream, there are some uncertainty of supply due to some reasons. Chen 
et.al. (2013) [3] argued that the uncertainty of supply is caused by the difference of product quality on each supplier 
and different pricing due to currency. Based on Pujawan (2010) [4], the uncertainty of supply due to some reason, 
such as the seasonal of raw material, the capacity of supplier, delivery lead time by supplier and the quantity of 
available material. On the other hand, the downstream has several problems that affect the uncertainty of food 
supply chain. Dani (2015) [5] argued that food industry deals with uncertainties due to the durability of food product. 
The life time of food product is limited by period of time [5]. The uncertainty of customer demand and the capacity 
of warehouse also becoming one of this problem [4]. Currently, product safety and health becoming consumer 
awareness (Pant, 2015) [6]. For this industry, if a company can survive and dealing with these situations, it will give 
them competitive advantages.  
Indonesia’s dairy market have a good trend, because its supply is still below the consumption level. According to 
Global Business Guide Indonesia (2015) [7], the domestic stock fulfill less than a fifth of national demand per year 
by the end of 2015. A research, which had been done by Ministry of Industry, showed that the demand of dairy

5. Conclusions
Regarding to the result of this study, it can be concluded : 
1.
Selecting the right supplier is a critical role in the beginning process of supply chain management.
2.
The main criterias for supplier selection are quality, delivery, quantity, pricing, and warranty. In addition,
the sub criterias are deployed from main criterias based on company requirement.
3.
Warranty criteria only used in some conditional situation due to company terms and policies.
4.
The sensitivity analysis is performed to describe the effect of changing weights in main criteria. All of the
sensitivity analysis of supplier selection are stay robust.

Abstract (12 font) 
Supply chains, especially global supply chains, can be complex and include multiple partners. Owing to 
the diversity between supply chains, the risks applicable to each may differ. Not enough research has been 
conducted on businesses using an inter-disciplinary approach when attempting risk management. 
Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to explore how the combination of financial and 
operational risk management methods can be used to assist Carbocraft in mitigating the risks identified 
and associated with the import of freeze-dried fruit from Germany to their customers in Durban, Cape 
Town and Johannesburg. Risks were listed and discussed whilst mitigation strategies were suggested. 
Risk supply chain mitigations, Freeze dried fruit, Carbocraft, Mitigation strategies 
Introduction 
Carbocraft is an importer of raw food ingredients, based in Johannesburg, South Africa. The company was 
founded in 2010 and has since grown to 11 employees. The study was conducted at Carbocraft, primarily 
focusing on the supply chain risks related to importation of freeze-dried fruits into South Africa. The freeze-
dried (FD) fruit is sourced by Carbocraft from Paradise Fruit, a company based in Germany. Paradise Fruit is 
a company that has emerged as an industry leader in the field of freeze-drying 
(Paradise 
Fruits, 
2014). 
Paradise Fruits define their freeze-drying process as: 
Freeze-drying is a process where frozen raw materials are placed in a refrigerated vacuum and ice 
crystals in the product are sublimated into water vapour, while the cell structure of the original 
product remains. 
Carbocraft places purchase orders with Paradise Fruit, for shipping in a food-grade container, from Germany to 
South Africa. The freeze-dried fruit is non-perishable, sealed in thick plastic bags that are packed in cartons, then 
palletized. This product can have a production lead-time of 1-3 weeks, as the products are produced according to 
orders received. Freeze-dried fruit generally has a shelf-life of a year, sometimes a year and a half, thus limiting the 
inventory the supplier is able to keep available. Shipping from Germany to South Africa takes approximately four 
weeks. Following which the total lead-time for this product is 4-6 weeks. The shipment is then cleared through 
customs and delivered to Carbocraft’s outsourced warehouses. All shipments from Paradise Fruit are handled ex-
works by outsourced freight forwarders. However, the process is not without risks. 
The ultimate purpose of risk identification and analysis is to prepare for risk mitigation. This study will review the 
supply chain, identify and define risks within it and then explore the different methods available for avoiding and 
possibly counter-acting these risks. In order to identify risks, a definition for ‘risk’ must be established. Cause and 
effect over time allows risk to be defined as “the probability of occurrence of disruptive events” Heckmann, et al. 
(2015). 
The definition of risk has endured many modifications and as such the expansion of risk management and 
development of continuous improvement strategies remains necessary (Gilaninia, et al., 2013). Risk is the effect of 
uncertainty on objectives, whether positive or negative (ISO Guide 73, 2009). 
As imports and exports increase throughout the globe, supply chains are growing more complex and involve more 
agents, multiple materials-handling points, multiple money movements and information movements throughout the 
process. Owing to the increase in complexity, supply chains have become more volatile as they are exposed to more

strategies needed to resolve or manage the risks identified. Implementing some of the strategies mentioned above 
should ensure a smooth flow of freeze-dried fruit from Germany to South Africa, while ensuring continuous 
customer satisfaction. This study is limited as it cannot measure the exact impact of the risks on the supply chain. 
 
Further studies could be conducted on the successfulness of implementing the suggested strategies in this supply 
chain. A detailed supply chain analysis could be prepared and compared to internationally recognized supply chain 
best practices for supply chain solutions that cover a broader base than just risks.

Abstract 
Research on Humanitarian logistics and Supply chain management has not been very comprehensive. It is 
still growing and one can note a few gaps. It has mainly dwelt upon adapting pointers that can be noted in 
private/commercial sector logistics and figuring out how they can be in cooperated into Humanitarian 
supply chains. This was an exploitative research aiming to compare lessons learnt from within.

1. Introduction
Sub Saharan Africa has the largest figures of victims both on and off Anti-retroviral therapy.
Zimbabwe and a South Africa are both in the top 3 in the World. The greatest access to therapy 
is also in this region and both South Africa and Zimbabwe has been constantly trying to 
improve its delivery. More than 61% of adults are enrolled on the program (UNIAIDS,2016). 
In 2010 more than a tenth of all people worldwide on therapy were Zimbabweans and South 
Africans. This goes to show how tremendous the efforts they are making are. Expects calculate 
that about 9000 Zimbabweans are enrolled on the therapy every month and the figures are 
projected to increase. For youngsters aged between 0-14, access to the much needed therapy 
becomes higher and it sits above 80% (UNIADS) as testing has been made compulsory for 
pregnant mothers and children. With such great figures one might be shocked to learn that they 
are still much in very short supply and then, they might realise how big the fight is, it has been 
so and will remain so unless something drastic is done. This is very worrying especially when 
one realises that victims need to commit to the drug for life and it supply needs to be stable 
and reliable. (Noguera et al 2003).  
Existing literature relevant to the study 
Research on Humanitarian logistics and Supply chain management has not been very 
comprehensive. It is still growing and one can note a few gaps. It has mainly dwelt upon 
adapting pointers that can be noted in private/commercial sector logistics and figuring out how 
they can be incooperated into Humanitarian supply chains. A number of researchers have 
published in this line of work, including Tomasini and Van Wassenhove (2005; 2006). Some 
even focus on how a multinational organisation can actually perform some logistics during 
relief operations assisting large non-governmental organisations. Mbohwa 2008, Discusses the 
operations of large NGOs in Zimbabwe, these include the world food programme, Red Cross

example of politicised humanitarian action. Although food distributions have resumed in some 
locations following the government’s ban on NGO activity during the elections in 2008, 
patients at MSF clinics tell us that distributions are manipulated for political purposes. In 
Epworth clinic, MSF patients were unable to get food aid for over six months after the June 
election, leading HIV/AIDS patients to default from treatment as they searched for food. 
Political and aid actors including the UN and donors need to shift their approach and strategy 
if they are to address the humanitarian issues facing Zimbabwe effectively and efficiently. 
Increased humanitarian aid is necessary, but so too is a move to a more proactive emergency 
approach based on a recognition of the severity of the crisis in all its forms. Donor governments 
and UN agencies must ensure that the provision of humanitarian aid remains distinct from 
political processes. Their policies towards Zimbabwe must not be implemented at the expense 
of the humanitarian imperative to ensure that Zimbabweans have unhindered access to the 
assistance they need to survive.

Abstract 
Disasters are often unpredictable and uncertain, most governments struggle to assist victims of disaster 
mainly due lack of capital and sponsors. Although one cannot be really certain, natural disasters like floods 
and hurricanes are unpredictable but can be prepared for. This is crucial for efficient response. Which 
generally means emergency planning is never enough, therefore South Africa needs a framework detailing 
how the humanitarian logistics will be used to prepare and prevent natural disasters like floods. Relief 
agencies have to put their focus on the models developed for immediate response, which involves items 
like medication and capacities (rescue teams and rescue equipment).

1. Introduction
Disasters are often unpredictable and uncertain, most governments struggle to assist victims of 
disaster mainly due lack of capital and sponsors. Although one cannot be really certain, natural 
disasters like floods and hurricanes are unpredictable but can be prepared for. This is crucial for 
efficient response. Which generally means emergency planning is never enough, therefore South 
Africa needs a framework detailing how the humanitarian logistics will be used to prepare and 
prevent natural disasters like floods. Relief agencies have to put their focus on the models 
developed for immediate response, which involves items like medication and capacities (rescue 
teams and rescue equipment). Emergency response involves demand and supply aspects 
Recent years the natural disasters have ( 2016 floods and 2015 drought in South Africa) captured 
international attention and advance research of natural disaster management have been conducted 
and response of emergency relief agencies have been effective and efficient. Before the end of 
2015 South Africa had rainfall problems, Southern Africa experienced  drought that crippled the 
agricultural sector, with production shortfall of maize around 9.3 million tons and South Africa 
alone had to import 8 million tons of maize to feed disadvantaged people. RIASCO action plan 
targeted 13.8 million people for emergency food assistance. Thousands of children required 
treatment for malnutrition. 
 
 
  39% of population had inadequate sanitation 
facilities, the drought exacerbated these already fragile situations. Disease outbreak increased due 
to people being forced to drink unprotected water

6. Humanitarian coverage interventions must be geographical, with the range of basic 
services. 
 
Opportunities 
 
  
There were three gaps found:  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
(i) preparedness as relief response: people around the world are affected by droughts and 
floods and not all of them get help. The government, agencies and international sponsors 
invest too much money in strengthening the defense response and in floods alarming 
systems. Half of the money that get spent on the systems should be used at the local level 
for ensuring that people get goods during floods and get proper equipment to prepare for 
such disaster.                                                                                                                                          (ii) 
Response: it is always necessary for government to respond on medium sized floods, floods 
that can cripple the economy for shorter time. Normally international agencies and donors 
are unlikely to be available when responding to a medium sized floods, and the local 
solutions become inadequate, because normally the local supply chain will be disrupted 
and emergency relief will require coordinated effort involving local government, producers 
of basic products and NGO`s. 
 
                                                                                                 
(iii) Economic recovery: small businesses that are affected by floods do not get any 
incentives from the government, which makes it hard for the businesses to recover and any 
economy without small businesses suffers.  
 
Proposed solutions for disaster response 
 
 Ensuring the distributing of materials to micro retailers not to be disrupted 
 Engaging micro-retailers as flood relief response (collaboration government etc)  
 ALL unnecessary waste should be eliminated from the process 
 Where possible ship bulk unassembled and unpackaged relief items to more local locations 
for final assembly or packaging closer to the victims 
 Increase flexibility and agility of the supply chain such that they can be quick enough to 
react to the ever changing uncertainty of the humanitarian supply chain.  
 
Conclusions 
 
South African Emergency Services did not cope or did not managed to cover every area that has 
been affected, therefore, the paper added logistical decisions that can be used to tackle the response 
disaster: supply management, Resource management and demand management. The paper touches 
the drought impact from humanitarian view, and the recommendations that SADC region can use 
for the future when dealing with such events. We also address the water crisis in South Africa, and 
WASH organization (Water, Sanitation and hygiene). SADC leaders implemented new 
interventions.  
 
The papers found Gaps in the solutions of emergency relief phases, preparedness, response and 
recovery. With our efforts we came up with proposed solutions that can work for South Africa. 
Generally, the paper concludes that there is more attention for logistics emergency planning for

flood disaster prevention, but more can be done if South Africa can receive funding from 
international donors. The issue of drought, floods and water crisis can cripple the economy and 
the people that is how serious the matter is. Local people should be given proper equipment to 
prepare and protect their homes and businesses from flood disaster.

Abstract 
Many Foreign nationals were victims of mob violence and those who owned properties had their property, including 
shops looted and burned down, while they and their respective family members were badly wounded, killed or chased 
away from their homes. In May 2008 more than 70 people died because of it, and the displacement of 35,000 people 
was witnessed. The ultimate aims of this research paper was to review the work done during and after xenophobic 
attacks in South Africa, to identify factors that contributed to the xenophobic attacks, to identifying how the 
government NGO donor organizations and international community dealt with the situation and what measures they 
put in place to prevent such brutal behavior and actions of xenophobic attacks from happening again and to Identify 
the logistics work done to alleviate the pain and suffering of the victims

1. Introduction
Very few cases of xenophobia have been recorded around the world. Xenophobia and the 
associated disasters got a little bit of attention when it occurred in South Africa mainly in 2008. 
Several incidences have since reoccurred and there is always growing fears that another attach or 
attacks might be looming.  It has been described as any kind of fear related to an individual or 
group perceived as different from the person that has the phobia. It has led to disasters that have 
resulted in extensive damage to property, businesses lives and livelihoods.  
Many Foreign nationals were victims of mob violence and those who owned shops had their 
shops looted and burned down, while their respective family members were badly wounded, 
killed or chased away from their homes. In May 2008 more than 70 people died because of it, 
and the displacement of 35,000 people was witnessed. 
Two main patterns of the xenophobic culture were identified in 2008 by the Human Sciences 
Research Council, the first pattern is that the violence was not against foreigners in general but at 
other African nationals. The second pattern that they identified was that the violence largely took 
place in the urban informal settlements of major cities in South Africa

Abstract 
Safety is an important issue in the rapid industrialization especially in chemical industries. The objective 
of this study is to investigate relationship between safety climate factors and safety performance in 
chemical industries and proposes a new framework. This study uses safety management, work pressure, 
safety competence, safety procedures, safety communication and safety supervision as independent 
variables that explain the relationship towards safety performance in chemical industry at Pasir Gudang, 
Johor. A survey instrument was developed, and 220 responses were collected. Factor analysis and 
multiple linear regression was used to analyze the data collected using SPSS software. As a result, safety 
climate factors (safety management and work pressure, safety competence, safety communication and 
safety procedures) were able to explain 47.2% of variation safety performance. Nonetheless, it was found 
that reflections of safety climate factors on safety performance could not be similar with each industry, 
since findings would fluctuate due to geographical context and individual context. Despite the limitations, 
this study contributes to the literature by revealing table factor structures, where appropriate level of 
reliability and validity measures of safety climate factors and safety performance scales were developed.

1. Introduction
Industrial accidents are considered as a major social challenge. According to International Labor 
Organization (ILO), it was reported that approximately 360 million fatal and 337 million non-fatal work-related 
accidents occur worldwide every year which holds the estimated cost of US $5 Billion worldwide (Hon, Chan, & 
Yam, 2014). The recent rapid industrialization, occupational safety is being a severe issue that shall be considered in 
all industrial and human activities. Unawareness and improper safety management could indirectly report the 
phenomenon of industrial accidents. Thus, a well-established method is required to evaluate the link between 
existing organizational characteristics and safety at work including risk for accidents. 
Historically, in the industrial sector, the accident reduction approach has focused on examining “lagging” 
data or commonly known as past events, such as lost-time accident rates and incident rates (Rhona Flin, 2007). 
Based on lagging data, the injury or fatality needed to occur before the company took action to eliminate or reduce 
exposure to the hazard. Therefore, reporting was after an incident rather than a proactive attempt to prevent injury. 
However, these Traditional methods of improving safety within industry focused primarily on accident 
investigations to determine specific causes has been recommended for changes in the future by adopting an 
approach to prevent injuries and fatalities by focusing on predictive measures to monitor safety culture (R Flin, 
Mearns, O’Connor, & Bryden, 2000). Current safety management and injury prevention study suggests human 
behavior may have a greater role in preventing injuries or fatalities than was first suspected. Safety climate factors 
derive an approach to relate human behavior with accident preventions

Kvalheim and Dahl (2016) indicated that negligence of perceived procedure in offshore service vessel 
industry to be negatively related to safety compliance. Furthermore, Antonsen (2009) also have suggested that 
simplicity of procedures are significant success criteria for high compliance. Furthermore, the finding of safety 
communication also were found to be similar with some of the previous studies by Sampson, Dearmond, and Chen 
(2008) where they highlighted that  improved communication between line workers and supervisors will results in 
decreasing minor accidents and increasing in personal protective equipment (PPE) use.  
 
3.10 Impact on Industry 
It is strongly believed that reliable safety climate scale could provide proactive information about safety 
problems before they develop into accidents and injuries (Seo, Torabi, Blair, & Ellis, 2004). Although the finding 
that safety climate perceptions will not necessarily match actual levels of safety performance, M D Cooper and 
Phillips (2004) recommends that industry should focus its primary safety improvement effort on changing unsafe 
situations and conditions as well as people’s safety behaviour at all organizational levels, rather than concentrating 
on improving people’s attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about safety. Even though previous studies in various 
industries found that worker’s perceptions play major role in highlighting effectiveness of safety system in a firm, 
but there are always a need of physical changes within an organization (M D Cooper & Phillips, 2004).  
 
4. Conclusion and Future Work 
 
4.1 Conclusion 
The main purpose of this study was to identify safety climate factors and safety performance in chemical industries 
in Johor and has been established. The finding of this study which derived the safety climate factors of safety 
communication, safety procedures, safety competence, safety management and work pressure are found to be similar 
to previous studies in various industries. Safety management was renamed to explain the safety commitment and 
safety supervision factors. A newly reliable developed relationship was able to explain 47.2% of relationship 
between safety climate factors and safety performance which full fill the second objective of this study. Although, 
only 47.2% of safety climate factors were found to impact safety performance of chemical industries in Johor, which 
common findings in a social investigation, then reflections of safety climate factors on safety performance could not 
be similar with each industry as compared with other researchers finding. In addition, the findings would fluctuate 
due to geographical context and individual context. Furthermore, even though the only 47.2 % of derived safety 
climate factors explain the relationship with safety performance, it is found that all 26 individual constructs are 
found to be valid and consistent thorough model evaluation. Although, the findings of the study were able to achieve 
the objectives, there are plenty of gaps and limitations which need be considered for future work. 
 
4.2 Study Limitations 
The findings of this study must be interpreted based on the following limitations. The results of this study 
were dependent upon sincere and honest responses from participants and there are no complimentary actions. 
Moreover, demographic factors also play an important role in manipulating the relationship between safety climate 
factors and safety performance (Vinodkumar & Bhasi, 2009). Thus, in future, effects of demographic factors on 
safety performance also should analyse co-currently, and the respondent’s perceptions shall be analysed by 
demographic factors such as age, working experience, education and position in the particular firm.  
Despite these limitations, this study actually contributes to the literature revealing factor structures of safety 
climate, where appropriate level of reliability and validity measures of safety climate scale was developed. 
However, it is strongly recommended to do more exploration on the safety climate factors by increasing the number 
of independent variables and number of samples and also compare the findings with previous studies by revalidating 
the previous established safety survey instrument.  
 
4.3 Future Work 
There are few items and issues to be considered in order to improve and increase the final results. Since in 
this study, the area of study was just focused on chemical industries in Pasir Gudang. In future, it should be 
expanded to more chemical industries around Johor and also around Malaysia. Furthermore, a longitudinal study 
should be carried out for the collected survey data since in this study was only in cross sectional. Furthermore, safety 
performance based on the perceptions will need to be supported by collecting more objectives and quantitative data 
measuring actual safety performance such as accident rates, injury cases, fatal cases and near missed cases.  Other

than these, this study also can be expanded by developing a model to explain the relationship between safety climate 
factors and safety performance by using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) respectively.

Abstract 
Gravitational Water Vortex Power Plant (GWVPP) is one of the green technology that utilizes 
hydropower at low hydraulic head. Different from large-scale hydropower, GWVPP is a micro 
hydropower plant that harvest energy from water vortex formed in a cylindrical basin. It is advantageous 
due to its low hydraulic head requirement as well as positive impacts on both environments and social. 
Experimental approach was taken in this paper to study the effects of inlet flow rate and penstock’s 
geometry of GWVPP on performance of GWVPP. The outlet and basin diameter were fixed at 72mm and 
400mm respectively. Inlet flow rates were varied from 5.6m3/h to 8.8m3/h while three penstock model A 
to C have increasing feeding width but same model length while penstock D to F have same feeding 
width as penstock A but reducing model length. It was discovered that penstock B and C reduced the 
overall performance of GWVPP while the rest of the penstock have insignificant effects on GWVPP’s 
efficiency. Also, higher inlet flow rate was also discovered to generally increase the efficiency of 
GWVPP. Future works will involve changing the outlet’s diameter as well as elevating the penstock to 
study its effect on GWVPP’s performance.

1. Introduction
Hydropower has been one of the most preferred renewable energy resources along with solar and wind energy. This 
is because at least 71% of earth is covered by water surface. Besides that, it is also one of the cheapest energy source 
with zero carbon emission. According to Key World Energy Statistics (2017), the world hydro electricity production 
increased from 1,296 TWh to 3,978 TWh in year 1973 and 2015 respectively. Norway topped the list of domestic 
hydroelectricity production with 95.9%. (International Energy Agency, 2017) 
Hydropower can be divided into a few scales where large scale hydropower involved the construction of huge dam 
and smaller scale hydropower operates on the hydrostatic or kinetic energy available in the run-of-the-river stream 
or even wastewater network. Even though large-scale hydropower is able to produce electrical power up to 22,500 
megawatts (USGS Water Science School, n.d.), the negative impacts environmentally and socially is significant. 
Best alternative to avoid the negative impacts would be the development of hydropower at smaller scale. 
Gravitational Water Vortex Power Plant (GWVPP) fits the criteria as micro hydropower plant. 
Franz Zotloterer discovered and invented GWVPP back in year 2006 when he was looking for ways to aerate 
inactive streams. The discovery of GWVPP made a new milestone in hydrodynamic development because he 
managed to aerates inactive water so that oxygen saturation in the water increases energy free. Other than that, 
GWVPP also has very low hydraulic head requirements, causing it to increase attention from researchers. Such 
requirements actually promote the possibility of implementation at rural areas with water streams or rivers. 
A GWVPP consists of a penstock which is connected to a cylindrical basin tangentially. At the central bottom of the 
basin, a circular outlet is presents. The water from river will be directed into the penstock. Following the penstock, 
2968","the velocity of water exiting the penstock became the tangential velocity of the water vortex. According to equation 
(1), the strength of vortex, Γ is directly proportional to the tangential velocity, 𝑣 of the water vortex. Even though at 
the moment there’s still no proper formula to relate the strength of vortex to the power available in the vortex due to 
uncertainties, the indirect relationship between them is proved in this paper. Reducing the width of penstock feeding 
width, 𝑊𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑 will increase the tangential velocity, hence increasing the power output and improving the performance
of the laboratory scale GWVPP. Sagar et. al. (2014) actually pointed through simulation that increasing 𝑊𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑 will
increase the tangential velocity of water vortex. 
The performance of turbine when Penstock D, E and F was installed are almost similar. This means that the length 
of the penstock model, 𝐿𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 have no effects on the performance of turbine. According to Newton’s first law of
motion, object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state due to 
external forces. With that in mind, Penstock A, D, E and F should show significant difference in performance of 
GWVPP with Penstock A being the most efficient penstock while Penstock F will be the most inefficiency penstock. 
This is because Penstock A resembles a smooth track for water to travel along the wall with minimal change in 
motion’s path. On the flip side, Penstock D, E and F have shorter 𝐿𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 which resembles obstacle that force the
water to change its path when water travelled in straight line. Due to the change in motion’s path, energy losses are 
expected in many forms such as collisions and turbulence. Such losses should then cause the strength of water 
vortex to reduce. 
For the results to not behave as expected, a few speculations have been made. First of all, the equipment used to take 
measurements need higher accuracy. Besides that, the length of penstock without the model is too short to provide 
significant energy loss. Or, the energy losses are so insignificant that the energy losses are negligible. Hence, more 
studies are necessary by using better equipment and larger prototype scale in order to make significant impact on the 
development of penstock for GWVPP. 
5. Conclusion
In a nutshell, the maximum achievable efficiency was found to be 28.29% when Penstock E was installed along with 
inlet flow rate of 8.8m3/h. The power output of the configuration was also highest compared to other configurations. 
Also, it was found that peak performance of the prototype is between 8.0m3/h to 9.6m3/h. However, such finding 
requires validation because the experiments carried out did not include inlet flow rate of 9.6m3/h. Other than that, it 
was also determined that the smaller the penstock’s feeding width, the higher the efficiency of GWVPP.

Abstract 
In recent years, concerns about environmental preservation have fostered research on alternative natural 
materials, motivated industries to employ more environmentally friendly materials and encouraged the 
implementation of recycling activities. A comparative study was conducted to investigate the physical and 
mechanical properties of wood plastic composites (WPC) produced from polypropylene (PP) and 
recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with different types of fibres (coconut coir, bagasse, and 
pineapple leaves). The natural fibres were chemically treated then mixed with the PP and PET using a 
Brabender mixer at the temperature of 200 °C. The WPCs were produced using hot pressing at the 
temperature of 180 °C with pressure of 0.098 MPa for 15 minutes. Then, the colour, density, water 
absorption capacity, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity were examined. The results showed 
that physical and mechanical properties of WPC were strongly dependent on the types and amount of 
fibres. Moreover, this study also revealed that WPC produced with pineapple leaves fibre possessed 
excellent physical properties and mechanical properties compared to coconut coir and bagasse fibre. The 
results of the study indicated that WPC produced from a mixture of PP, recycled PET and pineapple 
leaves fibre is a viable alternative material to natural wood for wood-based industries.

4.0 Conclusions 
 
In conclusion, the mixture of polypropylene, recycled PET and natural fibres makes possible the manufacture of 
environmentally friendly WPCs. The colour, density, water absorption, MOR, and MOE are strongly dependent on 
the types and amount of fibres. The density, MOR and MOE decreased with increase in amount of fibre due to fibre 
agglomeration inside the composite which lead to the formation of voids and eventually affected the physical and 
mechanical properties of WPCs. On the contrary, water absorption increased with the increase in the amount of 
fibre. This is mainly attributed to the hygroscopic property of natural fibre. In term of physical properties, WPCs 
produced with coconut coir, bagasse and pineapple leaves exhibited light brown and dark brown colours which are 
similar to the natural colour of wood. Additionally, it appears that WPCs produced with pineapple leaves exhibited 
excellent mechanical properties (MOE = 8.3 MPa and MOR 1353 MPa) compared to coconut coir (MOE = 8.13 
MPa and MOR 353 MPa) and bagasse (MOE = 11.02 MPa and MOR 423 MPa). Further research is needed to 
optimise the processing parameters for improving the physical and mechanical properties of WPC produced with the 
mixture of polypropylene, recycled PET, and natural fibres.

Abstract 
There are plenty of different styles of furniture on the market, but with so many terms getting thrown 
around it’s hard to know what the different type is. Today, there are many type of modular furniture that 
we can find in the market or furniture shop. Modular furniture are made up of independent work surface 
and storage units with panels used as end panels or space dividers. This paper presents the study on 
stylish coffee table furniture that influenced by modular concept design. The general aim of this study is 
to identify characteristic of stylish modular coffee table for student center. The student center is a like 
place of our home where most of us spend leisure time with housemate, lecturer and others. The design of 
coffee table must be safe for all user. This is why adding a nice mirror of coffee table in student center 
will be surely useful and decorative pleasing. Mirror of coffee tables are what other people address as 
glass top table design. The methods used to develop the ideation in designing process are specifying the 
direction for design concept and make a visual research. The study is expected will develop a new design

1. Introduction
 Furniture is a big deal in the design industry in Malaysia. A well-executed concept can result in a timeless piece 
of furniture that never goes out of style and innovative design. There are plenty of different styles of furniture on the 
market in the Malaysia which is suitable for all people to use. Furniture has been a staple of wealth and luxury 
for centuries, from the Jacobean style of the 1600s through the Scandinavian contemporary style of the 1900s 
(Eerduosi, 2017). Since then, furniture fashion has deviated from the more ornate classical looks to more 
contemporary, bold styles that blur the lines between artistry and functionality (Ifa deccor, 2017). In today's modern 
era with less space available and when people do not have time to maintain the things the most challenging part of 
furniture innovation would be to build furniture that is attractive, multifunctional and optimally uses the ever 
reducing space. Customers would demand of products that are easy to maintain, but Wooden Furniture will never go 
out of fashion because of their durability and unmatched look. The globalization of the economy in Malaysia has 
created great competitiveness in the furniture market. The Malaysian furniture industry gives out an impressive

Abstract 
Minimalist interior design is popular in Malaysian modern homes as it is neat, organized, and visually 
calming. Dining table with minimalist design is one of the most attractive design that consist of less 
elements, less clutter, less patterns and emphasizes the need for more space. The aim of this study is to 
design dining table influenced by modern minimalist design suitable for apartment residential. The design 
of dining table involves the collection of data on the characteristics of minimalist dining table, 
development of the ideation in designing process specifically on the direction for design concept, and 
development of visual research. The study purposed a new design of minimalist dining table for 
consumers especially those with limited space of dining room.

1. Introduction
In Malaysia, increasing of citizen population has leads on the high demand of housing, especially on low-cost
type. Most of the low-cost houses have small space area with limited outdoor and indoor spaces that need right 
selection and decoration idea. Thus, minimalist is among the most popular selection of interior design for this type 
of houses. Minimalism design was reported as one of the most significant and influential movements of the 20th 
century (Anonymous, 2016). Minimalist home designs creates and cultivate a feeling of emotional harmony through 
sharp, clean lines, simple primary colors, and efficient use of space that serves both the aesthetic and functional 
aspects of the home (Tan, 2015). The selection and arrangement of furniture in a space is strongly influenced by the 
functional needs and creativity of the users (Zulkiflin and Mohammad, 2012). Dining table is one type of furniture 
that has high demand from the users. 
Dining room is a room used for eating meals (Merriam-Webster, 2018). It is a room for consuming food or area 
arranged for dining. Dining room located in the indoor room where people have their meals, or a room where meals 
are served. For most of people, the dining room is importance where, it is the place for entertain guests and serve 
family meals. Thus, it is important to get the suitable design of dining room. For instance, small dining room in 
apartment or flat need to consider on the limited space compared with double-storey house, condominium or 
bungalow, with more space for dining room. 
Dining furniture is not limited to table or chair, but it includes kitchen, dining room set, dining room chairs, 
sideboards and barstools. Dining table is a table, especially one seating several persons, where meals are served and 
eaten, especially the major or more formal meals (Dictionary, 2018). The dining table is the central element around 
in home which everyone gathers for family meals. It comes in a wide variety of materials and styles, from wooden 
table classic styles to more modern glass and metal tables. Size for dining table depends on number of seating that 
can be fit. Usually set table is double, four, six or more chairs depend on the size and design of dining table. The 
best selection when pairing this dining set furniture can give the harmony dimension and styles in dining room. The 
design for limited dining room usually becomes room that overlooked the layout and aesthetics. Thinking about 
dining room furniture arrangement does not only mean calculating dimensions, it also means evaluating the 
available space (Gomez-Zerpa, 2017).

4. CONCLUSIONS
This paper introduced the conceptual design of modern minimalist dining table inspired by British Military
Uniform. Besides that, limited space of dining room area for small apartment residential unit is the main focused of 
the design ideation selection that needs minimize size of furniture selection and decorating to utilize the small space 
dining room. Minimalism is the simplicity of style in artwork and design, achieved by using the fewest and barest 
essentials or elements to maximum the effect. This study used design process as a tool and the outline approaches in 
furniture designing process. Modern minimalist furniture design contain function practicality and aesthetics value 
(appearance) which require systematic conceptual design including ideation, product specifications, mockup of 
selected dining table design. The next stage of this project is embodiment design which include the detail drawings 
of the selected design.

Abstract 
Manufacturing Industry cannot avoid problems involving of manufacturing process, 
including layout arrangement problems. Previous studies have reviewed the layout and 
improvements that have been made in order to make production going smooth. However, the 
previous studies did not explain about the importance of methods used in modeling or layout 
arrangement processes in details. There is no explanation about the importance of simulation 
methods used to improve the work process. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to 
increase the production output based on simulation analysis by using ARENA simulation 
software. The qualitative method was used to conduct this study and data was collected at 
studied company to fulfill the result. The results shows that using simulation can improve the 
layout hence increase the production output.  While the findings from experiments showed 
that the company’s layout affected the production efficiency. This research used ARENA 
simulation software as method to analyze work process by creating an overview of the 
movement of a process with more accurate and precise simulation results.

Abstract 
Long waiting time to be served at the outpatient counter is always the main problem faced by the public 
clinic. Outpatient department at public health clinic had the greatest queuing challenge compared to the 
other units. This situation has been a common complaint by the patients. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study is to determine the waiting arrival time and service time of patients at the outpatient counter and to 
model suitable queuing system by using simulation technique. This study was conducted at one of the 
Public Health Clinic in southern Malaysia. This study employed descriptive analytical and simulation 
method to develop suitable model. The collection of waiting time for this study is based on the arrival rate 
and service rate of patients at the outpatient counter. The data calculated and analyzed using Microsoft 
Excel. Based on the analyzed data, the queuing system of the patient current situation was modeled and 
simulated using the ARENA software. The result obtained from the simulation model shows that average 
waiting time of patients in queue is 54.295 minutes with the average total exit patient is 327 patients. 
Thus, the average service time is 13.481 minutes. This study proved that the clinic has achieved the target 
adopted by Ministry of Health patient charter with the target of waiting to see the doctor within or less 
than 60 minutes. The study also addressed a few problem found during the observation and appropriate 
strategies were formulated to improve the waiting time and utilization percentage were carried out 
including rearrange the schedule of resources. The outcome of this study can be used by Ministry of 
Health to improve public health clinic services and plan their resources wisely.

1.0 Research Background 
Time management at the outpatient counter is important especially to the patient with bad injures and 
diagnose with critical illness (Mittal, Chatterjee, Hasnain, & Varshney, 2016). There are two most common factors 
cited that impact patient flow and department load in the hospital; (i) patient arrival rate and (ii) in-hospital flow. 
These factors affect longer waiting time that will caused patients to be dissatisfied (Hassan, Rahman, & Lumpur, 
2015). Although the patient has an appointment with the doctor, the long waiting time has made the patient feel 
bored and depressed. Additionally, long wait times lead to patient forgoing scheduling appointments, increase no-
shows, and limit access to care for patients who really need it. Nonetheless, the most paradoxical situation emerges 
are; longer waiting time, yet capacity is underutilized. 
 Waiting time is define as the time spent by the customer in the queue before the commencement of the 
services (Shanmugasundaram & Umarani, 2015). Unfortunately, this case happen at many developing countries 
public clinics. Public clinics received a large number of patients every day and this generally results in long patient 
waiting times (Afrane & Appah, 2014). Based on the study done by C & Appa Iyer, (2013),  sixty-one percent of the 
patients waited for 90-180 minutes in the clinic, whereas 36.1% of the patients spent less than 10 minutes with the 
doctor in the consulting room. The commonest reason for the long waiting time in the general outpatient department 
was the large number of patients with few health care workers.

target adopted from the Ministry of Health patient charter. A 2011 study of outpatient waiting time in 21 hospitals in 
Malaysia found that the average waiting time to see the doctor was 60 minutes (Ba, Khairatul, & Farnaza, 2017). In 
comparison, this clinic achieved a good average total waiting time of 54 minutes to see the doctor and 78% of server 
utilization achieved the target of waiting to see the doctor within or less than 60 minutes. 
There were several problems identified from this study that need to be rectified. A low percentage of 
registration utilization an unnecessarily long time to be registered and to see the doctor. Registration should be a 
quick and simple process. This study identified that the long waiting time is due to low server utilization caused by 
the registration counter being manned. Lack of staffing utilization is a known contributor to lengthy waiting time in 
hospital outpatients and public health clinics (Ba et al., 2017). A recommendation need to increase the number of 
staff at outpatient department to reduce the waiting time of patient. But this recommendation cannot to be accept 
because will increase the cost of adding server. However, the waiting time of patients achieved the target adopted 
from the Ministry of Health patient charter. The set target criteria of total waiting time from registration to 
consultation should be within or less than 60 minutes.

Conclusion 
In this study, a multiple server channel model was developed for the outpatient department at the Public 
Health Clinic with a focus on the patient waiting time for having a treatment. The main objective of this study is to 
determine waiting time of patient’s flow which can be used to improve the operating performance and also 
improving the quality of the services provided to the patients. The first objective to this study to determine the 
waiting arrival time and service time of patients at outpatient department. This results is shown at the Table 2, 3 and 
4. The result stated that the average waiting time of patients in queue is 54.295 minutes with the average total exit 
patient is 327 patients. Thus, the average service time is 13.481 minutes. In comparison, a study in Malaysia found 
that the average service time in outpatients was 15 minutes (Ba et al., 2017). There is no specific guideline on the 
best service length but studies found that patients prefer to have more time with the doctor. 
Meanwhile the second objective is proved that this study using the simulation technique for model queuing 
system. Based on the results of multiple server channel patient flow simulation model developed, it is proved that 
there is waiting time achieved with Ministry of Health patient charter. In this patient charter stated that patients 
should achieved the target of waiting to see the doctor within or less than 60 minutes. Simulation model result shows 
that longest waiting time exist at pre-consultation room about 28 minutes and the lowest utilization of server is at 
registration counter about 59%. Therefore, suggested improvement need to make to this stations with a view to 
reduce the waiting time and increase the utilization of server. This is to ensure the high quality of services is 
delivered. The outcome of this study is the better understanding of queuing theory and management service. In 
addition, the health care providers can make decision that increase the satisfaction of all relevant group besides 
optimizing the resources. This study further established that queuing theory and modelling is an effective tool that 
can be used to make decisions on staffing needs for optimal performance with regards to queuing challenges in 
clinics. This study therefore be replicated in other clinics or other countries in order to inform clinic administrators 
more on the usefulness of the application of queuing theory and modelling as a tool for improved decision making.

Abstract 
In this study, the Bessant’s Continuous Improvement (CI) Maturity Model, as a means to measure the 
presence of continuous improvement culture, was tested for its validity and reliability in the context of 
Malaysian manufacturing companies. The CI Maturity Model has been validated in several different 
settings before but has yet to be investigated for its applicability in Malaysian manufacturing companies. 
A total of 321 survey responses were obtained and later analysed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) 
and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The findings confirmed that the CI Maturity Model showed 
adequate validity and reliability in the context of Malaysian manufacturing companies. The CI Maturity 
Model can be used by Malaysian manufacturing companies as a framework for developing continuous 
improvement culture.

1. Introduction
Continuous improvement is management philosophy that aims to provide customer satisfaction by continuously 
improving the quality of products or services and processes (Singh & Singh, 2015). Continuous improvement (CI) 
can be seen from two different perspectives (Corso, Giacobbe, Martini, & Pellegrini, 2007). First, it is a set of 
practices and processes originating an innovative flow to encourage an organisation to strive toward excellence. 
Second, it is a set of capabilities that make it possible for an organisation to learn, innovate and renew (Corso et al., 
2007). In the first perspective is largely influenced by Imai (1986)’s works that puts emphasis on the process (i.e. 
method and tools) (Aloini, Martini, & Pellegrini, 2011). Meanwhile, the second perspective is based on Bessant et 
al. (2001)’s works that focus on the abilities to develop and consolidate in behavioural routines, and CI is construed 
as a learned and interiorised ability (Aloini et al., 2011; Corso et al., 2007).   
Since 1998, the number of works related to Imai’s approach (i.e. the so-called ‘hard’ perspective) has been 
on the decline, while work under the category of the Bessant’s approach (the ‘soft’ perspective) has significantly

continuous improvement behaviours in Malaysian manufacturing companies.

Abstract 
This paper presents the results of developing  models  to determine the size of material ordering by 
considering life time and minimum order quantity (MOQ). This topic was inspired by real problem at an 
aerospace company located in Bandung. The faced real problem is how to minimize waste in material 
procurement due to short of material life time and minimum order quantity from suppliers. The waste is 
caused by a lot of unused material (eventualy expired and causing high expired cost), added with high of 
ordering costs, storage costs and stockout costs. Until now the authors have not found the appropriate 
model. On the basis the authors developed or modified a new model.  The developed model is 
deterministic category by  assumption of material demand, lead time and costs involved are considered 
fixed or unchanged. The developed model are combination between optimal and heuristic approach. The 
developed model will get optimal solution when the normal situation faced, but for the specific situation 
the best solution will be found by heuristical approach. 
Authors believe this research will be very useful for companies, as well as for scientific development 
related to optimization in the field of inventory control and material management.

Introduction
Every business system has the goal of generating profits as much as possible by lowering costs as low as possible. 
One of the costs that caused the greatest waste in business activities was the logistics cost, which included a material 
procurement cost of about 40%, Bower Sox. [2]. 
An Aerospace company which located in Bandung Indonesia (apearless named of company) is one company that 
always trying to find the best way to manage its inventory. The complexity of the problems are being faced by the 
company today is very high. The type and number of demands vary greatly, material characteristics were vary also 
including  life time, unit price, lead time ordering, and minimum order quantity from  the vendor. 
Based on observations in the Material Planning Department that handles planning of non metal raw materials  is still 
a serious problem, that is still many materials that have overstock and stockout caused by the incompatibility 
between the needs with the amount of material ordered. When the number of ordered material are larger than the 
level of usage (slow moving) it will cause the buildup (overstock) in the warehouse. While for material with fast 
moving usage category more than ordered size  will cause material to be depleted (stockout).  
The difficulty faced today is determining the size of material ordering by considering the life time and minimum 
order quantity that can minimize the cost due to deficiency or due to excess. Researchers believe that the complexity 
of material procurement issues can occur in almost all other businesses that may be more complex than the problems 
at the site. The problem of procurement of perishable commodities in supermarkets with different characteristics 
may be more complex. Most of agricultural materials have short life time such as fruits  and vegetables.

Under ideal conditions the optimal T value is obtained at T = 0.979  for a total cost of $ 82,963.89. However, for life 
time material is very short Lf = 3 months, then the value of T becomes improper which will cause the amount of 
expiration is very big and will cause material shortage. Because the developed model does not accommodate the 
deficiency, the decision is T revised = 2 months. With the decision will result in a total cost of $ 93,593.10, there is a 
difference with the cost at an optimal T of $ 10,629.21. The cost differencies are an avoidable loss due to determined 
minimum order quantity by vendor and short life time of materials.  
If life time is long enough, for example Lf = 10 months, then by order of MOQ = 1500 does not cause expired 
material. So that optimal ordering interval is obtained

With T = 1,3 month, the requirement of  Lt + T < Lf  are satisfied.  
Order size can be calculated  Q = R x T = 7800 x 0,108 = 842,4 unit 
 
Because of Q<MOQ, the order size is 1500 units. Consequently, if the order interval is performed every 1.3 months 
each cycle will occur the remaining 657.6 units. This residual value will accumulate which will result in large 
storage costs. So the solution offered to order at interval T = MOQ/R = 1500 / 7800 = 0,192 years or  2,3 month. 
 
At optimal order interval will get  the cost  below,

While the total cost with a 2.3 month or 0.192 year booking interval is $ 78642.97. There is a difference  of $91,47 
due to the minimum order quantity set by the company. 
If the MOQ set by the company is small enough eg MOQ < 800 units, then ideal conditions can be achieved with a 
1,3 month order interval with an order size of 842,4 units. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
The developed model resulted optimal formulation for the T order interval,  followed by an advanced calculation or 
algorithm to meet eligibility requirements.  
The developed algorithm starts from finding the optimal value by considering life time and minimum order quantity 
by considering purchase cost, order cost, storage cost, and expired cost.  
From the developed model above,  the optimum T by considering life time and minimum order quantity can be 
achieved maximally (100%) when the life time of material is relatively long and MOQ is relatively small. 
If the condition is not obtained then the optimal value will change following the eligibility requirements in 
accordance to algorithm developed.

Abstract 
Indonesia's creative industries are increasingly contributing positively to the growth of creative economy. 
Soft innovation as a business development strategy begins to show its true identity as a major booster for 
the advancement of several creative industries in Indonesia. The author observes business phenomena 
occurring in the macro and micro environments of several creative industries in fashion, design and 
handicraft sub-sectors, and it is alleged that entrepreneurial orientation and co-creation by business actors 
with customers and partners can generate soft innovations in some creative industries. The results show that 
the breakthrough of soft innovation is triggered by the combined activity of the two factors mentioned 
above. The authors conclude that in the creative industry, soft innovations such as innovation of aesthetics 
elements, intellectual property, and local experience elements that have been created in the products offered, 
are able to become the superiority and uniqueness of Indonesian creative products to compete in the 
domestic market, as well as foreign markets.

1. Introduction
Study of innovation from previous researchers confirmed that innovation is positively capable of improving company 
performance (Jogaratnam, 2017; Shan, Song, & Ju, 2014; Zhang, Edgar, Geare, & O’Kane, 2016). Innovation as stated 
in the Oslo Manual is interpreted as ‘the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), 
process, a new marketing method or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization or 
external relations’ (OECD & Eurostat, 2005). Based on the above definition it can be understood that the minimum 
requirement to be said to be an innovation is when the product, process, marketing method or organization method is 
completely new (or significantly improved) for the company. The meaning of innovation as described above, raises 
many responses in line with current economic and industrial developments. Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), 
United Kingdom, 2003 states that innovation is 'the success of exploiting new ideas'. In this way, there is no reason 
that to exploit new ideas should be limited to functional enhancements alone, especially with the exception of non-
functional enhancements. In other words according to DTI, innovation is improving economic welfare by using new 
knowledge, and new knowledge is not only reflected in functionality alone. (UK Trade and Industry Department, 
2003).

environment, it is suggested to be introduced further and developed more intensively to the stakeholders in the creative 
industry in Indonesia so that it is expected to improve soft innovation as a creative industry development strategy in 
Indonesia which has an implication for the improvement of Indonesian creative industry performance in future.

Abstract 
High numbers of work accidents prove that work safety can no longer be denied. There must be a system 
to manage safety, especially in the construction sector, which has the highest contribution of work 
accidents in Indonesia. The system to manage safety is usually called Safety, Health, and Environment 
system (SHE system). However, the success of SHE systems is affected by the safety maturity level of the 
company. In fact, the number of work accidents is still increasing even though SHE systems have been 
applied in those companies. This research was conducted to develop a safety maturity model in order to 
improve safety and project performances. This research will draw a portrait of the existing safety maturity 
level of Indonesian construction companies. After knowing the existing level and the indicators that have 
not been fulfilled, a model for improving the existing safety maturity level was developed. The variables 
of the research are: safety policy, safety institution, safety cultures, safety maturity level, safety 
performance and project performance. This research was conducted through Delphi and questionnaire 
survey methods. The results of this research are the improvement of a safety maturity model and the 
suggestion of improvement actions to increase safety maturity level. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
1.1 Background 
Figure 1. Number of accidents percentage 
Lately, construction sector has been the largest contributor for number of accidents in Indonesia. It contributes for 
32% for number of accidents based on the survey conducted by National Journal (2009). This fact shows that safety 
in construction sector has not been well-maintained by the contractors. While the contractors have knowledge about 
safety, health and environment system, but still cannot reduce the accidents.

Figure 8. Resilient Level Radar Chart 
 
Resilient level is the top performance from a safety maturity level. At this level, safety is really a matter for the 
enterprises and has became a daily needs. Safety awareness is at its highest concern for all employees. All 
enterprises are aiming to reach this level, so a safe workplace will be created. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, every construction enterprise is at its own safety maturity level. The sequences of the level start from 
basic, reactive, compliant, proactive, until resilient level. The survey has shown to us the three indicators for each 
level that can be improve so they can level up the enterprises safety maturity level. The suggestion methods are 
given above to improve from the existing level to the higher level. By improving enterprises safety maturity level, it 
will create better safety cultures. When great safety cultures are settled, it will give a great safety performance. A 
great safety performance will eliminate work accidents, work illnesses and will save a lot of project time and project 
cost. By eliminating those risks is also ensuring the quality of the result. Last but not least, a good safety 
performance will affect the project performance. So in simple words, by improving safety maturity level will deliver 
a good project performance.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to analyze the use of online social networks as a medium for Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) disclosures. To this end, an analysis was performed of the messages posted by the 
top 200 public listed companies in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. In addition, analysis was 
performed on the responses that they received on two of the most popular online social networks 
Instagram and Youtube. The results of the analysis of these data are explored to see which of the Indian 
listed companies are using social media networks and which of the social media networks are most 
frequently used. In addition, the goal of this paper is to investigate which corporates adopted the online 
social media more effective and communicated the same to the stakeholders. The study also explored how 
Indian companies communicate more frequently the non-CSR tasks and activities more than CSR 
activities using social media platforms like Instagram and Youtube. The study explored to find how 
rudimentary the adoption is. The study also shows how the Indian companies are transitioning and 
adopting these social media platforms is used for CSR disclosures.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to analyze how luxury fashion brands are using social media network platforms. 
To this end, an analysis was performed of the messages, pictures and videos posted by the top 50 luxury 
brands in India and the responses that they received on one of the most popular online social networks, 
Instagram. The aim of the paper is to explore the results of the analysis of these data show how luxury 
fashion brands in India are using social media networks, which of the social media networks are most 
frequently used and if the social media usage differs based on brands country of origin. The findings show 
how this industry is still in its rudimentary phase of using digital technologies like social media networks 
and equally chaotic and unpredictable. The study also shows how the global luxury brands are 
transitioning and expanding into Indian markets and how these social media platforms are used for 
adoption. The study also explores to see which of the luxury brands use photos, posts and videos.

Abstract 
In seaweed industry, the post-harvest handling process of seaweed is an essential stage before shipping. 
The quality of dried seaweed focuses particularly on its moisture content for obtaining better selling price 
in the trading market. In the traditional and conventional methods, low technologies and economic drying 
process (i.e. platform method, hanging method) is widely implemented in Malaysia. In recent years, 
passive dryer (solar chimney dryer or greenhouse dryer), active dryer (dehumidifier dryer) and hybrid 
dryer (wind turbine, double-pass solar collectors with fins and v-groove) were developed for post-harvest 
handling process. However, there are in early stages of development and it is required to model and 
optimize before technologies are transferred to industry for application. A solar chimney dryer that is 
cold-inflow free, economic fossil fuel free and no additional electrical devices through the enhancement 
of flow is proposed in seaweed industry and might be favoured by those farmers whom used to the 
conventional technology. Consequently, a natural convection solar dryer that incorporated with flow 
enhancing chimney and cold-inflow free was designed and tested in the Faculty of Engineering, 
Universiti Malaysia Sabah to understand drying behaviour of seaweed as well as thermal performance of 
the solar chimney dryer. The drying process was then modelled mathematically to describe the seaweed 
drying process. The results showed that Page model was the best model to describe the solar drying 
kinetics of seaweed in the solar chimney dryer. The Henderson and Pabis model may be the most 
effective model to describe the drying kinetics of seaweed since nearly all the models perform 
satisfactorily with determination of coefficient (R2=0.91-0.98) in describing the solar drying kinetics in 
the solar chimney dryer.

1. Introduction
Carrageenan is a family of sulfated polysaccharides that extracted from red algae. It is useful addictive in food 
industry for gelling, thickening, emulsifying and preserving foods and drinks. Carrageenan tends to be in vegan 
products as it is plant based and used to replace gelatin which is extracted from animal. Kappaphycus and Eucheuma 
are red algae species that grows widely in Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippine. Sun drying is traditionally and 
conventionally postharvest handling process by spreading on a platform or by hanging with rope at coastal areas as 
shown in Figure 1. It is an essential process to dry fresh seaweed for shipping. However, open sun drying process 
requires larger area and prone to contamination during raining seasons due to re-moistening.

4. Conclusion
The Page model which is the best fitted model was selected based on the highest value of determination of 
coefficient (R2) and lowest value for RMSE to describe drying kinetics of seaweed on top, middle and bottom tray in 
drying chamber of a solar dryer with draft enhancing chimney. The Henderson and Pabis model may be the most 
effective model to describe the drying kinetics since nearly all models perform satisfactorily value of determination 
coefficient (R2=0.91-0.98) in describing the solar drying kinetics of seaweed in the solar dryer with a draft 
enhancing chimney.  
In order to improve the drying rate of seaweed drying in the solar dryer, the design of solar dryer as well as 
construction materials shall be further developed and investigated so that scale up process become possible for 
seaweed industry

Abstract 
The influence of project management on construction projects anywhere in the world cannot be 
underestimated as poor project management has grave effects on the stakeholders (clients, consultants, 
contractors and users) and the projects at large. The aim of this study is to investigate the level of awareness 
of project managers of their roles on construction projects and determine the deficient project management 
roles that lead to abandonment of construction projects. The study is survey in nature and uses both 
questionnaire and interview (confirmatory) to elicit necessary information for the study. The population of 
the study consists of abandoned building projects in Lagos, Nigeria. Sixty-six 66 questionnaires out of the 
80 that were administered on project managers of abandoned building projects were returned and used for 
the study. Thus, the project managers of public and private abandoned projects were used for the study and 
the results of the study were analyzed with frequencies, percentages and mean item scores. The results of 
the study indicate that out of the 16 project management roles identified, project managers are very aware 
of two and aware of the remaining 14. Also, the study found that deficiency in 13 of the roles had high 
degrees of leading to project abandonment. The conclusion of the study is that project managers are aware 
of their roles on construction projects but the roles were not performed on those projects, thus leading to 
project abandonment. In view of this, the study further concludes that there would be some uninvestigated 
exogenous factors that are responsible for the non-performance of PM roles on those projects. Hence, the 
study recommends that further studies into why project managers fail to perform their roles on construction 
projects should be conducted. The study also recommends that project managers must engage in adequate 
planning, cost control and resource management to prevent project abandonment

INTRODUCTION 
Over the years, project management has been widely recognized in the construction industry with its role being 
essential for successful project execution. The relevance of project management continues to grow with increase in 
complex projects and clients demanding that the triads (cost, time and quality) of project success be strictly achieved. 
Thus, there is need to include specialist management skills in project teams (Alitheia, 2010). Despite this however,

Conclusion 
 
The study investigates the level of awareness of project managers of their roles on construction projects. The study 
also investigates the project management roles that could lead to project failure on construction projects if they are 
not performed.  The findings of the study indicate that the respondents are aware of all of the roles of project managers 
on construction projects. This result is not expected because most of the professionals in the built environment that 
practice project management were admitted for postgraduate or professional studies. The respondents are very aware 
that as construction project managers, they need to plan work execution and manage client issues.  
Moreover, they claim that non-management of client issues, management of construction process, resource allocation 
and utilization, developing budget schedule and monitoring them, planning of work execution, management of risks, 
delivering project within cost and time constraint, management of project finance, definition of work requirements, 
management of design process, progress monitoring and plan adjustment, management of approval processes and 
management of claims would to a high degree lead to construction project failure if not carried out or properly carried 
out. However, to an average degree, management of safety, management of project environment and ensuring final 
deliverable meeting are the project management roles that could lead to project management in the Nigerian 
construction industry. 
Therefore, the conclusion of the study is that, professionals in the built environment are aware of the roles of project 
managers on construction projects. Further to this, the study concluded that, construction professionals agree to a high

Abstract 
The aim of the study was to investigate the risks in procurement within the public sector. The study first 
identified the risks related to procurement, then distributed the questionnaires with 25 respondents by the 
employees within the public sector. Although the literature review highlighted that corruption was 
perceived as one of the biggest risks in procurement, all the questions relating to corruption had to be 
omitted from the questionnaire to prevent political distortion and fear that the respondents will not 
respond to the questions objectively. It is common knowledge that corruption in the form of collusion in 
the public sector procurement is widely affecting the ethical way of contracting for goods and services. It 
was found that current mitigation strategies were unable to prevent future mitigation strategies. The 
introduction of ethics training could provide positive results in terms of mitigating the procurement risks 
as employees would be sensitized to what constitutes unethical behaviour in a procurement environment. 
The procurement officers must take part in continuous professional development regarding proper 
procurement practices including ethics and values.

Background
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a fundamental portion of prudent financial management in the South African 
public sector (Ambe & Badenhorst-Weiss, 2012:246). According to Bramer and Walker (2011:453), public 
procurement is the acquisition of goods and services by public sector organisations from selected suppliers in order 
to effectively and sufficiently provide basic services to the public. According to Ambe and Badenhorst-Weiss (2012: 
241), section 217(1) of the Public Financial Management Act (1999) requires public procurement to be ""in 
accordance with a system which is fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective”. 
Effective identification and measurement of the procurement risk is important as the basis of efficient risk 
management and risk prevention (Lei, Donghong & Tie, 2009). Procurement risk can be viewed from a transactional 
viewpoint (CIPS, 2013:2). Lei et al., (2009:3118) indicated that the procurement process is exposed to risk during 
the different transactions that occur between the buyer, supplier, and other market factors. 
Public procurement is subject to increased critical observation aided by technology. 
Ambe and Badenhorst-Weiss (2012) added that prior to 1994, public procurement in South Africa was directed to 
massive, developed contractors and this made it challenging for small and medium enterprises to participate in 
public procurement processes. 
The South African public sectors, programme reviews, and public and political expectations for service 
improvements (Ambe & Badenhorst-Weiss, 2012:243). The inefficiencies of the procurement function have led to 
limited visibility for supply chain managers regarding where their products and services originate from and where 
they are consumed (Coetzee, 2015). 
Ambe and Badenhorst-Weiss (2012) suggested that public sector procurement in South Africa is the powerful 
transformation tool which is aimed at promoting people who were previously disadvantaged by unjust past practices.

Abstract  
 
It is emphasized that self-assessment practices using quality award-based models has been adopted by 
companies throughout the world as a comprehensive and systematic means for improvement. National 
Quality Award (NQA) models around the world have been developed to assist organizations for analyzing 
its performance with reference to quality management. In this paper the authors discuss the self-
assessment practices based on NQA models on the basis of current literature. A range of issues is 
discussed including the main purpose, benefits and process of self-assessment practices. The main quality 
award-based world-renowned models and frameworks are also reviewed in this paper. This study is also 
highlighted the main benefits of self-assessment practices for organizations seeking to introduce quality 
management. The results can be considered as valuable information for management review to develop an 
effective action plan to better-performing companies by analyzing their current practice in their quest to 
put meaning to quality.

1. Introduction 
 
With the increasing levels of international competition and the demand of major customers for quality, a variety of 
quality improvement approaches have been proposed as the prime driver to measure of company performance. One 
of the most common ways and systematic reviews of an organization’s activities and performance against a quality 
model, usually based on a National Quality Award (NQA), is self-assessment. Self-assessment through participation 
in a NQA program is considered as an effective way for analyzing company performance with reference to quality 
management. NQA programs around the world have been mainly proposed as the prime driver for company 
performance assessment purpose against the existing quality assessment models. These models have spread as a way 
of increasing competitiveness and reducing costs by helping to incorporate and assess quality management 
principles and practices within organizations (Kim et al., 2009; Al Marri et al., 2007). They provide guidelines for 
organizations seeking to introduce quality management.  
Over the last few years, self-assessment approach through participation in a quality award program has been widely 
adopted by organizations as an essential instrument to assess their performance towards excellence (Dimitriadis et 
al., 2015; Doeleman et al., 2014; Brown, 2013). For many organizations conducting self-assessment against quality 
award models is strategically and tactically vital for gaining a competitive advantage.

Abstract 
The property market, especially in apartment products, has in recent years shown unstable conditions and 
has a downward trend between new supplies, new absorption and occupancy rates. Property corporations 
have market challenges and business competition that require a business strategy to win the competition 
through the value added offered. The purpose of this study is to measure the value added that can be given 
by the corporation in the apartment product into a property business strategy. This research involves 
property corporations classmates, owning apartment products, listed as a go-public company and doing an 
Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the same year on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The data collection in 
this descriptive research is done through observation, interview and documentation study. The research 
findings show the most dominant value added influencing business strategy is increased flexibility and 
value enhancement besides other less dominant value added such as cost reduction, risk control, 
marketing, productivity improvement and cultural change. While the business strategy chosen by all of 
property corporations involved in this research have a business strategy to attract investors, retain 
investors and increase investor wealth.

innovative excitement efforts and efforts to improve core competencies. Another 50% indicator consists of create 
customer effort, and promotion of corporate culture. 
 
V. 
Discussion 
 
Referring to Klopčič, Kuipers, and Hocquette (2013) opinion, the value added of increased flexibility with legal 
aspect is done when the land / site procurement stage needs to be adjusted to the remuneration of factors of 
production ie legal aspects / provisions applicable through employment, capital and risk . When the company will 
start a job, the availability of land and location including the handling of its legal aspects must be quickly resolved, 
and this is the most expected value added by any property company, because the land or location is raw material 
(production factor) and the next process will not running if raw materials are not available yet. 
Increasing the value of the indicator is the time to purchase the apartment product. Time required when  the buyer 
make priority determination, profitability of the project and check the financial condition in accordance with the 
remuneration / rewards of the product factors ie building construction work, initial capital, and risks arising from 
property / apartment products 
White (2011) says the management of real-property business can be done with a number of process improvements. 
Improving the process that can be done is to find a more efficient and effective way through innovative strategies 
from the quality of service delivery to customers with a more efficient operating costs resulting in an increase in the 
investment value of the property / apartment. Increased productivity, cost reduction, risk control, cultural change, 
public relations and marketing are another added value that is an innovative strategy in the process of more effective 
and efficient property / apartment business methods and methods. 
Based on the findings of this study, the added value of the business activities of the apartment product business can 
be demonstrated through the performance of the corporation in a business strategy. The performance income derived 
from capital value and also from leasing value as proposed by Edwards & Ellison (2004) because property business 
is asset investment product. 
The efforts to attract investors, retain investors, and increase wealth for investors as the business strategy dimension 
of property apartments selected by all property corporations, according to Humplick and Peterson in Karlaftis and 
Kepaptsoglou (2012). The interests of investors as stakeholders in the property sector have a vested interest in and 
expectations of invested investments so as to require assessment and measurement of various performance 
dimensions. 
The operational performance and profitability of firms operating the apartment assets influenced by optimization in 
the apartments management start in the procurement, operation, maintenance, control, renewal, improvement until in 
elimination of physical assets as well as to provide safe and economical infrastructure (Prescott and Andrews, 2011). 
For example, performance measurement focuses on cost per square meter and space and property unit strategy 
decisions so as to contribute to increased revenue (Lindholm & Leväinen, 2006). Operational and profitability 
activities are carried out to make management more flexible, and through a strategic planning process and in 
accordance with the potential, the company can implement the ' value added ' that has been indicated (Lindholm and 
Gibler, 2006).  
 
VI. Conclusion 
 
Property firms can provide added value through increased flexibility, value enhancement, and cost efficiency as the 
most implemented dimension, while increasing productivity, risk control, changing culture and public relations and 
marketing is more of an added value dimension. The identified value additions will improve performance through 
improved and more efficient and effective management processes in a defined business strategy to achieve revenue 
and profit growth objectives. 
Finally, the property business firm's strategy as the main way or effort to attract investors, retain investors and 
increase investor wealth in apartment products. This is done by providing information, providing concrete evidence 
and trying to increase the value of the apartment product. Business strategies that are set to achieve revenue and 
profit growth goals and through added value can be achieved.

Abstract 
Customer-oriented marketing strategies should be able to develop marketing programs and plans that 
deliver the appropriate value to customers. Customers for colleges are students, so students become key 
actors in contributing to value creation. The purpose of this study is how the strategy of building the 
students satisfaction of private higher education (PHE) through co-creation with experience value as 
intervening variable. The number of respondents as many as 357 students taken from 32 PHE in South 
Sumatra Province taken with multistage random sampling technique. The analysis technique is done by 
structural equation models with LISREL program as a tool. The results showed that co-creation had no 
direct effect on student satisfaction, but it influenced to experience value. The value of experience created 
by co-creation will create student satisfaction value, so the value of experience becomes a good 
intervening variable for the relationship between co-creation and student satisfaction.

Abstract 
The aim of this descriptive and correlational research is to explore the relationship between employee’s 
personality and career achievement. This study involved 126 respondents ranging from grades 1 to 54 in 
the Land and Mines Office, Nusajaya, Johor. The respondents were selected using stratified random 
sampling method. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire was designed to evaluate the respondents’ 
personality, while the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) was developed to measure their 
career success. Then, the collected data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
(SPSS) version 20.0. The results indicated that the ‘openness to experience’ personality trait was found 
high in the majority of respondents as compared to the other four personality dimensions. In addition, the 
respondents scored higher in intrinsic career success as compared to extrinsic career success. 
Furthermore, the Pearson correlation test revealed that the dimensions of agreeableness, extraversion, 
openness to experience, and conscientiousness are associated to the intrinsic career success. However, the 
findings related to extrinsic career success showed a positive relationship with the conscientiousness 
dimension, and a negative relationship with the neuroticism dimension.  Finally, the findings from this 
study will make a significant contribution to the field of personality and career success.

1. Introduction
Development is very important and needed in an organization. It is required by any organization, individual, and 
society as a whole in order to improve ourselves or move forward in life [Peel, 1992]. Based on the empirical 
studies, both factors related to workers namely personality and career success are interdependent [2]. 
Therefore, Big Five Personality traits are applied to measure the workers’ personality. It comprises five main 
personality dimensions [3]. Meanwhile, the career success can be explained in detail using two components, 
particularly extrinsic and intrinsic [4]. The Big Five Personality factors are openness to experience, 
conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. 
The extrinsic career success includes significant achievements in career life such as the  external rewards. On the 
other hand, the achievement of intrinsic career success covers the subjective internal satisfaction of the individual 
towards his or her work. 
Personality is also one of the most important aspects in influencing the individual’s career success or growth [5]. 
Meanwhile, the component of extrinsic career success is very crucial for an employee, which refers to the objective 
type of achievement [6]. In addition, the component of intrinsic career success refers to the individual attitudes 
towards his or her career, and how much the person loves his or her job [7].

8. Conclusion 
 
This study gives better understanding and holistic view for the organization regarding the factors that affect the 
career success of the employees. Even the results of this research study shows the relationship between Big Five 
Personality and Career Success among the employees at Department of Registration, Land and Mines Office (PTG) 
in Nusajaya, Johor are not enough strong correlation that is because majority of the employees in the government 
sector at this country which is Malaysia still assume the uses of big five personality is still not important to their 
lives. One of the reason why this situation happened is they are not exposed to the interest or importance of the big 
five personality quality in enhancing their career success and life. However, it is also a good platform for the 
organization to have a more comprehensive view in developing a long-term strategic action plan. Other than that, it 
encourages the implementation of detailed personality tests which are practical or useful to the employees.

Abstract: Shopping centre are retail properties with special qualities compared to other property 
investments. Shopping centre are the most glorious places these days with their attractive shops and a 
wide variety people where people spend their weekends to relax and shop. The base for the payoff of all 
commercial real estate investments is its tenants and thus the purchasing power these are able to attract. 
The retail tenants might differ in size, management, sales, their exposure to consumer trends and in their 
positions on their market and positions towards their competitors. However, it appears the forces driving 
retail expansion all over the world have deviated from actual consumer demand. With the changing tastes 
and preferences of customers, shopping centre extend a global impact across metros, cities and towns. 
The scope of the retail business in Malaysia is broad and includes hypermarkets, shopping malls, 
specialty stores, and direct sales. There are numerous shopping malls of different size, categories and 
concept located in Klang Valley and the number of shopping centre is still increasing. Now, with the 
emergence of more shopping malls, undoubtedly the competitions between malls have become stiffer. 
Shopping malls that are unable to stand the test of time will not survive. This is because newer malls have 
been built with creative designs, styles, ideas and concepts to attract customers.  Other great challenges 
faced by shopping malls are that they have to find and retain their tenants. Customers would expect 
certain criteria to be met for optimal satisfaction. Therefore, this paper is to explores the literature review 
made to be applied in classification of shopping centre in Malaysian dimensions in order to determine and 
develop the classification framework.  In addition, this paper seeks the adoption concept of Shopping 
Centres in Malaysia. The criteria of classification of shopping centre gained through literature reviews 
can be set as reference as a rating tool for a grading of shopping centre for developer, tenant and customer 
to make decision and investment purpose in the future.

4. Result: Conceptual Framework of Shopping Centre in Malaysia 
 
There are ten (10) categories of shopping centre that was used and suitable in Malaysia. Each shopping centre has a 
5 rating from one star until five star. The 5 rating star represent for excellent, 4 rating star represent above average, 3 
rating star represent average, 2 rating star represent below average and 1 rating star represent poor. Grading of 
shopping centre based on criteria and inspection study. The categories of criteria divide by fourteen (14) which are 
Size, Anchor tenant, Types of product, Location, Leisure/Entertainment, Concept,Configuration/Presentation/Design 
Structural, 
Customer 
facilities, 
Physical 
presentation, 
Maintenance,

security 
and 
Infrastructure/Facilities. The criteria of shopping centre was validate from expert opinion in various industry 
including government and private sector. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) using as a method to rating the 
grading of shopping centre, AHP also widely uses as an effective tool for the project selection in shopping centre. 
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has become a popular tool for making a decision among researchers and has 
been widely used for solving problems (Vadiya & Kumar, 2003).

5. Conclusion 
 
Finally, based on result from critical literature review analysis, it can be concluded that the result shows there are ten 
(10) suitable categories of shopping centre can be adapted in local context to develop the classification model 
shopping centre in Malaysia. Each categories has criteria and sub criteria. There are fourteen (14) criteria for each 
categories of shopping centre. The purpose to grading of shopping centre to help the owners rank portfolio holdings 
and shed low-scoring properties. Lenders use it in a similar manner. Retailers often use grading to help them 
evaluate the setting for which their stores exists. (ICSC, 2009). Gregory Kerfoot (2009) suggested mall-grading 
criteria using an A-B-C-D grading matrix that captured population in the trade area, the number of anchors, small-
tenant occupancy and competition. PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) used expert opinion from retail real-estate-
industry professionals to create a grading system for regional malls.  Although its survey-based system has been 
recast in mid-2009, PWC’s regional-mall classification remains based on sales-per-sq-ft evaluations, which is its 
shorthand for easy classification of a host of factors that would impact the sales performance. From the preliminary 
study, the important citeria including location, size, Catchment area and anchor tenant. Tanan (1998) was stated five 
important factors as attraction power of shopping center that is location, business concept, design, tenant mix, and 
management. This shopping centre classification model can be betterment benchmarking for Malaysian property 
industry in general.

1. Introduction
Lean manufacturing is a manufacturing paradigm to remain competitive in the world market through 
production of quality products with improved productivity at reduced cost. In lean manufacturing through optimal 
utilization of resources major costs incurred in manufacturing the product is reduced. By implementing lean techniques 
in the manufacturing industry various process improvements can be achieved with reduced cycle time. ABC is an 
Excavator Bucket manufacturing industry in India, which supplies the buckets for Tata Hitachi and Caterpillar. EX 
70, EX 110, EX 200, EX 210, ZAXIS 80, ZAXIS 120 H are the models of Tata Hitachi for which buckets are 
manufactured. The cost of each EX 70 bucket is $1100. The company works 8 hours per day.  
1.1 Problem Statement 
The Bucket for model EX 70 should be produced continuously to meet the daily production target, the 
forecasted demand for EX 70 buckets shown in table 1.0. The demand is increasing gradually so the industry with 
present capacity cannot satisfy the demand in future. Therefore, some lean tools have to applied to increase the 
efficiency of an industry. 
Table 1 shows the demand of buckets. It can be observed that there is continuous increase in demand for this product 
in future. To meet the demand, it necessary to decrease the lead time.

6. Conclusion
The research work proves that by using the lean tools production lead time is reduced in manufacturing of 
EX 70 excavator bucket. Thus, the productivity in the fabrication stations have been improved. Total time taken in 
welding station was reduced from 90 mins to 80 mins per bucket, total time taken in Lug alignment inspection was 
reduced from 18 mins to 13 mins per bucket and total time taken in painting station was reduced from 45 mins to 40 
mins per bucket thus, total cycle time of 538 minutes to manufacture a Ex 70 excavator bucket is reduced to 518 
minutes per bucket. The ergonomic condition of worker and manpower utilization is also improved after 
implementation of proposed process. The productivity can further be improved by continuous process improvement 
and according to the product requirements. The total cost savings due to productivity improvement is about $ 
81,912per year. This work can still be further improved through continuous improvement by improving the process.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to improve the condition of sugar industry by identifying and eliminating 
the waste by applying the production planning tools and lean principles. Production lead time reduction is 
an important means to improve productivity in manufacturing industries. The forecasting of sugarcane 
supply is carried out using simple moving average, the forecasting of sugar production capacity of industry 
and sugar market demand is studied and analyzed to see whether the company can satisfy the demand in 
future. The MRP is also carried out for the chemicals like limestone, phosphate which are bought from 
outside. The paper also focuses on reducing the break downs in an industry and reduce the waiting time of 
the sugarcane delivery. The implementation procedure is discussed. The feasibility and the significance of 
lean production are discussed and the results are also shown.  
1. Introduction
This research paper addresses the application of production planning and control concepts to Sugar industry 
which is continuous processing industry. Continuous production is a flow production method used to manufacture, 
produce, or process materials without interruption. Continuous production is called a continuous process or 
a continuous flow process because the materials, either dry bulk or fluids that are being processed are continuously in 
motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment. Shri Prabhulingeshwar Sugars & 
Chemicals Ltd., founded by Mr. Jagadeesh S Gudagunti is an integrated company primarily engaged in the 
manufacture of sugar and allied products. The company was founded in 1999 in Siddapur Village, Jamakhandi Taluka, 
Bagalkot District. 
1.1 Problem Statement 
Production planning and control have been widely used in discreet industry application but the application 
of Production planning and control to the continuous process industry have been fewer. This is because such industries 
are inherently more efficient and present relatively less need for such improvement activities. The sugar should be 
produced continuously to meet the daily production target. The company is failing to meet the customer demand due 
to lack of sugar cane availability, break downs, non-value-added activities.  
1.2 Objective 
The objective of the study is to improve the production of sugar by reducing the time taken for non-value-added 
activities such as Setup, Movement of material by using lean tools. The objective is also to improve operator safety 
and reduce fatigue and reduce the break downs. 
1.3 Literature Review 
Forecasting by moving average method: 
If a time series is generated by a constant process subject to random error, then mean is a useful statistic and

4. Results 
From this paper, the forecasting of sugarcane supply is done from which the sugarcane supply for 2017 is forecasted 
to be 1.33 million tons. This will help the industry to be prepared in advance to crush so much of sugarcane without 
any breakdowns. The forecasted value of sugar production capacity of an industry in 2017 is 2.67 million bags 
Whereas the demand in 2017 is 2.88 million bags. With the current capacity, the company falls short to satisfy the 
demand. As the company is not able to meet the demand in future extra resource should be installed like Mills, Boilers, 
Hoppers which cost around 2.35 million dollars. The payback period is also calculated to check the feasibility, the 
payback period is calculated to be 6 years by the money made by the result of extra resource. Material requirement 
planning of chemicals like Limestone, Phosphate and empty sugar bags is done as they are bought from outside. From 
the MRP the material ordering date is found to get the material well in time. The waiting time of sugarcane tractors is 
reduced to 6 hours from 72 hours meanwhile the breakdown of industry is also reduced.  
 
5. Conclusion 
From this research, I could forecast the supply of sugarcane in year 2017. The production capacity and demand of 
sugar bags was also forecasted for year 2017 which will help the company to know the status and work on it to meet 
the future demand. The research also predicts the demand of sugar for next 6 years, it was found that the company 
would not satisfy the demand, so it is recommended to increase the capacity from 8500 tons of crushing per day to 
12000 tons of crushing per day. The amount associated in instalment of extra resource is 2.35 million dollars and the 
payback period is 6 years from the money made by the result of extra resource allocation. Therefore, it is feasible to 
invest to increase the crushing capacity.

Abstract 
Linear programming (LP) technique is a vital technique in the optimization of resource allocation and 
achieving efficiency in planning particularly in achieving profit for the budget airline by flying more often 
to more profitable route among the top 5 airports in the United States of America. In this paper, a Linear 
programming technique is applied to determine the optimum no of time a budget airline need to fly between 
2 cities to make maximum profit with respect to various factors such as Fuel Price and staff salary for the 
year 2017. The proposed LP model is solved by standard simplex algorithm and solver. It is observed that 
the proposed LP model is appropriate for finding the optimal no of times budget airlines need to fly between 
cities and making maximum profit.

1. Introduction
Budget Airline or Discount Airlines originated with the airline which operates on very low operating cost. 
The main Objective of the budget airline is to provide transport medium at cheapest fares to the public in 
today’s competitive market. The main operating concept of budget airlines is not to provide the traditional 
type of services which is offered in most of the airlines and is included in the fare charged to the customer, 
resulting in lower fares and very few comforts. To compensate for the loss in the fare budget airline often 
charge their customer for some special service such as food, priority boarding, seat selection and extra 
baggage. Along with Reduced fare the other objective is to keep the cost of the aircraft maintenance as low 
as possible. Aircraft maintenance is one of the biggest expenses for any airline in airline industries. Cost of 
aircraft maintenance reduces the margin of profit by a great extent. The budget airline is low-cost airline 
but they don’t comprise on aircraft safety or its passenger safety. Safety regulation is common for all the 
airline whether its budget airline or legacy airline. All airlines are only supposed to use FAA certified 
Aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration). To reduce the aircraft maintenance cost budget airline mostly 
uses only one type of aircraft which helps them to lower the inventory for the replacement part. Budget 
airlines tend to operate short-haul flights that suit the range of single-aisle which is known as narrow-body 
planes. The wide-body aircraft are typically too expensive for low-cost carriers. As all the aircraft are of 
same type budget airlines also save a large amount of time and training expense for their staff as they don’t 
have to train their staff specially for all the various types of aircraft in their fleet. Budget Airline operates 
on the minimum sets of equipment, further reducing costs of acquisition and maintenance, as well as 
keeping the weight of the aircraft lower and thus saving fuel. A budget airline like Ryanair does not have 
reclining seats they also don’t have rear pockets, to reduce the weight of the aircraft as well as eliminate 
cleaning and maintenance costs.

5. Result 
 
The result shows the optimization in operation of Budget airlines. The Optimized result now makes proper 
use of the available slot in the different airport which in turn results in an increase in profit of the airline. 
There is an increase in revenue by $60000 every day which is equal to $21 Million annually. The results 
are only based on 5 airports this technique can be used across all the airport for the airlines and there will 
be much better revenue generation as compared to the present situation. Due to optimal slot utilization, we 
can use the same data can be useful for Staff Scheduling, Aircraft Maintenance, Selecting Hub Airport for 
the airline and many others.  
 
 
6. Conclusion.  
 
By using Lingo programming and Solver for Integer programming we can identify the number of flight 
required between two cities to maintain the connectivity and get maximum profit for a budget airline. This 
helps the budget airline to be a game changer in the airline industry. By taking such steps airlines can 
operate efficiently and avoid wastage of resources.  
The same kind of Technique can be used to optimize the Bus service in a city by the changing the frequency 
of the bus across the city. It can also be used to optimize Train Service across the vast country. In this case, 
no of trains or no of couches in a train can be changed to get an optimized result in operation.

Abstract 
The newspaper industry has some distinctive qualification which makes it stands out from other industries 
especially in the distribution process. The strict is a short delivery deadline that will affect the product price.  
Because of the demand is defined, with some agencies spread on an area so the problem in the newspaper 
industry will be the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW). Optimal route can be 
determined using Differential Evolution Algorithm to calculate the shortest route for every agency and 
maximized the usage of the vehicle using coordinates and demands of the agencies. The result shows that 
there is an optimal route which have shorter route and shorter travel time than the existing route in the 
distribution process.

Introduction
A successful company distribution are generated from integrated scheduling between production scheduling, transport 
scheduling and inventory scheduling (Chen, 2010) meanwhile Regarding the printing and distribution of the 
newspaper industry taking from the actual occurrence that orders of products with high time sensitivity character must 
send their goods directly to the consumer without using intermediary inventory so that the focus is to coordinate 
between the inventory and the distribution of the newspaper company (Buer, et al., 1999). The result of a case study 
in one of the newspaper company in Surakarta town got some problems, one of them is the slowest of distribution 
process due to the less precise route determination. 
Thus the research needs to be done to reduce the mileage by finding the optimal route. For the problem, the suitable 
model is the Vehicle Routing Problem (Wang, 2015) (Baekers, et al., 2016) and due to time constraints, the model 
added Time Window elements (Kumar, et al., 2012). VRP itself can serve to solve the problem where the state of 
delivery has many points and carried out continuously in an area. VRP development itself has been done on various 
issues, for example VRP is used to determine the distance matrix on completion using a Nearest Neighbour algorithm 
(Amri, et al., 2014). 
Prior to this research there were several studies similar to case studies in newspaper companies, but using other models, 
including using the Sweep method (Cahyaningsih, et al., 2015). However, in the case study in this article, the algorithm 
that best matches the data obtained is Differential Evolution which has an advantage in the evolution experienced by 
every individual in the population where differentiation and crossover occur sequentially in each individual who is 
randomly selected from the population at any time (Fahmiari and Santosa, 2010). Thus the most appropriate solution 
to determine the optimal route in the study case in this article is the Differential Evolution algorithm (Mingyong, et 
al. 2010) (Silva, et al., 2013) 
This article is intended to solve the problem of determining the existing route in a newspaper company in Surakarta 
town so that the best route that has the shortest distance is expected to have a shorter travel time than the current route

Due to the distribution process in this area takes place every day, then in a month can be calculated that the company 
experience saving distance of 162 km or if calculated cost savings of vehicle fuel with assumption a litre of Pertalite 
can go for 10 kilometres and the  price of Pertalite is IDR 7,400.00 per litre then it will save 119,880.00 per day. For 
one year it can save IDR 41,958,000.00, with the assumption of 350 work days per year. Of course, it is a considerable 
saving because of no investment should be made. 
4. Conclusion
From result of data processing that have been done can be concluded that result of determination of VRPTW
model by using Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm get optimal proposed route with total distance of 32.6 km with 
estimated time of 1 hour 28 minutes compared to existing route with 38 km distance and estimated time of 1 hour 44 
minutes. So the new route produced is better because it has a shorter time and a shorter distance that can result in 
savings of IDR 41,958,000.00 with no investment is made. Further research can be conducted by combining using 
qualitative methods that will enrich the model and can reflect the real condition more closely.
