Abstract 
 
This article presents a novel direct search method of optimization, Game of Patterns (GoP) method, so-
called by the author, for solving unconstrained mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. The GoP 
method is based on: a set of Œ∑ random patterns search, which initially forms the set of Œ∑ active players, 
namely, ‚Ñã
[], ‚Ä¶ ‚Ñã	
; and a game rule framework. At each kth game round, each th active player ‚Ñã
[] 
will explore inside his own pattern at the current kth round. The strategy of each th player is given by a 
random quantity 
[], which will allow each player to explore inside his own pattern by a set of 
[]trial 
points. At the beginning of each kth game round, each active th player bets 
[] according to his budge 
Me for each round. At the end of each kth round, the player that has identified the best objective function 
value is considered the winner of the kth round, therefore the rest of active players must pay off to the 
winner their bets. This process is recurrently repeated until that has been disqualified  ‚àí1 players from 
the game. It is worthwhile to point out that any player will be disqualified if his balance account 
[] is 
less than his budget Me for the current kth round.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, optimization problems in business, medicine, engineering sciences, and applied sciences nowadays are 
more and more complex, which can involve both continuous and integer variables are able to describe many real 
world problems. 
 
Furthermore, the problems of optimum designs are often studied in engineering science. Examples of this kind of 
problems are presented by Brea (2009, 2013), who describes a set of several engineering problems. Floudas (1995) 
also presents a wide set of optimum designs for chemistry process plants under a viewpoint of optimization. 
Moreover, Yang and coworker (2012) present the approach of game theory for using in multi-objective optimization 
problems, and Audet, et al., (2001) have proposed pattern search method for locally solving constrained mixed 
integer nonlinear problems. 
 
In our case, we shall use both an approach of game theory and a random pattern search algorithm, the Mixed Integer 
Randomized Pattern Search Algorithm (MIRPA) (Brea, 2015), for proposing the design of a novel direct search 
optimization method, Game of Patterns (GoP) method, so-called by the author, allows us to identify at less, a local 
optimum solution to unconstrained mixed integer nonlinear problems. Much has been written on optimization and 
the theory of game. Nevertheless, our focus has been on using the theory of game for including a theoretical 
framework, what will be defined as a new heuristics for identifying local solutions to unconstrained mixed integer 
nonlinear optimization problems. In this case, a zero-sum game framework was defined, therefore, each player

In this case, n=m=2, the parameters of the GoP methods were fixed at: a = b = 0.9, c = Œî = 5, e = 10fi, 
W = Œ¶ = 100, the number of sampling equal to 1000, number of players Œ∑=5, and the same start point, which was 
fixed at 0 for all components of  j,. From the table, we can say the GoP method identifies the global minimum.

From the report, 876 replications yielded a DTP less than 0.013, what allow us to indicate the GoP method 
satisfactorily identifies in this case the global minimum. 
 
7. Conclusions
The GoP method has shown us to be a good enough heuristic method for identifying at least a local optimal 
solutions to mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. Preliminary results have allowed us to figure out the 
GoP method can be used for solving mixed integer nonlinear global optimization problems. However, we need to 
study some converge properties of the GoP method first. An experimental scheme will be proposed for tuning the 
parameters of the GoP method for improving its performance.  
In order to keep developing the method, we shall also research others discrete distribution for choosing the strategy 
of each player for improving the competition among the players.  
 
A. Appendix
A set of mixed integer optimization problems are here shown for testing the GoP. A notation is defined for each 
problem, which allows us to define the dimension of the problems in ‚Ñù' √ó ‚Ñ§(. 
 
A.1 Goldstein-Price problem 
Although the Goldstein-Price function is defined in the two-dimension real numeric field, we have used it for testing 
the GoP method, due to the fact this function has been frequently used to test global optimization algorithms (Shi 
and √ìlafsson, 2000).

Abstract 
Asean Economic Community 2016 has been creating more challenges in logistics industries in Indonesia. 
The implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) in logistic services is needed for increasing competitiveness 
leading to the establishment of so-called smart logistic transport. We propose the implementation model of 
the Indonesian Smart Logistic Transport, by focusing on cold supply chain system. We have conducted an 
engineering economic analysis of the smart logistics transport, in relation with the mobile network platform 
of 2G, 3G, 4G. Development of the implementation model is completed by conducting in-depth interviews 
with the application customers, technological vendors, regulator and network provider. Based on 
implementation trial in September-October 2015 and engineering economic analysis, we have found that 
Smart Logistic Transport is not feasible only on scenario 3 for CD6 at 4G network. Such condition is caused 
by the expensive price of 4Gs M2M gateway module and MDVR. Therefore, it requires the minimum 
amount of implemented truck to make implementation feasible. Our proposed model has signified 11 
features, i.e. 2 basic feature and 9 advanced features, formulating the Indonesian smart logistics transport 
system. Due to the dynamic business process, customers may need specific advanced features in 
the future. By taking such opportunity, Indonesian local content developer can work to develop 
any relevant application features, which is needed by the logistic companies in the near future.

Abstract 
Revenue generation of a logistics company depends on how the logistics cost of a shipment is calculated. 
Logistics cost of a shipment is a function of distance & speed of the shipment travel in a particular network , its 
volumetric size and dead weight. Logistics billing is based mainly on the consumption of the scarce resource 
(space or weight carrying capacity of a carrier). Shipment‚Äôs size or deadweight is a function of product and 
packaging weight, dimensions and flexibility.  
Hence, to arrive at a standard methodology to compute accurate cost to bill the customer, the interplay among 
above mentioned physical attributes along with their measurement plays key role. This becomes even more 
complex for an ecommerce company, like Flipkart, which caters to shipments from both warehouse and 
marketplace in an unorganized non-standard market like India. 
In this paper, we‚Äôll explore various methodologies to define a standard way of billing the non-standard 
shipments across wide range of size, shape and deadweight. Those will be, usage of historical volumetric / dead 
weight data to arrive at a factor which can be used to compute the logistics cost of a shipment, also calculating 
the real/contour volume of a shipment to address the problem of irregular shipment shapes which cannot be 
solved by conventional bounding box volume measurements. We‚Äôll also discuss certain key business practices 
and operational quality considerations needed to bring standardization and drive appropriate ownership in the 
ecosystem.

Abstract 
This article aims to show the second phase of a research about a methodology for decision making in 
contracting and supply and demand of transport in the Supply Chain (SC), using a consolidation strategy. 
Consolidation is used to solve producers‚Äô and transporters‚Äô needs to reduce cost, maximize service level 
between origin and destination and improve flexibility of multimodal transport. It is caused because of a) 
Equipment‚Äôs Consolidation (EC) capacity, b) use of Chassis Truck (CT) for several transport methods, 
merchandise type and Cargo Unit‚Äôs (CU) nature. The first objective of this article is to show the 
nomenclature for different kind of alternatives for transport consolidation, which is proposed based on a 
previous literature review, where were found Inventory Consolidation Models, Collaboration Strategies, 
Models for Terminal Optimization, among others; but no inventory and interaction of all possible 
alternatives of CU, EC, CT in multimodal features which allow a clear and easy identification in decision 
making. The second objective is the selection of EC using the nomenclature previously proposed with 
PROMETHEE I, II method and the use of GAIA Graphic (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive AID) under 
criteria described in Transport Multicriteria Decision Making (TMDM), therefore, a consolidation study

Resumen 
Este art√≠culo es parte de la segunda fase de la investigaci√≥n de una metodolog√≠a para la toma de decisiones 
en contrataci√≥n y oferta del transporte en la Cadena de Suministro (CS), utilizando la estrategia de 
consolidaci√≥n. La consolidaci√≥n nace de las necesidades intr√≠nsecas de los productores o transportadores 
de minimizar el costo, maximizar el nivel de servicio entre un origen y un destino y la flexibilidad en la 
multimodalidad. La consolidaci√≥n se da por la capacidad del Equipo de Consolidaci√≥n (EC), el uso de la 
Unidad de Arrastre (UA) para varias modalidades, el tipo de mercanc√≠a y la naturaleza de la Unidad de 
Carga (UC). El primer aporte del art√≠culo es la nomenclatura de las alternativas para consolidaci√≥n de

Abstract 
Fractionation is important to understand someone‚Äôs health. How we can simulate blood 
fractionation through a simple, inexpensive ink spread experiment more about blood 
fractionation and liquid chromatography. Cotton will spread on ink the most because it has the 
most pores. Pilot ink spreads fast because it is water-based (low viscosity). Higher temperatures 
should result in more spread because of lower viscosity.  We measured the ink spread by taking 
the average between high and low ink mark points. We check our measurement repeatability and 
determined our sample size. The results repeatedly showed that nylon was the material with the 
least ink spread, with water not spreading at all, pilot ink barely spreading, and India ink 
spreading very little. For polyester, water spread much better than nylon.  It was clearly shown 
that higher temperatures meant more spread. We heated the cotton cloth only since using heat 
transfer from the water to the ink is too long and the water vapor would block the pores from 
absorbing the ink. We learned more about using statistics graphs and tables. We also learned 
how to control the experiment and determine the sample size through teamwork building. We 
would thank our teachers and parents for advising.

1. Introduction of Chromatography Science and Ink Spread Experiment
In medical Science, separation of blood helps understand the health condition. Red blood cells can carry oxygen to organs and 
remove carbon dioxide. White blood cells are essential to the immune system.  Platelets are needed to clot your blood when you 
are bleeding.  Though, the process of blood fractionation is costly and complex.  The objective of this STEM project is to design a 
simplified, inexpensive ink spread experiment to study Chromatography Science and Applications, and Simulate Blood 
Fractionation.  Chromatography is method for separating the parts of a mixture of either a gas or liquid solution containing 
different chemicals [1,2,3,4].  The mechanism of ink or blood spread is by a process called calligraphic motion.   There is research on 
how to purify the blood by modern techniques [5,6,7].  In this STEM project, authors use liquid chromatography over gas 
chromatography due to budget constraint.  During ink chromatography, mobile phase is water or ink, stationary phase is the 
different types of cloth.  The solvent is the water. The solute is the ink pigments (blood cells).  When ink/blood spreads, it is going 
through the pores in the medium (cloth).  The affinity between the solute and the pores determines chromatography. The spreading 
difference among water mark, ink mark, and base mark can simulate the blood fractionation. 
2. Define Project Scope
In order to define project scope, team has conducted (1) 5 Whys Analysis, and (2) SIPOC Analysis.

1st Why did the Pilot ink spread faster than Water?

Answer= Due to lower viscosity of the Pilot Ink.

5 Conclusions 
This project has designed ink spreading experimental and demonstrated the ink spread property to simulate the 
blood fractionation.  It‚Äôs very critical to control the measurement repeatability and quantify the spread distance.  The 
cotton cloth has a better spread behavior over Polyester and Nylon due to its better media pore affinity.  Pilot Ink is 
also over India Ink due to its lower viscosity.  Heating the cloth over Ink can better control on temp factor and 
improve the ink spreading.   Confidence interval statistics and Power Test sample size are applied in order to meet 
the project budget limit.

Abstract 
The Triathlon is an Olympic event that affects the entire city. This STEM paper is to manage the 
road closure time of a triathlon event in any City who may have a Triathlon event. In order to 
quantify the Road Closure Impact to meet 5.5 hours of closure time, authors have developed three 
different models: (1) Ideal Scenario, (2) Practical Scenario, and (3) Potential Scenario. In the first 
Ideal Scenario, authors applied Minitab descriptive statistics and box plots to optimize the event 
schedule and sequence among three Triathlon sports (Swim, Run, and Bike). In the second Practical 
Scenario, authors have managed the risks such as: pre-event preparation time, award ceremony 
time, dependency on Gender, Age, Category factors, 2000+ players, Safety/Health, etc. In the last 
Potential Scenario, we have further optimized the Zone Close and Open period. We can minimize 
the Zone wasted usage (waiting for players) based on the Worst Case Scenario. The biggest selling 
point of this paper is not just on the Closure Cost reduction, but also on the Safety/Health protection 
as well as promoting customer service and local business. This event may be completed on the 
event day, but our excellent customer service can attract more visitors to join the next city event. 
Key Words: Triathlon, Descriptive Statistics, Minitab, Model, Non-Parametric 
1. Introduction
Triathlon is a multisport event consisting of sequential swim, cycle, and run disciplines performed 
over a variety of distances1. The Purpose of this paper is to build an accurate model to manage a 
triathlon event in a city. There is one concern / restriction; the road closure time for the triathlon 
event has to be less than or equal to 5.5 hours in order to minimize the impact to the local people 
and business. We used data from 2017 HiMCM competition. In order to make that happen, we need 
to build a model that could tell us critical information like when we should hold the event, how are 
we going to arrange the sequence among the three sports etc. We will apply Minitab descriptive 
statistics, and three models to optimize the Road Closure time and area. 
2. Building three Models
Three different models were constructed for three different scenarios; one being the ideal scenario, 
assuming that no unexpected events such as injuries, weather concerns occur.  Therefore, the first 
ideal model may not be practical and needs certain improvements 
The second model is the practical scenario, in which we consider the possible risks such as injuries, 
effect on local traffic and life overall, weather concerns, age dependency etc. We will take those 
into account and consider possible changes to the arrangement of the event in a practical sense. 
37","3.3 Model 3 Potential Scenario 
 
Model 3 is the potential model that considers: 
‚Ä¢ 
How do we further optimize road closure time? 
‚Ä¢ 
Should we place these senior players in the back line when starting the Swim event? 
‚Ä¢ 
Can we claim any age dependency?  
 
In order to answer these questions, we constructed a scatterplot and regression model by Minitab 
software as shown in Figure 6.  
 
 
 
Figure 6: Scatterplot on age dependency. 
 
We chose scatterplot because it may show us any correlation between the total time and age. As 
shown in the graph, the R-Square is only at 0% (random pattern), which means Age is not a factor 
that affects the participants‚Äô finish time. However, the level and age of triathlon competitors, and 
the race distance, influenced the risk of injury over a race series. These results provide timely 
information for triathlon race event organizers and could be incorporated into a review of practices 
for the provision of medical services to triathlon events, especially the common sprint distance 
competitions5. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
We will start Triathlon event with swim, then run, and bike based on the cycle time distribution 
and safety consideration.  In order to meet 5.5 hours of road closure time requirement, we need to 
apply 2 disqualify rules to shorten the event duration.  We will also hold the award ceremony in 
the end, and we will not separate male and female players or by age factor, as our model shows that 
there is no significance in doing so.  We will take safety risk as top priority.

Abstract 
This project is to build a statistical model to predict who will win 2017 NBA Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) Award. The player statistics have been standardized to the Z scale in each player statistics 
category in order to remove any mean and standard deviation effect. The ‚ÄúMVP Index‚Äù has been derived 
from combining each player‚Äôs Z statistics as a ""Uniform"" model. To evaluate the model accuracy, team 
has derived another ‚ÄúAccuracy Index‚Äù of predicting the top five MVP players recognized annually. The 
first ‚ÄúUniform‚Äù model can predict the top five winners at 47% accuracy.  Team has further derived the 
""Weighted"" model by adding the weight factor. The ‚ÄúWeighted‚Äù model has further improved the 
Accuracy Index from 47% to 52%.  Authors have added the ""Team Winning"" factor.  Power 
transformation will improve the model accuracy but which may also create any over-fit concern when 
power level is getting higher.  Based on the Power Model, team can improve the Accuracy Index to 70% 
at Power=3.  Authors also used Data Mining Discriminant analysis to rank players into clusters.  The 
Discriminant model accuracy is only 55%. Team will use the Power=3 model to predict 2017 MVP at the 
season end.

1. Introduction
Sports are big part of our daily life.  Every major city has their professional teams and local fans are very supportive 
to their local professional players as their heroes or role models.  National Basketball Associate (NBA) is the largest 
basketball organization.  Each year, in addition to the Regular Season Winner, NBA league would also announce the 
Regular Season Awards.  Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is the most recognized award.  In the past, some MVP 
winners like Michael Jordan were very obvious and consensus winners without any doubt.  Though, some MVP 
winners were questionable.  This paper would try to formulate what could be the most deciding factors to formulate 
the MVP ranking based on their individual season performance and their team performance.   
In major professional sports, the coach and team management are looking for ways to win more games in order to attract more fans 
to support their business.  Sports statistical modeling analytics1, 2 is becoming a critical approach to uncover the 
winning patterns hidden in sports data collected during each game played.  The objective of this paper is to build a 
statistical model based on the past NBA MVP Winners and their individual and team season performance in order to 
predict the NBA 2016-2017 Regular Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) in which official result will be released in 
June 2017. 
There are several research talks presented in MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference3-5.  These papers have used 
intensive Analytics to uncover players‚Äô playing patterns and help coach develop each player in order to create and 
maximize each player‚Äôs values to their specific team. Our paper will provide the predictive methodology to be 
applied in the end of the regular season (April 2017).  In below Figure 16, one Sports Analytics company has 
predicted the 2016-2017 MVP Award Odds in the early season.  Our paper would build a predictive model to predict 
who will win the 2016-2017 MVP Award.

3.4.  Data Mining Discriminant Model 
 
Data Mining Discriminant analysis12 has been utilized to identify the basketball performance indicators in regular 
season and playoff games.  Discriminant analysis was used to split the actual winners (true groups) into 5 
discriminant clusters based on the Z Scale Statistics. The discriminant analysis like affinity analysis can group the 
similar players together based on their statistics purely with equal weight.  It‚Äôs interesting to apply Data Mining 
algorithms on this MVP case study.  The Discriminant model accuracy is at 54.5% not better than Power model 
shown in Table 1.  The Discriminant model is not considering the team record factor.  There are still some values in 
this Discriminant model since which is still better than the Uniform Model and Weighted Model without considering 
the Team factor.

4 Results and Conclusions 
 
Author has utilized JMP statistics software Z transformation, Descriptive statistics, Power Transformation, Best 
Subset, and Data Mining Discriminant analysis to build four different predictive models to predict the NBA MVP 
winners.  Table 2 has shown the model algorithm and accuracy comparison. Power=3 model has shown the better 
prediction capability which has indicated the importance of team performance on the MVP selection process.  
Power=3 model will be utilized to predict the 2017 MVP winner in mid-April 2017 when the MVP regular season 
will be ended.

past top 5 MVP winners at 70% accuracy.  This model can demonstrate the potential to make the MVP selection 
process more objective and transparent than current more subjective methodology (voting).  This modeling concept 
can be also applied to Olympic Event and other Professional Sports such as Football, Baseball, and Soccer.

Abstract 
Athletic records are broken year after year, and the limits of human performance 
continue to be debated. Just as soon as we think something can‚Äôt be done, someone comes along 
and shows us that it indeed can be done. It is revealed that having fast and slow twitch 
muscle fibers may determine what sports athletes excel at and how they respond to training. 
Human muscle fiber type may influence what sports we are naturally good at or whether we 
are fast or strong. Muscle fiber types can be broken down into two main types: slow twitch 
(Type I) muscle fibers and fast twitch (Type II) muscle fibers. These distinctions seem to 
influence how muscles respond to training and physical activity, and each fiber type is unique in 
its ability to contract in a certain way. If it is possible to determine the proportion of these 
fibers, it helps for the early prediction of human capability for the selection of right event. 
Slow twitch fibers help enable long-endurance feats such as distance running, while fast-
twitch muscles fatigue faster but are used in powerful bursts of movements like sprinting and 
the proposed a prototype aims at finding  which muscle fiber type is predominant and in that 
way foster the development to improve the capability of individuals,by evaluating the fast and 
slow twitch muscle fibers. Predominance is found based on analyzing those parameters 
which differentiates slow and fast twitch muscle fiber. Although many elite athletes are 
blessed with the right genetics for their sport and a great training routine, even recreational 
athletes can make the most of their abilities with optimal conditioning.

Abstract 
Welding flux design is a multi-objective optimization problem with several conflicting objectives. The 
traditional welding flux development is unwieldy process involving lengthy and costly, trial and error 
experiments and the optimum welding flux formulation is not guaranteed. This paper proposed a 
methodology that will prescribe an optimal welding flux formulation that is the closest to the ideal flux 
with minimum cost and experimental effort. Response models developed by Kanjilal and co-investigators 
were used to determine the optimal flux formulation using compromise programming. Analytical 
hierarchy process was used to determine the weight (wj) to reflect the relative importance of each 
criterion. The response models for the weld metal properties, were optimised individually to determine 
the ideal points and to set up the payoff matrix. The payoff matrix developed for the eight criteria showed 
that two criteria were complementary while others were conflicting. The side plate ferrite and charpy 
impact strength were the two complementary criteria. The Lp distance metric was used to determine the 
flux formulation for varying values of the p and wj. Compromise programming is an efficient method in 
determining the welding flux formulation thereby eliminating the problem faced by the traditional 
method. 
Keywords

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Welding flux design is an unwieldy process requiring lengthy trial and error experiments based on the principles of 
metallurgy, physics, and chemistry tempered with experience. The extensive and expensive trial and error 
experiments are required because it is often difficult to know a priori how the flux ingredients interact to determine 
the operational characteristics of the flux during welding and the final properties of the weld-metal (Adeyeye and 
Oyawale, 2008). Kanjilal et al (2007b) proposed prediction models for submerged arc welding flux and pointed out 
that some of the individual flux ingredients and their binary mixtures have a predominant effect on weld metal 
transfer of oxygen, manganese, silicon, and carbon contents. Since the appearance of Kanjilal et al (2004, 2005, 
2007a and 2007b) papers, there has been an increased interest in the development of prediction and optimization

combined with the small grain size of the acicular ferrite produces a considerable high yield and tensile strength (da 
Trindade Filho et al., 2004). 
 
3.2 CASE 2: CRITERIA ARE OF VARYING DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE  
In real life, criteria are not of equal importance. Here, the welding flux designer considers all criteria to be of 
different weights. The flux formulation under L1 was 27.98% of CaO, 10% of MgO, 10% of CaF2 and 32.02% of 
Al2O3. For L‚àû, it was 33.13% of CaO, 10% of MgO, 12.97% of CaF2 and 23.71% of Al2O3 and for L2 the flux 
formulation was 28.38% of CaO, 10% of MgO, 10% of CaF2 and 31.62% of Al2O3. The response of each objective 
under L1 and L‚àû was calculated since all compromise solutions are bounded by L1 and L‚àû (Gan et al. 1996). Table 
12 also shows the response of each objective under L1, L2 and L‚àû.  
 
From Table 12, L1 and L2 achievement levels were closest to the ideal when compared to L‚àû. Under L‚àû the acicular 
ferrite content was 36.6% and the corresponding yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and charpy impact strength 
were 379MPa, 544MPa and 28.5 joules respectively. The achievement under L2 was 44.1% of acicular ferrite 
content with an improvement in the mechanical properties (yield strength = 393MPa, ultimate tensile strength = 
580MPa and charpy impact strength = 33.5 joules) of the weld and the achievement under L1 with 44.2% of acicular 
ferrite content also showed good mechanical properties (yield strength = 392MPa, ultimate tensile strength = 
581MPa and charpy impact strength = 33.5 joules) of the weld. The achievement level under L‚àû showed the highest 
concentration of side plate ferrite, grain boundary ferrite and polygonal ferrite when compared to the other two 
metrics for both scenarios. The achievement level under L1 and L2 were the closest to the ideal. This showed the best 
value in mechanical property.   
 
4.0 CONCLUSION 
Compromise programming model has been proposed for welding flux development for submerged arc welding. The 
approach is useful for determining the best compromise flux formulation when various conflicting performance 
criteria are considered. The weld metal responses such as microstructural and mechanical properties in submerged 
arc welding have been optimized. The proposed method eliminates the problem experienced by the traditional 
welding flux development to give the best balance among several conflicting quality criteria. The welding flux 
designer can use different weight structures to explore trade-off options before choosing the formulation that best 
suits his needs. This approach is also useful for identifying complementary and conflicting criteria.

Abstract 
In this paper a Fuller and Thompson equation and gradation curves were applied to 100% Recycled Coarse 
Aggregates (RCA). A total of 300 samples of concrete made up 100% RCA were analysed and tested at 7, 
14 and 28 days according to BS EN 12390-3, 2002. The average compressive strengths achieved for the 
Recycled Aggregates Concrete was approximately 83.0 mPa, the highest ever recorded compressive 
strength from the concrete manufactured using 100% recycled course aggregates. 
Keywords: Recycled aggregates concrete, high strength, packing density 
1.0 Introduction 
Today there is impressive increase in the use of recycled concrete, but basically these recycled aggregates are used as 
fillers in road construction and in low-level applications due to impurities and defects associated with recycled 
aggregates.(Tu, et al.  2006).  In analyzing research works done by Yehia et al. (2015), Sivakumar et al. (2014), Fennis 
and Walraven (2012), Motwani et al. (2013), Mwasha and Lalla (2011, Mwasha and Lalla (2012), Richarson et al. 
(2010), Fennis et al. (2009)  Mwasha and Mark (2008), Movassaghi (2006), Shing Chai et al. (2004) and Limbachiya 
et al. (2000) it was found that all these authors agreed that  many benefits which promote sustainability were offered 
from producing recycled aggregate concrete. Some of these benefits include reduction in the amount of natural 
aggregates required due to coarse recycled aggregate replacement and converting tons of building construction and 
demolition wastes from landfill. Despite the economic and environmental benefits of concrete produced with Recycled 
Concrete Aggregates (RCA) and steadily increased usage of the material, the construction industry has not totally 
embraced it, especially for structural applications, partly due to previous findings that have concluded that RCA-
concrete is inherently inferior to conventional concrete made with natural aggregate (Mas et al., 2012), Richardson et 
al. (2010),  (Fathifazi, at. el.  2009) and (Katz, 2003). These authors have also concluded that Recycled Aggregate 
Concrete is lower than that of virgin aggregate concrete due to the occurrence of porous residual mortar coating the 
Recycled Aggregates.   
This paper seeks to provide a solution to the construction industry for using Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) in 
an efficient and sustainable manner to produce High Strength Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) for use in high 
strength structural applications. To achieve these aims the three categories of aggregates were tested under laboratory 
conditions, natural aggregates (C1) as the control sample, High Strength Recycled Aggregates (C2) and Low Strength 
Recycled Aggregates (C3). The PPO methods based on Fuller and Thompson equation and gradation curves were 
applied to 100% Recycled Coarse Concrete Aggregates. A total of 96 samples were analyzed and tested at 7, 14 and 28 
days according to BS EN 12390-3, 2002. The results showed that by applying PPO to recycled aggregates it is possible 
to achieve high strength concrete with compressive strengths above 80 MPa. This high compressive strength for RAC 
is rare and worth to explore more.

then the w/c ratio would be maintained and higher compressive strengths would be expected for the saturated aggregate 
mixes.       
The water absorption capacity must be considered for the RA and the total overall amount of water in the mixes must 
be the same, i.e absorption water and mixing/hydrating water, when comparing mixes with dry RA against mixes with 
saturated surface dried RA. This was considered in the  experiments for this research project, where additional water 
was added to the original w/c ratio content for mixes with dry recycled aggregates to cater for their water absorption 
capacity, whereas the original water cement ratio was maintained for the mixes containing the soaked RA.      
There were no trends observed to confirm that the saturated particles resulted in better packing density or resulted in 
samples of higher concrete density.

 Most researchers shown in Table 8 have observed the general trend in reduction of the compressive strength with 
increase in the RA percent. However in this paper 100% recycled coarse aggregates were utilized and the results 
obtained have surpassed the trend, that when using 30-40% RA replacement, only can high compressive strengths be 
maintained.  
4.0 Conclusions and Recommendations 
This paper has demonstrated that recycled aggregates can be used to manufacture high strength concrete. Using high 
strength concrete manufactured using recycled concrete aggregates promotes sustainability this is because it is 
environmentally friendly and the landfills are relieved from concrete debris as well as both embodied energy and 
embodied pollution is reduced.  
The aim of this paper was set out to determine whether by applying particle packing optimization to recycled concrete 
aggregates and pre-soaking duration of the recycled aggregates would result in high strength concrete. It was found in 
this paper that gradations calculated according to the Fuller equation results in an aggregate combination with highest 
packing density. Having graded the natural and recycled aggregates according to the Fuller and Thompson (1907) 
equation/gradation charts has proven to result in an aggregate combination that carried the highest packing density 
when compared to combinations above and below this gradation curve. It was found that natural aggregate concrete 
produced the highest compressive strengths (106.2 MPa) followed by the HSRA concrete (82.7 MPa) and then the 
LSRA concrete (76.9MPa). These results are superior to those obtained from the published research on using recycled 
aggregates as shown in Table 7. The high compressive strength might have been induced about by the utilization of 
micro silica. Micro silica like other pozzolanic materials leads to a reduction of the size of the crystalline compounds, 
particularly, calcium hydroxide, consequently, there is a reduction of the thickness of the Interfacial Transition Zone 
(ITZ) in high-strength concrete. The densification of the interfacial transition zone allows for efficient load transfer 
between the cement mortar and the coarse aggregate, contributing to the strength of the concrete. For very high-
strength concrete where the matrix is extremely dense, a weak aggregate may become the weak link in concrete

strength (Metha and Monteiro 2004). From the density results obtained the micro silica did have the effect as described 
above.  
4.1 Recommendations  
4.1.1 Recommendations for future research work 
‚Ä¢
A major factor to be taken in account is how particles of different shapes (recycled aggregate particles)
interface with the bonding mortar paste between them. This would be a step closer in understanding the true
in depth relationship between particle packing and compressive strength, hence it is recommended that further
research be done in this area.
‚Ä¢
It was found that the rate at which water absorption takes place during mixing of the RAC is slower than
expected leaving free water available to aid in workability. An investigation into how this water is absorbed
is also recommended in determining whether the w/c ratio of the mix is increased resulting in a lower mortar
paste quality lowering the concretes‚Äô compressive strength.

Abstract 
Due to global competition, many organizations are coming up with ways of sharpening their 
competitive edge. This has been achieved through cost leadership, differentiation of goods and 
services and lastly, through quick response to the needs of the customers. To respond to 
these market requirements, manufacturers are using high-tech equipment.  They are also 
adopting new material control methods such as Just-In-Time philosophy. Set-up costs are also 
being minimized to a minimum. All these factors are shifting the focus to maintenance since 
unreliability and availability of manufacturing equipment will result in high maintenance costs, 
low profitability, low production and an increase in customer dissatisfaction. At East African 
Portland Cement Company, the raw mill plant has led to the above problems which in turn 
lead to negative feedbacks from the customers and as a result, there is need to develop a 
maintenance concept that will respond to the challenges mentioned above. Consequently, in 
this research an analysis of various the maintenance concepts were investigated.  
Overall Equipment Effectiveness of the Raw mill plant was evaluated and analyzed. Downtime 
analysis was also done to establish the major causes of low plant availability. From the research, 
it can be deduced that East African Portland Cement Company requires a harmonized 
maintenance concept regarding inspection, regular maintenance; repair and overhaul, 
scheduled and preventive maintenance of the main components as well as environmental 
auditing during operation to ensure that the plant is fully operational and efficient. Total 
Productive Maintenance concept therefore has been identified as key to the meeting of 
organizational objectives of the company. A customized framework of Total productive 
maintenance deployment at East African Portland Cement Company has been developed 
with six step transformation steps used in embedding high performance culture. It is 
expected that an implementation of this project will lead to a reduction in failures, time to 
perform a repair and an elongation in the mean time between failures hence higher plant

(c) IEOM","Conclusion 
The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) has been analyzed for three financial years 
(2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2012/2013) and it was established that the achieved OEE value has a 
huge variance compared with the targeted OEE value of 90%. By comparing with the world-
class value for OEE which is 85.41%, there was no single month in which the targeted OEE 
value was achieved for the 36 months period 
It was also established that the three major causes of low availability of the Raw mill plant are 
downtime due to production (scheduled cleaning, start ups, rework), works (planned shutdown 
maintenance) and mechanical breakdown. A Pareto analysis reveals that a reduction in the 
downtime of the three can greatly reduce the overall downtime on the raw mill hence resulting 
into improved availability 
A customized framework of TPM deployment at EAPCC has been developed to improve Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) to 85% and this will result into improved productivity and 
profitability. 
The developed customized framework of TPM deployment at EAPCC could be adopted by other 
similar manufacturing plants and also be used along other literature. Comparative analysis of the 
various maintenance concepts has been done and OEE methodology explored to determine the 
need for TPM deployment. By developing an effective maintenance concept that binds together 
all the maintenance policies, maintenance actions and strategies for maintenance, the number of 
stoppages in the raw mill will greatly be reduced by increasing the mean time between 
stoppages. This will increase the monthly production for the company as a result of improved 
raw mill availability and reliability. With increased production, the revenue will be greatly 
increased resulting into increased profitability.

Abstract 
Fringe projection entails projecting a fringe pattern or grating on an object and viewing it from a different 
direction. It is a convenient technique for contouring objects that are too coarse to be measured with 
standard interferometry. Fringe projection is related to optical triangulation using a single point of light and 
light sectioning where a single line is projected onto an object and viewed in a different direction to 
determine the surface contour (Case et al. 1987). The fringe patterns are projected on to the object surface 
and the deformed grating image is captured by a CCD camera for subsequent analysis. Phase shifting 
techniques have been employed to determine the phase value. The phase variation is achieved by using a 
linear translation stage incorporated to the grating.  In this paper, the surface profile of objects for 3D 
printers is determined by using fringe pattern.

Could occupational role stress be suppressed to the extent 
of been dissolved? 
Abstract 
This paper forms part of a comparative study that explored the effects of occupational role stress on selected 
employees working in two banks with branches in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. A survey of hundred 
respondents was conducted using a questionnaire was based on factors that promote stress versus those that 
dissolve  stress both, relating to issues involving occupational role stress among bank employees. The paper 
discusses the strategies adopted to manage stress. The analysis of the data shows that the relationship between the 
expectations of the superiors of the respondents and the expectations of their junior staff were causes of 
occupational role stress. Conversely, the ability of respondents to use their education and expertise in their duties 
and, the correlation with their personal values and job requirements, has the ability to mitigate and dissolve 
occupational role stress in the workplace.  However, the respondents expressed ambivalent views on, feeling 
overburdened in their role functions, the possibility of their occupational roles interfering with their family lives. 
The ambivalent views further go on with their role functions when having been assigned to some entities or people; 
the relationship between their occupational roles and their personal interests and, lastly, how the amount of work the 
respondents were required to do interfered with the quality of their work.

Abstract 
The aim of the study is to analyze current situation and challenges of use of Information Communication 
Technology (ICT) solutions in Small business (SB) in general and particularly in Latvia and propose 
recommendation for better use of ICT tools and solutions to enable faster growth of companies operating 
in SB segment. The scope is limited to ICT solutions, tools and supporting infrastructure. Extensive 
literature review and statistical data analyses are conducted. Main sources are World Economic Forum 
materials, surveys on global ICT development by various international organizations, Latvian ICT tools` / 
solutions` penetration survey, Central Statistical Bureau and materials prepared by Latvian Investment and 
Development Agency. Most widely used is information gathered from focus groups interviews and data 
analyses. The main conclusions are that still many companies operating in SB sector in Latvia currently 
underestimate benefits of implementation of ICT tools and solutions. Latvia`s ICT infrastructure is well 
developed and serves as a solid base for more efficient use of ICT solutions and tools as well in SB to 
facilitate faster growth and competitiveness. ICT as a driver of economic growth is evident form variety of 
data, surveys and case studies covered further in the paper.

Introduction 
World Economic Forum recognizes ICT industry as important factor of economic growth globally (The Global 
Information Technology Report, 2013). As well European Union (EU) emphasizes ICT industry‚Äôs importance in EU 
planning documents - Europe 2020 Strategy (EUROPE 2020‚Ä¶, 2010). Majority of world`s countries ICT is less than 
10% of GDP but nevertheless 90% of public and private sectors are dependent on ICT services and products. ICT 
solutions` implementation at least triples annual productivity growth rate (Atkinson, 2015). Eighty two percent of 
Latvian companies admit that ICT solutions and services significantly increase business process efficiency by time 
saving (53%), cost saving (34%), more secure information storage (28%) and new know-how (26-27%). Top 
management at 84% of Latvian companies acknowledge that technology helps promoting their production and 
services, and is one of key resources to ensure competitiveness (BiSMART, 2015). Reliable ICT infrastructure is one 
of the key elements for successful development of ICT services and products, for attraction of foreign direct 
investments as well as for each country‚Äôs economic growth in general. 
Methodology of Research    
The research is based on extensive literature review learning about the importance of the ICT industry`s role in 
facilitating overall economic growth and competitive advantage and particular attention is devoted to the ICT role for

Table 8 addresses some of the concerns shown in Table 7, e.g. High switching costs and undetermined final cost of 
the service; Integration with existing systems. It is visible that by switching to Cloud services, companies can solve 
some of the currently most widespread concerns of the business, e.g. retention of current  customers, increase of 
customer loyalty, attraction of new customers and cost management.  
 
Another survey conducted among companies that adopted cloud services emphasized that cloud services enable 
solving the issues which are currently faced by Latvian SBs: (Getting Into The Cloud, 2014)

Conclusions 
Modern and innovative ICT infrastructure is the driving force for the economic growth and competitiveness of each 
country. 
Latvia`s ICT infrastructure is well developed to ensure implementation of various ICT tools and solutions to support 
business needs and enable faster growth of the businesses, including SB segment.  
Nevertheless, the existing IT and telecommunications infrastructure will not be sustainable without attracting and 
ensuring additional investments for research and development of new products and services and for introduction it 
into the market. 
ICT is important growth enabler for SB segment providing access to e-commerce which is currently fastest growing 
trade option. 
Companies qualifying as SB in Latvia should focus more on implementation of ICT projects to support their business 
processes and increase effectiveness of their operation work through cloud services / cloud based IT. This could be 
supported by European Union (EU) funds if changes in the requirements could be proceeded - there are EU funds 
available for innovations, but, according to the eligibility criteria, those funds are accounted for capital expenditures 
(CAPEX) of a company, e.g., BIF (European Investment Fund, 2015). Another factor that prevents the companies 
from applying for the funds is a huge paperwork which should be reduced (Focus Group, 2015).

Abstract 
The problem of decreasing truck transportation costs for Mexican firms is of great interest and a challenge due to 
the currently deficient supply structure. This work deals with the case of leading Mexican tobacco manufacturer 
that requires a reduction of its outbound transportation cost under a declining market scenario. The approach applied 
to achieve the objective includes the elimination of important transportation wastes through mathematical modeling 
techniques. Truck fill loss and distance travelled in excess are identified as the main wastes existent in the 
transportation of finished product from the manufacturing plant, located in Monterrey, to three regional warehousing 
hubs, and then, from these to 70 distribution centers located throughout the country. The application of location 
and/or routing models imbedded into a decision analysis scheme and supported by a GIS system is carried out to 
obtain the solution to several scenarios developed by the management of the company. Results and advances of 
their implementation are provided.

1. Introduction.
The problem of concern in this paper is the reduction of outbound transportation cost. This is particularly of great importance 
for Mexican companies because of the country`s deficient logistic level of competitiveness in road transportation (IMCO 2004). 
The firm of concern is a leading producer and distributor of tobacco products to its Distribution Centers (DC) and retailing 
chains across Mexico. The national supply chain, shown in Figure 1, consists mainly of one processing plants, three 
consolidating hub centers, 57 regional distribution centers and 17 distribution centers of the leading convenience store in 
Mexico, OXXO. The transportation of the final product is outsourced to three companies; Ryder, Tres Guerras and Racing.  
The firm satisfies 40% of the Mexican market with 9 brands distributing directly 200, 000 retailing points. The company 
has experienced two important strategic issues that have impacted unfavorably its level of competitiveness and market share; 
a more stringent law enforcement against smokers and; a more severe competition from other players. As a consequence, the 
firm has seen a decrease in its national demand. The distribution cost associated has increased during the last years forcing the 
upper management to establish an objective of reducing outbound transportation. 
This work provides a brief description of the efforts of the company to implement the approach recommended by Di Vece 
et al., (2015) that has the purpose of reducing distribution cost through a change of the distribution structure and its 
improvement. The report consists of four sections with the initial dealing with a brief review of the literature on the problem. 
Then, a description of the scheme utilized is described in section 2. The application of this scheme is undertaken in section 3, 
and section 4 presents a summary of conclusions.

4.3 Implementation and results 
The implementation of the previously described initiatives is planned to be stage-wise. The authorization of the 
investment required to implement the new DC¬¥s is expected to be done during the first quarter of year 2017. 
Meanwhile, the management decided to carry out the reassignment of several DC¬¥s to new hubs, and the redefinition 
of various new routes. They also approved a pilot program of various new routes in the short run. The impact of the 
new routes on the truck capacity utilization was significant increasing from an average of 46% to the level of 74%. 
The projected new level of outbound transportation cost is expected to be 9% lower than the initial level. 
 
Simultaneously, higher management approached their transport suppliers to redefine freight terms on the basis of 
a just cost for the same service. The company was willing to provide volume and certainty in longer contracts for the 
new relationship. The additional benefits obtained with the project include a better level of service for customers 
located in the northwestern and southeastern parts of Mexico. 
 
5. Conclusions 
As initially mentioned, the problem of concern in this paper is the reduction of outbound transportation cost. The firm 
of concern is a leading producer and distributor of tobacco products to its hubs and DC¬¥s across Mexico. All the 
outbound transportation of FG is carried out completely by external suppliers. The management in charge of 
distribution and logistics of the firm decided to establish the objective of reducing inbound transportation. 
 
The scheme used to define the improvement strategy for reducing inbound transportation cost is based on the 
stages suggested by Di Vece et al., (2015) and Moore (2006). In summary, this document briefly describes the efforts 
that are part of the first three stages: price negotiation, streamlining operations and optimization. The impact of the 
implementation of the initiatives is estimated as a reduction of 9% of total outbound transport cost.

Abstract 
The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of specialized literature that includes models 
concerned with production scheduling focused on production and energy efficiency; seeking to determine 
the progress that has been achieved in recent years in these areas. 
They are rated in accordance with the field that they addressed; either, production efficiency, energy, or 
the inclusion of both as an essential part in the search for the optimization of scheduling production in the 
industrial sector. Following this, an analysis of the most relevant variables will be carried out, with the 
aim of framing what will be the definition or improvement of a production scheduling model with 
optimization of production and energy efficiency. 
Keywords 
Scheduling and planning production Models, energy efficiency 
1. Introduction
Globally, the industrial sector is the largest energy consumer; using close to 37% of the produced energy. 
Additionally, this consumption is expected to grow by around 33% by 2030, as it compares to 2010‚Äôs, which will 
bring along with the generation of the respective contamination quota [1]. 
The effect of production (surplus and products), is sought to be less contaminant with the passage of every day. 
However, this effect is still inherent to the process and has not been avoided in its entirety, generating, among other 
gases, CO2, SO2, NOX, and CO; of which we already know the consequences [2]. It has even been argued that 
human-induced climate change is directly related to energy consumption around the world, and it is expected to 
represent an additional cost in the future [1]. 
In addition, when analyzing current production planning methods and models, it can be seen that they don‚Äôt include 
the optimization of energy consumption among their main objectives, as they do with issues such as productive 
efficiency, regulated flow, management inventories, just-in-time, optimization of processing times, amid others; 
Leaving aside other elements such as downtime, processes, and effects that spring out from this way of planning, 
and are equally relevant. 
The energy issue is most often addressed at the level of components (machines and equipment). However, little 
progress has been made and implemented on the optimization of energy efficiency at the level of plants as a system 
[1]. 
Most likely this is due to the fact that there are no models to incorporate these variables from the planning process, 
as it will be seen in the assessment, and only the effects are known only when they occur; generating extra costs, 
additional times and consumption of resources which are never considered, and that increase the total productive 
cost, thus reducing the profitability of the different goods and services that are produced.

In addition, [38] proposed a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the learning goal model, [33] a 
metaheuristic ant colony model MOACO, [32] a multi-objective deterministic model, [36] an optimization model 
with Energy consumption constraints, [15] a block energy model, [41] an artificial neural network optimization 
model, and [47] intelligent search algorithms. 
 
Now, there is a great vacuum in dealing with the problem of scheduling and production planning taking into account 
energy efficiency, since few authors have approached it from different models but have left out quantitative models 
that include variables as: cost, energy efficiency impacts into production chain and financial aspects. 
 
On the other hand, the production planning studies that have been developed taking into account the energy 
efficiency factor within the scheduling variables are even more scarce, and most of them correspond to the inclusion 
of the analysis of the energy fees in different schedule times and therefore it becomes the element of definition for 
production optimization. 
 
Besides, the solutions are very particular; that is, they refer to very specific industries such as metalworking, the 
computer industry specifically in the administration and data processing. 
 
In many cases, only models are presented for two variables: the total processing time (makespan) and energy 
consumption. And in the best cases involve some additional variables such as: due date of work orders, work order 
number, energy costs and CO2 equivalent. 
 
Many of the models look for local efficiencies and they don't consider the overall efficiency of the company. Not all 
of them include economic aspects as part of the model or analysis directly. In some, impacts on productive times are 
not analyzed and are not included as an analysis variable. 
 
In no case the result of production scheduling  is showed; that is, the sequence in which production is efficiently 
performed. Only the models are presented, and their results in terms of the variables they analyze. 
 
Hence, there is a whole way to go and explore, so that these elements that are not included are part of the analysis 
and therefore of the model to be developed, and as a product this not only delivers the results of the variables, but its 
main result is the sequencing of the production program.

Abstract: During the last decade, South Africa has been dealing with a serious food crisis. The reason 
of this food crisis has been largely attributed to the effect of climate changes, land availability and high 
food prices, which in return have caused an important damage to the lifestyle of many households, 
especially those living in rural area. In response to this backdrop, the South African governments 
decided to develop new strategies in order to create a future environment where households are not 
dealing with issues relating to food insecurity. One of the strategy put in place has been on empowering 
small farmers by giving them the necessary resources. Because, they believed that small farmers would 
contribute in reducing food crisis by increasing food throughput, as it this later is viewed as a serious 
challenge for many countries all over the world. However, this approach has not yet meet the expected 
result due to the fact that the trend of food crisis still growing at regional and national level. Therefore, 
the present research article aims at developing a model that can help to enhance food security in South 
Africa. The model focus on four keys such as food availability, poverty per district, intra-household 
food distribution, Land availability. Limpopo province was used as case study. The result show that the 
mitigation of food insecurity can increase employment and empower those who live in townships.    
Keywords: food security, poverty, agriculture, small-scale-farmers, climate changes, land availability, 
economic impact.

Abstract 
Design of Experiments (DOE) techniques were applied to improve the thermal performance of a gas oven, 
aided with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study in concept selection phase of Product Design 
Process PDP. Typical approaches to these types of activities involve developing all possible combinations 
of geometries changing one variable at a time, analyzing them with CFD, and predicting the main effects 
over the parameters surface heat flux and pressure drop, which in this application are the system responses. 
The develop plan for the team was to generate an script that allowed analyzing the sample space of the 
process variables and analyze much geometry configurations to study the geometric parameters. By 
utilizing DOE techniques the number of geometries was strategically reduced to 29. The metamodel of the 
system was obtained as a function of the input variables, with a statistical adjustment of 86.78% for the 
surface heat flux and 78% for the pressure drop. Subsequently we found the geometry that improves the 
performance of the product using the multiobjetive optimization method ‚ÄúNormal Boundary Intersection - 
NBI‚Äù.

3. CONCLUSIONS
The integration of numerical processes was used; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Experimental Design 
(DOE), and the construction of metamodels for the preliminary design of a turbulator for an gas oven. The model 
existence serves as a tool for new optimizations in the development of new turbulator, resulting in the PDP reduction 
for time and costs, when compared to the current empirical system. It should be emphasized that the metamodel 
contemplates two correlated and conflicting responses that could hardly be optimized empirically.

Detect Multiple Choice Exam Cheating Pattern by 
Applying Multivariate Statistics

Abstract 
This aim of this project is to apply a series of pattern detection Data Mining algorithms to accurately identify 
during classroom test exams. To detect if a pattern could be identified on the answer keys between students 
not attributable to chance alone, multivariate statistics tools were used to determine whether there was any 
association pattern among the students.  Hierarchical Clustering and Dendrogram Tree were used to identify 
the grouping affinity behavior related to exam cheating pattern.  Authors also used Heat Map to identify 
and recognize patterns in exam scores using visual analysis.   The authors also selected the top 20% of 
questions considered the most difficult ones in order to increase the detection power.  The probability of 
picking the same wrong answers on the difficult questions are even more unlikely by chance alone as 
compared to picking the right answers for the easy questions.  It is statistically even more improbable that 
students would unintentionally select the same wrong answers on difficult questions, and therefore provides 
very evidence of cheating.  Principle component analysis was also used to identify pairs of students who 
cheated, with.  The predictive model approach using Data Mining tools was very powerful for analysis of 
the complex exam cheating patterns.

1. Introduction
For each instructor, designing an effective assessment exam is a critical job1,2.  While a written exam of comprehensive questions 
and free-form answers may demonstrate critical thinking and depth/breadth of knowledge, this exam takes as significant amount of 
time to grade, and grading may often be subjective. Multiple-choice exams are more common due to their ease of quick and objective 
assessment by graders, despite limitations in demonstrating breadth of knowledge.  Unfortunately, students may try to cheat by 
copying or checking answers each other during these exams, especially if they are seated very close to each other (as is often the 
case due to space limitations, such as in public schools).  The inevitable possibility of cheating under these circumstances, presents 
a dilemma for most instructors, challenging them on resourceful design their exams to minimize cheating risk.  This paper uses Data 
Mining tools and techniques (using JMP 12 Software) to detect patterns in multiple-choice responses among pairs of students that 
are indicative of cheating.  The demonstrated effectiveness of this ‚Äòcheating detection‚Äô approach warns students proactively, by 
cautioning them to avoid attempting cheating before taking any multiple-choice exam. 
In this case study, there were 75 students who sat in 25 different small tables (with 3 students per table) in a very limited classroom 
space.  The instructor modified the original exam into three different orders (versions A, B, C).  Three students from the same table 
would each take different versions (one student per version, per table).  Students could not use cell phones or laptops during the 
assessment exam to prevent communication with one another.  However, students were still smart enough to attempt to synchronize 
the questions in each of the versions, thusly providing evidence of cheating as shown in the analysis that follows.  The objective of 
this paper is to implement a data mining algorithm to detect any cheating pattern from students taking the exam at the same table.   
2. Data Collection and Multivariate Correlation Analysis
The raw data includes each student‚Äôs ID, Exam Version, Answers, and Table Number.  In order to reduce the computing time and 
also improve data quality (signal-to-noise ratio), the lowest 25 multiple-choice exam scores were excluded from the analysis.  Also, 
it is highly unlikely that we can locate any evidence of cheating from the worst-performing students. Seating location was randomly

4 Results 
Results from all analyses presented previously are summarized per Table 4.  Three cheating tables were identified in 
after taking into account each of the four analyses used.  Table 17 was identified as suspect of cheating in the 
Correlation Analysis, but not in the other three analyses .  Correlation Analysis is only based on the accumulated 
score, not on the correspondence between patterns of answers between individuals.  Therefore, with Correlation 
Analysis there may be a chance of wrong detection (Alpha risk) of cheating, since  two students can have the same or 
similar scores when seated at same table, but their pattern of answers by question can differ significantly.  PCA model 
is more powerful than clustering algorithm to detect such cross-table cheating pattern.  This observation may indicate 
the power of linear combination (eigen vectors) may be more powerful than hierarchical clustering analysis.   
 
The above results have demonstrated the powerful prediction accuracy of detecting similar patterns of answers 
between students sitting at the same table when taking a multiple-choice exam.  The methods and analyses used herein 
have been shared with other faculty and students in graduate school both to discourage cheating among students and 
to stimulate students‚Äô learning by providing a practical example of real-world statistical techniques used in relation to 
their daily life.

5 Conclusions 
The authors have utilized Data Mining Algorithms such as Multivariate Correlation, Hierarchical Dendrogram 
Clustering, Heat Map, and Principal Component Analysis to detect patterns in responses to multiple choice exams 
which indicate cheating took place among students.  In the world of Big Data, there are no perfect algorithms which 
can provide a ‚Äúcatch all‚Äù solution to any given problem. Using several Data Mining tools together to cross-validate 
study results enables the student researcher to make more extensive inferences on their data by considering the data 
through multiple points of view.  Ultimately, this offers the possibility of a more meaningful study conclusion, but 
choosing the right Data Mining tools or algorithms for the problem is critical for success so as to minimize the risk of 
algorithm bias.  The Data Mining results in this paper sever as a powerful framework to help instructors to manage 
exam grading for multiple choice exams.  By more accurately detecting cases of cheating on these exams, the use of 
a comprehensive exam question format can be avoided, saving Instructors‚Äô exam preparation time and grading time.  
The authors have identified three tables where students were very likely to have cheated.  The prediction accuracy 
should be very reliable since the answer choice correspondence patterns were identified using various data mining 
tools (Correlation, Clustering, Heat Map, and Principal Component Analysis) and achieving statistical significance.  
These students have a poor defense against claims of cheating, based on the extraordinary correspondence between 
their answers on the exam!  The same Data Mining concept and algorithm choices can be applied to many other 
applications to uncover otherwise hidden patterns such as in: Sports Analytics, Customer Relational Management, or 
Biostatistics.

Abstract 
Seru production system is an innovation in Japanese manufacture. However, until now almost reports about 
seru production system are from Japan and be not well known in the world. In this paper we make a 
comprehensive report to totally investigate Japanese seru production system. We collecte all publications 
about seru production system that published in past decade, including books, journals, newspapers and 
websites. Over 276 factory cases are picked up from the publication materials. We also select 194 key 
words from the title of the articles that can be considered to describe the feature of seru production system 
well. Then a keyword-factory matrix can be made. By using this matrix we can make a clustering analysis 
based on a S-F scheme to describe systematically what be the seru production system.

Abstract 
This research is design to analysis current scenarios on the selected Basic Metal and Steel Industry 
regarding to lean production elements practice using secondary data and observation. Before direct 
investigation on the field, selected lean elements are identified from literatures using key words related 
to lean production and implementation techniques. From literatures, holistic approach studies and 
implementing lean production in continuous based process industries has found as a limitation. In 
addition to that, lean production system appears to be unknown and misinterpreted on selected sectors 
under this investigation. Skill shortage, adoption of new technology, linkage b/n upstream and 
downstream activities, product diversification and development, labour productivity and product 
quality, technological capability, and management problems are raised as problems. The most four 
critical problems have selected and conceptual frame works and suggestions proposed for further 
improvement. On the leanness assessment, necessity of having contextualized and systematic approach 
on solving continuous improvement related problems facing metal and steel industries have given 
emphasis based on data analysis findings. So, that leanness strategy is contextualized as Ethiopian 
farming system and the systematic approach is developed using system dynamics modeling technique 
to enhance the competitiveness of Ethiopian Metal and Steel Industries through lean manufacturing.

Abstract 
This research is designed with an objective of studying how production planning and 
control systems could enhance competitiveness of steel production industries and build an 
integrated road map for production planning and control strategy under conditions of raw material 
and logistics as a bottleneck. In this particular research, two null hypotheses Ho1: There 
is no significant correlation between PPC and competitiveness and Ho2: There is no significant 
correlation between PPC and raw material logistics as a constraint have been prepared and the first 
null hypothesis Ho1 is rejected and the second null hypothesis Ho2 is accepted as it is due to 
research finding indicating that market strategy is having a direct impact with Pearson 
correlation factor (r=0.868) strong positive significant correlation than raw material and logistic 
Pearson correlation factor (r=0.243) which is weak positive significant correlation. This weak 
correlation result indicates market strategy have a direct impact than raw material and logistics 
constraints on PPC. To solve problems such as, market is dominated by overseas products and 
lack of simplified production planning and control system to overcome resource constraints an 
integration of pull and push production system has been forwarded. The integration model has 
three main parts including supply chain and marketing, manufacturing, and management 
strategies.

Abstract 
The life cycle of electronic products is becoming shorter. Calculate the optimum quantity to buy and hold 
in inventory is a big challenge, must be incorporated the temporary variable into the mathematical model 
that describes the death of the product and therefore calculate the required inventory. Economic Order 
Quantity (EOQ) was used in this case study in coordination with the logistic function, originally applied to 
population growth, this is a convenient function for estimating economic batch versus time analogy. Thus, 
a nonlinear regression was used to estimate the parameters of a hybrid model, EOQ-curve S. Once applied 
this model, the total costs of inventories were reduced by about 67%, demonstrating the effectiveness 
achieved.

1. Introdution
The design of inventory models tailored to each company is important as they solve unique problems with the 
possibility of generalization. For the present case, we worked in a commercialization company of varied electronic 
products, which are sold by Internet. The main objective is to solve the problem of over inventory, and therefore, high 
costs of inventory maintenance, especially obsolescence products. The demand for short-lived products is described 
as an S-curve, allowing an optimal Q to be established over time, which minimizes costs substantially as observed in 
the results (Spedding & Chan, 2000). We used concepts of inventories, optimization, statistics and costs, a combination

Future research work should focus on a forecasting methodology and operations management for short-lived 
products. 
CONCLUSIONS 
It was possible to design a model for the control of inventories, for producer of short life cycle. This allowed us to 
reduce the costs of maintaining inventory and, in particular, to minimize obsolete inventories, also increasing 
turnover. 
Today products have a very short lifecycle, which is not covered by most inventory models, but more and more 
often find sales structures based on innovation, reducing the life cycle of products and demanding a low level of 
inventory. 
The techniques proposed here help to reduce inventory costs by approximately 67.40%, compared to the 
methodology used by the company to estimate the economic lot.

Abstract 
This study describes the efforts of the Mexican Red Cross institution located in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, 
M√©xico to reduce ambulance response time. The major focus for improving the performance of emergency medical 
systems has been the reduction of ambulance response time by determining the optimal number and locations 
through the use of mathematical modeling.  A general two-stage scheme consisting of a geospatial - time statistical 
analysis and a mathematical modelling stage is applied based on an emergency call database generated from during 
2016 and the beginning of 2017. The mathematical modelling stage includes the application of the Double Standard 
Model (DSM). Scenario analysis for the resulting demand levels per day and various combinations of fixed and 
mobile ambulance bases are evaluated. Results of a pilot program are provided.

Introduction
The fundamental responsibilities of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems are to provide urgent medical care, such as 
pre-hospital care, and to transport the patient to the hospital if needed (Fitch, et al., 2016). The emergence of Mexican EMS 
institutions has taken place since the beginning of the current century. According to Fraga-Sastr√≠as et al., (2010), in Mexico, 
33% of the institutions that offer emergency medical services are private organizations; 31% are non-governmental 
organizations financed through donations; and 26% of the institutions receive government financing. Pinet (2005) stated that 
in Mexico, the institutions and organizations that offer prehospital services are not being overseen in terms of coordination, 
regulation and performance evaluation. One of the main private institutions that provide emergency medical services is the 
Mexican Red Cross which was founded in 1910.  
This study recommends the application of mathematical programming modeling to determine the optimal Emergency 
Medical Operations System Structure to Decrease Response Time for the Red Cross operations located in the metropolitan 
Monterrey area. The system structure consists of the definition of the number and location of ambulance bases. 
The paper consists of four sections. The following section provides a review of relevant research on the topic and a 
description of the general scheme applied to define the optimal EMS structure and of the main concepts used. Section three 
describes the application to the EMS operations for the metropolitan Monterrey Red Cross. Section four provides a discussion 
of the results and the main conclusions of the study. 
2.
Review of literature for determining the optimal EMS operations structure
As previously described, the structure of the EMS operations system consists of defining the number and location of ambulance 
bases such that an objective function is satisfied. The configuration of the EMS structure determines the patient flow through 
the Healthcare System (HS). According to Saghafian et al., (2015), patient flow in healthcare systems can be viewed from two 
perspectives: operational and clinical (Cot√©, 2000; Cot√© et al., 2000; and Marshall et al., 2005). The first perspective refers to 
the physical movement of patients through a set of locations, and the latter refers to the progression of their health status. In 
this paper, we use the term patient flow to mean the first perspective. Patient flow can be classified as patient flow into, in, and 
out of the HS. Even though, the EMS structure impacts very significantly total physical patient flow through the overall system, 
its structure is mostly defined by increasing patient flow into the HS. This is done by minimizing ambulance response time.

Abstract 
In current context of globalized markets, competitiveness of agricultural producers faces challenges derived from 
national and international standards that impose high-quality requirements to access important markets and 
implement measures to warrantee safety in food, especially in fresh produce. Under this context, traceability of 
supply chain plays an essential role of giving information that aloud to establish improving points in each link of the 
supply chain. Current traceability approaches are based on conventional commercial solutions used on industrial 
products, leaving out fresh produce features that make necessary having into account a higher level of information 
all over the entire supply chain. Throughout this research work, it is presented a proposal to evaluate fresh produce 
traceability systems taking into account technological systems that aloud to monitor the product transport conditions 
and the design of an architecture to facilitate its visualization, tracking and control in any part of the chain. This 
research work pursue the construction of easy-to-employ quality indicators in order to evaluate the traceability and 
the decision making throughout technological monitoring, design methodologies and the construction of approval 
and verification instruments using a case study of the supply chain of Solanum Quitoense (Lulo in colombian

Introduction 
The competitivity on regions brings the potential to augment production on a sustained way through investment on 
technological agendas and innovation (INCODER, 2010). The creation of a traceability system us necessity and

Currently the research group Society, Economy and Product (SEPRO) performs the study of traceability on products 
like Solanum Quitoense and tomato on the tree of sumapaz region and its agro- industrial corridor with the objective 
to propose a traceability system differentiator on the implementation of better practices to increase its competitivity,

Abstract 
During the last decades, environmental management has become a matter of prime importance in business, 
derived from the need of responding to pressure exerted by different types of stakeholders (e.g., regulators, 
NGOs, or consumers). In particular, an instrumental perspective in academics has addressed the analysis of 
how the implementation of environmental strategies impacts the economic performance of firms. The 
mainstream of environmental management literature has followed the win-win paradigm, in which 
environmental and economic objectives can be achieved simultaneously. However, given the multifaceted 
and complex nature of the relationships between economic and environmental objectives under the 
framework of sustainable development, it is argued that trade-offs are the rule rather than the exception. 
Therefore, this work aims at developing a conceptual framework for the analysis of the trade-off between 
environmental and economic objectives in the context of closed-loop supply chains.  This framework will 
help to understand the emergence of trade-offs between environmental and economic objectives of firms 
during the adoption of advanced environmental practices, such as reverse logistics. It also aims at exploring 
how collaboration among different agents in the supply chain can help decision makers to manage these 
trade-offs. 
Keywords 
Reverse Logistics, Environmental Collaboration, Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Modeling and Simulation. 
1. Introduction
The growing importance of environmental issues in business management, derived from the intention to respond
to the pressure exerted by different types of stakeholders (e.g., regulators, NGOs, or consumers), has aroused great 
interest in the academic field that is evidenced in the development of studies that analyze how the implementation of 
environmental strategies impacts the economic performance of companies. Different empirical studies have focused 
on analyzing how environmental strategies can be financially viable (Epstein & Roy, 2003; Hart, Milstein, & Caggiano, 
2003; Orsato, 2006; Schaltegger & Figge, 2000). 
This interest to study the relationship between environmental management and economic performance has led 
researchers and entrepreneurs to strive for establishing the so-called ""Green Business Case"", which postulates that 
strategies for making a company environmentally sustainable can generate ""win-win"" situations that reconcile 
environmental protection with financial success. Under this approach, environmental practices are viewed from the 
perspective of capital efficiency; that is, environmental projects are evaluated in terms of its contribution to the

Abstract 
This study deals with optimal layout design by line balancing using simulation modeling. Modeling and 
simulation are potential tools for analysis of the assembly lines like apparel of a garment manufacturing. 
The experiment controls the resources of the assembly line process without affecting the real production 
system. In this study the Arena software, AutoCAD and POM software are employed to model and 
measure the performance of the existing sewing line of the Ronny t-shirt model. The t-shirt has 12 major 
parts to be assembled. For each activity, the researcher has taken 15 sampling observations using 
stopwatch. All the collected data are statistically analyzed using arena input analyzer for statistically 
significance and determination of expressions to be used to the simulation modeling. Standard simulation 
model was developed and run for 160 replications. The result shows the line is operating with a line 
balance efficiency of 72.56%. In the course of action using Opt Quest different types of scenarios had 
been developed and line balance efficiency increase to 75.3% and the company saves 518,400 birr per 
year that spent for salary. This arena simulation model has considered the production resources, 
processing time of each activity and testing different scenarios.

INTRODUCTION 
Ethiopian clothing industries face many problems that have not become competitive globally. These problems 
include; the poor performance of products in the export market, poor quality and inadequate supply of raw materials, 
low productivity and poor resource utilization. Because of those, most of the country's textile companies are not 
lucrative and most are in great loss [1]. Layout design is key concern to organize operations in such a way as to 
maximize resource usage and overall system throughput. The level of layout facility determines the efficiency of the 
entire delivery operation in the system.  Improper layout of facilities is detrimental to operations. Any existing 
bottleneck in the system results in long queues, long waiting times, stock outs, high operating costs, low throughput 
and overall system inefficiency. Such a system would operate below capacity. Properly planned and arranged 
workstations on available facility space, with optimal assignment of available resources, are expedient for the 
maximization of resource capacity and the level of efficiency of operations [2]. Several studies have focused on the 
facility layout problem, a segment of facility layout that focuses on the arrangement of departments, work stations 
and storage areas for an existing or proposed facility such that the most efficient use of all resources involved is 
realized. Poor layout designs lead to accumulation of work-in-process (WIP),

CONCLUSION  
In this paper, the simulation modeling and layout design of the sewing line is done by using arena 14 version and 
auto cad software. Based on the results of the simulation modeling the stations with large queue or high resource 
utilizations like shoulder attach, sleeve attach and with low utilizations that is below 50% utilizations like 2nfl1a, 
2nfl1b, operator 11b, operator 11a, quality checker 1 and quality checker 2 are bottlenecks in the production lines. 
The bottleneck recognized are eliminated or minimized using reassigning of the existing resources the operators and 
machines, to optimize the resources as much as possible. 
Finally, a new model was developed using opt quest model of arena with different types of scenarios by considering 
the constraints of the resources and controls and responses of the results. Therefore, the line efficiency has been 
increased from 72.556% to 75.3% without buying machines and the line can be produced 650 t-shirts with 16-man 
power. Therefore, they can produce this amount of t-shirt. 
This computer model can be applied to similar or different multifaceted manufacturing industries wishing to analyze 
and advance the performance of the production system. Hence, this research invites other interested researchers to 
make similar researches to improve the apparel industries to improve their productivity using optimization 
simulation modeling. 
The company will save the unnecessary salaries that allocated for the lines with an average of 518,400birr/year for 
16 lines of assembly lines.

Abstract 
The impact of Environmental Management System (EMS) Through ISO 14001:2004 on a Gabonese 
Mining Company (Comilog) was assessed. Companies around the world nowadays get certified to 
different environmental standards and some tend to get more than environmental benefits. This study 
takes a closer look at a manganese company based in Moanda, Gabon. The study investigated the level of 
implementation of EMS through ISO 14001:2004 as well as the comparison of   productivity prior and 
after a formal implementation of the standards.

1. Introduction
In all facets of business operation, there seems to be a strong tendency to go cleaner and clearer in the way of 
production in order to be environmentally friendly. The number of companies certified to ISO 14001 has increased 
considerably over the years. An environmental certification gives that favourable image that any business, especially 
the one in tough competition, would want to have from stakeholders. However, the productivity of an organisation 
already operating with set management practices is due to encounter changes due the implementation  of a new 
management system compare to the one that its activities considering an environmental standard. Changes can either 
be positive or negative depending on how the implementation is done. For this study, the Compagnie Miniere de 
l‚ÄôOggou√© (Comilog) was chosen as the case study company. It is a mining company operating in Gabon, Central 
Africa, which was certified ISO 14001 in 2012 and the organization has been in operation since 1962. The 
researcher focused on departments where the environment aspects were significant and relevant. Thus a comparison 
of productivity of departments, before and after certification, was carried out.

7. Recommendations 
 
It appears from the above data that the environmental concern has had impacts that are both good and bad depending 
on the departmental activities being carried out. From around year 2000 to the ISO 14001 certification in 2012, 
impacts in terms of production are positive. This is explained by the process of recycling manganese fines and sand 
that used to be considered as waste. As a result of that recycling, new product were added to the range of the 
company. However the maintenance work backlog of the maintenance department is now subjected to take longer 
than before due to environmental concern. The best recommendation has to always have all equipment ready in 
order not to waste much time when a repair is needed. Regarding the oil pollution due to hydraulic hoses breaks, the 
solution lies between a better understanding between both production and maintenance department. Indeed if the 
maintenance program is properly followed they would be less chance to have these hoses break. This also shows that 
despite the desire to be environmentally friendly, production always remains the number one priority of a company 
especially when there was no EMS from the beginning of operations. The warehouse has seen great improvement of 
its productivity and environment performance as well. From an archaic storage to a complete reshaping of it 
facilities, it now enjoys good work performance and less product. 
 
8. Conclusion 
 
The idea that EMS with or without certification can enhance a company‚Äôs performance has been assessed in a 
Gabonese mining company. The results show that some departments have improved on their productivity and some 
did not. Because this research was done in the mining industry only and in some departments that seem to be 
relevant to the research, results cannot be generalised. However one important aspect of such a research is to show

the importance of conducting such a study in a qualitative approach. It was found that in industries such as the 
mining one, recycling is the key to productivity improvement. As it is known globally through Lavoisier, nothing is 
new but everything get transformed. Hence further study may need to be undertaken to see whether service 
industries can benefit from EMS in the same manner.EMS ISO 14001 was recommended as an ‚Äúenabler of good 
business‚Äù as seen in the warehouse of Comilog. When activities are performed in a stipulated correct standard way, 
departments such as warehouse can only gain from it. A formal EMS tends also to be an upset for businesses that 
have long existed without environmental concern before. When production is the only main focus, EMS can find 
hard to be properly implemented or followed. In any company going for formal EMS must really be the centre of its 
operation and strategy especially in the execution of business‚Äô objectives.

Abstract 
The study explored aspects of effective mining wire rope lubrication with regards to minimizing common failures. 
Thus the work looked at coming up with a design which sought to improve the  safety of the wire rope facility and 
increase production in local Zimbabwean mines through reducing excessive labor cost and unnecessary cost 
associated with undue replacement of ropes. It is this regard that this work devised a wire rope lubricator that 
reduced labor allocated to lubricating of wire ropes by more than 50%, as well as achieving high lubricant 
penetration and cleaning the rope prior the process. The design would reduce the cost of wire rope maintenance by 
more than 42%. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Some effort has to be made to deal with challenges that prevent maximum mass production in local mines. The 
study has the objective of coming up with a more efficient method of lubricating wire ropes as well as reducing the 
cost of wire rope cleaning and maintenance in a more sustainable, and economic manner. Wire ropes are used in 
mines for transmitting mechanical power in mine hoists and cranes. Mine hoists are the fundamental mode of 
transport of workers and goods into and out of the mine shafts. A wire rope without proper lubrication also causes 
wearing of the sheaves, this would require re-grooving and replacement with time costing a mining company 
thousands of dollars in addition to down time during replacement. When a wire rope has reduced its strength by 10% 
it is recommended to be discarded. Wire rope lubrication extends the wire rope life by about 60% (Draka Elevator 
Tech Tips 2013), saving the mining companies replacement costs. Currently, most mines in Zimbabwe use methods 
of wire rope lubrication such as heating the lubricant and applying the lubricants using hands, rags or brushes. It was 
established that such methods are ineffective, costly and pose a health risk to workers. The wire rope needs to be 
cleaned before new lubricant is applied to remove foreign particles and old lubricant from the strands, and the spaces 
between the outer wires. Practically, use of hands to lubricate a 760 m of wire rope would be time consuming and 
results in poor lubricant penetration to protect the rope. The same practice would increase incidence of waste of

5. Recommendations 
The size of the collar could be changed by using a stronger and lighter material (high strength to weight 
ratio) instead of cast iron or mild steel whose selection was based on material availability. This would 
reduce the size and weight of the collar and improve the portability of the device. The current use of semi-
solid grease (Noxal Super 8) required some heating to make its application to the ropes easy. This messy 
and cumbersome practice could be replaced by use of a fluid lubricant with low viscosity which could be 
easily pumped and penetrate rope core effectively to reduce wire failure. Thus this study recommends the 
use of a solvent based lubricant such as Grippa 33S. It is easier to apply since it does not require heating 
and has a lower viscosity hence can be pumped by a pneumatic pump with great ease. Other advantages 
of using such a lubricant are its Molybedenum Sulpihde (MoS2) additive which makes it water wash 
resistant in underground mine environment and it is also biodegradable making it environmental friendly 
in case of incidental leakage. This lubricator device can be further improved by incorporating other 
accessories like the spiral wire scraper in Fig 17.0 below to clean the wire rope before lubrication.Tie 
down chains or a securing bracket for fixing it position during lubrication may be requires, as well as a  
carrying case to keep the device clean. A compressor with the following specifications: Power 3hp, 
Pressure 125psi and 10 gallons, was also recommended. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The design study managed to come up with a wire rope lubricator that was simulated using Solid Works for 
functionality and feasibility. The device could achieve the required key design objectives of lubricant penetration 
and time saving from 4 hour to about 1 hour 40 minutes according to the design calculations. The design for 
manufacture drawings were provided for fabrication of the prototype model. Further improvements of device could 
be done by adding pressure control valves and pressure regulators on the system for safe operation in the plant.

Abstract 
Quality control techniques in the industry are used to detect changes in process dispersion, but it is 
necessary to monitor two or more quality variables simultaneously. The problems of process monitoring 
where several related variables are studied can be controlled by means of multivariate control charts. The 
objective of this work is to describe the implementation of the multivariate. Generalized Variance |S| 
control chart using real data obtained from the industry. 
In the present research work the implementation of the multivariate Generalized Variance |S| control chart 
in the industrial field is carried out and a real multivariate case is analyzed with quality variables. 
Keywords 
Multivariate Statistical processes control, Generalized Variance |S| control chart. 
1. Introduction
The simultaneous control of several variables in the same piece or product has received much attention in recent 
years Aparisi (2014). The use of a single multivariate chart for process control is a more powerful option than using 
several univariate charts Aparisi (2006), Montgomery (2009). However, multivariate charts do not indicate which 
variables or variables are being measured that have changed and current techniques are inefficient to detect the 
variables responsible for the change Khoo (2004), Grasman (2010). Therefore the research will be focused on 
finding a method based on neural networks in order to identify the variables that have changed in the process, using 
industrial data. 
The main objective of this research is to design a generalized method based on neural networks to classify the out of 
control signal that the multivariate Generalized Variance |S| control chart, applied to a production process with real 
data obtained from the industry. 
2. Approach and formulation of the research problem
Identify the variables responsible for the change in an industrial process monitored by means of a multivariate 
control chart. With the advent of computers in the eighties, the neural networks took great strength since they

In this case the network detects that the variable responsible for the control signal is the variable assigned to node 3. 
That is body diameter. 
7. Conclusions
In this research we have used neural networks to detect the variable or variables that cause the signal out of control 
in a process, when the chart detected a control output. That is, those responsible for the out of control signal found 
by the chart. For the case of three variables in a process of an industrial bottler. 
The network design with the highest percentages of hits has, for the case of three variables, a network with an input 
layer of 11 nodes, a first internal layer of 12 nodes, a second internal layer of 14 nodes and an output layer of 3 
nodes. 
At present there is no alternative method, which detects which variable or variables are responsible for the signal of 
lack of control when the multivariate | S | detects a change in process. Therefore, the percentage of hits with another 
method can not be compared.

Abstract 
For the automotive industry, satisfying the specific demands of customers using differentiation strategies 
in product and service has become successful in increasing competitive global markets. Therefore, supply 
chain management and logistics capabilities play a key role in achieving competitive advantage. One of the 
key success factors for automotive companies is to have Tier 1 suppliers that have the logistic capability to 
provide the wide variety of components using Just in Time. The present paper focuses on a Storage Location 
Allocation Problem for a level 1 supplier company with a Just In Sequence production system. The problem 
is defined with  linear programming formulation to find the optimal allocation of items at a minimum 
operating cost. 
Key words: JIS, Inventory, Storage location, Allocation, Tier 1 Supplier 
1. Introduction
With constant innovation and increasingly demanding customers, manufacturing companies require strategies that 
generate a competitive advantage in order to meet customer needs and compete in an evermore globalized economy. 
This has led to the majority of companies producing a wider range of products and customization. These changes have 
created inevitable challenges and presented new optimization issues for many manufacturers. Due to intense 
competition, companies are looking for operational efficiency through Supply Chain Management and Logistics 
Optimization, as most companies include multiple suppliers, multiple manufacturers, multiple customers, different 
products to manufacture, as well as multiple issues in uncertain environments (Gholamian, Mahdavi, Tavakkoli-
Moghaddam, & Mahdavi-Amiri, 2015) (Mirzapour Al-e-hashem, Malekly, & Aryanezhad, 2011). 
A factory is usually equipped with more than one production line to produce various products, which raises the 
problem of how to effectively allocate limited resources to manufacture each item in order to maximize profits, another 
of the basic problems to be Companies are faced with the uncertainty of demand, since it affects the production system 
of a company generating problems in the planning and scheduling of production, as well as in inventory management 
(Ho & Fang, 2013) (Altendorfer, 2014). 
For the automotive industry, meeting the specific demands of customers using differentiation strategies in product and 
service has become successful in increasing competitive global markets. Therefore, supply chain management and 
logistics (ACS) capabilities play a key role in achieving competitive advantage. One of the key success factors for 
automotive companies is to have Tier 1 suppliers who have the logistical capability to provide the wide variety of Just

The proposed model optimizes 10% of the routes of the locations towards the picking area considering the 9 products 
that have the highest frequency of consumption in the production line.  
6. Conclusions
In this study, we investigated a Storage Location Allocation Problem (SLAP), the problem is defined with a linear 
programming formulation to find the optimal allocation of items at a minimum operating cost. The instance to be 
solved is a real problem of a supplier company level 1 of the automotive industry, in addition to working with a 
production system Just In Sequence. When applying the model in the picking area, savings of approximately XXX 
percent of daily trips from the locations to the buffer (picking) were obtained. The resolution of the model took less 
than a minute, despite being a combinatorial problem. This shows that the model can be applied in the company to 
make operational decisions of storage, due to the low computational time that demands to solve the more complex 
situation that it has. 
Finally, the nobility of the model and the operations of the company allow to carry out another study considering 1) 
the costs of transport from the place of arrival of the orders to the warehouse, to the storage locations of each order, 
2) costs associated with distances Between the units of the same order that are stored in different locations, 3) the
storage capacity of each location, and 4) the time of transfer of the components of the locations to the picking area or
production line.

I. Introducci√≥n
En las PYMES de transformaci√≥n debido a su car√°cter de constituci√≥n la planeaci√≥n, el control de
la producci√≥n y de sus residuos no eran tan importantes como en las empresas de mayor tama√±o,
pero debido a la globalizaci√≥n y los problemas de cambio clim√°tico, las PYMES deben empezar a
desarrollar los modelos de gesti√≥n organizacional debido a que los esquemas que se mencionaron
anteriormente tienen incidencia en otros procesos como son la gesti√≥n de compra, gesti√≥n de
mercadeo, gesti√≥n financiera, gesti√≥n comercial y la gesti√≥n ambiental entre otros. La planeaci√≥n
de la producci√≥n permite programar el uso de los recursos  (humano, productivo, econ√≥mico)
dentro de la PYME por lo cual se considera un campo que debe abordarse tambi√©n desde la
ingenier√≠a qu√≠mica, lo cual conlleva a buscar la mejor forma de asignar y emplear los recursos que
desde el punto de vista financiero significa minimizar los costos del plan y proceso de producci√≥n
al satisfacer las necesidades de los clientes internos y externos de la empresa, respetando los limites
hasta los cuales puede llegar la empresa, esto por medio de planes de producci√≥n m√°s limpia
viables o realistas.
Sin embargo, lograr la asignaci√≥n de recursos adecuada requiere que para la toma de decisiones la
informaci√≥n debe ser lo m√°s precisa en lo posible por lo cual se requiere manejar la incertidumbre
en los planes de producci√≥n y tambi√©n conocer eficazmente el proceso productivo. Por lo anterior,
el presente trabajo presenta el modelo de producci√≥n m√°s limpia a trav√©s del trabajo en ciclo
cerrado  y por consiguiente implementar alguno de los modelos para sistemas de planeaci√≥n MRP
con el manejo de par√°metros de incertidumbre como son la disponibilidad necesaria servicios de
fabricaci√≥n, disponibilidad de inventario, manejo de los residuos generados, nuevos productos y
procesos, en un ambiente frenado por las capacidades de los recursos; y el impacto que estos
procesos generan en el medio ambiente.
El proyecto plantea como objetivo general; El proponer un modelo de MRP en ciclo cerrado que
mejore la productividad en las pymes industriales ante los retos de competitividad con un cuidado
intenso del entorno.
Para lograrlo a trav√©s de los siguientes objetivos espec√≠ficos:
Determinar el nivel de control de procesos de transformaci√≥n en las pymes industriales.
Determinar el porcentaje de materiales y recursos amigables con el entorno empleados por las
pymes.
Proponer la estrategia ambiental corporativa que m√°s se acople en  las pymes de estudio. 
II. PLANTEAMIENTO DEL PROBLEMA

recursos para las futuras generaciones. Por lo anterior, la gesti√≥n de procesos tiene como objetivo

Figura 11. Disminuci√≥n de costos empresa 3 
Como se observa en la figura de pasar de unos costos de reproceso de 50 millones se disminuy√≥ 
en un 50% a tener costo en promedio de 27 millones que se pueden ir mejorando entre m√°s se 
comprometa la empresa en la correcta gesti√≥n de los residuos peligrosos [13]. 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONES 
A partir de este trabajo se logr√≥ conocer que desde que el hombre existe tiene una relaci√≥n muy 
directa con la naturaleza, pero q al pasar de los a√±os cada vez m√°s la degradan y causan da√±os muy 
desfavorables para la naturaleza en general con su comportamiento.  
Con el proyecto de la inclusi√≥n de la cascarilla de arroz dentro del inventario como un producto 
fuera de especificaciones para la comercializaci√≥n a la empresa escogida para el tratamiento de los 
residuos s√≥lidos se logra  una meta del 85% de ingresos no operacionales dentro del proyecto.  
Bajo la relaci√≥n comercial entre la trilladora y la empresa recuperadora de energ√≠a se disminuye  
en un 80% el impacto negativo de la utilizaci√≥n actual de los residuos s√≥lidos.  
Teniendo en cuenta estas dificultades se ha implementado capacitaciones para separar en la fuente 
y as√≠ disminuir la cantidad de trabajadores necesarios para la limpieza, implementaci√≥n de llaves 
ahorradoras para evitar el desperdicio de agua e implementar una picadora con el fin de que los 
desechos verdes puedan tener un proceso que traiga ganancia para la naturaleza y para la plaza; 
Con estos cambios que se pretende disminuir la contaminaci√≥n atmosf√©rica, evitando los malos 
olores, propagaci√≥n de roedores que conlleva a  enfermedades, generando tanto para trabajadores 
como para clientes un ambiente m√°s amigable al tiempo que la empresa adquiere una mayor 
utilidad. 
En la empresa de guantes pl√°sticos se logra tener una clasificaci√≥n adecuada  de los residuos 
generados, una adecuada capacitaci√≥n al personal  frente a la producci√≥n y manejo de los residuos; 
y la adecuada identificaci√≥n y almacenamiento de las materias primas. 
Con base en informaci√≥n recogida a lo largo del trabajo, se pretende implementar el uso racional 
de los recursos y  comprometer a la organizaci√≥n para minimizar el impacto ambiental de sus 
operaciones, productos y servicios, para evitar efectos adversos sobre sus integrantes, la 
comunidad y el medio ambiente [14]. 
Existe un relaci√≥n entre los altos niveles de contaminaci√≥n atmosf√©rica y aumento de estr√©s en las 
personas que la componen, el primero debido a la falta de un supervisor que genere un mayor 
rendimiento en las √°reas de trabajo y un buen manejo de las materias primas que la componen 
generando tambi√©n as√≠ un estr√©s por parte de los empleados, ya que no encuentran una salida eficaz 
y eficiente en la realizaci√≥n de actividades dentro del √°rea en que se desempe√±an en las empresas 
de transformaci√≥n.

personal de administraci√≥n participen en las diferentes iniciativas de reciclaje que se pretenden 
implementar.  En general las campa√±as de reciclaje estar√°n bajo en control del Comit√© Ambiental 
Escolar, pero estas mismas requerir√°n de la participaci√≥n activa del resto de la comunidad 
educativa.  
En la empresa de servicios m√©dicos se logr√≥ reducir costos del m√°s del 50% en consumo de energ√≠a 
mensual con la implementaci√≥n del sistema de sensores de movimiento que no afectar√≠an en nada 
la prestaci√≥n del servicio. 
Podemos determinar que la implementaci√≥n de la producci√≥n m√°s limpia genera tantos beneficios ambientales de 
cuidado y buena administraci√≥n de los recursos, como un beneficio econ√≥mico a la compa√±√≠a reduciendo costos de 
uso de materias primas y dise√±os amigables con el medio ambiente. 
As√≠ mismo  la compa√±√≠a se posiciona competitivamente en el mercado ya que cuenta con normas y est√°ndares 
ambientales que permiten generando consumo y demanda de productos y servicios elaborados que cuentan con 
producci√≥n m√°s limpia.

Abstract 
A solution method is developed for obtaining an exact optimal solution for a Critical Chain Project 
Management scheduling problem. Critical Chain Project Management aims to adhere to a target due date 
as well as to shorten the makespan. The problem is both simple and practical, yet continues to interest 
scholars and practitioners given the potential for improved scheduling. The traditional approach for solving 
this problem is based on a compromising policy called ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. Since existing methodology can be 
reduced to a combinatorial problem, an optimal solution must exist for a project. Hence, our approach is to 
obtain the exact optimal solution based on minimizing the estimated makespan. Given reduced task 
processing times, precedence relations, and assigned tasks per each resource, we obtain the processing 
sequence for each resource. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear-programming. An optimal 
solution can therefore be found using a general-purpose solver. Application to a scheduling problem is 
demonstrated to highlight the viability and performance of this approach. 
Keywords 
Critical-chain project management, good enough, combinatorial optimization, mixed-integer linear-programming, 
resource constrained project scheduling.

Abstract 
Every moving object possesses kinetic energy. Whenever it has to stop or reduce speed this kinetic energy 
has to be dissipated hence energy is lost from the system. This is the case with every mode of transport. 
With trains due to their mass the amount of energy lost is at a larger scale. Various methods have been 
developed by train manufacturers and other energy specialists in a bid to recapture this energy from the 
train. Though these may be successful in some respects they have some significant short comings. One of 
the most salient of these is that these methods have mechanisms which limit them to electric and electric 
hybrid trains. This paper is concerned with the development of a system of harvesting kinetic energy from 
trains which is independent of the source of traction energy. The system is based on the concept of flywheel 
energy storage.

approximated as an amplification of that system. On the other hand taking into consideration that the increase in size 
may lead to more loses from the system therefore the design bounding case for energy recover will be taken as 65%.

As described above the design in a multiple unit recovery system with the recovery units being the coaches only. 
Therefore it has been assumed that the energy recovery will be evenly distributed among the 10 coaches. Since system

Assuming all this power is absorbed by the kinetic recovery system without any loses, Average Power per flywheel

= 1.312 MW 
5. Recommendations and Conclusion
The flywheel energy recovery system discussed and developed consists of many components which are every pivotal 
in the transfer of energy. More attention has been turned on developing the flywheels hence energy transfer 
mechanisms are lagging behind in development. Different arrangements of the already existing kinetic energy 
recovery systems have to be explored, as this may lead to better compatibility and wide application. 
In the design here presented there is much development need to meet the required performance of the system. Further 
research has to be done in the following lines  
ÔÉò
Acceleration of the flywheel
Due to the high amounts of energy to be harvested from trains the flywheels used have a relatively large mass and 
therefore have high inertia. This calls for the development of mechanisms to enable quick take off for flywheel.

High speed flywheels are always a risk. Any failure should be averted by all means. This can be done by the 
improvement containments by increasing their robustness. Shock absorbing systems should also be developed so as 
to reduce the extent of damage in the case of any failures. 
Further consideration has to be done in how energy can be obtained through the kinetic energy harvesting system 
besides in braking. An example is when moving downhill. The train will be transforming gravitational potential energy 
into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy can also be harvested. 
Environmental friendliness is the rising to supremacy in design considerations of 21st engineering. Governments, 
councils and other such like organizations should develop and adopt policies on environmental friendliness so as to 
invoke innovation and development towards a greener world.  
Rail way transport is regarded as the most energy efficient mode of transport and increasing their energy efficiency 
has proven to be one of the most effective ways of reducing overall CO2 emissions. It should now be the goal of every 
railway manufacturer or operator to meet high standards of environmental friendliness through innovative design, 
manufacture and operation of rolling stock.

Abstract 
Futures is a type of derivative products standardizing price, quantity and supply for trading. Researchers 
have suggested a variety of method in order to compute the expected future earnings rate according to the 
change of the investment rate in the futures market. This research verifies the efficiency of Kelly bet when 
Kelly strategies are applied on raw data from December 15, 1997 to March 31, 2016 in the KOSPI200 
futures market. This research introduces sample strategies based on technical analysis, and Kelly criterion 
is applied to these sample strategies so as to verify the efficiency of the investment rate on Kelly criterion. 
As a result, we found that the Kelly bet is a better than flat bet when an investment strategy is used with the 
same initial capital. However, the Kelly bet decreases stability as well as the loss width is maximized.

Abstract 
Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) represent one of the most common occupational 
diseases that affect large numbers of industrial workers. The aim of the study is to identify relevant risk 
factors associated with the existence of musculoskeletal discomfort or pain, according to the affected body 
part. A transverse field study was conducted, on a sample of 174 workers of three Venezuelan meat-
processing industries. The standardized Nordic questionnaire was used for the identification of WMSDs 
and the data mining methods CfsSubsetEval and ConsistencySubsetEval were used for the selection of the 
relevant factors, which are available in Weka. A WMSDs prevalence of 77% was found; excels the 
shoulders (49.4%) and back (47.1%) as the body parts that affect most workers. The factors that presented 
the greatest correspondence with the discomforts of the shoulders are postural overload, repeatability, 
psychosocial demands and time working in the same task. In the case of the discomforts of back, the factors 
selected are postural overload, lifting of loads, pushing or pulling loads, low social support and the medical 
history. The multifactorial etiology of WMSDs was confirmed.

1. Introduction
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) include a large number of painful inflammatory and degenerative 
conditions that affect muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, nerves, and blood vessels. These include clinical syndromes 
(tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, bursitis), nerve compression disorders (carpal tunnel, sciatica) and osteoarthrosis, but 
also other less standardized conditions such as myalgias, back pain, and other localized pain syndromes not attributable 
to a known pathology (Punnett & Wegman, 2004). 
In general, musculoskeletal traumatic injuries are subdivided into two large groups: those that develop gradually and 
are caused by the excessive use of the different components of the locomotor apparatus mentioned above, and those 
that occur due to acute trauma or fractures, originating by accidents (Canadian Center for Occupational Health and 
Safety, 2014 and Attwood, Deeb & Danz, 2004). This work is focused on the WMSDs of the first group, those caused 
by repeated exposure to a type of physical activity. 
WMSDs represent considerable costs and impact on the quality of life, since they can generate a lot of pain and 
suffering in affected workers, decrease their productivity and quality in the work, and even cause disability (Almagro, 
Borrero, Paramio, Carmona & Sierra, 2009 and Chandna, Deswal & Pal, 2010). This type of disease has spread 
throughout the world and is quite prevalent in many countries, in the EU member states for example, WMSDs are the 
most common work-related health disorders, accounting for 59% of all occupational diseases recognized by European 
statistics in 2005, and accounting for more than 10% of all years of disability lost in 2009 (International Labor 
Organization, ILO, 2013). 
Most of authors agree on a multifactorial etiology in the process of generating WMSDs, which makes it more complex 
to understand, limiting the effectiveness of intervention programs. In addition, not all factors that may interfere with 
the occurrence of WMSDs have the same level of correspondence, so depending on the type of disorder and the body 
part affected, some risk factors will be more important than others.

4. Discussion 
 
The prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort in the meat industry workers found in this study (77%) is similar to that 
obtained in other investigations done in the industrial sector. √ñzt√ºrk & Esin (2011) found an overall prevalence of 
65% in sewing workers in a textile company, with the trunk (62.5%), neck (50.5%) and shoulders (50.2%). In the 
same way, Ilardi (2012) found a prevalence of 80% of hand and wrist WMSDs symptoms in workers of the salmon 
industry, specifically in bone work; followed by shoulders by 60% and arms/elbows by 50%. While the prevalence 
levels of WMSDs in the shoulders are similar in all three scenarios (between 50 and 60%), the most critical body parts 
differ between them. In the case presented here the most commonly affected part is the shoulders, while in the textile 
workers is the trunk and in the workers of the fish industry are the hands and wrists; however, the importance of 
WMSDs is indisputable. 
According to the results found, the diversity of factors associated with the musculoskeletal discomfort of each body 
part confirm that the origin of the disease is multifactorial and complex, involving not only biomechanical, but also 
psychosocial and individuals factors. 
In the case of shoulder discomfort, which is the body part that affects most workers (49.4%), it was determined that 
postural overload (biomechanical), repetitive movements (biomechanical), psychological demands (psychosocial) and 
the time working in the same task (individual) represents the subset of factors that correspond most to the occurrence 
of the disorder. Some investigations consulted (Bod√≠n et al, 2012; Flores & Bast√≠as, 2011 and Bernard, 1997) coincide 
to associate the biomechanical factors of postures and repetitiveness with the WMSDs of the shoulders, but they did 
not include psychosocial factors. However, in the study by Devereux, Rydstedt, Kelly, Weston & Buckle (2004), there 
was evidence of the relation between shoulder discomfort and psychosocial factors (low social support, low reward, 
ambiguity about the future of work), biomechanical factors (posture, repetitiveness and load lifting) and even 
individual (age and gender). Although they do not exactly match the ones found here, they confirm the multicausal 
origin. 
After shoulders, the back is the body part that most affects the workers considered in the study with 47.1%. The factors 
related to this type of discomfort are biomechanical: postural overload, lifting of loads and activities of pushing or 
pulling, but also found an important relationship with the low social support (psychosocial) and the existence of a 
medical history associated with musculoskeletal disorders (individual). These results have a high coincidence with 
those found in other studies (Bernard, 1997; Meksawi, Tangtrakulwanich & Chongsuvivatwong, 2012; Tinubu, 
Mbada, Oyeyemi & Fabunmi, 2010; Camargo, Orozco & Herrera, 2008 and Elders & Burdorf, 2001) done in different 
occupational fields. They found a high correspondence between biomechanical risk factors (postures, lifting and 
manipulation of loads) and back discomfort. In relation to the psychosocial factors, some researchers like Widkstein 
et al (2012), Widanarko et al (2012) and Bongers, de Winter, Kompier & Hildebrandt (1993) found that the poor social 
support of supervisors and peers represents a contributing factor in back WMSDs, coinciding with this study. 
In general, the results found could constitute the input for the construction of models that allow an explanation of the 
occurrence of WMSDs, as well as for the prediction of this type of disease that affects large numbers of workers, and 
in particular in meat processing industry. Prediction is the basis of effective prevention. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The most commonly affected body parts in the industrial sector studied were the shoulders and back, as reported by 
86% and 82% of the workers consulted, respectively. Then follow the hands/wrists (55%), the neck region (51%), the 
lower extremities (39%) and the elbows/forearms (23%). 
The most important risk factors associated with the presence of musculoskeletal discomfort reported by workers were 
identified, which corresponded not only to biomechanical variables, but also to psychosocial and individual variables. 
Shoulder discomfort were related to higher level of risk due to postural overload, a higher level of risk due to repetitive 
movements, more unfavorable exposures from the point of view of psychological demands, and greater time working 
at the position. Back discomfort were associated with higher levels of load manipulation (lifting and pushing or 
pulling), higher risk of postural overload, more unfavorable social support and the medical history related to 
musculoskeletal discomfort. 
The biomechanical risk factor with the greatest impact on musculoskeletal discomfort was postural overload, being 
associated with the presence of discomfort at the shoulders, back, neck and hands. This risk factor represent the aspect 
that needs the most attention in the industrial sector considered. On the other hand, the psychological demands to 
which the worker is exposed was the psychosocial factor that was associated with a greater number of discomforts,

and therefore needs special attention. While the most relevant individual factor is the medical history of the worker 
related to his musculoskeletal system, which reflects the importance of recurrence of discomfort. 
The preliminary results found in this study constitute an important source for preventive intervention processes at the 
industrial level and represent the basis for the construction of predictive models for the analysis of jobs with similar 
characteristics.

Abstract 
 This study deals with bottleneck detection with simulation techniques and time study. Modeling and 
simulation are potential tools for analyzing assembly lines such as clothing in a garment. Thus, the 
researchers attempted to experiment 160 numbers of replication in the arena tool.  
The experiment monitors the assembly process resources without altering the actual production scheme. In 
this study, the arena software and POM dedicated to modeling and measuring the performance of the existing 
Ronny t-shirt sewing line. The t-shirt is formed and has 12 main parts are assembled.  
For each activity, the researchers took 15 sampling observations using stopwatch. All the collected data are 
statistically analyzed using the input analyzer in arena for statistical significance and the expression 
resolution to be used for the simulation model. This simulation model has considered production resources 
like four threads over lock machines, single needle, two flat lock needles, machine operators, quality 
checkers, trimmer, batch arrival time Inter lot of pieces, sequence pieces, testing Different scenarios.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the simulation modeling of the sewing line is 
done by using arena software. During the analysis, the 
bottlenecks were identified. The bottlenecks have identified 
based on resource utilization, number waiting in queue. The 
main bottlenecks are that resources with low utilization that 
is below 50% utilizations like 2nfl1a, 2nfl1b, operator11a, 
operator11b, operator 11a, operator11b, quality checker 
1and quality checker2 and some of stations have also high 
waiting queue like shoulder attach, sleeve attach. 
The bottleneck identified are eliminated or minimized using 
reassigning of the existing resources the operators and 
machines, to optimize the resources as much as possible.

Abstract 
The global climate change and fossil fuel dependency are two major important challenge for achieving sustainable 
transportation. Alternative vehicle technologies, especially electric vehicles, have great potential to reduce the 
environmental impacts from transportation and to diversify energy sources in transportation. In this study, carbon 
footprint of vehicles fueled by gasoline, diesel, liquefied natural gas (LPG), and electricity are analyzed and 
compared for possible candidates of taxi operations in a metropole city, Istanbul, Turkey. Environmentally 
extended multi-regional input-output analysis is conducted to evaluate the upstream (supply chain) emissions due 
to vehicle operations. According to the results, conventional vehicles which are powered by gasoline have the 
highest greenhouse gas emissions, while electric vehicles have the least. Upstream (supply chain) emissions of 
EVs is found to be highest compared to other options. The GHG emissions of EV and LPG vehicle are 130 and 123 
gCO2-eqv./km, respectively. LPG is the most common fuel source for taxis in Turkey, especially in Istanbul. 
Considering that the marginal difference in these two vehicle types is very low, the carbon emission reduction potential 
of the EV is lower than expected. This is mainly because of the high fossil fuel dependence in the electricity generation 
mix in Turkey. To utilize the carbon emission reduction potential of EV in Turkey, the use of renewable energy sources 
for electricity production should be increased.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, it is generally recognized that sustainable development is a major concern all over the world. Meeting 
today‚Äôs needs in a way that it would not ruin the future generation‚Äôs ability of achieving their needs is a widely accepted 
definition of sustainability (Brundtland Commission, 1987). Environmental sustainable development requires 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), air pollution, and energy demand (Kucukvar et al., 2014c; Nuri Cihat Onat 
et al., 2014a; Tatari et al., 2015a). Sustainable transportation also known as Green Transportation is one of the major 
ingredients of sustainable development and as a result an important factor of environmental development (Ercan et 
al., 2016a). Transportation sector is responsible for 25% of world‚Äôs GHG emissions. There is an increasing trend in 
transportation related GHG emissions in comparison to other sectors (Nuri Cihat Onat et al., 2016b, 2016c). The 
significant concerns such as global climate change, dependence to fossil fuels, and air pollutions in metropole cities 
are leading challenges towards achieving a sustainable transportation (Ercan et al., 2016b). Local and international 
governments are following sustainable transportation strategies such as replacing conventional vehicles which use 
fossil fuels by those which are using electricity like hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) or plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles (PHEV). There is a growing movement toward these alternative vehicles because of their great potential 
in decreasing the negative effects of transportation sector. However, there are some difficulties in these ‚Äúgreen 
vehicles‚Äù widespread implementation like customer‚Äôs reluctance of buying these vehicles or lack of infrastructure",,,south 2017

Abstract 
During a machines lifespan, it reaches a point where it no longer performs as it used to in its early age. 
When this happens, one of the options to consider is the procurement of a new machine. However 
unavailability of funds may always hinder this process leading to the next best solution, redesign (design 
modification). ZXY is a metal and plastic packaging company situated in Zimbabwe. One of their 
production processes produces crown caps for carbonated drinks. Two machines are available for this 
process, the SACMI Press machine and the Callahan press. This paper involves the redesign of a Callahan 
punch press machine for crown caps at ZXY and the factors leading to the design modification .It looks at 
the design of the punching tool, which is the punch and the die, the automation of the guard. After the 
redesign, the implementation of a proactive maintenance strategy is then looked at for the redesigned 
machine.

5. Recommendations and Conclusion 
Introduction and the implementation of design modification is a good initiative. Buying new machinery is costly and 
the cost of transporting it into the country is also high. During use all machines are bound to face problems and 
repairs. For imported machines the spare parts are almost always never available and need to be imported as well. 
This may lead to prolonged downtime in the case of repairs which require the machine to shut down. Every hour a 
machine is not in use, considerable amounts of money are lost and the for line production, the whole line is 
disrupted .design modification may be implemented in conjunction with the application of appropriate technology 
which makes use of locally available technology that decentralized, labour intensive and small scale. Local 
engineers may be used to come with the engineering design modifications to counter act problems and increase 
efficiency of machines. 
When design modification is implemented successfully, even the availability of spare part will not be a problem 
anymore. Parts may then be made available locally for the local design. With the availability of spare parts 
maintenance can be done and implemented successfully. Design modification and import substitution work hand in 
hand in providing alternative solutions for companies suffering through the poor performance of the country‚Äôs 
economy at large. As per observation, there are a lot of old machines at ZXY and other companies in Zimbabwe. 
Instead of engaging the money consuming new machine procurement, the implementation of the initiatives shown 
below is bound to have a positive result on the national industries when implemented correctly.  
 
 
 
Figure 4. New way of design 
5.1 Conclusion 
The three practices below work hand in hand and each stage requires specifically trained personnel to carry out the 
required tasks. The adaptation of these initiative will be beneficial to the country as services and goods would be 
made available locally. At a time when the country is face with the highest levels of unemployment, this is an 
opportunity for job creation in the industrial sector. This also has an advantage of preserving the country‚Äôs foreign 
currency reserves. The most obvious advantage is that it will save a lot of money compared to trying to buy new 
machinery.

Abstract 
Washing clothes is one of the essential parts of life. We all wash our clothes either by hands or by machine. 
A washing machine is a device designed to wash laundry such as clothes and sheets. In these days there 
exists a wide variety of washing machines in the market and there is stiff competition among the 
manufacturers. These washing machines cost between $350 to $750 depending upon functions and features. 
All of these washing machines are powered by electricity and the basic principle of operation is by creating 
a turbulent flow of the detergent around the dirty clothes. Almost 60 percent of our population lives in rural 
areas where it is impossible to use electric powered washing machines, mainly due to the unavailability of 
electricity or the absence of the machine itself due to high costs of purchasing a new washing machine. 
Washing clothes by hand is laborious, strenuous, takes a lot of time and leaves one breathless. This paper 
intends to directly address the problems faced by people in the rural areas when washing clothes by 
designing and fabrication a pedal powered washing machine. The machine can also be used in urban areas 
to save electricity and also to exercise. The machine does not require electricity or an engine but uses human 
power. The transfer of human energy through the use of a foot pedal and crank mechanism is what is known 
as Pedal power. This is the mechanism that has been used to propel bicycles. The paper designs and 
fabricates the pedal powered washing machine. Experiments are conducted in order to determine the 
optimum operating conditions.

environmentally friendly solution. It is the best solution for the environment since some parts use recycled material 
and since it also saves water. The solution does not require electric power or power from internal combustion 
engines thus saving energy. The design has great benefits to the social live hoods of many people in the rural areas. 
Villagers no longer need to waste time scrubbing clothes and thus can utilize that time for other business like 
working in fields. The machine helps protects people‚Äôs hands which were being damaged by washing detergents 
when scrubbing by hands. The machine doesn‚Äôt need one to get into contact with the detergent thus no danger is 
posed to one‚Äôs skin. 
 
Figure 9.3 Graph of load vs time for an 80kg person pedaling at 150rpm 
From the above experiment the optimal speeds for the different loads are: 
1. For a person weighing 50 kg, the optimal speed is 60 rpm and clothes should weigh 1.25 kg. 
2. For a person weighing 65 kg, the optimal speed is 90 rpm and clothes should weigh 1.25 kg. 
3. For a person weighing 80 kg, the optimal speed is 150 rpm and clothes should weigh 1kg. 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
When any detailed design has been done, it is easily understood that no product/design get at its best or 100% 
efficient in its operation. There should always be opportunities for continual development and improvement. As 
shown, despite the fact that the selected concept proved to obtain satisfactory results, it could be still be improved to 
obtain a higher effectiveness of efficiency in the discharge of the intended duty. Although the working model of the 
pedal powered washing machine was fabricated and  implemented,  there  is  a  scope  of  further  work  in  the 
project which has not been undertaken. There are a number of ideas where the loss of power can be reutilized and 
the design can be modified for better performance. The energy wasted during washing can be utilized in most 
fruitful  way  by  using  it  in  another  household  machine  which would work simultaneously as the washing  goes 
on. The capacity of washing can be increased so that more clothes can be washed, thus utilizing the wasted energy. 
It would be more efficient to store energy using a flywheel and use the energy when needed. Future pedal powered 
washing machine should have a flywheel.

5.1 Conclusion 
In order for the machine to be accepted in the community, it must be inexpensive and easy to build. I recognized this 
need and designed the machine from the start with low cost in mind. The machine cost $59 which was less than the 
$100 I had expected. The machine was built using parts which are readily available in rural areas.  Therefore there is 
no need to import components should they wear out. We feel that the washing machine project was 
‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù. A functional prototype of a human-powered washing machine was built.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to identify and explain the dimensions of innovation that have effects on 
the manufacturing competitiveness in the automotive industry through a systematic literature review. The 
definition of the leading countries is based on three different rankings: 1) automotive industry, gathered 
through the figures publicized by the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles 
(OICA) which are then translated into rankings of the industry; 2) manufacturing competitiveness 
rankings based on the Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index (GMCI) and 3) global 
competitiveness and innovation, based on the ranks issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The 
final list of such leading countries is then used to develop a regional comparison of available scientific 
literature gathered through a systematic literature review. Analogously, the quality of the papers found is 
assessed based on the SCIMAGO Journal & Country Rank to determine which papers are to be used to 
identify the factors of innovation previously mentioned; leading to the creation of a quality assessment 
per country of affiliation. Finally, the effects of the different dimensions of innovation are identified in the 
papers that provided the best quality and that belong to such countries to ensure relevancy.

Abstract 
A logistics cluster is a concentration of enterprises which their core activities are logistics and related 
services, in a dense and specific geographical area, pursuing to improve competitiveness in operations and 
services offered by the logistics chains competing as a region. 
This paper presents a theoretical approach related to the logistics and transportation clusters, the main 
factors to remain in a successful operation and how to compete as a group to increase regional 
competitiveness.  
Based on different research frameworks in a wide spectrum of countries about clusters for 
competitiveness and specifically logistics clusters development, a literature review is presented in this 
exploratory study, mainly used to begin the construction of a Logistics Cluster in a particular region in 
Latin America. This logistics cluster is the 11th cluster in the region and the first one based on logistics 
and transportation operations. In brief, the horizontal integration, synergy between members, 
diversification and the geographical logistics intensive agglomeration becomes the main topics of interest 
of this paper, looking forward to build competitiveness through a logistics cluster, and gain attractiveness 
for the region.

1. Introduction
Through the supply chain, goods transportation has represented an important link in order to increase 
competitiveness for organizations, both manufacturing and services. In fact, is mainly important to develop 
strategies to intensify the service level for being competitive in a specific location. Nowadays the aggressive 
competitors are getting together creating alliances for a common front not competing as an enterprise by itself, so 
together they participate as a region against other specific regions to become more attractive and sophisticate to their 
customers. Logistics is not an exception.  
In order to participate in high-end markets, logistics enterprises in Mexico are forming strategic associations 
supported by the government and by academic institutions. 
A cluster initiative is a type of strategic approach based in to develop strategic industrial sectors and emerging 
sectors in a particular region, involving the private initiative, the government and the universities working together 
to mature processes and synergies in specific activity sector to increase competitiveness.

Logistics clusters are taking importance and relevance since global supply chain operations, and are becoming a new 
strategic way to compete in very diverse markets, bringing back to members rapid response to changing business 
environments, innovation dynamics, new business opportunities and strong integration to achieve the competitive 
challenges and improve the firms performance. Other important contribution is the mention that through putting 
together the (1) Geographical agglomeration, (2) horizontal integration, creating (3) synergies between members and 
(4) diversifying transportation, the firms interconnected in a logistics cluster become more efficient and competitive 
in their operations and attractive to serve other industries, accomplishing economies of scale in transportation and 
other logistics operations, their individual productivity tends to increase consistently by operating higher volumes 
and creating direct and indirect new job positions, at the end, the economic development of the region becomes 
more important.  
 
For managers, this research highlighted that logistics clusters can benefit to improve enterprises performance by 
reducing costs and sharing knowledge through collaboration and logistics services sophistication allowing firms to 
take advantage of the given opportunities presented by logistics clustering. 
In the further years, logistics clusters for competitiveness in wide regions would become a key success factor to be a 
player in the very dynamic environmental challenges. 
 
For future research, this study contributes as a baseline to continue developing more investigation related to this 
topic, and to test in correlational and explicative studies the relationship between the factors described and the 
increase in competitiveness through a logistics cluster. 
The opportunity to develop more empirical studies in this area of study supported by the operationalization of the 
variables (factors), to design a reliable measurement instrument and the process to stablish the relevance of each 
variable and to test the relationship among theory and measurement results. 
The expected product at the end will be a model of related factors that influence positively on logistics cluster for 
the Nuevo Le√≥n region.

Abstract 
Electric vehicles have a great potential to decrease the adverse effects of transportation, especially in metropolitan cities. On the other hand, adoption 
of the electric vehicles requires supporting infrastructure such as charging stations and policies to enhance the transition from conventional gasoline 
vehicles to electric vehicles. Hence, determining optimal charging station locations is an important task for both having an economically feasible 
transition and reinforce the market shares of electric vehicles. This paper investigates the optimal locations for charging stations in Istanbul, Turkey. 
An integer programing model is developed and optimal charging locations in Istanbul is determined for three different market penetration scenarios, 
namely 10%, 25%, and 50% market penetration.  The results can be useful for policies aiming to enhance use of electric vehicles, thus minimizing 
the environmental impacts of transportation, as well as fossil fuel dependency.

Introduction  
A well-developed sustainable transportation system is an essential component for sustainable development of metropolitan cities and  researchers 
have been assessing the issues such as environmental, social, economic impacts of transportation systems using operations research tools (Alirezaei 
et al., 2017; N. Onat et al., 2017; Tatari et al., 2015). Private cars are the common transportation mode in cities, contributing the negative affect of 
transportation including greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and energy consumption, air and noise pollution, petroleum dependency, and energy 
security (Ercan et al., 2017, 2016; Onat, 2015a; Onat et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016). All these environmental, social, end economic concerns make 
promoting sustainable transportation system more significant (Onat, 2015b; Onat et al., 2014). Alternative vehicle technologies, particularly electric 
vehicles (EVs), have great potential to solve the listed problems (N. C. Onat et al., 2017; N.C. Onat et al., 2016a, 2016b). The benefits of electric 
cars displacement of petroleum are listed as ‚Äúincreased transportation energy efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, reduced criteria emissions, 
reduced fueling cost, improved consumer acceptance and improved transportation energy sector sustainability‚Äù (Bradley and Frank, 2009; Noori et 
al., 2016; N.C. Onat et al., 2016c; Nuri Cihat Onat et al., 2016).  
Electric vehicles are emerging technological phenomenon in the transportation and they have spread through cities. However, this technology is still 
found to be expensive; hence it is generally preferred by wealthy people. This is stated a result of survey which conducted by EV users in California 
as ‚ÄúThe maximum income asked in both surveys is different and therefore the highest income to compare is $150,000 a year. Plug-in EV owners‚Äô 
income is higher than the general population and new car buyers up to $150k‚Äù (Tal, G. et al., 2013). Radtke et al., (2012) examined the underlying 
reason of people preferring and not preferring electrical vehicles in Japan. Among 265 participants, the most important reason of not considering 
electric vehicles was found to be expensive prices of electrical vehicles, followed by participants concerned about the number of charging stations 
(see Figure 1 for more details) (2012, p.8). These two surveys conducted from different regions, America and Asia, and they had similar findings 
that high income people are more likely to prefer EVs due to its high prices.  
Furthermore, EVs need charging stations for owners, requiring a proper infrastructure optimally spread around the city. In the literature, there are 
studies about finding optimal solutions for charging stations of electric vehicles. For example, Baouche et al., (2014) examined Lyon, France and 
used p-dispersion model with a cost constraint, which includes travelling between each charging stations, and server investment constraint, which 
includes travelling between each charging stations and server investment cost. They concluded that potential locations of charging stations should 
be centralized public places, suggesting shopping centers and/or Center Business District are the best optimal charging station location in Lyon. 
Frade et al., (2011) proposed an optimization of charging units of EVs in Lisbon, Portugal by using Maximal Covering Location Model (MCLP) 
with respect to demand of charging stations. Similarly, Hess et al., (2012)  proposed genetic programming approach and identified optimal charging","Figure 5. Optimal charging location for 50% market penetration 
The number of optimal charging station for each district can be seen in Table 6. The average number of optimal station is 8 for each district which is 
8 times higher for 10% penetration rate. The distribution of charging station was more stable between shopping center, gas station and parking areas. 
Because the total number of parking areas as potential charging location was higher than shopping centers and gas stations, number of parking areas 
as optimal locations were higher number compared to others.

Table 6. Number of optimal charging location for 9 districts for 50% penetration rate 
 
E. Conclusion 
This paper presented a study on optimal locations of the electric vehicle charging stations for in Istanbul. It was significant for Istanbul because EVs 
would be spread in transportation as an environment friendly alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles. There is a need for proper infrastructure and 
determination of accurate locations for electric car drivers to promote the deployment of electric vehicle. Therefore, candidate charging locations 
were chosen among the public places such as shopping centers, public parking areas or gas stations in high income distinct Next, methodology 
proposed an integer programming problem with minimization of the number of allocated site as limited with the certain distance (S). The model was 
solved by GAMS Software and visualized with Google Earth. 
A. Initial target population: High life quality district","Scope of paper were limited with 9 districts which have higher life standards than other districts. The reason behind districts choice was that the early 
adaptors of the EV were expected to have high-income level due to high prices of EV. Furthermore, 9 districts are located in the center of Istanbul, 
both in Asia and European side.  
B. 50% Penetration rate resulted the best optimal locations 
This high penetration rate gave opportunity to people to not have range anxiety because of having enough infrastructure of charging station. So, in 
these 9 districts, the charging locations become normalized such gas stations which were mandatory places for current daily life in Istanbul because 
of current number of gasoline vehicles. The distance between two charging location was short. So, it allowed people to select alternatives and not 
pushing them to leave their routine followed road. The crossed areas that were created by optimal charging locations has increased and nearly all 
points have a crossed covering areas which provide high flexibility for EV users.  
In this paper, methodology suggested that determine possible locations of charging units where were specified as potential point for refueling electric 
vehicle such as shopping malls, parking areas and gas stations like similar studies selected, then solve the integer programming to find the optimal 
number and the place of the charging station among possible locations. Moreover, in second step allocating the charging station by integer 
optimization problem was solved by GAMS Software and also related models used to validate and test the model. For further implementation, three 
different scenarios based on different market penetration rate were solved and the results transformed to visual map. As a future extension of this 
work, the model will include a stochastic extension and studied location will be enlarged. Because the number of candidate points and the districts 
needs to be greater while the penetration rate increase, only limited potential locations are taken into consideration in this paper. Additionally, 
alternative to electric vehicle such as self-driving car should be examined in further studies.

Abstract 
The culture of lean implementation is considered as a key element for its long-term sustainability and leaders play a 
crucial role, since they are responsible for influencing individuals and teams. This article aims at empirically 
examining the relationship between the behavioral orientation of leaders from different hierarchical levels (middle 
managers and frontline leaders) and the implementation phase of the Lean Manufacturing (LM) roadmap. The 
proposed method relies on both qualitative and quantitative fronts since it combines the results of semi-structured 
interviews with lean experts and a cross-sectional survey with 225 leaders from different Brazilian companies that 
are undergoing LM implementation. The study bridges a gap observed in the literature regarding LM 
implementation, as it enables the identification of the relationship between multi-level leadership styles and the 
implementation phases of LM roadmap. The findings support the existence of a transient leadership style orientation 
along the Lean implementation and provide evidence that there is not a single best leadership style for lean 
implementation. 
Keywords 
lean manufacturing implementation; leadership behaviors; lean roadmap. 
1. Introduction
Lean manufacturing (LM) implementation entails fundamental changes in companies‚Äô managerial systems, across 
the organizational and department levels (Wan and Chen, 2008). The LM implementation is about changing both 
technical and socio-cultural aspects (Tortorella and Fogliatto, 2014), which can be seen as the essence of leadership 
(Schein, 2004), since such implementation creates expectations regarding leaderships‚Äô attributes and behaviors 
(House et al., 2004). Further, it is important to approach the underlying culture of lean implementation, considered 
as a key element for its long-term sustainability (Hines et al., 2004). Thus, leaders play a crucial role in the 
establishment of such lean culture, since they are responsible for influencing individuals and teams towards the 
achievement of strategic objectives (Sethuraman and Suresh, 2014). Particularly in a lean change, usually 20% of 
the effort is related to the implementation of lean practices, while 80% focuses on changing leaders‚Äô behaviors 
(Mann, 2009). 
Previous studies, e.g. Womack and Jones (2003) and Spear (2004), have highlighted the importance of a lean 
leadership and the development of certain attributes such as commitment and communication skills. Gelei et al. 
(2015) investigate the leadership attributes that contribute to (or inhibit) a successful lean implementation. A 
common belief is that lean leaders should be cooperative, delegators and excellent motivators of personnel (Angelis 
et al., 2011). However, the analysis is usually undertaken from the perspective of high maturity companies such as 
Toyota, neglecting the evolutionary nature of the implementation process, and its resulting demands for adaptive and 
transient leaderships‚Äô behaviors (Marksberry, 2010). Further research indicates that a successful lean 
implementation demands transformational leaders at the top (Suresh et al., 2012) demonstrating the desired 
behaviors towards the expected culture and outcomes, which must be carried out by transactional leaders in middle 
management levels (Emiliani, 2008; van Dun et al., 2016). Therefore, it is noteworthy the scarcity of detailed studies 
concerning the desirable behaviors of leadership from different hierarchical levels along the evolution of lean 
roadmap implementation, as claimed by Liker (2004), Mann (2009), Liker and Convis (2013), and Dombrowski and 
Mielke (2014).

5. Conclusions 
 
This research suggests two major findings. First, the contextual does matter with regards to leadership style 
orientation along the LEM roadmap phases, although not all variables matter to the same extent. Overall, in 
companies with higher levels of LM practices implementation, the contextual variable that must be mainly observed 
by senior managers and directors is the number of followers that both Middle Managers and Frontline Leaders are 
responsible for. Despite results show that this association may not always happen as expected, senior management 
must take into account this variable and the current phase of the lean implementation in order to better comprehend 
the desired behaviors of these hierarchical levels. Hence, this comprehension allows companies to plan and design 
the organizational structure (size of teams and hierarchy levels) according to expected outcomes for the LM 
implementation. Further, the identification of context‚Äôs influence on leaders‚Äô style orientation helps senior 
management to anticipate leadership development initiatives in order to fulfill the current LEM phase requirements 
and outputs. Secondly, our findings support the existence of a transient leadership style orientation along the 
implementation of the LEM roadmap phases.  Such behavioral shift is evidenced in terms of task and relation 
orientation and may vary according to the hierarchical level. Therefore, contrary to previous research (e.g. 
Dombrowski and Mielke, 2014; van Dun et al., 2016), this study provides evidence that there is not a single best 
leadership style for lean implementation. Actually, the best style orientation appears to be contingent and depends 
on the maturity of the LM implementation (LEM roadmap phase) and the respective role of the leader (Frontline 
Leaders and Middle Managers). 
This research has some limitations. First, respondents were all from companies located in Brazil; their answers 
might be linked to national issues. Thus, this limitation restricts the results to this social and economic condition, 
indicating that diversifying the sample would help providing wider and more generalizable results. Second, the 
sample size effectively confirmed only the effects of some contextual variables and it was not possible to verify all 
variables. The influence of the variables that were not significantly associated may exist in a lower level. If that is 
the case, larger sample sizes can highlight those effects. Additionally, our results are limited to only three leadership 
contextual variables. In real case scenario, leaders are exposed to several contingency factors that may influence 
their behavior and the effectiveness of them during the evolutionary process of LM implementation. Third, the 
establishment of subsets of LM practices according to LEM roadmap phase was based on practices mainly applied 
within manufacturing companies. A wider comparative study among companies that are implementing the lean 
thinking would avoid any potential error on the assessment of practices. 
Future studies could include additional variables or use multiple levels of analysis, such as systems dynamic, to 
capture the composed influence of those variables that were not tested at this study along time. Further, results for 
leadership behaviors at more advanced phases of lean implementation were not convergent. The misalignment 
between ideal behaviors and actual styles preferences may feature an additional opportunity for future research.

Abstract 
Inventory control in perishable products supply chain is one of the biggest challenges today, especially for 
medicines and blood products supply chain. Shortage can increase the mortality risk at hospitals, on the 
contrary, high levels of inventory could generate wastage of these resources. This paper studies the problem 
of inventory control and distribution of blood products. This study determines the number of blood units to 
be processed by the blood center and the number of units of blood products to be ordered by hospitals to 
minimize the total cost and the shortage and wastage levels in blood supply chain. Two optimization models 
are formulated: A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Model for known demands and a Stochastic 
Programming (SP) Model for the case where demands are uncertain, considering multiple periods, types of 
blood and life time of products. Datasets are generated to evaluate the efficiency of proposed models for a 
multi-hospitals single-blood center system. An algorithm is developed to simulate the supply chain and 
evaluate the mathematical models. The results show that the SP Model obtains lower expected rates of 
shortage and wastage compared to the deterministic model. In this last, demands are approximated by their 
mean values.

1. Introduction
Perishable products differ from nonperishable products in that the former can lose their usefulness if they are not 
properly stored and transported or if they are not used within their shelf life. Inventory control in perishable products 
supply chain is one of the biggest challenges today; especially for products requiring a very high service level such as 
medicines and blood products. Shortage of blood can increase the mortality risks at hospitals, on the contrary, high 
levels of inventory could generate wastage of this scares resource. Patients may receive Whole Blood (WB) or 
components of blood. Up to four components can be derived from donated blood. The main transfusable blood 
components include: Red Blood Cells (RBC), Platelets (PLT), plasma and cryoprecipitated AHF condition [1]. 
Components can be mechanically separated from a unit of WB, called whole blood-derived (WBD), or can be obtained 
using apheresis, an automated procedure that filter the desired components from the blood while the remaining 
components flow back into the donor [1]. Table 1 presents principal uses of main transfusable blood components and 
their shelf life. PLTs are the blood component with the shortest shelf life. Shortage and outdated units of blood are 
undesirables through supply chain. Transfusion of WB, RBC and Plasma units decrease between 2008 and 2011. On 
the contrary, the transfusion of PLT units to US patients in 2011 increased by 7.3% from 2008, especially the apheresis 
PLT transfusion with an increase of 11.9% [2]. The National Blood Collection and Usage Report presents data on 
outdated components as a percentage of the total number of units of each type processed for transfusion in 2011. PLT 
were the blood component with the greatest percentage of outdated units with 17.1% for WBD PLT and 12.8% for 
Apheresis PLT compared to WB and RBC (2.4%), plasma (2.2%) and Cryoprecipitate (3.3%) [2].

Table 23 shows the outputs: expected costs and the new evaluation parameter defined in the Algorithm 1, the shortage 
rate in hospitals. The number of simulations defined is ùëÅùëÅ= 100. The simulation of results of the deterministic model 
registers levels of inventory and shortage of blood units in hospitals. If the blood supply chain does not consider 
demand as a stochastic parameter and the blood center produces the units established by the deterministic model just 
as the hospitals order the units established for each period, it is expected that the supply chain present the higher 
shortage rate compared with the expected shortage rate considering the results of the stochastic programming models. 
The expected total costs increase if the expected cost of shortage and the shortage rate decreases.

6. Conclusions  
This document presented a study to optimize the blood supply chain for a single-blood center multiple-hospitals 
system considering products of 8 different blood types. The challenge of inventory control and distribution of 
perishable products, especially blood products, inspired us to start this research. A deterministic and stochastic 
programming models are developed to minimize the total cost and the shortage and wastage levels in blood supply 
chain within a planning horizon. Datasets are generated to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed models and an 
algorithm is used to simulate and evaluate the results from mathematical models. One of the challenges of stochastic 
programming is the size of the problems and the resolution of these in reasonable computational times. For future 
research related to the blood supply chain modeled as a multi-stage problem, it is proposed to evaluate scenarios 
reduction methods. In addition to this, approximation methods can be used such as the L-Shape Method or Cutting 
Plane Approximation in the case of multi-stage problems. Heuristics, Markov processes or other solution methods can 
be developed to optimize the blood supply chain proposed. The mathematical model developed has possibilities of 
expansion: to include ABO compatibility or include other stochastic parameters such as blood supply or C/T ratio.

Abstract 
The global increasing energy demand have made governments more environmental conscious, yet there are also 
impacts on society and the environment. The triple-bottom-line sustainability assessment and Autoregressive 
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods are used for projecting the impacts on environment, economy and 
society until 2050 by electricity production sectors in Turkey from 12 different energy sources, under Business As 
Usual (BAU) and Renewable Energy Development (RED) scenarios. In this regard, three sustainability indicators 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, wages and taxes are quantified based on electricity production from renewable and 
non-renewable resources using a high country and sector resolution EXIOBASE, which is a global multiregional 
input-output (MRIO) database. The results showed that in comparison of BAU with RED scenario, GHG emissions 
associated would be 84% less in RED, wages will be 23% less and taxes would decrease by 22.4% under RED plan 
by 2050. In addition, energy sources responsible for the highest GHG emissions per kilowatt-hour of electricity 
produced are found as biomass, coal, waste and oil. However, coal and biomass contributes to high wages and tax on 
products purchased. This research provides important insights for policy makers to make more informed decisions 
considering environmental, economic and societal performance of electricity production policies.

1. Introduction 
 
Over the past decade, world has seen a significant rise in energy demand and population [1], while energy consumption 
is expected to increase by 34% in 2030 [2]. Policy makers are concerned with devising policy such a way as to mitigate 
the sustainability challenges which are growing more serious over the years [3]-[4]. European Union has already taken 
measures to combat the global warming issue by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions [5], devising ‚ÄúRenewable 
Directives‚Äù in 2009 for the member countries and therefore have successfully moving forward to increase dependency 
on renewable energy from 8.5% to 20% by 2020 [6]. In this effort, Denmark has planned to produce 50% of its 
electricity need from renewable energy sources [7]. While Sweden is the leading county in the EU in terms of 
renewable energy use [1], [8]. The country has already achieved the target of 49% of renewable energy in 2014 and 
is reached 52.6% of total energy consumption by renewable energy sources. Germany aims to produce 45% of its total 
energy through renewables by 2030 while Turkey has the potential to meet 50% of its energy demand from renewable 
energy sources [9]-[10]. There have been significant efforts in attempt to reduce carbon emissions; however, 
sustainability issues are much beyond the climate change. Studies have shown that the de-carbonization policies have 
resulted in the reduction of carbon emissions but have stressed the scarce mineral resources [11]. Energy consumption 
not only affects the environment but also influences other pillars of sustainability such as society and economy. 
Sustainability is often the goal of cooperate sector, government and NGOs but it is hard to classify which one is better 
towards achieving sustainable goals [12]. There is mesh of challenges that if one indicator is adjusted the others are 
effected in negative way. For instance if GHG emissions cut by planning energy mix accordingly for electricity 
production then it is possible that other parameters like gross value added or government revenue will be adversely 
affected by this change. Since every indicators in different dimensions have relations with each other, therefore there 
is a need to carefully monitor the impacts associated with domains like social and economic. The Triple Bottom Line 
approach allows considering this factor [13].",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract 
Emergency medical services-EMS are responsible for pre-hospital stabilization and transport of patients 
under emergency conditions. For EMS, medicine management is essential as affects the safety of the 
patient, the quality and the costs of the services. Medicines are perishable products, which have a constant 
utility up until a known expiration date, this characteristics limiting the lifetime of the good and add 
complexity to their inventory management.  
A study of the processes involved with the replenishment and consumption of medicine on different EMS 
in Medell√≠n-Colombia, showed discrepancies between the records and the inventory on hand, the presence 
of medicine with a lifetime close to their expiration date and perished items. Base on those considerations, 
a medicine inventory model is proposed. The model separates the concepts of inventory replenishment 
and inventory review, and integrates a multi-criteria classification in order to considerate the service 
characteristics and the medicine properties as perishable products.  
This research was funded with public funds of the Colombian government and counted with the support 
of a real EMS. The resulting model was used to establish some functional requirements of Appbulancia, 
an EMS inventory management software to administrate the medical supplies and equipment on this kind 
of services.

Resumen 
Los problemas de localizaci√≥n de instalaciones siguen tomado gran importancia en el √°rea de investigaci√≥n 
de operaciones. Los criterios para decidir la localizaci√≥n de cualquier tipo de instalaci√≥n se ve relacionado 
con los tiempos de respuesta ante distintos acontecimientos y/o ante restricciones de zonas. Las principales 
restricciones en problemas de localizaci√≥n de instalaciones restringen el establecimiento de las mismas en 
zonas prohibidas, zonas congestionadas o bien regiones de barrera. En el contexto de este problema, la 
mayor√≠a de los estudios abarcan el problema de Weber sobre el plano para localizar una instalaci√≥n. En el 
presente trabajo se extiende el problema de Weber sobre una superficie esf√©rica con adaptaci√≥n de 
restricciones para delimitar zonas para la localizaci√≥n de instalaciones. La soluci√≥n de este modelo del 
problema de Weber con instancias de prueba da soporte a la validez de su planteamiento.  
Palabras clave 
Weber, restricciones de zona, esfera 
1. Introducci√≥n
Como lo se√±ala Church y ReVelle [1], una forma importante de medir la efectividad de una ubicaci√≥n de instalaci√≥n 
es mediante la designaci√≥n de la distancia promedio recorrida por aquellos que lo visitan. En problemas ya abordados 
sobre la ubicaci√≥n de instalaciones se consideran restricciones de capacidad para las plantas a localizar con el objetivo 
de satisfacer la demanda de los clientes ubicados en determinada zona. Tambi√©n se abordan problemas de localizaci√≥n 
con restricciones de √°reas debido a la dificultad de acceso a la planta. 
Alfred Weber introduce la teor√≠a de localizaci√≥n de industrias en 1909. Si bien se sabe que el problema de Weber 
busca la ubicaci√≥n de una instalaci√≥n en relaci√≥n con n fuentes de suministro de material sobre un plano, el objetivo 
se logra cuando la suma ponderada de las distancias del centro de servicio a los puntos de demanda se reduce al 
m√≠nimo [2]. 
En consecuencia, se ha extendido el problema de Weber para su aplicaci√≥n en superficies esf√©ricas. Esto para localizar 
una instalaci√≥n considerando una superficie muy similar a la que tiene el planeta Tierra, brindando una mayor 
precisi√≥n en los c√°lculos. Con ello el problema ha pasado a tener una gran importancia en las aplicaciones reales.  
Un punto importante a mencionar es que estos modelos de Weber (en el plano y en la esfera) no consideran las 
condiciones de acceso, rasgos ecol√≥gicos, la comunicaci√≥n viable o bien dimensi√≥n de la instalaci√≥n; por lo tanto, 
disminuye la eficacia de la ubicaci√≥n. Estas consideraciones son aplicables a instalaciones como escuelas, industrias, 
centros de servicio de emergencia y otros a los que la proximidad es deseable y cuentan con restricciones de este tipo. 
As√≠, en el presente trabajo se propone el modelo de Weber sobre la esfera para la localizaci√≥n de instalaciones, 
agregando la restricci√≥n de que el punto a localizar se encuentre dentro de una zona espec√≠fica. Cabe mencionar que 
se utilizar√° la longitud de arco m√°s corta para determinar la distancia entre los puntos dados y la ubicaci√≥n √≥ptima de 
la instalaci√≥n.

5. Conclusiones 
 
La selecci√≥n de un lugar geogr√°fico entre varios para la ubicaci√≥n de instalaciones, tiene un gran impacto dentro de 
cualquier organizaci√≥n, pues no solo son cuestiones de costos, tiempos de respuesta, rentabilidad, sino que tambi√©n, 
se deben considerar factores ecol√≥gicos, zonas restringidas, desplazamientos o bien regiones de barrera. 
 
Aplicando el modelo de Weber sobre la esfera con las restricciones de ubicaci√≥n geogr√°fica, se logra localizar 
instalaciones dentro de los limites especificados, considerando como referencia un punto propuesto o bien la soluci√≥n 
√≥ptima dada por el modelo de Weber sin restricciones. 
 
Al aplicar el modelo de Weber con la restricci√≥n de zonas espec√≠ficas, se observ√≥ que los nuevos puntos √≥ptimos se 
localizan en la frontera de la zona determinada y siendo m√°s concretos muy cerca de una de las esquinas del √°rea 
determinada. 
 
El trabajo a futuro ser√° enfocado en modelar matem√°ticamente las zonas determinadas con diferentes caracter√≠sticas 
de forma.

Abstract 
Success factors that impulse regional growth, such as networks, integration, and efficiency, have been used 
and taken advantage of to enhance the logistics clusters located worldwide. Although the success factors 
play an absolutely necessary role in improving logistics-related activities and operations, there is a 
knowledge gap in the literature regarding their role as an instrument that can boost economic growth. 
Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to identify and subsequently compare the success factors in the 
logistics clusters in three key specific regions: East Asia-Pacific, North America, and Western Europe. This 
paper employed a systematic literature review methodology, which identified 50 publications. The research 
characteristics and objectives were evaluated using a bibliometric analysis identifying a high concentration 
of articles and publications focusing on describing the technology, and innovation in the regions of East 
Asia-Pacific and Western Europe as principal and more important elements of the literature review. The 
findings obtained suggest that the identified success factors that increase the regional growth are equivalent 
in function among the three regions. This conclusion brought in the opportunity to suggest the proposition 
of empirical investigations to gather more information in order to improve the logistics operations within 
the logistics clusters worldwide.

En este art√≠culo se aborda el proceso de mejoramiento de un programa para la enfermedad de 
diabetes en una Instituci√≥n Prestadora de Servicios de Salud (IPS), con el fin de lograr mayor 
adherencia del m√©dico a las gu√≠as cl√≠nicas y del paciente al programa, a trav√©s de la aplicaci√≥n de 
las metodolog√≠as Chronic Care Model (CCM), Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) y Lean 
Six Sigma. 
 Se analiz√≥ un programa en una poblaci√≥n de diab√©ticos no complicados de una (IPS), que presenta 
un crecimiento en prevalencia de diabetes a lo largo de los √∫ltimos 3 a√±os. Se realizaron entrevistas 
semiestructuradas a los responsables del programa y se recolectaron datos secundarios que 
permitieran identificar las principales causas de falla de adherencia, a trav√©s de SIPOC, DMAIC, 
identificaci√≥n de modos potenciales de falla, an√°lisis de los requerimientos cr√≠ticos para la calidad 
y recursos necesarios para la atenci√≥n oportuna y focalizada del paciente.   
Se encontraron tres principales factores que afectan la adherencia al programa  y se plantearon 
soluciones basadas en:  a) mejorar la capacidad del sistema a trav√©s de celdas de atenci√≥n por perfil 
de paciente para mejorar la oportunidad y la resolutividad del m√©dico a trav√©s de un modelo de 
redes de Jackson, b) mejorar los m√©todos y procesos mediante el involucramiento de los pacientes 
como socios en el autocuidado y c) mejorar los mecanismos de control  a trav√©s de herramientas 
para la adherencia al programa que faciliten el seguimiento a los indicadores del control de diabetes 
en el paciente y permitan tomar mejores decisiones. 
Las propuestas de mejoramiento apuntaron a garantizar mayor control de cara a la adherencia. 
Tambi√©n fue importante comprobar la validez pr√°ctica de analizar un escenario de salud, utilizando 
herramientas propias del sector y de la ingenier√≠a industrial para dar respuesta a problemas de falta 
de adherencia a programas de salud.

Conclusiones 
 
ÔÇ∑ 
Se corroboran que los factores definidos en la literatura por la OMS respectoa a las causas de no 
adherencia a los programas de enfermedades cr√≥nicas son el apoyo a los pacientes, factores 
sociales, factores relacionados con el paciente, adherencia de los medicos y apoyo familiar. 
ÔÇ∑ 
Para el programa analizado los factores a intervenir prioritariamente fueron la mejora en la 
capacidad resolutiva del medico y del equipo base, el involucramiento del paciente y el 
mejoramiento de los mecansmos de control que incluyan al paciente y generen informaci√≥n mas 
cercana para la toma de decisones.  
ÔÇ∑ 
El modelo Chronic Care Model (CCM) y Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), son 
complementarios y permiten definir procesos estandarizados, trazables y con informaci√≥n para el 
an√°lisis de resultados y el mejoramiento del progama.  
ÔÇ∑ 
Las herramientas de ingenier√≠a industrial como SIPOC, 6Ms, AMEF, QFD y  Gesti√≥n Visual, que 
hacen parte de metodolog√≠as como Six Sigma y Lean, permitieron aportar al diagn√≥stico de los 
procesos relacionados con al identificaci√≥n de modos de fallo asociados a la no adherencia del 
programa y definir a apartir de all√≠ mejoras a los procesos que hacen parte del modelo Chronic Care 
Model (CCM) y a la determinaci√≥n de controles y de informaci√≥n para volver mas robusto y fiable  
el Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). 
ÔÇ∑ 
El modelo de red de Jackson puede ser usado para la planeaci√≥n de la capacidad futura de m√©dicos 
para las demandas pronosticadas de corto, mediano y largo plazo. Adem√°s el modelo puede 
replicado para el c√°lculo del n√∫mero de actores necesarios del equipo extramural y para el dise√±o 
de talleres de entrenamiento y re entrenamiento por la evoluci√≥n de la enfermedad en los pacientes.  
ÔÇ∑ 
Desde la ingenier√≠a industrial, mediante las herramientas de an√°lisis y mejora de procesos utlizadas 
en esta investigaci√≥n, se considera que se influye sobre la variable de proceso, planteada por 
Averdis Donabedian (1980), que finalmente influye sobre los resultados en salud.  
ÔÇ∑ 
Las propuestas de mejoramiento apuntan a garantizar mayor control y auditoria en el equipo de 
salud de cara a la  adherencia a gu√≠as y v√≠as cl√≠nicas y por parte del paciente contribuye a la 
adherencia al programa.   
ÔÇ∑ 
Las propuesta de mejoramiento deben ser implementadas en el programa de diabetes de forma 
hol√≠stica de tal manera que involucren a todos los actores del servicio y al paciente, para garantizar 
resultados que puedan influir positivamente en la adherencia al programa tal y como se presenta en 
la figura 2.ciclo sist√©mico de al adherencia a programas de tratmiento de la enfermedad, para 
mejorar los resultados en salud.

Resumen 
El Pacto Mundial de las Naciones Unidas establece que la meta de la comunidad internacional y 
empresarial coincide en el cuidado y protecci√≥n del medioambiente. En M√©xico el consumo de bebidas 
embotelladas como refrescos y sus desechos de PET ha generado serios problemas ambientales y sociales. 
As√≠, el objetivo de esta investigaci√≥n fue dise√±ar un modelo de Responsabilidad Social para empresas 
refresqueras y el manejo de sus residuos s√≥lidos de PET. El m√©todo de investigaci√≥n consisti√≥ en un 
estudio correlacional para el cual se emple√≥ un cuestionario dirigido a consumidores de refresco y agua 
embotellada, expertos en Responsabilidad Social involucrados en la problem√°tica del manejo de residuos 
PET. Los resultados de la investigaci√≥n permitieron explicar las relaciones de asociaci√≥n entre las 
variables √©ticas y valores, protecci√≥n del medio ambiente, y relaciones con el consumidor. De esta 
manera se propone un modelo de Responsabilidad que ayude a dichas empresas a fortalecer su 
compromiso con el medioambiente y la sociedad.

1. Introducci√≥n
El Pacto Mundial de las Naciones Unidas es una plataforma pol√≠tica y un marco pr√°ctico para apoyar empresas a 
llegar a ser sustentables. Esta iniciativa pretende armonizar en el mundo las operaciones y estrategias comerciales. 
De esta manera, las empresas, que desempe√±an un papel fundamental en el impulso de la globalizaci√≥n, pueden 
ayudar a garantizar que los mercados, el comercio, la tecnolog√≠a y las finanzas progresen de una forma que beneficie 
a las econom√≠as y las sociedades contribuyendo a tener actividad econ√≥mica m√°s inclusiva [1].Como se√±ala 
Carneiro [2], al considerar a una empresa como una actividad humana de car√°cter econ√≥mico que se dise√±a y se 
pone en marcha con el objetivo de generar resultados a trav√©s de la realizaci√≥n de transacciones econ√≥micas. 
Aunque la Responsabilidad Social es una pr√°ctica incipiente en M√©xico, las empresas aportan valor a la sociedad a 
trav√©s de la creaci√≥n de puestos de trabajo, la generaci√≥n de estabilidad social mediante la acumulaci√≥n de riqueza, 
lo anterior fundamentado en los comportamientos √©ticos y en los valores, por lo que la sociedad solicita a las 
empresas que sean responsables de las consecuencias ambientales y sociales de su actuar, incorporando para ello una 
actitud m√°s positiva en la consideraci√≥n de las necesidades, los valores y los intereses sociales. En este contexto, la

Conclusiones 
Por lo tanto las particularidades sobre los productos proporcionados las empresas refresqueras tienen un papel muy 
importante en las decisiones de compra, porque esta informaci√≥n podr√≠a llegar a constituir la √∫nica informaci√≥n 
disponible para los consumidores de forma r√°pida. El marketing o la informaci√≥n injusta, incompleta, confusa o 
enga√±osa, puede tener como resultado que los consumidores adquieran productos y servicios que no satisfagan sus 
necesidades y ser incluso peligrosos para el consumidor o el medio ambiente,  esto puede afectar negativamente al 
crecimiento de mercados de productos m√°s sostenibles.  
 
Para contribuir al consumo sostenible las empresas refresqueras deber√≠an promover una educaci√≥n eficaz que d√© 
poder a los consumidores y les permita entender los impactos en su bienestar y el medio ambiente de las elecciones 
de productos que realizan, adem√°s de proporcionar a los consumidores productos beneficiosos, desde  el  punto  de  
vista  social  y ambiental, considerando el ciclo de vida completo y reducir los impactos negativos para la sociedad y 
el medio ambiente a trav√©s de la eliminaci√≥n, o la minimizaci√≥n de los impactos negativos para la salud y el medio 
ambiente de productos, adem√°s de ofrecer servicios de reciclaje y disposici√≥n final de los residuos s√≥lidos urbanos 
de PET.  
 
Aunado a lo anterior las iniciativas de educaci√≥n y toma de conciencia permiten a los consumidores estar bien 
informados, ser conscientes de sus derechos y responsabilidades, tener mayores probabilidades de asumir un papel 
activo y ser capaces de tomar decisiones informadas, en cuanto a la compra de productos y consumir de manera 
responsable. La intenci√≥n de la educaci√≥n de los consumidores no busca √∫nicamente transferir conocimientos, sino 
tambi√©n la  aplicaci√≥n de esos conocimientos. Al educar a los consumidores, las empresas refresqueras  deber√≠an 
abordar la protecci√≥n del medio ambiente, el consumo sostenible y la disposici√≥n final adecuada de los residuos 
s√≥lidos urbano de PET.    
 
Consolidar la responsabilidad social en las operaciones de las empresas refresqueras conlleva compromiso y 
entendimiento, por lo que se tiene que hacer un esfuerzo en la de toma de conciencia acerca de la √©tica y valores a 
practicar adem√°s de centrarse en el aumento del entendimiento de los diferentes aspectos de la responsabilidad 
social, incluidos los compromisos √©ticos y el reconocimiento de las esferas elementales de responsabilidad social de 
los RSU de PET. El compromiso y el entendimiento deber√≠an de empezar por los l√≠deres de las empresas 
refresqueras.  De esta manera se tendr√≠a que incorporar en la declaraci√≥n de la misi√≥n referencias espec√≠ficas, claras 
y concisas a los aspectos importantes de la responsabilidad social, incluyendo los principios y asuntos de 
responsabilidad social que ayuden a determinar la manera en que la organizaci√≥n opera con respecto a el manejo y 
disposici√≥n de los residuos s√≥lidos urbanos de PET para reducir y en su caso eliminar la contaminaci√≥n ambiental. 
Fundamentalmente se deber√° incluir la responsabilidad social como un elemento clave de la estrategia de la 
organizaci√≥n, mediante su integraci√≥n en sistemas, pol√≠ticas, procesos y comportamiento para la toma de decisiones. 
  
Adem√°s de revisar las actividades actuales, las empresas refresqueras tambi√©n deber√≠an mantenerse informadas 
sobre los cambios en las expectativas, en las modificaciones regulatorias que afecten a la responsabilidad social y en 
las nuevas oportunidades para mejorar sus esfuerzos en la materia.  Asimismo la consolidaci√≥n de la responsabilidad 
social empresarial no ser√≠a efectiva sin la cuidadosa supervisi√≥n, evaluaci√≥n y revisi√≥n de las actividades 
emprendidas, los progresos realizados, la consecuci√≥n de los objetivos identificados y los recursos.  
 
Por lo que el seguimiento continuo o la vigilancia de actividades de la responsabilidad social asegura  que  las  
actividades  se  est√©n  llevando  a  cabo  como  se  pretende.  Igualmente la Uni√≥n Europea (UE) reconoce que es 
crucial el apoyo de las empresas para la protecci√≥n del medioambiente. Esto significa que habr√° que consultar al 
sector privado a la hora de redactar legislaci√≥n nueva, cofinanciar investigaciones y ofrecer incentivos a las 
empresas que mejoren su rendimiento ecol√≥gico [36]. En este contexto, la contrataci√≥n particular es ineficiente, de 
manera que los an√°lisis econ√≥micos se han traducido en una prolija legislaci√≥n ambiental que regula el impacto 
sobre el medio natural de las empresas guiadas bajo el principio de ""quien contamina paga"". La legislaci√≥n 
ambiental no es el √∫nico mecanismo procedente del entorno institucional que puede propiciar la adopci√≥n de 
pr√°cticas ambientales [37].

Abstract 
Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is growing more than urban solid waste 
generating impacts for environment and human health. Due to development of Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT), the Higher Education Institutions (HIE) have adopted 
measures to correctly manage WEEE, as HIE contribute to growth of WEEE by replacing and/or 
disposing equipment to strengthen and satisfy institutional operations. The objective of this article 
is to propose an institutional framework related to Reverse Logistics (RL) for the management of 
RAEE. The Study of Times and Value Stream Mapping was conducted to establish the connection 
of agents involved in the management. Results show the potential HIE have to strengthen decision 
making process through RL obtaining economics and environmental benefits.

Abstract 
 
Customer service is one of the things companies have to be the most careful about and it involves many 
different aspects from prices, on-time deliveries, defects and other things. In other words the offer that a 
company makes to a client and therefore the reason why a client decides to work with a company. In this 
research paper our objective was to improve the deteriorated relationship between a supplier and its client 
by increasing the amount of on-time deliveries. We used the Lean Six Sigma methodology and DMAIC to 
give our research structure. This involved the use of different tools like R and R, Pareto diagrams, VSM, 
SMED, AMEF and other things. Through our analysis we found two main reasons why deliveries are late. 
The first one is the amount of time mouldings are in repairs because of defects and the second one is the 
amount of time that is lost in changeovers. To attack these two points we implemented tools like 5S, SMED 
and others and were able to improve on-time deliveries by 7%.

1.1 Description of the company 
Fabricacion de Maquinas (FAMA) is a company that is part of the Vitro group. Their main market has been the 
metalworking industry in national and international levels for more than 70 years since the company first opened. 
Eventually when the glass industry started growing a necessity to produce glass bottles was born forcing Vitro to 
create bottling plants. These bottling plants needed mouldings to start production of glass bottles so FAMA started 
producing everything that is necessary to produce a glass bottle, but their main products are: 
‚Ä¢ 
blank mould 
‚Ä¢ 
blow mould 
A blank mould is used to give the bottle a preform, called its blank shape and is used to measure the amount of glass 
that is necessary for a specific bottle. A blow mould is used to give the bottle its final shape and is used to do different 
printings on the bottle by the use of internal cuts in the moulding. 
Currently FAMA produces these for many different important industries, for example: 
‚Ä¢ 
Beer industry 
‚Ä¢ 
Soda bottles 
‚Ä¢ 
Wine bottles 
‚Ä¢ 
Jar containers 
 
1.2 Current situation 
In 2015 the company Owens-Illinois bought the bottling plants of Vitro group turning into the main client of FAMA. 
Because of the relationship between FAMA and Vitro‚Äôs bottling plants both companies agreed to keep working 
together, as long as FAMA is able to achieve good results in:

Internal audits: We decided to apply weekly audits, where the process of measuring, calibrating 
and keeping everything in order are evaluated. We also tracked the progress of our project 
through an evaluation called SOL (Security, order and cleaning) that is already implemented 
monthly by FAMA.  
 
‚Ä¢ 
Measuring tools record update 
We found a lot of measuring tools that needed to be calibrated, so we coordinate with the Projects, 
Security and Metrology areas to inspect all the instruments in all the work areas.  
After the inspection, we found 22 out of 50 instruments that need to be calibrated immediately 
because their calibration was expired. Also, 9 instruments were found without a label and were also 
checked and labeled. 
‚Ä¢ 
Design of experiments 
The goal of the experiment was to find the ideal parameters to run the machine, to maximize the 
lifetime of the cutting tools. After several tests, we found the following ideal parameters:  
- 
1000 RPM 
- 
50% speed 
- 
10 gallons of soluble 
The original parameters that are normally used in the plant are these: 
- 
1,080 RPM 
- 
70% speed 
- 
7 gallons of soluble 
With the original conditions, the cutting tool can work on 69 mouldings before it must be changed. 
With the new conditions that we found through the experiment the cutting tool can last 90 
mouldings. With this information, we spoke with the operators to standardize the lifetime of this 
specific tool and now the operators know when they must change it. 
‚Ä¢ 
SMED 
We compared the changeover times before the beginning of the project, during the project and also 
after the implementation was done, and we found better results when we helped the operators to do 
all the external activities (at the design stage). 
There was a time reduction in the third stage of the project (implementation), as you can see in the 
following chart:

Manuals delivered:  
Besides designing the operation manuals, we instructed all the operators on how to do several key 
things of their work. This was the most difficult part of the project because not only we needed to 
find the correct way of doing things but we also had to change the normal structure of thinking, 
break all the paradigms and eliminate all the wrong practices from the operators.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Now that we had done all this we updated the scoreboard with information from before we started 
implementing and from the first week of May to better evaluate the effects of the project. This is the

Abstract 
El servicio al cliente es una de las cosas que m√°s deben cuidar las empresas e  involucra muchas cosas 
desde los precios, los tiempos de entrega, las entregas a tiempo, las piezas defectuosas, entre otras cosas. 
En otras palabras es toda la oferta que se le hace a un cliente y por lo tanto es la raz√≥n por la que un cliente 
decide trabajar con una empresa. 
En esta investigaci√≥n nuestro objetivo era mejorar la decadente relaci√≥n entre un proveedor y su cliente al 
aumentar las entregas a tiempo. 
Utilizamos la metodolog√≠a Lean Six Sigma y la herramienta DMAIC para darle estructura a nuestra 
investigaci√≥n. Esto involucro el uso de diferentes herramientas como, R y R, diagramas de Pareto, VSM, 
SMED, AMEF, entre otras. A trav√©s del an√°lisis de estas herramientas encontramos que hay dos razones 
por las que las entregas no se est√°n haciendo a tiempo. La primera es la cantidad de tiempo que los lotes 
pasan en reparaciones por defectos y la segunda es la cantidad de tiempo que se pierde en cambios de 
formato. 
Para  poder atacar estos dos puntos  implementamos herramientas como 5¬¥S, SMED, entre otras y se 
aument√≥ 7 puntos porcentuales las entregas a tiempo.

Abstract 
Solid waste management involves making decisions regarding differents alternatives that impact the 
environment, society and economy. For this reason, reverse logistics strategies have been initiated in 
order to recover the value of waste and reduce the negative impact on the environment. The objective of 
this article is to propose a model to selecting strategies for the reverse logistics of hospital waste that can 
be used, considering multiple criteria to support the decision-making process. Different important criteria 
were identified in the review of the bibliography, they were validated from primary sources, with which 
they were determined which should be considered in the process, as well as identified more convenient 
inverse logistic strategies, AHP methodologies and TOPSIS to obtain the results of the decision.

Abstract 
Researcher and academics have been using operation management methods and tools, as continuous 
improvement projects, to address problems related to process efficiency and financial pressure in hospitals. 
Although there are literature reviews related to continuous improvement projects in hospitals, to authors‚Äô 
knowledge, there is a lack of information about the contributions that other operation management methods 
and tools have been applied and/or investigated in hospitals, such as supply chain management, logistics, 
human resources, and performance measurement.  Therefore, the purposes of this research are (i) define if 
hospitals‚Äô problems and solutions is a topic of interest in an overall operations management field and (ii) to 
characterize the literature available.  In order to achieve this aim, a literature review limited to the 
International Journal of Operation and Production Management was conducted.  This research shows that 
hospital problems and solutions have been increasing over time in an operations management field overall, 
author collaboration has been increasing in recent years, and the topics most commonly addressed are 
related to performance, quality and process improvement.  The limitation of this research is the use of a 
single journal; therefore, future work should be conducted a systematic literature review to validate some 
of these findings.

1. Introduction
Hospital services are very different than manufacturing and other service organizations (Berry & Seltman, 2008) in
that the service represents a necessity, patients (or customers) are usually sick, and hospitals are complex organizations
where human interaction is constantly present throughout the processes, with limited resources (Harper, 2002).  Patient
safety problems showed some of the inefficiency of the organizational processes that hospitals have (Institute of
Medicine, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2001).  Researchers and academics have been using operation management
(OM) methods and tools as continuous improvement projects to address problems related to process efficiency
(Herzlinger, 2006; Leape & Fromson, 2006; Baddour & Saleh, 2013) and financial pressure in hospitals (Stevenson,
2011).  Although there are recent systematic literature reviews related to continuous improvement projects in hospitals
(Gonzalez Aleu, Van Aken, & Keathley, 2016; Gonzalez Aleu & Van Aken, in press), to author knowledge, there is
a lack of information about the contributions that other operations management methods and tools have been applied
and/or investigated in hospitals, such as supply chain management, logistics, human resources, and performance
measurement.
The purposes of this research are (i) define if hospitals problems and solutions is a topic of interest in an operations 
management field overall and (ii) to characterize the literature available on OM in hospitals using the dimensions of 
publication characteristics, author characteristics, and content characteristics (Keathley-Herring et. al, 2016). This 
investigation seeks to answer the following research questions: what trends (positive or negative) exist in the frequency 
of publications in a journal specialized in operation management addressing topics related to hospitals? which are the

Bogota, Colombia, October 25-26, 2017 
This first stage of the research, about the dimension of publications, has demonstrated that the application of 
Operations Management in hospitals is in a phase of early growth and development, increasing in relevance during 
the last decade. A total of 44 publications on the subject have been found among the 2014 publications from the journal 
since its foundation in 1980.  Through the analysis of the publication trends to answer RQ1, it was found that of the 
publications in the sample, 70.5 per cent have been made from 2002-2016, and 50 per cent of the total have been made 
in the last 10 years. This growth in relevance seems to have been strongly influenced by the publications of the Institute 
of Medicine in the beginning of the 2000s (2000, 2001). The data reflects that this development should continue in 
the following years and there are many areas of opportunity for development. The phase of this research area was 
defined by using the business approach of the product‚Äôs lifecycle theory. The slow adoption in previous years followed 
by an accelerated increase in frequency started in recent years suggests a phase of early growth. 
 
Later, the analysis for RQ2 showed that most of the publications have been made by groups of 2-to-3 authors that 
made a single publication. However, in recent years there has been a group of authors that is guiding the research: 
Dirk Pieter van Donk, Justin Drupsteen, and Taco van der Vaart from the Netherlands. They published together in 
2013 and 2016, being the only group to have multiple publications in the sample. This also indicates a phase early 
development in the research area, and presents an opportunity for author collaboration and leadership, which can 
contribute to develop maturity (Keathley-Herring et al., 2016).  Still in the author dimensions, the sample features 
representatives from 14 different countries, with 65% of the authors from USA, UK, and Netherlands in the respective 
order of representation. This concentration suggests that there is room for further international collaboration and 
development. There is also a high cooperation between authors from different institutions, with nearly 50 per cent of 
the articles featuring authors from different organizations. This is positive and can benefit the quality in future 
publications. An interesting example of collaboration between different knowledge areas was found between Civil 
Engineering and Social, Political and Institutional science. The result is a study with a strong theoretical base in social 
and institutional studies, a research methodology proper for this area, and an equation model to test the results. This 
is an example of successful collaboration between different knowledge areas and applicability of external practices 
into hospital and healthcare research. The area can benefit from more cases as this one in future research. 
 
Through the analysis for RQ3 and RQ4, key information was found to understand the development in this area and 
the main topics present in the sample. The first finding in the content is that most of the papers (38 of 44) in the sample 
present exclusively an investigation research, while the presence of application is reduced. This finding can be linked 
to the early development stage identified in the sample. The content analysis provided the most frequent topics and 
concepts, which are related to performance, resource management, quality management and operation improvement. 
This provides the context of what is currently being investigated and the main areas of interest of OM in hospitals. As 
stated in the introduction section, hospitals are complex organizations with limited resources, and the research is 
focusing on these issues to reach an optimal level of operations. Also, the constant human interaction present in 
hospitals an area of interest for the application of OM in these organizations. 
 
4.2 Discussion 
This research provides a structured reference for researchers and practitioners to identify the state of research of OM 
in hospitals; it can be used to obtain information in the literature. In the case of practitioners, the study identifies what 
has been investigated already, the publications from previous applications are identified and can be followed for 
further development.  
 
For researchers, it provides a similar advantage. Information in this study can be used as a scoping study and a starting 
point for an extensive literature review. Also, the main subjects of interest can be useful data for new authors to guide 
their research. The content analysis presents in a clear way the research lines that are being studied and which ones 
have opportunity for development. The different content characteristics are a clear image for this purpose.  
 
4.3 Limitations 
This investigation is limited to a single journal, the IJOPM. This condition skews the results and they could vary 
against information from other journals or databases. However, this paper intends to present a scoping study. The 
selection of the journal was determined due to its academic relevance to the research in Operations Management 
(Scimago, 2017). It is also an academic journal that has a general approach to OM, which is useful to appreciate the 
role of OM in hospitals as part of the research area overall. Lastly, the journal was also accessible for the researcher 
and matched the study‚Äôs requirements.  The journal still provided a varied sample that featured different topics of OM 
and research tools, this enabled a complete analysis and proper conclusions that can be complemented with future

Abstract 
Looking forward to reduce their transportation expenses, the transport and traffic department of a 
steel company has implemented a system, which consists in a set of circuits developed to achieve a 
fast, efficient and low cost transportation, with a common origin and/or destination. These circuits 
have been called clusters. The clusters operate with contracts that prioritize the transport operation to 
contractors who cover them at a lower price per trip and with volume targets measured in terms of 
number of daily trips per truck. However, the contractors‚Äô expected performance in those clusters has 
not achieved the established targets for two of the four identified clusters. The objective of this project 
is to increase the daily trips per truck by 30 percentage points, in clusters one and four. DMAIC 
methodology was followed to accomplish this objective. For the accepted and implemented proposals, 
a post indicators vs. base line comparison was made, and for those unimplemented proposals, a 
discrete event simulation was developed by ProModel program, in order to estimate their impact.

Introduction 
Road transportation has become an important factor in international trade and the management of supply chains 
(Villarreal 2016). Delays and unnecessary transportation can raise freight costs and reduce profit margins. (Bachraoui 
2016) Understanding lean concepts is key for identifying waste and optimizing the supply chain without spending a

With these results, it can be estimated that when implementing the row priority in all the plants for cluster 1, there 
would be a 46% increase on trips. Likewise, when implementing the row priority in the plants of Guerrero and 
Churubusco for cluster 4, there would be a 50% increase on trips. 
 
5.9 
Investments and procedural changes 
Of the strategies selected, only the number 1 required an investment by the company to buy the crane system. The 
value of the investment is $ 5,464,188 MXN, approximately 310,178 US Dollars. For the rest of the strategies, 
procedural changes were made, of which the most significant were: 
 
‚Ä¢ 
Strategy 2 (Priority in queues for cluster trucks): In this strategy the procedure of entry to the plant and the queue 
of waiting for the loading and unloading of materials was changed. The main change is to stop waiting in line like 
any truck and skip it being the first to entry to the platforms once it becomes available again. 
‚Ä¢ 
Strategy 3 (Alternate routes): For this strategy, previously there was only one route established for each one of 
the trips without being in several occasions the best option, however, once the project was implemented, each 
route has alternatives of routes that can be used and that show an improvement in time or distance. 
‚Ä¢ 
Strategy 4 (Multiple shift changes): For this strategy, the procedure change focuses on the fact that two shifts 
were made previously, in which all the pilots did at the same time. Once the project was implemented, there are 
the same two shifts per day, however, instead of changing everything at the same time, two groups are changed 
that shift shifts at different times to avoid recording low activity peaks.

Conclusions 
 
The case of study presented in this document highlights the contribution made to a major company in the region 
dedicated to the production of steel products, with the aim of increasing the number of trips in two of the clusters 
defined by the company. Although the objective presented seems very specific at first sight, the process of analysis 
involved a holistic understanding of the operations of the transport and traffic department of the company. 
 
The process improvement methodology DMAIC guided the actions involving the application of techniques and basic 
concepts of industrial engineering. Those goes from descriptive and inferential statistical analysis and process 
redesign, to implementation of simulation of discrete event models to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposals in a 
dynamic and uncertainty environment. 
 
The clarity of the exposure of the current situation and the justification of the proposals to the managers in the company 
allowed several of them to be quickly approved and implemented, so in this report it is possible to observe not only 
simulated or estimated results but real ones.

Abstract 
Waste of Electrical and Electronics Equipment (WEEE) is growing due to the short life cycles and to the 
random consumption patterns. These waste contain both hazardous and valuable materials which need a 
suitable management approach. Reverse logistics (RL) is a strategy to recover value from materials that 
have diminish it at any stage in the supply chain. This work is aimed at exploring the environmental and 
economic benefits of a RL system for the WEEE management at higher education institutions. 
Environmental benefits for decreasing the extration of raw materials due to recovery and also for avoiding 
to dispose WEEE in the landfill. Industrial metabolism was used by applying the MET matrix (Materials, 
Energy, Toxicology) as a tool for the cualitative life cycle analysis. Economic benefits were considered 
like the income for the materials recovered and costs due to the resources allocated in the RL system 
activities. The results provided with a global vision of the inputs and outputs at each stage of the life cycle 
of the RL system for the WEEE management. The evaluation of inputs and outputs represent a key issue 
for decision making process related to a complex object of knowledge such WEEE management.

Abstract 
When a call for a service is received by an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provider, a decision must 
be made on which vehicle to send to provide assistance. The dispatched vehicle becomes busy and the 
system‚Äôs preparedness to attend a new call decreases. Therefore, to increase this value, idle EMS vehicles 
could be relocated among the standby sites.  This study aims to evaluate the effect on the critical 
performance measures of the system, the sequential application of a dispatching mathematical model and a 
relocation model, taking into account the operational requirements of an EMS provider in Colombia.  
Four scenarios were simulated during a period of maximum activity to evaluate the dynamic state of the 
system given by the dispatch and relocation decisions. Dispatch decisions should follow the most common 
rule -dispatch the nearest vehicle- or the optimal solution of a dispatching model. Relocation options were 
either doing nothing and following the optimal solution of a mathematical relocation model. Both models 
consider the fleet and the services heterogeneous, and look for to improve the system‚Äôs preparedness level. 
The simulated system showed improvements in response times and preparedness levels of up to 54% when 
the dispatch follows the solution of the mathematical model and no relocation occurs.

Introduction 
Quality of care is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired 
health outcomes, and are consistent with current professional knowledge (Sanders, 2002). Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS) are part of these services. The dispatch and relocation of the ambulance -when appropriate-, in a given 
area of coverage are two of the key elements to reduce the waiting time of a potential patient and the initiation a health 
care service. During the operation of an EMS provider, frequent decisions about which vehicle to send to respond to 
a service call are taken. The dispatched vehicle becomes busy and the system‚Äôs preparedness for a new call decreases. 
An action to restore the system's service level might be to relocate some of the idle EMS vehicles waiting at their 
standby sites.  The impact of these decisions is directly received by the patient, which may affect their chances of 
survival (McLay & Mayorga, 2010); (Pons, et al., 2005)). From the patient‚Äôs point of view, response times are by far 
the most important performance measure for an EMS provider, and it is one of the measures most studied in the 
literature ( (Nogueira, Pinto, & Silva, 2016), (Wei Lam, et al., 2014), (Pons, et al., 2005)).  However, different

Improvements on response times and preparedness levels reached 54%, by comparing this scenario with the default 
scenario (i.e. the nearest dispatching rule without relocation). Reductions on the standard deviation of these variables 
were obtained, with a greater reduction (85%) on the standard deviation of the preparedness level for urgency calls.   
On other hand, fleet occupancy was also improved (25% reduction) but the increase in the standard deviation reflects 
low balance of workload. 
 
The first thing to be observed from the ANOVA results is that the decisions of dispatch have greater influence in the 
performance measures than the ones of relocation.  Both types of decisions can explain 66.3% of response time 
variation and 76.6% of preparedness levels, and have an even more impact in the fleet occupancy (86.7%).  It should 
be noted that the two main quality performance measures (i.e. response times and preparedness level) for the more 
critical cases, -the urgency calls-, are much more sensible to both dispatching and relocation decisions. The variability 
of preparedness level for urgency calls, can be estimated with a  ùëÖùëÖùëéùëé
2= 0.987, and the response times with a  ùëÖùëÖùëéùëé
2= 0.999, 
which are very high values. In contrast, response times are only explained 66.3% with both factors. This value makes 
sense, since both decisions are taken at the beginning of the EMS vehicle‚Äôs travel, and the response time also greatly 
depends on the distance to the destination.   
 
4.1 
Limitations 
Only four complete runs were simulated in the same horizon, which was the most congested one in observed the 
period. Taking more replicates makes no sense, since the models are deterministic. The results shown here are only 
valid to the EMS provider under study, and for the two mathematical models used, which were taken from the literature 
and they were adapted to the operating conditions of that EMS provider. However, general conclusions are a call for 
EMS provider companies to consider the use of operations research models to improve their quality performance. 
During the simulation, the probability of vehicle breaking or maintenance was not included.  During the selected 
horizon, no emergency calls were received. 
 
5 
Conclusions 
 
The performance measures of the most critical calls -the urgency ones-, were found to be significantly affected by 
both, the dispatching and relocation methods. In particular, the preparedness of the system and the response times for 
to handle urgency calls were the most sensitive performance measures. The scenario that reports a better performance 
for a period of peak activity of the EMS provider under study was to dispatch an ambulance according the optimal 
solution indicated by the mathematical model without relocating idle vehicles, because the times between call arrivals 
are very short. Then, an EMS provider should consider alternatives to the most common rule of assigning the vehicle 
closest to a call. It will be necessary to study other scenarios, with less demand, to verify if the use of the mathematical 
model to relocate can influence favorably the average times of response and the preparation of the system. It was 
found that the use of optimization models, such as those used in this work to dispatch and relocate EMS vehicles, can 
improve not only the average response time but also the system preparedness to handle new calls, especially when 
major services are requested priority.

Abstract 
Calicarnes is a food company established in the city of Cali, whose commercial activity is the disposition 
and distribution of meats. Due to a prior diagnosis identified the need to improve its planning function and 
inventory management, a mathematical inventory model was developed to identify of order size and age 
traceability of the meat cuts. This model gives an estimate of the amount of optimal raw material (pig 
carcasses) to be demanded to meet weekly demand of cuts over a period of eight weeks. In addition, it 
allows following the time of storage of each type of cut and of this form to provide support to the area of 
supply. The proposed model manages to reduce inventory levels by approximately 20%.  The traceability 
of the different cuts in the inventory using the PEPS (first in, first out) discipline guarantees a rotation of 
the products and reduces the amount of kilograms lost by expiration.

Figure 5. Second run results: (a) Number of pig carcasses purchased to be sold as whole pieces. (b) Number of pig 
carcasses purchased to be divided in cuts. (c) Final total inventory. (d) Profit. 
 
Figure 5 shows the results of the second run. In this run real data of the 8 weeks following the first run is compared. 
The model uses as initial inventory the final inventory simulated in the first run. Figure 5.a shows similar decisions 
on the number of pig carcasses to be sold as whole pieces while Figure 5.b shows a more stable difference in the 
number of pig carcasses to be divided in cuts, with an average difference of 18. This impacts directly on the average 
inventory, as shown in Figure 5.c. Finally, Figure 5.d shows a greater and more stable profit. 
 
Finally, Table 4 shows a summary of both runs. It shows reductions of more than 85% in the inventory in both cases, 
due to a reduction of about 30% of the number of pig carcasses to be purchased every week. Profit also increases. The 
first run shows157% increase and an adjustment can be observed in the behavior of the system. Run 2 starts with 
inventory that already reflects these changes, and shows a profit increase of almost 50%. However, as a consequence 
of smaller purchases, the shortages of the top 4 cuts increase up to 119.1%.  It is worth noting that even in the real 
scenario, where purchases are 30% more, shortages are still present.

Conclusions 
 
A forecasting ‚Äì optimization methodology is proposed to improve inventory management in a small and young beef 
and pork retailer company in the city of Cali. The model considers fixed lifetime of the perishable products. To 
estimate sales, a forecasting model is selected for each product and these estimations are used as an input to the 
optimization model. The later maximizes profit, subject to capacity constraints. It tracks the age of the cuts in

inventory, which follows a FIFO policy, with nonlinear constraints. This is a very relevant aspect when it comes to 
perishable products. Inventory, transportation, processing and pig carcasses costs are considered in the model.  Finally, 
an easy, user-friendly and accessible implementation on Excel was developed to select order size in a periodic revision 
system. The model was implemented and tested for an 8 week horizon, under two real scenarios. It showed potential 
improvements of more than 85% inventory reduction, a purchase reduction of about 30% of pig carcasses, and profit 
increase of 157% in the first run, and 49.5% in the second run. Future extensions of this model are to remove the 
assumption of having all initial inventory of one week old, and to adapt the model to beef, and to take care of shortages, 
which increases due to the purchase reductions.

Abstract 
This article present an analyses of reverse logistic strategies that can used as supporting municipal solid 
waste management in a medium city. First, we diagnose the current situation regarding the management of 
solid waste in a Colombian city, from generation, collection, treatment and final disposal, using qualitative 
research. Surveys were used for public officials and others involved in the management system. Further, 
we analysed different perceptions about evolution waste management, in order to identify possible 
improvements in the system. Then, Reverse logistics alternatives for municipal solid waste were proposed, 
which were validated and selected using multi-criteria techniques.

Abstract 
Studies on energy efficiency in vehicles require as input data values for the drag (Cd) and the rolling 
resistance (Fr) coefficients obtained under real operational conditions of the vehicles. Frequently, these 
values are unknown for the case of cargo and passenger transportation vehicles, which are the largest 
consumers of fuel among ground vehicles. The accepted measurement methods for the determination of Cd 
and Fr are expensive and are still being questioned for their low capacity to reflect the real operational 
conditions of the vehicles. This work evaluates the level of accuracy and precision of Cd and Fr obtained 
by on road coast down tests, which is an easy to implement and affordable alternative method to obtain 
those coefficients under real operational conditions. We added to this method the influence of the road 
grade and the use of the generalized reduced gradient technique to minimize the differences between the 
speed obtained by an analytical model, where Cd and Fr are an unknown, and the instantaneous speed 
measured during cost down tests conducted following the testing protocols recommended by the SAE 
J1263. This combined method was applied to a sample of 19 vehicles. The obtained values of Cd and Fr 
showed an average accuracy error < 5.2 % and an average precision error < 6.1%, that are acceptable for 
studies in energy efficiency in vehicles.

4. Conclusions 
Currently there is need for an affordable and easy to implement methodology to determine Cd and Fr values, under 
real conditions, and with acceptable levels of accuracy and precision for studies on energy efficiency in cargo and 
passenger vehicles. To address this need we proposed the use of on road coast down tests with the use of modern 
speed measurement technologies (GPS) in combination with the generalized reduced gradient method, and the 
inclusion of instantaneous road grades effects. 
Multiple coast down tests (>10) over a sample of 19 vehicles, and the use of the generalized reduced gradient 
technique, showed that this combination generates Cd and Fr results with accuracy levels and precision appropriate 
for studies on energy efficiency in vehicles. The average accuracy error was < 5.2% and the average precision error 
was < 6.1 %. 
This methodology generates Cd values that encompass all the forces opposing to the motion of the vehicle and are 
proportional to the square speed, and Fr values that embody all the forces that are proportional to the vehicle speed, 
irrespective of whether those forces correspond to aerodynamic forces or to the rolling resistance forces, respectively. 
These values reflect the real average performance of ground vehicles at speeds below 120 km/h.

Abstract 
The institutions of higher education that aim at continuous improvement, within the framework of 
accreditation of high institutional quality, can complement and potentiate their quality management model 
on philosophies such as Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing. These philosophies enhance the possibilities 
of obtaining excellent quality services and effective, efficient and economical processes, which are some 
of the benefits that these philosophies have obtained in different industries and sectors of the economy.  
This article presents and disseminates a Lean Six Sigma model that systematically integrates these two 
methodologies with the DMAIC structure and establishes its own techniques and tools for the improvement 
of services offered by higher education institutions. The article explains in detail the steps and techniques 
for each phase of the DMAIC structure and how they interact each other to define clearly a problem in 
processes that deliveries a service in a higher education institution, measure the impact of the problem 
presented, analyze the root causes that originates the problem, improve the process and establish controls 
that assure the sustainability of the improvement actions.

Abstract 
Production and distribution planning has a great importance in supply chain, because on the one hand it 
provides production plan of manufacturing factories and on the other side it offers a plan for distribution of 
products from manufacturing  factories to each of  sales centers and distributors. The present study proposes 
a multi-purpose production-distribution planning model in supply chain in which the delivery date is 
considered to be fuzzy. The proposed production-distribution planning model aims to minimize the 
Production costs and product delivery time to customers according to Capacity of machineries, work force, 
storage space and also taking into account the time value of money. In order to analyze the validity of 
proposed model, a solving method is provided in the study and it is solved with a numerical example. The 
results of numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the mathematical model and the solution 
proposed.

Abstract 
Improving efficiency through collective actions and capacity pooling had been the driving force for many 
manufacturing SMEs clusters. However, the relocation cost and limitation had been one of the biggest 
challenges in this management approach. This research focuses on a new proposed clustering approach for 
increasing the competitiveness of manufacturing SMEs referred to as temporary clusters. These new 
clusters are offered to manage the geographical permeant connectivity challenge associated with the famous 
classical clusters. The research started with an empirical study of farmers markets (as an example of 
temporary SME cluster) to examine to what degree these temporary setups exhibit some typical cluster 
requirements and performance behavior. Results highlighted that temporary clusters share many of the 
positive performance behaviors like permanent ones with less cost and extra mobility advantages. These 
findings were then extended into the manufacturing SMEs context to explore the different temporary 
clustering configurations that can enhance specific relevant objectives for these SMEs. These objectives 
include technology transfer, entrepreneurial capacities, social capital and of course economic growth. 
Analytical analysis was conducted through a temporary cluster configurator toolbox to examine how 
manufacturing SMEs can be clustered based on their value chain objectives in this dynamic nature.. Various 
insights about the impact of the temporary clustering dynamics on the previously listed objectives were 
deduced. Furthermore, suggested management practices and policies that will improve the performance of 
manufacturing SMEs along the outlined objectives are offered.

Abstract 
The much proven method of agile project management has been primarily considered as a tool for software 
companies to drive productivity. This paper deals with the driving factors and successful implementation 
of agile project management in Non-IT sectors. Even though many authors have pointed out the successful 
implementation of Agile Project Management in IT sector and different dimensions determining the 
competitiveness and success rates of the project, this paper mainly focuses on the project success in five 
dimensions. An online survey was conducted and 322 practitioners responded from various industries 
regarding the success factors of agile project management. The principal component analysis reveals the 
correlation between the success factors and the project efficiency. Also the challenges faced and the 
advantages while implementing agile project management methods were also discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
Project Management demands the quality of an expert juggler. It is a way of juggling the balls
simultaneously while maintaining the balance in providing the best quality in stipulated time and reasonable 
budget. The data from the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI) suggest that around 
60% of the project failure are because of exceeding the planned time and budget. If these current status are 
continuing, India will suffer a GDP loss of USD200 billion by the end of year 2018. Proper knowledge of 
the project management techniques leads to the successful stories in private sector. Projects that failed to 
complete on time and within the estimated budget leading the country to move away from the track of 
success. To achieve the projected trajectory of growth of India, a combined effect is needed from Industry, 
government, professionals and academic bodies. 
Recently the MOSPI has brought to light some data on time and finance overdo in public sector 
projects. The delays and improper establishment of public sector infrastructure projects like roadways, rails, 
and power projects resulted in exceeding budget of Rs.1.24 lakh crore (USD19.07 million). Among the 600 
projects of over Rs.150 crore (USD 23.31 million), 73 projects started without getting the approval on 
completion dates and 203 projects are of cost overruns, and 306 of time overruns. These 306 delayed 
projects also caused cost overrun of 23 percent. Around 50 percent of projects were unable to complete on 
the stipulated time and 33 percent of government initiated projects suffered a cost overrun. Lack of proper 
management of projects causing a bane for India‚Äôs dreams to be an economic powerhouse.

According to MOSPI‚Äôs detailed study, the factors shows in Table 1 are withholding the normal project 
progress.

Table 7 shows the component matrix for success factors. The first principal component is strongly 
correlated with three of the original variables. Meeting project budget goals and scope and requirements 
will results in the overall project success. It represents the overall efficiency of the project. The second 
principal component is correlated with mainly with only two of the original variables. Achieving client‚Äôs 
satisfaction will lead to end user‚Äôs satisfaction. This represents the stakeholder satisfaction. 
6. LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER SCOPE OF RESEARCH
A limitation of this research is an evaluation of the percentage of agile used in each project and its effect 
on the project success. Future research should verify this relationship and find out the correlation. Also 
agile project management techniques are not widely implemented in consulting firms. So the reason for 
rejecting or not implementing agile methods can be found out in the future research. Future research can 
include the importance of hybrid agile methods, a combination of agile and traditional project management 
methods. That is mainly focusing on the companies using hybrid agile methods and the factors determining 
the success. This research doesn‚Äôt include the different planning methods in agile approach. So future 
research can include how structured planning impacts the agile success. 
7. CONCLUSION
From a past few years, agile has been replacing the traditional methods for project planning and execution 
mainly due to the success rate in IT industries. This paper has explored the efficiency and success rate of 
Agile project management in Non-IT sectors and shows a quantitative analysis of different success factors. 
Our findings reveals that the range of Agile used in a project does have a statistically significant impact on 
all five dimensions of project success, meeting project budget goals, scopes and requirements, client 
satisfaction, end user satisfaction and overall project success. The main challenges the organization faced 
while implementing agile project management techniques are in budget and schedule estimation, for 
minimal documentation, waste management and contractual issues. The main advantages of agile approach 
are rapidness, information integration, flexibility and collaboration. From the survey conducted, around 
82% of the total respondents revealed that they are aware of the agile project management methods used in 
the organization. Other respondents from consulting firms are unaware of the agile methods and also some 
employees in the lower level management of the companies implementing agile are unaware of agile 
methods. For proper implementation of agile, communication with all the stakeholders is needed, since it 
is lacking in most of the firms.

ABSTRACT 
Fossil fuel emissions have become a major concern for many countries worldwide. The adoption of 
renewable sources of energy is vibrant with sophistication in the field of renewable automobile engine 
technology innovations. Many countries have been investing large amounts of money in improving their 
economy and as result of this, CO2 emissions is increasing exponentially. So, the fossil fuels are being used 
at a faster rate and we are definitely going to run out of them faster than expected. Investing in other greener 
forms of energy becomes very important in such a situation. Many countries have come together in this 
regard and have stated making policies and holding meetings regularly to check the damage. But the reforms 
that have been taken have not been very effective as they have not lead to the required results. The aim of 
this paper is to sketch out the growth pattern of renewable energy in recent past and to find its correlation 
with CO2 emissions in BRICS nations. Data from the past 15 years for all the BRICS nations is taken and 
regression analysis is done with CO2 emissions to determine the impact of one on another. Results show 
that shifting to greener forms of energy is not the only way to reduce CO2 emissions. Recommendations 
are also suggested for renewable energy adoption and usage for each of the BRICS nation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Throughout history, we have had a purely extractive attitude towards natural resources. Due to the 
problems generated by this over dependence, the United Nations (UN) created the World Commission on 
Environment and Development (UNCED). This commission criticizes risk of overusing natural resources 
without considering the capability of the ecosystems to meet these demands, pointing out the disparity 
between sustainable development and the existing production and consumption patterns. 
Renewable energy is the need of the hour; every nation is trying hard to shift to this form of energy 
consumption from the traditional forms of energy. The world has reached to a point where consumption of 
fossil fuels has increased more than expected which is leading to exhaustion at faster rate which will make 
them unavailable for future generations and also are becoming a major cause of pollution. Many policies, 
conventions, conferences are being held worldwide every year but the outcome of these meetings are not 
very promising.  BRICS Leaders‚Äô Summit was held in Goa in October, 2016 and the main agenda is 
financing clean energy infrastructure but it is found that these countries are facing a $51 billion yearly 
funding shortfall to meet the requirement. BRICS nations are trying to introduce various policies to counter 
the pollution caused by the usage of non renewable energy but these have not been executed properly. 
BRICS have a renewable energy objective of approximately 1250GW between 2020 and 2030, which is 
estimated to cost about $975 billion. Many attempts have been made to shift to greener form of energy and

4. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION
1.
Brazil
Brazil should use the resources properly with regards to renewable energy as they have a lot of
potential which will allow shifting to wind and solar power to reduce carbon emissions from power. Brazil 
should target 42.7 GW of wind and 23.6 GW of Photovoltaic, and 44.9 GW of other renewable by 2030. 
Adding to greener projects will strengthen urban and rural populations, which will provide them with better 
idea about the energy sector. In this way, people become energy makers themselves and gain economically 
which will in turn increase the energy efficiency. More fossil fuel extraction by the Brazilian government 
would lead to many problems and one of that being financial losses which will happen because of climate 
change. Brazil should try to be below the global per capita average for carbon emissions in 2020 and CO2 
emissions should be limited to 1Gigatonne by 2030. Deforestation should be reduced in Amazon forest and 
Cerrado regions. Higher funds should be put in public transport which is needed to limit fossils use in 
infrastructure. 
2.
Russia
Russia should try to reconsider options and set ambitious goals in renewable energy production and
get rid of all the legal barriers which will help in implementing energy efficiency technologies. They should 
try to orient state subsidies from new oil and gas withdrawal and also from nuclear in different way which 
will favor renewable energy and energy efficiency. Russia should try to increase the speed of development 
of the domestic system which is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and find a method which will 
regulate greenhouse gases. Also, start new international renewable energy plans with neighbouring 
countries like China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan etc. 
3.
India
India should focus on creating effective financing layouts for easy energy access by trying to
varying the climate negotiations.  Sustainable energy is not accessible to 1.2 billion people around the world 
but India has promised to deliver 24 hours power supply to everyone by 2019 and the best way to do this is 
to use distributed renewable energy.  Coal mining should not be done from forests and these activities 
should be prohibited. Government must try to impose restrictions on mining in forest areas to extract coal 
otherwise the climate would be badly impacted.  The government must make plans which include the fact 
that we will run out of fossils and nuclear energy, and how to change to renewable energy. 
4.
China
China should try to set a ruthless coal consumption threshold for the years 2016 ‚Äì 2020, and make
sure that every province has its own target and this target should be prepared taking into account coal 
consumption in 2014. China should make all the changes required to take the national CO2 emissions to 
the peak level much earlier than 2030, maybe even as early as 2025. They should change structure of its 
power generation system so that growth of renewable energy should not be stopped, and solar power 
production is increased.

5. South Africa 
South Africa should change their electricity plan (made in 2011) as it is out of date, mainly because 
renewable energy has become so cost competitive. The plan which is being employed by South Africa 
overlooks the enormous advantage that it has in renewables, and the openings that can be used to shape the 
future of the country capacity as a of renewable energy producer. Small projects should be employed as 
they can enhance electrification and rural. Barriers to rooftop solar occur due to the lack of a regulatory 
framework, financing methods, go-getting targets for the renewables and also a reliable grid. South Africa 
should prefer greener investments instead of water and pollution causing ones which will mean that the 
country‚Äôs target of 17,800MW of renewables will be met by 2030. No more coal stations have to be 
constructed after Medupi and Kusile, and rest of the coal stations must be shut down after they complete 
their life span of working.

Abstract 
Network optimization is a crucial topic in logistics. Efficiencies, effectiveness, and customer 
responsiveness are the factors to consider in the optimization process. Closed-Loop Supply Chains are 
network configurations that achieve an optimal integration of the forward logistics and the reverse logistics 
of an enterprise. Mostly, deterministic and stochastics models focus on minimizing costs (transportation, 
distribution, production, remanufacturing). However, real-world problems require considering additional 
qualitative factors such as quality, environmental considerations, among others that are difficult to measure. 
Decision theory provides different techniques to design decision framework model that include quantitative 
and qualitative factors. This paper presents a novelty application of the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating 
Technique (SMART) to optimize the decision-making process in a Close-Loop Supply Chain. A Peruvian 
retailing store chain data is used to validate the proposal model, and the findings provide valuable 
managerial insights.

Abstract 
In recent times Mexico is having an energetic reform and is requiring the integation of the suppliers of the generation and 
maintance of energy. There is  found an abscence of this kind of business integration between this type of suppliers. The present 
study presents an efficient and effective instrument with the aim of mitigating this situation where colaborations are pursued 
by endeavours. This instrument is supported by a guide divided in two phases which together sum ten steps, where each step is 
the link of a chain which strenghtens the process as it goes forward. The objective of this instrument is to generate the integration 
of suppliers for the previous mentioned market, which would be satisfying the offer gap defined by the energetic reform in the 
country. After the instrument was designed, it was posible to generate a case study within a Company of the energetic sector, 
where it was tested and the outcome surpassed all expectarions since it helped the Company to idenify the potencial parter for 
the strategic Alliance in order to integrate the supply chain of both endeavours, in order to increase both their market share and 
generate succesful strategic alliances in the market.

Abstract 
This study uses a decomposed queuing network model to determine optimal beds to serve an emergency 
department where patients have low tolerance for delay.  M/M/‚àû and M/M/C of queuing models were used to 
analyse the data obtained from LUTH Emergency Department (ED) for a period of 18 months. The findings reveal 
that the ED requires at least 64 beds to provide efficient emergency services to the existing population. It was 
suggested that improving patient flow and reducing waiting time for patient can be achieved through the following 
ways: (1) managing the arrival rate by different appointment methods such as online appointment management 
system to spread arrivals and call in appointment system; (2) increasing the number of servers; (3) optimizing the 
service rate.

Introduction 
Nigerian public hospitals and all over the world are faced with the challenge of allocating limited resources, such 
as beds, personnel and other medical resources available for randomly arriving patients. One of the hospital units 
that have been seriously affected is the Emergency Department (ED). What account for this recent experience is 
the increasing rate of population and its demand for emergent medical emergent services. Overcrowding in ED 
which prevents prompt delivery of medical services may have negative effect on the quality of health care. The 
inability of the ED resources to hand rapid changes in demand for care services results to high levels of congestion 
in the ED. Scarcity is observed both in resources unable to change in the short term, such as nurses and physicians, 
as well as resources that are rather fixed, such as bed capacity. Congestion or waiting is experienced due to random 
arrivals and length of stay of patients in the ED. It has been an issue all over the world to manage patient waiting 
time, deliver prompt care and provide patient satisfaction in ED and Nigeria medical situation is not an exception. 
So, health care systems have been challenged in recent years to deliver services to all the patient and high quality 
services with limited resources without delay (Malik and Belwal,  2016).  In an ideal hospital with perfect 
information about patients‚Äô arrivals and length of stay, it would be feasible to allocate the exact amount of 
resources required in ED (Hajnal and Zsuzsanna, 2015; Diakogiannis, 2014), using queuing model. 
Researches  show that in the emergency department(ED) and intensive care units (ICU) of  the Public Teaching 
Hospitals (Lewin Group, 2004; IOM, 2006; Av-yeung, Herrison and Knottenberg, 2006; Au-Yeung,  Harder and 
McCoy, 2009; Green, Soares, Giulio and Green, 2006; Delia 2007; Bruin, Rossum, Visser and Koole, 2007; 
Geranmayeh and Iyer, 2008; Olorunsola, Adeleke and Ogunlade, 2014; Aboukanda and Latif, 2014; Diakogiannis, 
2014; Hajnal and Zsuzsanna, 2015), patients experience longer waiting times to be admitted to or diverted from a 
unit (as a bottleneck unit) as it reaches capacity thereby reducing healthcare access to the public, and increasing 
operational cost to hospitals because of the associated inefficiencies. The long waiting lists have become symbols 
of the inefficiency of hospitals services all over the world, particularly in publicly funded hospitals (Gauld, 2000). 
Overcrowded emergency department (ED), intensive care units, prolonged waiting times, patient care delays, 
refused or diverted admissions and scare resources are common themes in large public hospitals (Derlet and 
Richards, 2000; Henry, 2001; Shmueli, Springe and Kaplan, 2002; Lewin Group, 2004; IOM, 2006; Av-yeung, et 
al, 2006; Green, Soares, Giulio and Green, 2006; Delia 2007; Bruin, Rossum, Visser and Koole, 2007;

Abstract 
The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of specialized literature that includes conceptualization, 
background, developments and applicability concerned with the term ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù in regional context; seeking to 
determine the progress that has been achieved in recent years in this area. 
The article allowed to response two main questions: What is the Industry 4.0?, Is it likely to be implemented in 
Regional Context?, these questions were supported with others questions: What is the environment of the Industry 
4.0 and what are the reasons and motivations for its implementation?, What are the basic theories about industry 4.0 
and what exactly do they consist of?, What are the differences among selected world regions in terms of the demand, 
fomentation and implementation of the Industry 4.0?. Now, the two main objectives of this work were: Describe the 
characteristics of the Industry 4.0; Analyse its applicability in Regional context; in specific, Identify and describe the 
environment of the Industry 4.0 together with its principle reasons for its implementation, Describe the basic 
theories of the Industry 4.0, Identify the requirements and differences of the Industry 4.0 in different world regions 
and Analyse the applicability and necessity of the Industry 4.0 in regional context. 
This work is based on two investigation types: The first part, the characterization of the Industry 4.0, is descriptive. 
However, the second part, the investigation of the applicability, is explorative. The methods used in this work is 
inductive. In order to obtain the results for the second, exploratory part questionnaires will be used. The information 
obtained from this method will be analysed and presented in the last part of this work.

1. Introduction
The term ‚Äúindustry 4.0‚Äù was created by the German government in the second decade of the 21st century, and forms 
together with the so called project of the future ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù below the new high tech strategy for Germany, apart 
from other technological projects. It was selected thanks to the fact that the economy is on the threshold of the fourth 
industrial revolution, in which the real ‚Äì physical- world and virtual world unite in a system, a so called Cyber 
Physical-System(CPS). This is only possible through the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a ‚Äúnew concept 
completing the evolution of communication and informatics, applying them to the objects, which allows a better 
interaction between them. It refers to a net of daily things interconnected through the internet‚Äù [1]. 
The two main questions to be answered within this work are: ‚ÄúWhat is the Industry 4.0?, ‚ÄúIs it likely to be 
implemented in a Regional context?‚Äù Supportive questions are: What is the environment of the Industry 4.0 and 
what are the reasons and motivations for its implementation?, What are the basic theories about industry 4.0 and 
what exactly do they consist of?, What are the differences among selected world regions in terms of the demand, 
fomentation and implementation of the Industry 4.0?. The two main objectives of this work are: Describe the 
characteristics of the Industry 4.0 and analyse its applicability in a Regional context.

Abstract (12 font) 
The goal of ORM is to manage risk, not to eliminate risk, so work can be accomplished with minimal 
impact. Each person has a role to play in managing risk and each of these roles is vital to the success of 
the organization. Risk cannot always be avoided; it is better to manage risk and use ORM to prevent loss. 
ORM involves five steps: (1) Identify hazards; (2) assess the hazards; (3) make risk decisions; (4) 
implement controls; and (5) supervise and watch for change. This is Deliberate ORM and requires time to 
plan the process. Time Critical ORM (TCORM) involves quick process and a set of skills to ensure 
proper execution of a plan or event; exactly what is required in the field and involves 4 steps: (1) 
Determine what can go wrong or is changing; (2) determine what can be done; (3) acting to correct the 
situation(s); and (4) telling the right people. The application of TCORM will be presented through short 
case studies where ergonomic opportunities‚Äô were identified (what could go wrong); immediately 
implementable approaches were identified (what can be done); implementing the approaches (act to 
correct the situation); and evaluate their overall effectiveness (telling the right people).

Abstract 
Wind energy has become an important source of energy in the last years, proven to be an alternative to 
fossil power production. The advances in technology have allowed to exploit this resource in new 
environments. While offshore wind farms projects are growing at important rates, onshore farms are still 
the main contributors of this energy source. However, challenges to make wind farms projects profitable 
are still prevailing. In this context, maintenance activities have an important impact on energy production 
and operational costs. A linear optimization model is proposed to solve a maintenance scheduling problem 
for onshore wind farms. The model includes classical key concepts such as availability and revenues. 
Moreover, it includes technicians crew costs which are relevant when the maintenance operator is not the 
farm responsible. Therefore, a multi objective scheme is used to solve the problem via the epsilon constraint 
method. Preliminary results on modified instances previously used in the literature show that an 
approximation to the pareto front can be found for small instances. 
Keywords 
Onshore wind farms, operations and maintenance, maintenance scheduling, multi objective optimization, epsilon

1. Introduction
The awareness of climate change, the variability of oil and gas prices, and their scarcity, have accelerated the use of 
energy alternatives, e.g. wind, solar, biomass, etc. Among these, wind energy has shown a remarkable development 
over the last decades. According to the Global Wind Energy Council (2016) the global installed wind capacity at the 
end of 2016 was of 486.8 Giga Watts (GW). This value implies an increase of 12.6% when compared to 2015, it

space solution for the problems is highly constrained. Therefore, the number of solutions, and more important, efficient 
solutions is limited.  
Among the solutions found by the epsilon-constraint method, nearly one third are proven to be efficient. Indeed, as 
little as this number might be seen, the reason is the complexity in solving the single objective ILP. One can see that 
the cost objective is by much the one with the higher gaps, averaging 13.9%.  Furthermore, the gaps on cost component 
show a considerable rise when more skill are considered in the problems. This is especially important in instances 
with higher number of time periods, where family 20_4_3_20_B reaches a maximum of 34.6%.   
Energy objective contrary to costs objective, show an excellent performance. Through the 40 instances, the average 
gap is only 0.6%. Type B instances (regular technician-to-work-ratio) consistently outperform type A (tight 
technician-to-work-ratio) instances in this metric. Despite the better performance in terms of energy gaps, results show 
that the number of solutions not proven efficient is mostly due to energy objective function. The average number of 
solutions for which energy presents a positive gap doubles the same metric for costs objective. Therefore, it is safe to 
say that single objective ùëçùëç2 is solved to optimally more consistently than ùëçùëç1. However, when dealing with sub-optimal 
solutions, the average costs (ùëçùëç1) gap is over 20 times bigger than the energy (ùëçùëç2) average gap. 
6. Conclusions
This paper introduces a new model to solve the wind farm maintenance scheduling problem in the onshore context. 
The proposed model considers the multi objective nature of the problem, taking account of both costs as well as the 
energy production/utility. The problem is solved using an ILP embedded in an epsilon constraint algorithm. Results 
show that an approximation to the pareto front can be found to small instances previously used in the literature. Still, 
the complexity of ILP problems make that most of the solutions found by the algorithm cannot be proven to be Pareto 
Efficient. Improvement in the computational times and performance of the ILP considering the cost objective must be 
conducted in our future work. Nevertheless, as shown in a detailed example, one can see the importance of considering 
multiple objectives. In fact, the augmentation of costs can have significant consequences in the amount/utility of 
energy produced. Our solution approach can thus give the decision makers an important source of information to plan 
and perform the maintenance activities. 
Undergoing work considers new variants of objectives as well as approximation methods to deal with bigger instances. 
Indeed, the stochastic nature of the problem makes a daily roll-over approach suitable, thus, faster approaches are 
necessary to apply this type of models. Moreover, we are currently considering the inherent stochasticity in task times. 
Certainly, times to perform a task might not be completely known prior to the problem solution, therefore, solution 
methods must consider this aspect to create robust and reliable solutions.

Abstract 
This paper presents the diagnosis of the state of implementation of processes and technologies for the supply 
chain management of hospitals in Medell√≠n, in order to determine the level of competitiveness of hospitals 
in the city with respect to world class hospitals. First, a bibliographic search process was carried out to 
determine the most used logistics trends in hospitals in different countries. All this followed by an analysis 
of the literature review and, finally, an instrument was designed and applied to a representative sample of 
hospitals in Medell√≠n, where four important subjects were evaluated: stock, information systems, 
optimization and continuous improvement. 
This study found that the most used logistic tools in hospitals in Medell√≠n are: lean manufacturing, 
standardization of processes, stock control, among others. However, in the analysis performed by quadrants, 
it is evident that there are opportunities for improvement in the methodology used by hospitals to develop 
their logistics activities, since 80% of the sample has a low positioning factor and therefore a globally 
uncompetitive logistic level.

1. Introduction
In the hospital sector, the supply chain is an important factor in terms of efficiency and patient care, since it defines 
different fundamental methods to the development of the processes. Hospital logistics currently seeks to improve the 
patient's perception and attention times, reduce delays, improve flows and increase the processes effectiveness (Zona 
Log√≠stica, 2015). 
The objective of the hospital sector in Colombia will be to formulate, adopt, direct, coordinate, execute, and evaluate 
public policies on health, public health, and social health promotion; as well as participate in the formulation of the 
policies on pensions, periodic economic benefits and professional risks, which will be developed through the 
institutions that comprise the administrative sector (Rep√∫blica de Colombia, 2016). Aiming at this, the National 
Planning Department, by 2016, presents a budget corresponding to 11.4% of national expenditures in the 
regionalization of the investment budget (Departamento Nacional de Planeaci√≥n, 2015). However, focusing on the 
quality of health care, managers have left this issue aside, specifically in making better use of resources (Colombia & 
Ministerio de la protecci√≥n social, 2005). In order to improve these resources and increase the user experience, 
methodologies are implemented in different hospital departments, focusing on different areas such as inventories, 
storage, planning, continuous improvement philosophies, methods, times, and standardization.

5. Conclusions 
‚Ä¢ 
In this paper we classified the publications found in order to identify the subgroups in which the trends are 
implemented. It is possible to perceive that these methodologies are applied according to the resources and 
needs of each hospital, evidenced in the proportionality of publications that focus on the improvement of 
processes and technologies. 
‚Ä¢ 
One of the contributions of this project is to know and identify the literature review of hospital logistics, it 
was found that the countries that have shown the most interest according to the number of disclosures are the 
United States and United Kingdom with seventeen and eight publications respectively. In the same way, it 
was found that lean manufacturing and mathematical modeling are the most common logistic trends in the 
literature which are implemented in different departments of the hospital such as warehouse, emergency, 
surgery, and external care and support.

‚Ä¢ 
According to the results obtained in the analysis by quadrants, it is concluded that hospitals in Medell√≠n still 
have to improve in many aspects to be competitive worldwide, since all the institutions of the sample -except 
for a complexity 4 hospital- are found located in the third quadrant. 
‚Ä¢ 
The continuous improvement subgroup is the one that presents a better rating, this can be due to the ISO 
9001 quality accreditation system, which requires within its standards to have a continuous improvement 
system to be followed up. 
‚Ä¢ 
The optimization subgroup presents satisfactory scores, however, they fail to meet the international 
positioning factor. This can be due to the lack of resources for the implementation of technologies that support 
the optimization of processes. 
‚Ä¢ 
The subgroup of information systems and inventories are the ones that present greater opportunities for 
improvement. Despite finding some publications that deal with this issue, they have not been implemented 
in hospitals in Medell√≠n. 
‚Ä¢ 
After the analysis of the results of the survey by quadrants, it was found that the IPS with level of complexity 
4 are those that have a higher average positioning factor (66.95%). However, this value places these 
institutions in quadrants III and IV, demonstrating that they do not comply with the implementation of global 
logistics trends in general. 
6. Future projects 
It is expected that the analysis of the results of this research will be expanded by analyzing the behavior of data with 
a box and whisker plot, in addition to an analysis of the categorization of hospitals and finally an analysis by institution 
including recommendations to each one of them.

Abstract 
In this paper, we study a single-item multi-stage remanufacturing inventory system using stochastic 
decomposition process. We extend the classic continuous inventory control policy to develop a control 
policy for this remanufacturing system. We use queuing theory techniques to derive steady-state 
probabilities and, consequently, the closed-form cost function of the remanufacturing system is estimated. 
A main contribution of this paper is providing a closed-form cost function for a multi-stage remanufacturing 
system which enables developing solution algorithm to find the optimal policy. Furthermore, a simulated 
annealing algorithm is proposed to find near optimal values of the inventory control policy parameters. 
Finally, sensitivity of the derived model to some parameters is analyzed.

1. Introduction
In recent years, manufacturers have paid growing attention to reuse activities that provide material waste reduction 
via the recovery of some content of used products. Motivation behind these product recovery activities is two-fold: 
growing environmental concerns and potential economic benefits (Ahiska, 2008). These reuse processes and related 
activities are studied in terms of reverse logistics. 
Reverse logistics is the process of efficiently planning, implementing, and controlling inbound flow and storage of 
secondary items and related information opposite to the traditional supply chain direction for the purpose of recovering 
value or suitable disposal (Beltran, 2002; Fleischmann, 1997). Remanufacturing is a typical example for economically 
attractive reuse activities. Remanufacturing transforms used products into like new products. After disassembly, 
modules and parts are extensively inspected and problematic parts are repaired, or if not possible, replaced with new 
parts (Ahiska, 2008). 
The literature on inventory control and production planning in reverse logistics is reviewed by Fleischmann et al. 
(1997). They stated that recovery process effect three main areas, namely distribution planning, inventory control, and 
production planning. This paper belongs to the inventory control area. Due to uncertainty of product returns and 
coordination of product recovery option with regular procurement, inventory control for recoverable manufacturing 
systems is more complex than traditional systems (Inderfurth and van der Laan, 2001).  
Papers such as Dobos  and  Richter (2006), Heyman (1977), Inderfurth  and van der Laan (2001), Kiesmuller and van 
der Laan (2001), van der Laan et al. (1996), van der Laan and Salomon (1997), van der Laan and Teunter (2006), 
Muckstadt and Isaac (1981), Ouyang and Zhu (2006), Roy et al. (2009), Tang and Grubbstrom (2005), and Bagherpour 
et al. (2009). Each model in the literature differs from other models with respect to its assumptions. Assumptions must 
be made on the demand and return processes, existence of a disposal option for returned items, relevant cost 
parameters, lead times of production and remanufacturing activities, and the length of planning horizon. 
The physical design of the remanufacturing system we study in this paper is based Takahashi et al. (2007) who studied 
a remanufacturing system with a stochastic decomposition process (see Fig. 1). In the decomposition process, a 
returned item is disposed or decomposed into parts or materials. The recovered materials and parts are stored to be 
used in the production process. For this remanufacturing system, Takahashi et al. (2007) developed a Markov chain

carrier‚Äôs selection in the supply chain (SC) under the theoretical approaches in the literature to build a theoretical and practical 
methodology for decision-making in the CS, a case study is presented to CS of green coffee. The Multi Criteria Decision Aid 
(MCDA) techniques revised, the nonparametric outranking method PROMETHEE allows decision makers to combine quantitative 
and qualitative criteria for carrier‚Äôs selection with scientists and easy components. The carrier‚Äôs selection policy for Land 
Transportation Service (LTS) proposal is designed under the criteria of maximizing the opportunity, flexibility, efficiency or 
opportunity and technology; and cost minimization presented in the Network Decision Multi Criteria (MCDN) for Transportation

Abstract 
The purpose of this work was to write the instructions to implement the methodology ""SMED - Single 
Minute Exchange of Die"" in the changes of formats of the bottling process in the ""Industria Licorera del 
Cauca"", supported by the model of the international standard of automation ISA S88; Likewise, the 
corresponding checklists were produced that provided information and control was made with the intention 
of guaranteeing the success of the project in the long term, for the development of this project involved all 
maintenance staff and process leaders. In addition, the 5'S technique was implemented in the mechanical 
maintenance area, where the ideal environmental conditions of work were created, resulting in a reduction 
of the time for the enlistment of work elements and parts for a more effective format change, minimizing 
time Unproductive for the productive process.

The purpose of the SMED is the reduction of times, a projection of the total expected time for the format change is 
made using the instructions, the conversion of operations, 5'S in the packaging workshop and the training of the 
maintenance staff. The checklists were developed in order to monitor and follow the process to evaluate their 
effectiveness and make the adjustments to improve it.

Abstract 
The internal communication in public universities is an unexplored field, however the previous 
investigations considered to internal communication as a strategic element and essential to the success of 
an organization. You can improve internal communication using digital channels that enhance and 
simplify the variety of traditional channels. The objective of the research is determined what extent 
applications in the cloud of Google Apps for Education improve internal communication between 
members of the university community. The results of the research reveal that the use of the Software as a 
Service Google Apps does not substantially improve internal communication among members of the 
university community. However, we have identified some factors that prevent the use of Google Apps for 
Education, such as limitations in computer infrastructure, low level of knowledge in computing, limited 
use of digital tools in academic activities and the absence of a strategic plan for internal communication.

1. Introduction
The present scientific research studies the use of Cloud Computing applications to improve internal communication 
in Higher University Education. Google Apps for Education is a communication and collaboration platform, an 
example of Software as a Service or Cloud Computing application. The National University of San Antonio Abad of 
the Cusco had the need to implement an Institutional Electronic Mail System for the whole university community, 
provide security in the information, availability of the service at any time, from any place and from any device, 
avoid high costs in infrastructure and service support. In November 2013 the university migrated to Google Apps for 
Education to have a stable platform, unlimited storage capacity and Google technical support. In order adopt Google 
Apps for Education we trained teachers, administrators and students in communication and collaboration in the 
digital environment proving very helpful according to the opinion of the trained. However, reports indicate that most 
members of the university community do not use Google Apps for Education. This situation forces us to study and 
identify the factors that impede internal communication in the digital environment and because members of the 
university community act with skepticism to use emerging technologies that can improve the management and 
services offered by the university.

10. Conclusions and Future Work 
The use of the Software as a Service Google Apps for Education does not substantially improve internal 
communication among members of the university community of the National University of San Antonio Abad of 
Cusco. The downstream communication is unidirectional and there is little feedback in communication. In the 
upward communication there are difficulties because most of the students feel little informed and listened to by their 
authorities. In the case of horizontal and transverse communication there is empathy of communication between 
companions but they encourage informal communication. It uses a variety of traditional and digital media that does 
not allow a clear conclusion of the type of preferred communication medium. The limitations in computer 
infrastructure and the low level of technological competences of the members of the university affect the adoption of 
digital support in internal communication. Of the 30000 accounts available in Google Apps for Educations only 
(12%) have enabled it. It is necessary to develop an internal communication plan with the participation of all the 
actors of the university community and to achieve the use of digital supports that enhance the classical supports.

Abstract 
The nonlinear and nonstationary nature of structural damage brings a great challenge to structural health 
monitoring (SHM). Chaos theory and nonlinear time-series analysis domain suggests many effective 
candidates to capture system dynamic and measure the complexity of dynamical system. From different 
candidates, this paper focuses on multi-fractal spectrum analysis for online structural health monitoring. 
Results show that the quasi recessive correlation dimension (QRCD) is not only the best fractal dimension 
for detecting different defect levels, but also it has less computational complexity than the singularity 
spectrum used for extracting multi-fractal spectrum. On the other hand, the multi-fractal spectrum analysis 
is an effective damage quantifier for analyzing data which exhibit multi-fractal behavior and it has a better 
diagnosis capability for monitoring non-stationary process and those attractors which exhibit phase-
transition. 
Key words: Structural health monitoring; Multi-fractal Analysis; Singularity spectrum; Ergodic theorem. 
1. Introduction and motivation
Chaos theory and nonlinear time-series analysis domain suggests many effective candidates to capture system dynamic 
and measure the complexity of dynamical system (Moon et al., 1992). From different candidates, this paper focuses 
on the multi-fractal spectrum analysis for the purpose of structural health monitoring. The importance of the multi-
fractal analysis in connection to dynamical system comes from the fact that it is an efficient technique to determine 
the existence of strange attractors, thus it allows a statistical description of the underlying dynamics system‚Äôs attractor 
(Moon et al., 1992). A more convenient way to describe the global scaling properties of the attractor is by using a 
spectrum of singularities, which will be discussed in this paper. Scaling in Chaos analysis almost always reduce the 
object or pattern into smaller replicas of the original according to a fixed ratio (Garnett and Williams, 1997). The point

recursive correlation dimension partially overcomes the non-stationary problem using consecutive overlapping 
segmentation technique, especially, when the data is not highly non-stationary. 
 
The multi-fractal spectrum analysis works well with even highly non-stationary data (Adeyemi, 1997). It works 
efficiently for attractors that exhibit multi-fractal behavior as well as phase transitions if the generalized fractal 
dimension ùê∑ùê∑ùëûùëû satisfies the monotonic rule of the generalized fractal dimensions  ùê∑ùê∑ùëûùëû is violated (ùê∑ùê∑ùëñùëñ‚â•ùê∑ùê∑ùëóùëó if ùëñùëñ‚â§ùëóùëó). 
The Logistic Map, a notable chaotic attractor which exhibits phase-transitions was taken to test the suitability of multi-
fractal spectrum for analyzing non-stationary data. The generalized fractal dimensions ùê∑ùê∑ùëûùëû curve as a function of q for 
the logistic Map is shown in Figure 6. The discontinuity in the derivative of the Dq  curve occurs at q=2. 
 
 
Figure 6. Schematic plot of the ùê∑ùê∑ùëûùëû vs q showing for the Logistic Map 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper, a multi-fractal spectrum analysis is used for online SHM. Results indicate that the generalized fractal 
dimension has fairly high computational complexity of  ùëÇùëÇ(ùëÅùëÅ ùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëô) for each ùëûùëû‚àà(‚àí‚àû, ‚àû) compared with the QRCD, 
whose computational complexity of O(N). On the other hand, the multi-fractal spectrum has a better diagnosis 
capability for monitoring non-stationary process and those attractors which exhibit phase-transition. 
It should also be pointed out that, for a noisy data, the capabilities of both the QRCD and the multi-fractal spectrum 
are affected as damage detection features. Based on the characteristics of date, each of the correlation dimension and 
the multi-fractal spectrum has its own application and practical considerations. In future work, making no assumptions 
about the data and looking at the dynamical changes within an adaptive sliding window will be further investigated 
via Recurrence Quantification analysis or/and Hilbert Huang Transform.

Abstract 
The implementation of Advanced Planning Systems (APS) software may offers to Supply Chain 
Management (SCM) planning and optimization functionalities to industrial processes. A complete 
assessment of APS implementation should involve multiple criteria. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is 
worldwide multi-criteria analysis method. The Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks (BOCR) is a model 
developed from AHP theory. BOCR model allows a flexible analysis and potentially richer as opposed to 
only costs and benefits analysis. For APS implementation benefits are regarding to customer services, 
internal business processes and modular architecture issues; Opportunities relates to flexibility in adapting 
to changes, errors reducing, innovation and learning; Costs relates to project on budget, project on time and 
SCM costs; and Risks are associated with data, process, and user fit. The objective in this paper is to present 
a model for the assessment of APS implementation

1. Introduction
Advanced Planning Systems (APS) has gained relevance and attention from the academic and practitioner 
communities over the past decade. The acronym APS involves some synonyms such as ‚ÄúAdvanced 
Planning and Scheduling‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdvanced Production System‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdvanced Planning System‚Äù (Pittman and 
Atwater, 2016). In practice, is a computational system that uses advanced mathematical algorithms, or logic, 
to perform optimization or simulation on finite capacity scheduling, sourcing, capital planning, resource 
planning, forecasting and demand management.  
APS enables companies to optimize plans according to financial, strategic objectives and create plans that 
meet multiple objectives (Vidoni and Vecchietti, 2015). On the other hand, in APS the planning 
functionality is radically improved over Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), but it is essential for a good 
result that the user is familiar with the basics APS functionalities (Hvolby and Jensen, 2010).  
The main question of this empirical research is: How to assess the implementation of APS? There are many 
problems related to the implementation of APS, such as project management, choice of modules and 
transition from ‚Äúgo live‚Äù to normal operation (Ivert and Jonsson, 2014).  
Assess of APS implementation is about the quantitative and qualitative aspects and are based on multi-
criteria. Multi-criteria decision-making, also known as MCDM, is essential in decision-making processes. 
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a leading MCDM method with the large number of publications in 
international journals (Tramarico et al., 2015; Wallenius et al., 2008). The objective of this paper is to 
present a model for the assessment of APS implementation.

5. Conclusions
The aim of this paper was to assess the APS implementation considering BOCR. The proposed model and 
the results provided evidences of the APS implementation in a global chemical corporation. In this AHP 
application, absolute measurement was adopted instead of the original relative measurement: 6 percent 
points for Production Planning & Scheduling over Demand Planning and 2 percent points for Production 
Planning & Scheduling over Strategic Networking Planning. These findings evidenced the success of the 
APS implementation in the studied chemical plant. 
Finally, by means a real application, this article has illustrated how an APS implementation assessment 
model should be applied to appraise implementation system. We believe to have made significant 
contributions to the APS literature.  A new approach based on Analytic Network Process is suggested as a 
further research. Consider the existence of dependence and interrelations between alternatives and apply 
the Analytic Network Process (Saaty and Ozdemir, 2005).

Abstract 
Thanks to constant progress in science, we are living in a rapidly evolving world where new trends and technologies 
are developed daily. This has an impact on many different areas that impact on society in general, one of which is 
the whole field of industry and education. Especially in recent years, much progress has been made in this area, 
leading to some people talking about the fourth industrial revolution. This article discusses this new revolution, also 
known as Industry 4.0, addressing the introduction of modern communication and computing technologies to 
maximize interoperability across all the different existing systems. Every day we are more connected and able to 
communicate and interact in real time between educational and industrial systems. This article will discuss about 
technologies that support this new industrial revolution and discuss impacts, possibilities, needs and adaptation. 
These changes are important steps to meet the growing demand for highly customized products and services, 
improving resource efficiency and higher throughput.

1. Introduction
Thanks to constant progress in science we are living in a rapidly evolving world where new trends and 
technologies are developed daily and incorporated into our everyday lives. This has an impact on many different 
areas, the real world and virtual reality continue to merge, and allied to this modern information and communication 
technologies are being combined with traditional industrial processes, thus changing the various production areas. 
Traditional companies have realized that customers are unwilling to pay large amounts for incremental quality 
improvements. As a consequence, many companies, especially the industries have to adapt their production with 
focus on customized products and fast market time, always with lower cost and higher quality. Especially in recent 
years, with the progress made in this area, it is believed that we are experiencing the fourth industrial revolution. 
When talking about this new revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, we are often talking about the introduction of 
modern communication and information control technologies, with increasingly intelligent devices. , In a factory it 
is sought to maximize the interoperability between all the different existing systems. This interoperability is the 
backbone to making a factory more flexible and intelligent, as different subsystems are now able to communicate 
and interact with each other. These changes are important steps to meet most of today's industrial facility needs, 
such as the increasing demand for highly customized products, improving resource efficiency and higher 
throughput. 
This article aims to describe briefly the history of industrial evolution and to highlight that we live in a silent 
industrial revolution that is due to advances in several areas, especially ICT, and which areas lead these changes.

can access data from any machine and where the machines will exchange information and become more 
autonomous. 
 
As described above the introduction of new paradigms from TICC (Technology Information Communication 
and Control) will have huge impacts on virtualization of the process and supply-chain ensures smooth inter-
company operations providing real-time access to relevant product and production information for all participating 
entities. In this scenario boundaries of companies fell behind, as autonomous systems exchange data, gained by 
embedded systems throughout the entire value chain. The companies that will not be ready for these transformations 
are tied to die. 
 
 
2. CONCLUSION 
 
Industry 4.0 will address and create solutions for some of the challenges facing the world today such as 
resource and energy efficiency, urban production and demographic change. Industry 4.0 enables continuous resource 
productivity and efficiency gains to be delivered across the entire value network. It allows work to be organized in a 
way that takes demographic change and social factors into account. Smart assistance systems release workers from 
having to perform routine tasks, enabling them to focus on creative, value-added activities. In view of the impending 
shortage of skilled workers, this will allow older workers to extend their working lives and remain productive for 
longer. Flexible work organization will enable workers to combine their work, private lives and continuing 
professional development more effectively, promoting a better work-life balance. 
 
This paper discussed key technologies like cloud computing, IoT, CPS for the deployment of a new 
industrial revolution called Industry 4.0. This new paradigm will benefit from the latest TICC (Information 
Technology, Communication and Control) technologies associated with greater collaboration among the players in 
this industrial process. 
 
This change is already impacting the industrial area, especially in areas where the product life cycle is 
small and a constant search for improvement is needed, such as the electronics, automotive and aviation sectors. We 
need to train trained professionals to work and reason with a more global vision and knowledge permeate in 
different areas, which will be more closely linked. There is an open field for creating platforms, new or improved 
protocols, and connections between smart devices that allow you to use these new features in factory environments 
that are provided in Industry 4.0. You must completely develop new business models and exploit the considerable 
potential for optimization in the areas of production and logistics.

Introduction 
In history there are events that have brought about radical changes that mainly affect the daily activities of people 
both in their personal and work life. For companies, these changes are usually big challenges in the levels of their 
organizational structure since it is not clear what actions to take, what tools or processes to change to be considered 
competent within the industry to which they belong. 
The scientific-technical progress we are going through today has given rise to new ways of living. One of the fields 
that has had great development has been the industry since the adaptation of the human capital in executing new 
processes, is product of the innovation and technology that is incorporated to the diverse companies. 
This research will allow us to understand significant aspects of the new forms of human capital work that they face 
in this 4th industrial revolution in order to first know what is currently being done in Tier 1 companies of 
automotive sector in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, to later know what it takes to be able to achieve adaptability to the 4th 
Industrial Revolution.

ABSTRACT 
A pull production system is a make-to-order environment where manufacturing is started only after customer 
order is received and hence demand is confirmed. In an environment having dominant flow path for the products, 
it offers challenging scope for the management and control of raw material, work-in-process and finished goods 
inventory. Literature and industrial practice suggests a variety of heuristic models used to control inventory to 
optimal levels. Estimating and knowing the current and future inventories to be maintained is essential to sustain 
the material flow throughout the planning period. In this paper, we develop an integrated inventory control model 
integrating the demand and component material flows in a multi-customer, multi-product environment using 
system dynamics simulation modeling. We have simulated the model in a pull production system where the 
complete cycle depends on the customer order. The inventory level and structure are linked to delivery service 
and in effect to competitive advantage.

INTRODUCTION
Inventory is a double-edged sword in the manufacturing world. When the capacity is not able to produce to 
customer requirement, it is a boon; when things are flowing smooth, inventory is a waste of money (Verwater-
Lukszo & Christina, 2005). Whatever the cost incurred, companies are expected to offer the right products at the 
right time in right quantities. Customized design and order fulfillment in a make-to-order system offers a day-to-
day challenge in controlling inventory for the manufacturer. Stable demands, varying operation times, varying 
setup times, intermittent material flows, lack of transparent internal and external communication and high product 
mix are some of the characteristics of manufacturing which increase inventory (Minner, 2003). Two main 
objectives to be fulfilled are, primarily the level of inventory required to maximize customer order fulfillment, 
specified in terms of customer demand and finished goods inventory and secondly, the amount of in-process 
inventories specified in terms of flow of material and the amount of inventories must be able to keep up to the 
delivery service (Vastag & Montabon, 2001). Regulating the input flow on work released to production and the 
output flow to the customer based on the volume of work and flow times determines the trade-off between these 
two contradictory objectives. When the range of requirement is larger, the greater is the number of problems of 
investment, procurement, storage, holding, accounting, shortage and stock out deterioration (Wanke, 2010).  
Inventory accumulation and management has been studied in isolation as a manufacturing domain 
problem rather than as a systemic domain problem (Angerhofer & Angelides, 2000). System dynamics (Forrester, 
1958, 1997; Richardson, 2011) offers a platform to include the many variables of the system which affect the 
inventory. The model allows us to understand the feedback from each of the variables. In most realistic stock 
management situations, the complexity of the feedbacks among the variables precludes the determination of the 
optimal strategy (Sterman, 2000, 2001). The objective of this paper is to formulate a model to optimize the total 
system inventory by simulating a system dynamics (SD) model considering the systemic domain. The metrics used 
to optimize the SD model are customer order fulfillment and the actual amount of material inventories at the 
various stages, viz., raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. The fundamentals of inventory 
management, system dynamics and various inventory models in system dynamics literature are briefly dealt with 
through a literature survey. We define the problem of inventory control in pull manufacturing and model 
formulation in SD. The simulation of the SD inventory model and the obtained results are also discussed.

The order fulfillment ratio was obtained by considering the ratio of actual shipment to the customer orders. 
This ratio depends on the maximum shipment that is possible for each product. When we define the maximum 
shipment for each product in excess of the total customer orders, then naturally, we get the order fulfillment ratio as 
100% as shown in Table 5.

deterministic and probabilistic models that are in vogue. Real-time difficulties in predicting demand and maintaining 
production at expected levels has encouraged the development of many quantitative and qualitative models. Through 
Simulation of the developed model in this pull production system using system dynamics, we can see that the level of 
the various inventories can be forecast by knowing the customer orders or the forecast orders. There can be further 
enhancements to the model with the following additions. Firstly, the customer orders can be varied over each month 
also. To do this, we need to define an array as ‚ÄòMonth‚Äô dimension with 12 elements. When we consider changes in 
the order quantity for each month for each customer, the effect of safety stock will affect the system. Secondly, the 
cost of stock outs can be modeled into the system. Using this model, companies can estimate the amount of inventories 
on-hand and thus have a better control over the inventory. This facilitates them in fulfilling

Abstract 
The message of this article is quite simple, we want to advance entrepreneurship education for all types of person using 
an action-based application rooted in a specific set of practices. From our  extensive experience training a global cadre 
of entrepreneurship educators(six-year university professor), we have observed that the mindset of most educators is 
discipline specific and rooted in process model , Though the entrepreneurship process orientation is the most common 
approach seen in entrepreneurship education today, we posit that it is neither the most realistic nor the most effective 
approach for the current environment , testing application can improve entrepreneurship qualities by a simulation of real 
cases ,that can give educators a simple way to diagnose a strategic planning to improve the weaknesses qualities. The 
aim of this paper, however is to describe entrepreneur strength qualities ,and  how an application will help to promote 
the qualities of future entrepreneurs based on an internal entrepreneur model and a model describing its interaction with 
his external environment. 
Keywords: 
Entrepreneurship; entrepreneurship education; testing application; entrepreneurship qualities; entrepreneur model. 
1. Introduction
Most of us spend too little time identifying our innate talents or developing them into distinctive strengths that we apply
day after day. One of the best ways to change this is through heightened self-awareness. To get started,  we might use
the following lists to begin identifying some the activities or approaches where we believe we shine:
We live in a weakness-focused world. Based on the erroneous belief that good is the opposite of bad , for thousands of
years humanity has been fixated on faults and failures. True, we are each imperfect , but our weaknesses reveal little
about strengths which  we must cultivate from instinctive talents and champion in our everyday lives rather than letting
these gifts languish while we spend most of our time trying to fix weaknesses.
This issue becomes all the more vital in light of the fact that the brain's reticular activating system in primed to magnify
negative incoming message and to minimize positive. Criticisms and weaknesses tend to be amplified tin the higher
brain centers; in other words, they are blown out of proportion. Therefore, they must be managed with care ,We are far
better served by focusing most of our energy and attention on positive activities and pursuits that bring us vigor and
satisfaction.
Lifestyle entrepreneurs often initiate businesses on the basis of the goal of realizing a particular lifestyle balancing
economic, family, and social needs [1][2][3] Entrepreneurs play an important role in every free market society ,they act
as force for creative destruction, sweeping away established technologies, products , and ways of doing things and
replacing them with others that the marketplace as a whole sees as representing greater value. In this sense
entrepreneurs are agents of change and , hopefully progress.
It is important the acknowledge that entrepreneurs do more than just think of new concepts and recognize their
commercial opportunities. They take the next step ; forming enterprises and marshaling resources to  address them.
This article a linear approach to the topics that concern entrepreneurs, from the initial question (""Am I the type of
person who should start a business?"") to the last issue that a successful business owner needs to consider(""How can I

Abstract 
Present-day businesses implement tactical approaches to protect their market lead and corporate interests. Based on 
such logic, the current study presents an attempt to evaluate the significance of new product development team climate 
and idea support capability in a multinational scenario. The research survey is conducted on 30 team member‚Äôs 
representing new product development (NPD) operations at three selected work locations of a European company 
(Finland, Norway and the UK). The results of our study identified scientifically, discrepancies in the current practices 
with in the areas, namely the management¬¥s approach to acknowledging new idea generation potential of the 
subordinates, the potential of the company¬¥s internal and external communication systems, the limitation of the 
capacity for the data collection and record keeping, the empowerment of employees, recognition of the employees‚Äô 
effort, etc. All such areas are critically significant for any organization in terms of shaping its NPD teams¬¥ innovative 
capabilities and potential to harness their new product idea generation capability. 
Keywords  
New product development team climate, new product development idea support, new idea generation potential, 
empowerment of employees. 
1. Introduction
 Empirical studies for approximately three decades have focused on analyzing success factors linked to new product 
development (Cooper‚Äôs and Kleinschmidt, 1995; Heskett, 2001; Sparke, 1983; Jevnaker, 1998; Leenders et al., 2007; 
Murray and O‚ÄôDriscoll, 1996; Kazmi, Naaranoja, 2015). These studies have focused either on the internal 
organizational elements or the factors that influence NPD activity to gain competitive edge through reaching the 
market needs early. These parameters are actually the ones that can be influenced instantly with the support of the 
company‚Äôs management. NPD success variables are classified according to the NPD process; organization, culture, 
role and commitment of the senior management as well as the overall corporate strategy (Kazmi, Naarananoja, 2014). 
Angle (1989) proposes that the new idea generation process is grounded in the organization¬¥s creativity in addition to 
its ability to anticipate opportunities for innovation. The nature of an organizational setup is critical to NPD process, 
especially to bring the success factors into effect. The aim of the study is to unearth the potential of organizational 
culture that promotes ethical standards and guarantees conducive team climate. Such organizational potential will 
further ensures effective transformation of work teams into confident leaders, by inculcating the strength of 
strategically integrating new ideas from external as well as internal environments to harness organizational innovation 
initiatives. Hence, the current paper starts with the introduction of the core concepts and the need of the current 
research will touch briefly the literature review of the main subject areas i.e., New product development team climate 
and team support and New product development idea support. Later, the paper will through light on selected research 
methodology and proposed theoretical model. The study will be concluded with an in-depth analyses and discussion 
on the study results. 
2. Literature Review

New product development team climate and team support 
According to Cooper and Kleinschmidt (1995), while taking into consideration the concept of entrepreneurial or NPD 
team climate, the following aspects must be considered: 
i.
Opportunity for employees to spend part of their work time in developing their personal ideas,
ii.
Company‚Äôs support for the official projects, even if those projects were terminated by the management,

Abstract 
Production costs and logistical costs are determinant factors in the company's results, therefore, the 
appropriate management of these allows companies to generate value, stabilizing the cash flow, 
influencing the growth of the economy at sectoral, regional and national level. 
Micro, small and medium enterprises - MSMEs are the focus of the proposal specifically in the footwear 
and leather sector in Cali; The common characteristic is the lack of information for the decision making 
regarding costs that allow to define competitive prices, this affects the international relations of 
commercialization of products. This problem made sense for the proposal of generation of a model and its 
business logistics methodology to identify production costs and logistic costs generally hidden, validated 
in this sector; the result of this proposal serves as a reference tool, it provides replicable elements and 
structures to any productive platform and sector. 
The descriptive methodology was used, the analysis of the state of the sector under study allowed to 
establish the general problems to work towards the increase of sectorial competitiveness; In the company 
under study, the cost model was redesigned, reducing the lack of understanding of operations not 
included, improving the visibility of operations and their flow to 100%, thus demonstrating the advantage 
of the proposal for entrepreneurs and their companies 
.

1. Introduction
The national leather industry and its manufactures have suffered at the international level various threats depending 
on the competitive tendency imposed by each producing country, such as: design, quality, brand; high technology in 
European countries, Brazil's cluster work, the integration of industry by districts in Italy, government policies to take 
advantage of low production costs through the exploitation of cheap labor aimed at competition by low prices, as in 
the case of China, are an example of the competitiveness challenges faced by the Colombian industry [1]. 
The common feature of MSMEs in the footwear sector in the city of Santiago de Cali is the lack of information to 
make decisions regarding costs that allows the definition of competitive prices, which affects the international

The application of the presented logistic methodology allowed to determine that the cost of production happens to be 
conformed not only by the traditional costs of raw material, labor and indirect costs of manufacture, but also 
incorporate logistic costs that must be identified and quantified for their proper management. Some of these costs 
are included in indirect costs of semi-manufactured manufacturing, which for various reasons originated in the 
company and others have not been taken into account. Hidden costs of lost sales, excessive purchases, shortage 
costs, time losses, cost of financial immobilization of raw material, cost of obsolescence of the raw material, hidden 
costs not considered paid or assumed by the company the owners of the business, among others. 
 
Factors external to companies, such as difficulty in accessing bank loans, unfair price competition, government 
policies without guarantees for the producer, and contraband, in addition to internal factors such as informality in 
hiring, lack of training, technology and obsolete production processes, business culture oriented to tax reduction, not 
to the generation of value through its costs, among others, are added to the variables that must be considered to carry 
out an adequate management of production costs

Abstract 
En el mundo empresarial los requerimientos de los clientes son cada vez m√°s exigentes y variables, por lo 
cual las cadenas de suministros se ven obligadas a desarrollarse en ambientes ‚Äúinciertos‚Äù que no garantizan 
la continuidad de los negocios, constantemente se ve amenazada su operatividad en el tiempo por diferentes 
factores, en su mayor√≠a ex√≥genos al control organizacional como robos, huelgas, contaminaci√≥n por 
narcotr√°fico, terrorismo y factores clim√°ticos, afectando la eficiencia y efectividad en cualquier cadena de 
suministros. Es aqu√≠ donde la administraci√≥n y gesti√≥n del riesgo facilita a cualquier compa√±√≠a medios 
necesarios para identificar, medir, tratar y controlar los riesgos que interfieran en su actividad y poder 
garantizar la continuidad de su log√≠stica empresarial sin afectar la satisfacci√≥n del cliente.  
Basado en lo expuesto y acogiendo metodolog√≠as de estudio, normas t√©cnicas colombianas (NTC31000, 
NTC28000) y la norma t√©cnica australiana (AS/NS 4360); se propone un modelo de gesti√≥n de riesgos 
log√≠sticos dirigido al proceso de distribuci√≥n de producto terminado (az√∫car y miel) en un ingenio azucarero 
del departamento del cauca. Explicitando el paso a paso para la gesti√≥n y operaci√≥n empresarial, generando 
una apuesta de buena pr√°ctica log√≠stica que identifica y mitiga el riesgo minimizando las paradas en la 
cadena.

Resumen 
La optimizaci√≥n matem√°tica es ampliamente utilizada para encontrar la mejor respuesta a una funci√≥n 
objetivo que se desea optimizar y cuya soluci√≥n est√° sujeta a restricciones que intentan simular la realidad. 
Su aplicaci√≥n es fundamental en la soluci√≥n de problemas industriales en donde exista una oportunidad de 
mejora. En esta investigaci√≥n presentamos un nuevo enfoque de optimizaci√≥n para la soluci√≥n al problema 
de envasado en m√°quinas pesadoras multicabezales. En este problema, cada producto envasado est√° 
compuesto por la suma de pesos contenidos en un subconjunto de tolvas en la pesadora multicabezal. El 
enfoque de optimizaci√≥n propuesto pretende dise√±ar un modelo matem√°tico y un algoritmo para llevar a 
cabo el proceso. Adem√°s, se propone un nuevo criterio de selecci√≥n del peso total de paquete, estudiando 
la configuraci√≥n de llenado de las tolvas como m√©todo de disminuci√≥n de la variabilidad. Los resultados 
num√©ricos de los par√°metros de rendimiento m√°s importantes del proceso de envasado revelan la utilidad 
de nuestro enfoque.

1. Introducci√≥n
La optimizaci√≥n constituye una disciplina fundamental en √°reas como la inform√°tica, la inteligencia 
artificial o la investigaci√≥n de operaciones. La optimizaci√≥n se concibe como el proceso de intentar 
encontrar la mejor soluci√≥n posible a un problema, generalmente en un tiempo limitado (Nemhauser y 
Wolsey, 1988; Cook et al., 1998). Se puede decir que en un problema de optimizaci√≥n hay muchas posible 
soluciones y alguna forma clara de comparaci√≥n entre ellas, de manera que el problema existe si y solo si 
se dispone de un conjunto de soluciones candidatas diferentes que pueden ser comparadas (Duarte et al., 
2007). Dependiendo de la complejidad algor√≠tmica, los problemas se pueden categorizar en P, NP, NP-
completo y NP-duros. Para mayor informaci√≥n consultar Duarte et al. (2007), Blum et al. (2008), Marler 
(2009), Erdogdu (2009), y Bierlaire (2015). 
Existe una colecci√≥n importante de problemas de optimizaci√≥n para los que no se dispone de algoritmos 
exactos que permitan encontrar la soluci√≥n √≥ptima en tiempos razonables. Sin embargo, para resolver estos 
problemas, una alternativa consiste en dise√±ar algoritmos aproximados que encuentren una soluci√≥n de alta 
calidad en un tiempo que pueda asumirse. Cada problema est√° representado por un modelo matem√°tico

6. Conclusiones 
 
Hemos presentado un enfoque para optimizar el proceso de envasado en m√°quinas pesadoras 
multicabezales. El enfoque propuesto explor√≥ la configuraci√≥n de llenado de las ùëõùëõ tolvas de pesaje en la 
pesadora como t√©cnica para disminuir la variabilidad en el peso del producto envasado. La optimizaci√≥n 
del proceso implico el desarrollo de un modelo matem√°tico y un algoritmo para la soluci√≥n al problema de 
seleccionar los pesos en tolvas durante el proceso de producci√≥n.  
 
Los resultados de los experimentos num√©ricos confirman que tanto el enfoque de selecci√≥n (disminuir la 
diferencia absoluta entre el peso del paquete y su peso objetivo) como el procedimiento propuesto para 
llevar a cabo el proceso pueden resolver el problema de envasado de una manera eficiente. Se confirma que 
cuando se suministra una cantidad promedio diferente de producto a las tolvas la variabilidad en el peso del 
paquete se reduce. En este sentido, un igual suministro de producto a las tolvas de pesaje no parece ser 
conveniente en este tipo de procesos.  
 
Se resalta el hecho de que valores extremos del n√∫mero de tolvas combinadas ùëòùëò no garantizan una reducci√≥n 
en la variabilidad del proceso, aun cuando aumentos en los valores de ùëòùëò y ùëõùëõ incrementan el n√∫mero total 
de combinaciones de pesos para elegir.  En futuras investigaciones pretendemos estudiar la configuraci√≥n 
de la pesadora multicabezal para encontrar las condiciones √≥ptimas operativas.

Abstract 
Over the years, one of the most important problems in engineering university education is the lack of 
student attention. The great majority of this problem is that the student feels that the knowledge 
transmitted in class has nothing to do with the real world. Besides that, the industry needs creative and 
innovative solutions and universities are best suited to meet the challenge through attractive and relevant 
curricula integrating innovation topics. For this reason, there is a phenomenon has emerged, known as 
collaboration between the university and industry (CUI), which becomes very beneficial for both agents. 
This article aims to show a case study of a collaboration project between small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SME‚Äôs) and the entrepreneurship of a team of teachers and students. The project, called 
MicroErp, is being developed through end-of-course projects of the computing faculty and consists of the 
creation of a computer tool for medium and small business resource management.

4. Analysis of results 
 
The MicroERP Project is a clear example of University-Industry collaboration, where knowledge and technology 
transfer can be appreciated. On the one hand the industry has obtained a management support tool that will allow a 
better management of resources of small companies. The software presents functionalities suitable for small 
businesses. Figure 6 shows an example of the product promotion screen. The industry is also getting a digital 
platform without worrying about implementation and maintenance of the infrastructure, currently the hardware of 
the digital platform is housed in the servers of the university. 
 
 
Figure 6: Product promotion web page 
 
On the other hand, the university has also obtained very interesting benefits. The students gained new knowledge 
about communication techniques with companies, had to learn to translate their technical knowledge into an 
understandable language for small businesses were also able to validate their knowledge gained during their 
university life in a real project. The students were also able to apply their technical knowledge, developing a Web 
application in PHP with a database engine in MySQL. Additionally, communication between the modules was 
achieved through web services, where each module had web services that can be consumed by the other modules.   
 
5. Conclusions and Future Works 
 
Collaboration between the University and industry not only happens through written agreements. It is possible to 
conduct informal collaboration, linking students' projects with industry needs without the need for a signing 
agreement. This type of collaboration helps to make communication and the transfer of knowledge and technology 
more fluid. It should be noted that in the future this collaboration must be of a formal type, with some written 
agreement to help limit the responsibilities and benefits or create a university spin-off. 
 
The role of the teachers involved in the project was fundamental in the collaboration. The experience in subjects 
related to communication with company helped the students to know how to interact with the companies. Teachers 
also help motivate students during the course of the entire project development. Knowledge of the business 
environment helped a lot to know a need and served as a starting point for the MicroERP project 
 
Finally, knowledge and technology gained was invaluable collaboration. On the one hand the company obtained 
software that will allow you to manage your resources efficiently. The companies also gained knowledge about

software development projects, which will be used for future projects. On the side of the university, the students 
were able to validate their knowledge obtained in the university.

Abstract 
Construction productivity is of great importance to companies and researchers alike, and 
motivation is a well-known factor influencing workers‚Äô productivity. However, motivational 
factors are arguably unique to every country due to the different cultural, economy, and social-
technological factors. Thus, the objectives of this study is to identify and evaluate the most 
influential motivation factors affecting labor productivity, and to assess the importance of these 
factors from the construction workers‚Äô perspective. A structured questionnaire survey was sent 
to multiple construction sites in two major cities, Amman and Aqaba. From the returned 
responses, sixteen motivational factors were identified and statistically analyzed by calculating 
the average, standard deviation, and the importance index of each factor. The five highest 
motivation factors were shown to be personal growth/career improvement; pay on time; 
decision-making ability; decent and respectful job, and rewards/promotions. Results from the 
study indicate that workers valued personal growth and improving their career more than 
having a higher pay and getting financial rewards. The study concluded that if organizations 
pay particular attention to these motivational factors it will increase workers‚Äô productivity, 
which will also improve project delivery and improve staff retention, which in return will 
improve the organizational standards.

1. Introduction
Productivity is the prime element of living standards, possessing high levels of productivity is one of the 
key factors for project success (HM Treasury, 2001; Yi and Chan, 2013). Due to its critical state to 
construction projects success, productivity is one of the most discussed subjects within the industry, 
additionally it is one of most used indicators for evaluating construction projects performance and level 
of success, as it is the most flexible resource used in such (Yi and Chan, 2013). The term productivity is 
often defined in many ways. The simplest definition of productivity as described by Handa and Abdalla 
(1989) is the ratio of outputs of goods and/or services to inputs of basic resources, e.g. labor, capital, 
technology, materials, and energy. Since the construction industry is labor-intensive; it can be argued 
that the main resource of productivity is manpower (Jarkas, 2010). Thus, labor productivity is an 
important productivity measure, because of the large concentration of manpower needed to complete any 
given task.

Resumen 
Los nuevos retos que enfrenta el sector productivo se han denominado como la cuarta revoluci√≥n industrial 
donde se determina tres variables fundamentales en los productos: ciclos de vida cortos, alta calidad, y 
costos adecuados regulados por complejos sistemas de comunicaci√≥n que transforman empresas 
convencionales en empresas inteligentes. Para enfrentar estos retos es necesario preparar al sector 
acad√©mico con m√©todos, met√≥dicas y laboratorios que mediante pr√°cticas experienciales mejoren las 
competencias de sus estudiantes, una de ellas se ha determinado como Fabrica de Aprendizaje donde se 
abordan problemas reales industriales para hallar desde la academia recursos aplicables a la soluci√≥n de 
estos retos. En este art√≠culo se presenta el dise√±o y desarrollo de la F√°brica de Aprendizaje de la universidad 
EAFIT, ilustrando tanto su infraestructura como su forma de operar.

1. Introducci√≥n
El sector manufacturero representa actualmente el 14,7% del PIB mundial[1], como una de las actividades m√°s 
importantes para generar riqueza en cualquier naci√≥n. Colombia no es una excepci√≥n, este sector representa el 12% 
del PIB y es la cuarta actividad productiva de su econom√≠a  [2]. Escenarios como la competencia feroz, ciclos de vida

5. Discusi√≥n y conclusiones 
Las f√°bricas de aprendizaje son un enfoque prometedor para el desarrollo de competencias. La vinculaci√≥n de las 
estrategias de aprendizaje y las √∫ltimas tendencias en la fabricaci√≥n potencian la formaci√≥n, la investigaci√≥n y la 
educaci√≥n en diferentes √°reas de la ingenier√≠a. Este art√≠culo presenta el modelo de transformaci√≥n para cambiar la 
infraestructura f√≠sica y la estructura did√°ctica de las pr√°cticas de ingenier√≠a de producci√≥n hacia el concepto de FA. 
Las transformaciones propuestas se basaron en la definici√≥n de tres pilares (did√°cticos, de integraci√≥n y de ingenier√≠a), 
que son un conjunto de caracter√≠sticas que deben ser desarrolladas para lograr una FA. Se propusieron tres 
transformaciones para desarrollar cada uno de los tres pilares. En las dos primeras transformaciones, la construcci√≥n 
del pilar did√°ctico fue la m√°s cr√≠tica, debido a los desaf√≠os en el desarrollo de estrategias de ense√±anza-aprendizaje 
vinculadas al objetivo educativo, al grupo objetivo ya los recursos f√≠sicos. 
Este modelo podr√≠a proporcionar una directriz replicable para implementar gradualmente una FA. Argumentamos que 
un proceso de transformaci√≥n adecuado puede contribuir a facilitar el camino hacia nuevas tendencias de fabricaci√≥n 
como la industria 4.0, en un contexto acad√©mico que refuerza el proceso de educaci√≥n de ingenier√≠a.

Abstract 
Las empresas dedicadas al transporte de carga son agentes movilizadores de mercanc√≠as desde un generador 
de carga hasta un punto de demanda de esa misma. En este trabajo de plantea un modelo de distribuci√≥n 
que considera la programaci√≥n de la carga a recoger y la forma de entregar en dichos puntos de demanda 
para una empresa dedicada al transporte de carga seca, al granel, refrigerada y congelada. Un modelo de 
ruteo con ventanas de tiempo (VRPTW por su sigla en ingl√©s) es considerado para el dise√±o de las rutas 
entre origen y destino, y la t√©cnica de optimizaci√≥n de colonia de abejas (ABC, por su sigla en ingl√©s) 
escogida para dar soluci√≥n al modelo. Los resultados obtenidos fueron muy satisfactorios para la compa√±√≠a 
considerando como indicadores de medici√≥n, el balance entre las rutas en cuanto a rentabilidad y la mejora 
en la entrega oportuna a los puntos de demanda, lo que genera una reducci√≥n considerable del n√∫mero de 
devoluciones.

1. Caracter√≠sticas de la operaci√≥n
El presente trabajo se realiza para una empresa de transporte de carga encargada de la distribuci√≥n urbana 
en Bucaramanga, Colombia del 95% del producto terminado de uno de sus clientes. Parte de la operaci√≥n 
se concentra en transportar el producto terminado en veh√≠culos refrigerados, desde el centro de distribuci√≥n 
de la empresa contratante hasta los puntos de demanda (clientes de la empresa contratante). 
Los veh√≠culos de la empresa transportadora tienen diferentes propietarios que hacen parte de la empresa y 
quienes deciden realizar los trabajos de transportes definiendo la ruta y el conductor. A partir de esto es que 
se considera importante balancear las rutas en cuanto a rentabilidad. Adem√°s, en cuanto a este criterio: 
Diariamente son programadas 18 rutas urbanas teniendo en cuenta en primer lugar las siguientes 
restricciones: Restricci√≥n de pico y placa en las zonas urbanas, cada veh√≠culo debe realizar por lo menos 1 
ruta viajera cada semana. 
La asignaci√≥n de las rutas a cada veh√≠culo se hace teniendo en cuenta las siguientes restricciones: La 
capacidad de transporte en toneladas de cada veh√≠culo (2.5 o 1.5 toneladas), debe haber una equidad en la

6. Conclusiones 
 
Con la implementaci√≥n de la herramienta para la asignaci√≥n de veh√≠culos a las rutas de distribuci√≥n, 
mediante el uso de una jerarqu√≠a en el peso asignado seg√∫n la demanda, se logr√≥ acercarse a una equidad 
mayor en la liquidaci√≥n de fletes como resultado de este proceso.  
 
La construcci√≥n de la red de transporte para la distribuci√≥n urbana de mercanc√≠as representa una 
herramienta importante en la toma de decisiones centrada en aumentar el √≠ndice de satisfacci√≥n del cliente.  
 
Con la implementaci√≥n de herramientas de Georreferenciaci√≥n se puede tener una visualizaci√≥n m√°s clara 
del problema de rotaci√≥n de veh√≠culos, igualmente de su soluci√≥n.  
 
Con la implementaci√≥n del modelo de optimizaci√≥n y su t√©cnica de soluci√≥n, al tener una promesa de 
entrega para el cliente se pueden disminuir notablemente los indicadores de devoluciones de mercanc√≠a 
cuya causa est√© relacionada directamente con los tiempos de entrega.  
 
La aplicaci√≥n del algoritmo de colonia artificial de abejas se constituye como una buena alternativa para 
solucionar problemas de optimizaci√≥n combinatoria.

Abstract 
This paper studies the problem of programming the ships loading to the bulk, in port systems. Identical 
loaders called Shiploaders must attend bulk carriers. When programming the ships, the charterer tries to 
minimize the incurred penalization cost when the Laydays is breached. The charterer will be penalized 
based on the amount of time that passes from the ending of the Laydays until the beginning of the bulk 
carrier loading. This problem is analyzed as a Berth Allocation Problem ‚Äì (BAP), which is an NP-hard 
problem. Different metaheuristics have been implemented to address this type of problems. In order to 
explore the uncertainty in the bulk carrier loading, a metaheuristic is implemented on a simulation model. 
The metaheuristic Simulated Annealing (SA) was integrated using Flexsim Software 7.7.4 to address the 
uncertainty of the loading times in the programming of the ships. The results were compared with previous 
work where only genetic algorithms had been applied, without simulation. It was demonstrated that the 
simulation and the Simulated Annealing minimized the breach of the Laydays facing the uncertainty 
associated to the operation from the maritime port to the bulk carriers, bearing in mind more real instances.

Implementing a Digital Training 
Abstract 
For a company who is look for give a better customer services and reach the next level (higher 
level), it¬¥s necessary to have standardization¬¥s processes that can help to improve employee¬¥s 
responsibilities and give a better customer service. So based in processes' information, it can be 
created a digital training in a Learning Manager Systems (LMS), to training the employees in 
how to do the things and how to improve their responsibilities, so with this they can give a better 
customer service. In this paper, it¬¥s going to show how based in processes¬¥ information, it was 
possible to create a digital training in a Service Company and how the Company received this 
information. This company is locate at M√©xico and has 19 offices across the Country.

Abstract 
Engineering Education has been, as a part of the HRST, a significant factor according the OCDE in 
correlating to GDP. Previous studies demonstrate that the shortage of engineers in a country as vast as 
Brazil need to be understood in a microregional scenario and shows that the microregions with HEI¬¥s are 
often the only ones that can leverage their development indexes (HDI_E and HDI_R). Not only are the 
differences in the country great on a region by region approach, but spillovers and HEI¬¥s products need to 
meet local demands. Based on the bibliographical review and raw government and official data analysis 
this study concludes that there is a significant impact factor on a city ability to leverage its development if 
a HEI is placed and the spillover factor for the remaining cities of the same microregion is also present. 
This study also concludes that the quality of an HEI is also important to assess the amount of leverage it 
will be able to achieve.

Engineering Education, Microregional Development, Shortage of Engineers, Human Development Index 
Introduction 
Since the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began publishing the Going for Growth 
reports in 2005, there¬¥s been a significant amount of research to understand the impacts of Human Resources in 
Science and Technology (HRST) influence in a country¬¥s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). All careers of Engineering, 
since they are a significant part of HRST, has had a special focus not only from the Engineering Education community 
but also from the general public that understand the importance of Engineers in developing the society and creating 
innovation. Since the GDP focus only on economic output, another largely used index that takes in consideration a 
more complete set of variable is the Human Development Index (HID). It presents as a better comparison as it takes 
into account not only revenue but also education and life expectancy. 
This article is a continuation of a study presented by the authors in other congresses and journals. This paper will focus 
primarily on the impact of the presence of HEI¬¥s and the quality of the institutions as a toll to leverage the 
microregional development.  
This paper will have the following the structure: bibliographical review focused on the Shortage (or Lack) of 
engineers, the leveraging of GDP, the Regional factors and impacts of Engineering High Education Institutions (HEI) 
and the university products and spillovers. After that the article will focus on the method of separation of HEI¬¥s by

North region displays a situation that only the capital city has an HEI and only the capital¬¥s microregion will benefit 
from it. The rest of the state¬¥s microregions in all 4 cases have no direct impact as defined by Drucker (2016) 
 
 Conclusions 
 
Both Tables 2 and 4 displays that the impact follows a similar path in both HDI_I and HDI_E results. On both cases, 
the highest impact in leveraging the development was the Capital factor as previously discussed. Followed by the 
capital we can the presence of an HEI will have better results on the city and the findings of Drucker (2016) are 
supported that the impact and spillover are present locally.  
 
An important information is that the quality of the HEI also has an impact on the HDI indexes. On both comparisons, 
the cities that were categorized on the CH+ were in average better than the cities categorized on CH-. This points to a 
conclusion that not only presence, but quality is important. Finally, CIH category has a better result than CNH, 
showing once again that the impact and spillover effects on microregions is pertinent and the need to consider local 
impact is necessary to properly develop the country. 
 
When analyzing the possibility to leverage the participation, we can take a closer look at the South macro region of 
the country, which is the region that can leverage its GDP when compared to the Northeast region. It has half the 
population - 14,12% against 27,37% (PNUD et al., 2013) - but a better GDP participation - 16,2% against 13,4% 
(IBGE, 2014) and the coverage of HEI impact can be a determinant factor for it as well as the number of abled 
engineers (CONFEA, 2016). The 3 states of the macro region have an even distribution (SC = 81,23%, RS = 63,10% 
and PR = 45,11%).

Resumen  
Ante la presencia e importancia de las tiendas de barrios en el pa√≠s, se han creado diferentes relaciones entre 
los tenderos, proveedores y consumidores, permitiendo el inicio de estudios sobre las negociaciones y 
productos que pueden ofrecer a cada uno de sus clientes. Pero se detect√≥ la poca informaci√≥n verificable 
sobre los agotados en estos establecimientos, creando la necesidad de realizar un dise√±o de una metodolog√≠a 
que mida  este tipo de productos en el canal de tienda a tienda y permita conocer en un futuro las categor√≠as 
de productos que presentan mayores agotados, causales de agotados y generar conocimiento a los canales 
involucrados, contribuyendo de manera directa con el mejoramiento de inventarios en las tiendas, 
incremento de ventas y servicio al cliente. La ciudad de Barranquilla fue la escogida para el desarrollo de

On the presence and importance of shopping districts in the country, have been created different 
relationships between the merchants, suppliers and consumers, allowing the start of studies about the 
negotiations and products that can offer to each of its customers. But detected little verifiable information 
about the sold out in these places, creating the need of a design of a methodology that measure the exhausted 
in the store to store channel and allows to know in future product categories presenting older exhausted, 
causality of exhausted and generate proposals for knowledge to all the channels involved contributing 
directly to the improvement of inventory in the stores, increased sales and customer service. The city of 
Barranquilla was the choice for the development of the investigation, including all their locations and social 
strata.

Producto insuficiente 
No gener√≥ el pedido con la cantidad correcta. 
No hubo visita del proveedor 
El proveedor no realiz√≥ la visita a la tienda en el 
tiempo indicado. 
Proveedor no entrega producto 
Despu√©s de la existencia de una orden de compra el 
proveedor no entreg√≥, no entreg√≥ a tiempo o no entreg√≥ 
la cantidad correcta. 
Conclusiones 
Cada tendero debe ser consciente de la importancia que representa un buen manejo del producto agotado y queda 
demostrado que es necesario detectar oportunamente las oportunidades de mejoras en sus negocios y capacitar al 
equipo de trabajo para que sean mayores competentes frentes a los nuevos formatos de descuentos y para las mismas 
tiendas de barrio.  
El estudio permite ver desde otra perspectiva la manera c√≥mo se est√°n generando p√©rdidas millonarias en el canal 
tradicional porque no se cuenta con el producto en ese momento, creando poca credibilidad en la tienda y en donde el 
mercado es poco fiel y m√°s exigente cada d√≠a.

Abstract 
Cuando de Servucci√≥n (fabricaci√≥n de servicios) se habla, cobra mucha importancia establecer mecanismos 
que permitan estandarizar los procesos en pro de garantizar los recursos necesarios para fabricar servicios 
de calidad y altamente productivos, es as√≠ que, el estudio del trabajo se constituye en  una metodolog√≠a 
importante, con la cual las organizaciones de servicios cuentan para realizar proyecciones de sus procesos, 
adem√°s de ajustar e implementar metodolog√≠as m√°s eficaces que les permita a las partes interesadas en estas 
tener momentos de verdad altamente diferenciadores. El anterior planteamiento generara compa√±√≠as m√°s 
productivas y rentables a la hora de fabricar y ofertar sus servicios. 
Basado en los preceptos anteriormente expuesto se pretende con este documento proponer una 
metodol√≥gica para el desarrollo del estudio del trabajo bajo un enfoque de Lean Services, que permita 
trascender de un enfoque tradicional basado en el PHVA hacia un esquema DMAIC, atendiendo esto a las 
caracter√≠sticas actuales de los contextos de servicios y a la importancia que representa para estas la 
asignaci√≥n y el buen uso de los recursos en pro de garantizar sistemas de servucci√≥n que generen alto valor 
agregado a todos los grupos sociales y economicos de inter√©s.

‚Ä¢ 
Al tener caracteristica de sistemas por proyectos los sistemas de servucci√≥n, no muestran un 
comportamiento deterministicos, si no de tipo probabilistico y estocastico, lo que dificulta su analisis y 
comprensi√≥n. 
‚Ä¢ 
La Servucci√≥n no reviste que solo sea materia de estudio del marketing, sino que, es un reto a la 
creatividad y a la precisi√≥n en que deben dise√±arse e interactuar, el conjunto de elementos y cuestiones 
sujetas a influencias y conductas regidas por leyes probabil√≠sticas, donde interviene fuertemente el 
personal prestador del servicio, expectativas, deseos, variaciones y percepciones decisivas del cliente, y 
que si hacen a la esencia del servicio, son cuestiones importantes cuando se analiza los costos implicados 
en √©l. 
‚Ä¢ 
No se debe olvidar que la oferta total de servicio son elementos comunes al cliente, que con sus 
necesidades, percepciones y requisitos decide sobre el Servicio Global, lo que implica que cada acci√≥n 
(‚Äúservucci√≥n‚Äù) debe planificarse con el objetivo de crear valor. 
‚Ä¢ 
El estudio del trabajo en sistemas de servucci√≥n bajo enfoque lean services y six sigma, se convierte en 
una metodologia escencial para garantizar servicios de calidad, productivos y rentables, toda vez que 
permitira definir de una manera clara los roles que juega el personal de contacto en los momentos de 
verdad, determinar las actividades que agreguen verdaderamente valor a esos momentos de verdad lo 
que disminuira la improvisaci√≥n y mejorara la percepci√≥n del cliente ante el servicio fabricado. 
‚Ä¢ 
El estudio del trabajo en sistemas de servucci√≥n nos permitira determinar cuantos momentos de verdad 
y que recursos necesitamos para garantizar la calidad, la productividad y la rentabilidad de un sistema 
de servucci√≥n. 
‚Ä¢ 
Si bien es importante para las empresas de servicios garantizar tiempos de atenci√≥n, accesibilidad, 
disponibilidad del servicio, para asi fidelizar a los clientes, es mucho mas importante el concepto calidad 
del servicio, raz√≥n por la cual para el estudio del trabajo en sistemas de servucci√≥n, se hace necesarios 
trascender de los esquemas tradicionales para el desarrollo del trabajo a esquemas bajo enfoque lean 
services y six sigma enmaracados en la metodologia DMAIC orientada esta a mejora de procesos, lo 
cual se convirtio en el objeto principal del presente trabajo y el desarrollo de futuros trabajos propuestos. 
‚Ä¢ 
En los sistemas de servucci√≥n no solo basta con mostrar una atencion cordial y amena que demuestre 
nuestro interes por los clientes(calidad), si no que, tambien es necesario garantizar tiempos de atenci√≥n, 
disponibilidad de servicio(Capacidad de atenci√≥n); accesibilidad (productividad) al menor costo posible 
y con la menor cantidad de esfuerzos e inversi√≥n de recursos(rentabilidad).

Abstract 
El control estad√≠stico de procesos (C.E.P) es catalogado como una herramienta que circunscribe una serie 
de t√©cnicas cuantitativas orientadas a la mejora continua de calidad de los procesos y/o productos, por lo 
que posibilita la detecci√≥n y prevenci√≥n de incidentes an√≥malos y de aparici√≥n de causas de variabilidad 
asignable. Dado lo anterior, se presenta en este art√≠culo principios de aplicaci√≥n del control estad√≠stico en 
ambiente real, concretamente en una empresa dedicada a la fabricaci√≥n y distribuci√≥n de productos l√°cteos. 
En primera instancia, se plantea el dise√±o de una carta de control basada en modelos de tipo A.R.I.M.A, 
como consecuencia de la inminente disminuci√≥n del rendimiento de los gr√°ficos de control convencionales 
para hacer un seguimiento continuo a procesos dominados por una estructura de autocorrelaci√≥n. 
Posteriormente, se calcula un conjunto de m√©tricas especializadas que permiten evaluar la capacidad del 
proceso para cumplir con las especificaciones t√©cnicas predefinidas en el corto y mediano plazo. Se 
demostr√≥ emp√≠ricamente, que la adopci√≥n del enfoque propuesto presenta una alta efectividad para 
caracterizar la din√°mica del proceso productivo. Asimismo, se concluye que, aunque la distribuci√≥n del 
mismo, ostenta un nivel de estabilidad relativamente alto, su aptitud para satisfacer las tolerancias es 
inadecuada.

1. Introducci√≥n
Es un imperativo para la empresa moderna, articular acciones tendientes al robustecimiento de los sistemas de control 
total de la calidad, a fin de lograr un nivel prominente de rendimiento y garantizar le mejora continua (Krajewsky, 
Ritzman, & Malhotra, 2008). Es justamente en este escenario, donde comparece el control estad√≠stico de procesos 
como una disciplina que conjunta una serie de m√©todos con soporte cuantitativo √∫tiles para tal efecto.  Bien es sabido

√âl √≠ndice ùë™ùë™ùë∑ùë∑/ùë∑ùë∑ùë∑ùë∑ es un cuantificador de la capacidad potencial del proceso y se estima como el cociente de la variaci√≥n 
tolerada (dada por las especificaciones) y la amplitud de la variaci√≥n natural del proceso. Dado que el valor para este 
indicador en el corto y en el largo plazo es inferior a 1 se afirma entonces, que el proceso es incapaz de cumplir 
solventemente con las especificaciones predefinidas. En lo que respecta al indicador ùë™ùë™ùíìùíì -que es el ratio de capacidad 
potencial del proceso ‚Äì se hace patente  el hecho de que m√°s del 100% del ancho de especificaciones es ocupado por 
el proceso, dejando nulo de margen de holgura; en otros t√©rminos, la variaci√≥n real supera en sobremanera, la variaci√≥n 
tolerada. El √≠ndice  ùíÅùíÅùíÅùíÅùíÅùíÅùíÅùíÅ metrifica la capacidad del proceso en funci√≥n de la distancia existente entre las 
especificaciones y la media dividida entre la desviaci√≥n t√≠pica. El valor que asume esta m√©trica indica el nivel de 
calidad sigma del proceso, que para este caso es indeseable en tanto que es equivalente a 1,443. La capacidad real del 
proceso instant√°nea y a largo plazo medida por ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™/ùë∑ùë∑ùë∑ùë∑ùë∑ùë∑ indica un considerable desfasamiento de la media respecto 
al centro de la banda de especificaciones. En lo relativo a los indicadores ùë≤ùë≤ y ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ √©stos s√≥lo eval√∫an la habilidad 
del proceso a largo plazo. La primera m√©trica da indicio sobre el centrado de la caracter√≠stica de calidad. Dado que ùë≤ùë≤ 
es igual 0,068 se intuye que hay un d√©bil desfasamiento de la distribuci√≥n de la variable analizada respecto a las 
especificaciones, es decir que la media del proceso supera al valor nominal moderadamente. El √≠ndice de Taguchi 
(ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂) a diferencia del indicador de capacidad potencial del proceso, incluye en su formulaci√≥n un par√°metro ‚Äútau‚Äù 
que toma en cuenta el centrado y variaci√≥n del proceso. Debido a que ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ùë™ es igual a 0,51603 se colige que el proceso 
no cumple con las especificaciones y  por tanto, no admite un incremento de la variabilidad. Cabe acotar que, a largo 
plazo, se proyecta una reducci√≥n significativa en este indicador, lo que sugiere, que existir√° un detrimento progresivo 
de la aptitud del proceso en caso tal de que se obvie trazar estrategias de mejora que zanjen esta problem√°tica 
 
4.  Consideraciones Finales 
 
En este caso de estudio se expusieron ciertos principios metodol√≥gicos del control estad√≠stico de proceso a fin de 
identificar posibilidades de mejoras del proceso productivo. Luego de la aplicaci√≥n del grafico de control para datos 
individuales y la estimaci√≥n de las m√©tricas de capacidad se lleg√≥ a la conclusi√≥n de que ninguna de las variables 
registr√≥ una tendencia an√≥mala, a excepci√≥n del ‚Äúpeso‚Äù, que evidenci√≥ un comportamiento err√°tico e inestable, 
adicionalmente una fracci√≥n significativa de sus valores se localizaban fuera de los l√≠mites de especificaci√≥n. Ello es 
un fuerte indicio de baja capabilidad e inestabilidad. Sin embargo, un an√°lisis exhaustivo de la variable en cuesti√≥n, 
mediante el empleo de ciertas herramientas de monitoreo no convencionales permiten llegar a conclusiones dis√≠miles.  
Aunque si bien es cierto que las gr√°ficas de control est√°ndares, son un buen punto de partida para comprender la 
din√°mica de un proceso o servicio, en tanto que ostentan una alta potencia para detectar variaciones de fondo, suelen 
ser marcadamente sensibles frente a la transgresi√≥n de ciertas hip√≥tesis, como la de independencia serial, tal y como 
sucede con la variable de inter√©s analizada.  El an√°lisis comparativo entre la carta de control est√°ndar y aquella basada 
en los modelos de promedios m√≥viles autorregresivo integrados (A.R.I.M.A) hace patente el hecho de que √©sta √∫ltima

Abstract 
Este documento aborda el tema de las empresas prestadoras de servicios log√≠sticos para el sector 
transporte terrestre automotor de carga, esto debido a la falta de informaci√≥n oficial en el corredor vial 
Yumbo - Cali objeto de estudio. Este corredor se ha convertido en una de las principales rutas econ√≥micas 
e industriales, y un reconocido centro econ√≥mico del sur occidente colombiano, es paso obligado al 
principal puerto colombiano sobre el Pac√≠fico. 
Esta propuesta presenta (i) el dise√±o de una herramienta que permite caracterizar geogr√°fica, tipol√≥gica y 
econ√≥micamente las empresas del sector transporte de carga ubicadas en el corredor vial Yumbo-Cali; (ii) 
Genera el inventario de servicios log√≠sticos ofertados por las empresas antes caracterizadas, de tal manera 
que se ofrece una base de informaci√≥n normalizada que sirve para tomar decisiones administrativas y 
pol√≠ticas, tanto a las gerencias de las empresas ofertantes de carga, como al gobierno Nacional y 
Departamental.   Esta informaci√≥n permite que las empresas del sector transporte elevar la eficiencia en la 
prestaci√≥n de servicios log√≠sticos en t√©rminos de calidad, oportunidad, tiempo y costos, as√≠ como, 
extender su cobertura a otras regiones

Introducci√≥n
El funcionamiento y √©xito de las empresas var√≠a de acuerdo con distintos aspectos, como: (i) tama√±o; (ii) liderazgo; 
(iii) Asociatividad; (iv) comunicaci√≥n e informaci√≥n; (v) cultura organizacional; (vi) direccionamiento estrat√©gico; y
(vii) gesti√≥n financiera. Todo esto de la mano de inversi√≥n en desarrollo y tecnolog√≠a son caracter√≠sticas que generan
un factor diferenciador y decisivo en el desarrollo de las empresas.  [1].
Con lo anterior y teniendo en cuenta que en Santiago de Cali existen 2.224 empresas del sector transporte y 
almacenamiento [2], seg√∫n la C√°mara de Comercio las peque√±as y medianas empresas (PYME), constituyen un 
eslab√≥n determinante en la conformaci√≥n de cadenas productivas y en la generaci√≥n de empleo en Colombia. Por su 
tama√±o, poseen mayor flexibilidad para enfrentar los cambios del mercado y emprender proyectos innovadores.

Abstract 
The agriculture and food production are major contributions from the rural sector to a nation‚Äôs economy 
and social well-being. In most developing countries, the exportation of these commodities has generated 
economic growth and infrastructure changes. Brazil, for instance, has been self-sufficient in food 
production for the past several decades. Nonetheless, growing sustainability challenges within the food 
supply chain, regarding wastage and security, have become paramount issues for food industry 
stakeholders, requiring innovative capacity building through unique supply chain strategies and policies. 
The study aims to explore opportunities for rural development through a sustainable food supply chain, 
which deploys new technologies to support required infrastructure and capacity building. A systematic 
review of literature was conducted to uncover current sustainability challenges in the food supply chains of 
developing countries. The main outcome of the study will be a proposal for a conceptual model, which can 
be used by policy makers and local food industries to address these challenges.

Introduccion
La tendencia para mejorar la competitividad en Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe (ALC) est√° centrada en estrategias de 
aumento de las exportaciones. Para que estas estrategias puedan tener √©xito, un componente clave es un marco 
log√≠stico eficaz y eficiente que aborde todo el espectro de la cadena de valor, siendo el componente principal, los 
costos log√≠sticos, que en ALC oscilan entre el 18% y el 35% del valor del producto, lo cual es alto comparado con 
aproximadamente el 8% del valor del producto en los pa√≠ses de la Organizaci√≥n para la Cooperaci√≥n y el Desarrollo 
Econ√≥mico (OCDE) [2]. 
En Colombia en los √∫ltimos a√±os se ha avanzado en la comprensi√≥n de la importancia de la log√≠stica para la 
competitividad y en el Valle del Cauca se han desarrollado y adoptado medidas para mejorar este aspecto, como es

Resumen 
La tercerizaci√≥n (BPO) en las grandes empresas colombianas es una tendencia que ha permitido 
la subcontrataci√≥n de operaciones de acondicionamiento secundario generando ahorros en costos 
operativos hasta en un 25%. Estudios realizados por el programa de transformaci√≥n productiva 
en el 2012 establecen que este sector se encontraba conformado por 263 empresas con ingresos 
de 5244 millones de d√≥lares. En  Colombia la estructura de  estas empresas y el nivel de madurez 
en la cadena de suministro no ha permitido que el negocio cuente con mecanismos eficientes y 
estructurados para medir el resultado de sus operaciones a fin de determinar el grado de valor 
generado, por lo que resulta pertinente, contar con herramientas que faciliten el control de las 
actividades realizadas para una evaluaci√≥n y ajuste continuo, garantizando mejoras en la 
competitividad  como resultado de la toma de decisiones oportuna y acertadas.

Abstract 
The usability evaluation of a web site has been found using quantitative metrics. A case study 
has been used to collect quantitative data from participants to determine and measure 3 main 
factors of web site usability; effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. A questionnaire has been 
delivered to 32 participants and they were asked to complete 8 tasks which have been determined 
to navigate the web site. The results of the study produced an enriched perspective to measure 
the web site usability. We measured the effectiveness, efficient, and satisfaction with quantitative 
data and explored the weakness of each factor.

1. Introduction
Developing a highly qualified, well designed, and usable web site is one of the most complicated issues in online 
world. Users of the web site have different purposes and they are free on selection of the web sites (Nam, 2014). 
Web sites can be categorized into four groups; entertainment, information, communication, and commerce (Lee and 
Koubek, 2010).  
However, most of the web sites contain many problems in terms of usability (Becker and Mottay, 2001, Chau and 
Wong, 2010, Treiblmaier and Pinterits, 2010, Tung et al., 2009). The common problems can be defined as 
difficulties of understanding the content, difficulties in navigation, disorientation, lack of customization, reliability, 
consistency and so on (Downing and Liu, 2011; Fogli and Guida, 2014).  
Number of studies related to usability tremendously increased year by year since 1997 compared to relative areas 
such as human computer interaction, software, and web engineering. (Fernandez et al., 2011). While the number of 
usability studies has been increasing, the definition of it has been changed as well. Usability is defined as ‚Äò‚Äòthe 
capability to be used by humans easily‚Äô‚Äô (Shackel, 1991, p. 24); and ""...the ease of use and acceptability of a system 
or product for a particular class of users carrying out specific tasks in a specific environment""(Bevan, 1991). 
Usability has been defined differently by researchers because of its context. Additionally, new methods regarding 
measuring web usability have been introduced over the time. Researchers and practitioners used different methods 
to measure web sites‚Äô usability. There are two type of methods could be used for usability evaluations: Quantitative 
methods such as eye tracking methods, remote evaluations, laboratory analysis, surveys and qualitative methods 
such as interviews and think aloud methods.

As seen in Table 3, task 4, 1, 6, and 3 are the most unsuccessful tasks while task 2, 8, 7, and 5 are the most 
successful tasks respectively.  
 
This confirms that efficiency of the tasks as well because if we look at the most efficient tasks, they are 2, 5, 7, and 8 
which are the most effective tasks. Total system effectiveness can be calculated by taking average of successful 
tasks which is 77.1%. This explains that 77.1% of tasks have been completed successfully and system is effective 
overall by 77.1%. Web portal needs to improve its effectiveness by changing designs of the page, making links clear 
for users‚Äô inceptions and so on. Thus, effectiveness of the web portal could be increased. Additionally, in order to 
increase the efficiency of the web site, tasks, where users have less success, must be considered first as where users 
experience hard time to achieve their goals.  
 
3.3 Satisfaction 
 
We asked the participant to rate the system from 0 to 100 regarding how satisfied they were while using the system. 
As seen in the table 4, satisfaction of the system has been found %67.6. Satisfaction level depends on each person 
but 67.6% is less for a web portal. This shows that users are not that much satisfied while using the web portal.  
 
 
Table 4. Satisfaction of system usage 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The results of the usability measurement of the Fatih University web portal were extremely useful. Web site 
usability measurement is something that should be done by each web site owner. These studies could provide 
valuable information and perspective for any institutions regarding their online face. Incorporating usability testing 
into website redesigns will lead to user-centered websites, which means more attractive and functional web site for 
users. Reviewing of the camera recorders and notes provided a great insight regarding the strengths and weaknesses 
of the web portal so that we were able to see how to improve the web portal. Additionally, quantitative measurement 
helped to see the real performance of web site from usability perspective. Measuring efficiency, effectiveness and 
satisfaction with quantitative methods produced an enrichment insight for the usability of the web portal. 
 
The main weakness of the study was to lack of the quantitative measurement. This part could be an excellent starting 
point for further research.

Abstract 
This paper introduces a collaborative strategy in the supply chain that demonstrates potential to reduce 
management inventory costs, through the coordinated replenishment of multiple items from non-
competitors vendors. The proposed approach is an extension of the classical joint replenishment problem 
(JRP) denominated as stochastic collaborative joint replenishment problem (S-CJRP) since considers 
normally distributed demand and real world constraints. This research presents two main problems: the 
first consists in determining the frequency in which each vendor should replenish its products considering 
a limited transport and storage capacity. A heuristic procedure has been used as effective methodology for 
solve it. The second problem deals with the problem of allocate the benefits given by the collaboration in 
a viable and stable way. This problem was modeled as a cooperative game for ensuring fairness among 
participants. The Shapley Value was used as a method for allocation, which allows a balance between the 
contribution and gain sharing for the players. A study case is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of 
this strategy, providing economics benefits. 
Keywords  
Stochastic joint replenishment problem, collaboration in supply chains, multi-product inventory model, 
Shapley value. 
1. Introduction
The global competition, forces companies to meet the product demands at an increasingly lower
price. In particular, the retailers companies are forced to manage efficiently their inventories,
considering that a good management could be the base to a competitive advantage. However, for
companies with limited resources, competition may be non-viable. For example, the lake of
warehouse space, transport capacity or budget, leave aside the possibility of access to better 3pl
services charges, supplier quantity discounts or the exploitation of economies of scale.
The  inventory replenishment process implies incurring in two types of costs: a setup cost and a 
holding cost (Hax & Candea, 1983). In the first one, there are elements of a fixed nature. 
Therefore, it makes sense to replenish jointly multiple items rather than one. Including several 
items in an order allows the exploitation of economies of scale, so savings could be achieved 
(Silver, 1974). This problem is widely recognized in the literature as the Joint Replenishment 
Problem (JRP). Since its appearance in the works made by Starr, M. K., & Miller (1962), the 
JRP has been recognized by its potential of application in real scenarios. Different solutions and

8. Conclusions
This paper proposes a collaborative strategy where non-competitor companies can share
logistical resources and fixed costs related to manage inventories. Trough a study case was
demonstrated that a potential cost reduction can be achieved. The model is especially useful for
companies with limited resources because it provides the opportunity to achieve increase of
capacity and exploitation of economies of scale. On another hand, the strategy allows improving
the efficiency of companies with overcapacity thanks to a better use of resources. The tests
showed that players with similar conditions; demand and operational costs, can obtain
comparable benefits by forming coalitions, but the coalitions formed by player with
heterogeneous conditions could be unstable. In these cases, the players who contribute with little
charge and large costs can achieve high cost reductions, even more that big players because they
take greater advantage of the resource of the first ones, while the latter achieve little benefits.
The selection of players and the formation of coalitions should be more widely studied. Future
research must consider the possibility of multi objective function; where the main propose is not
reduce costs. Another important topic is the accuracy of the space required, since this paper
considered that the products are packed in boxes or units of load with regular and standard
forms. This assumption can significantly alter the results if there are products with irregular
shapes.

Abstract 
In Colombia, one of the main business concerns is to locate products within the reach of the consumer, 
especially in areas of difficult access, given the country's geographical conditions and road conditions 
make distribution operations difficult by this means. 
This document presents the results of the system characterization for collection and distribution of 
essential products in Valle del Cauca department within a pilot company, through an applied logistic 
model. The study concluded, among others, that last-mile operations have multiple inconsistencies, which 
make it difficult to deliver products to the consumer in a timely manner and in the expected conditions 
due to the way the supply chain is managed, where it is the consumer who goes to a distant geographical 
point to have access to basic products, and, these do not respond to consumer expectations. 
The proposed model is bi-helix, has an operative-functional component of the distribution system; and a 
mathematical component, which minimizes operating costs. This model serves as a reference for the 
development of on-site information collection instruments to recognize the configuration of the chain and 
the roads. 
Keywords  
Logistics model for transport, urban distribution, last mile. 
1. Introduction
In Colombia, food security is a constitutional right especially for children. That is why it is necessary that logistics 
distribution systems are properly aligned to contribute to the achievement of this national objective, especially in 
areas of difficult access which is where the most vulnerable and most need access to food of high nutritional value 
and low cost. 
Given these conditions, a project was executed in Valle del Cauca in which the problem of distribution of a critical 
food product for populations in poverty condition was analyzed. The analysis evaluated (i) the demand and 
consumption of the product, (ii) the level of service and (iii) the access and availability of the product at low cost.

4. Discussion. 
 
At this point it can be considered that most of the existing routing software has a programming that allows them to 
function properly in the geographies of countries such as the United States and Europe, countries where its 
development is conceived, however, the available software presents problems to recognize the Colombian directions 
and to locate some municipalities and smaller towns that are not totally digitalized. Likewiwe, and because they are 
specialized, they have high costs, making it difficult to access all of their capacity and possibilities even for 
academic studies, so we used the trial versions for the sample of routing of this project which, although it presents 
very good characteristics, is very limited in its functions and benefits. 
 
In order to gather information relevant to the project, field work, interviews and direct relationship with the agents 
of the chain closest to the client were used, since they had first-hand information about the operation and its 
conformation. The distribution logistics network is flexible in terms of the number and denomination of agents in 
each link. 
 
It is intended that this project serve as a model for the development of similar proposals in other parts of the country, 
that also serves as a basis for future IT routing platforms that are specifically developed to operate in Colombia, or 
that the available routing platforms can be upgraded to develop specific modules for Colombia and especially for 
Valle del Cauca.

INTRODUCTION 
El progreso de la log√≠stica en las organizaciones ha sido 
muy significativo durante estos √∫ltimos a√±os convirti√©ndose en 
elemento decisivo para los indicadores de gesti√≥n de las 
empresas, actualmente la log√≠stica inversa ha cobrado 
importancia en el sector empresarial pues surge como respuesta 
a la problem√°tica medioambiental reflejada en la legislaci√≥n de 
muchos pa√≠ses en materia de devoluci√≥n y recuperaci√≥n de 
desechos, envases y embalajes. Su desconocimiento en nuestro 
pa√≠s ha generado ,a su vez, una problem√°tica en  el manejo de 
las canastillas en las empresas en la ciudad de barranquilla, 
particularmente en Alimentos C√°rnicos S.A.S, la cual es una 
empresa productora y comercializadora de embutidos que 
utiliza este activo como parte sustancial para desarrollar sus 
labores log√≠sticas de almacenamiento y distribuci√≥n de 
productos;  por lo que este estudio se enfocar√° en la 
identificaci√≥n de mejores pr√°cticas en la log√≠stica inversa en el 
manejo de canastillas para que estas retornen oportunamente al 
proveedor y se le realice el reacondicionamiento adecuado y de 
este modo la canastilla sea utilizada nuevamente para embalar 
y transportar los embutidos. De esta manera la empresa lograr√° 
utilizar de forma adecuada las canastillas dentro de su vida √∫til 
y ser√° beneficioso para ella en cuanto a los costos que incurren 
cada vez que no poseen el n√∫mero de canastillas adecuadas 
para la entrega de sus productos. 
Se desconocen estudios diagn√≥sticos recientes acerca del 
manejo de canastillas en los diversos sectores en el pa√≠s lo cual 
no permite proponer mejoras ni generar un dise√±o de un 
proceso eficiente de dichas pr√°cticas.  Po ello se hace necesario 
la identificaci√≥n y diagn√≥stico por sectores, para lo cual se 
proceder√° a la recolecci√≥n de informaci√≥n primaria y 
secundaria en la empresa que permitir√° comparar de acuerdo 
con par√°metros fijados las mejores pr√°cticas en log√≠stica 
inversa y generar las respectivas recomendaciones.

RESUMEN 
La Distribuidora Barranquilla S.A.S. naci√≥ el 28 de octubre de a√±o 2000 en la ciudad de Barranquilla, por una 
propuesta que tuvo la Compa√±√≠a Nacional de Chocolate y Galletas Noel (actualmente Grupo Nutresa), para 
ceder la distribuci√≥n de sus productos hacia los  clientes m√°s peque√±os (tiendas de barrio, graneros, kioscos, 
colegios,). Con la creaci√≥n del Grupo Nutresa y sus pol√≠ticas para mejorar el nivel servicio y reducir los costos 
log√≠sticos, la distribuidora paso de manejar cero inventarios en su almac√©n y entregas de pedidos a sus 
clientes de 24 horas, a tener un almac√©n con la capacidad para mantener 5 d√≠as de inventario y aumentar el 
tiempo de ciclo a 48 horas. Debido a estas condiciones se hace necesario definir el dise√±o de layout de la 
distribuidora. 
El proyecto abarca hasta el dise√±o de layout del almac√©n de la distribuidora con el fin de mejorar las 
operaciones log√≠sticas, abarcando el dise√±o de las operaciones log√≠sticas internas (recepci√≥n, 
almacenamiento, alistamiento y despacho) y la definici√≥n de  los indicadores de gesti√≥n para evaluar cada una 
de las actividades.

Abstract 
Critical path assessment plays an important role in production project management in order to schedule and 
control of the projects. In fuzzy sets theory, it is often difficult for an expert to accurately quantify his or 
her opinion as a number in interval [0,1]. Therefore, it is more appropriate to indicate this degree of certainty 
by an interval that is why interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFSs) are used to better address the uncertainty of 
real world production projects. Also, a new multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method based on fuzzy 
preference relation under IVFSs is developed. Moreover, entropy method is extended by means oNEAA 
distance between each point from nearer and farther point among ideal points under IVFSs. Finally, an 
application about production projects is solved to better illustrate the calculation and capability of the 
proposed method.

1. Introduction
Decision-making is often associated with the procedure of selecting the best alternative from the set of feasible
alternatives. In many cases when selecting the best alternative, it is necessary to take into account the impact of conflict 
multiple criteria. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is an important part of today‚Äôs decision making problem. 
It has been vastly applied to various areas such as economics, management, production, and engineering (e.g., Salimi 
et al., 2013; Ebrahimnejad et al., 2014; Roshanaei et al., 2013; Mousavi et al., 2014).  
     Among many cases, crisp data are incomplete to model real life conditions. In fact, uncertainty plays an important 
role in decision-making problems. In order to tackle the uncertainty of real world problems, the fuzzy sets theory was 
proposed by Zadeh (1965). For instance, Chen (2000) proposed extension of TOPSIS for group decision making under 
fuzzy environments. Tsaur et al. (2002) transformed fuzzy MCDM problem into a crisp one by means of centroid 
defuzzification and then solve the crisp MCDM problem using the TOPSIS method. Chu and Lin (2003) introduced a 
fuzzy TOPSIS method for robot selection problems. Zammori et al. (2009) expressed critical path assessment problem 
as a MCDM problem under a fuzzy environment and solve it by TOPSIS method.  
     Critical path method (CPM) identifies critical activities on the critical path so that resources may be centralized on 
these activities in order to reduce the project completion time. Critical path selection problem is an important issue in 
project management and especially, production and manufacturing project management. Several articles have been

5. Conclusion 
     In this paper, a new multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method based on fuzzy preference relation concept 
has been developed. Main advantages of the proposed method for assessing critical paths in production project 
management was strength and weakness scores based on relative comparisons using fuzzy preference relation, and 
relative comparison of the performances of production project paths. Also, interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFSs) provide 
more degree of freedom to cope uncertainty of real world production projects that is why the MCDM method under 
IVFSs has been extended. Moreover, a new IVF entropy method by means of distance between distance between each 
point from nearer and farther point among positive ideal point and negative ideal point concepts under IVFSs has been 
presented. An application about critical path selection by considering efficient criteria such as time, cost, risk, quality 
and safety by using the proposed method has been solved to better illustrate its capability. The proposed method was 
useful to the project managers in terms of providing the total performance score of each path to measure performance 
of the paths on various criteria in a relative procedure. The results obtained in this study assisted the project managers 
to specify the critical path and also provide information regarding those activities which were critical enough to be 
given remarkable importance in their execution so that the project goals can be better attained.

Abstract 
The need to contribute you to the Colombian population with limited resources, from the University to solve the 
problems caused by poor electrical service in isolated zones such as: gaps in health services, education, 
communication, commercial, industrial and agricultural It was a reason for this research, gathering information with 
the entities involved in the generation and supply charge control. 
The work was made on Acand√≠ pilot municipality in the department of Choc√≥ as one of the most vulnerable in the 
service (as mining and energy planning unit). A Emselca Company S.A. He underwent a diagnosis followed by a 
strategic improvement plan that resulted in the proposal for a general restructuring of the same, shedding as a result 
it is possible to provide a service of electricity 24 hours a day in an efficient manner in this municipality and you can 
ring this study in other municipalities with similar characteristics. 
From the above, a change in business organizational culture, political and economic partner city, which is critical for 
the functional improvement of these businesses was proposed.

1. Introduction 
Environmental concerns and pressures are contributing to make organizations more proactive in the designing 
products, services, and processes, while making them less aggressive to the environment (GARZA-REYES, 2015). 
There is an increase in environmental responsibility, which has led to the implementation of Green initiatives in 
addition to the Lean initiatives (DHINGRA, KRESS and UPRETI, 2014) developed by Japanese companies after the 
Second World War, and disseminated worldwide. 
 
Companies can simultaneously adopt the Lean and Green strategies, towards to achieve a cost reduction, increase in 
profits, and improvement in corporate image (FERCOQ, LAMOURI and CARBONE, 2016). The Lean system has as 
one of its main premises the reduction of waste. According to Simpson and Power (2005), this contributes to 
environmental management. 
 
Despite being a relatively new approach (GARZA-REYES, 2015), the combined use of the Lean and Green production 
systems is being adopted by many companies (GALEAZZO, FURLAN and VINELLI, 2014, JABBOUR et al., 2013). 
In the academic field, these systems have been the object of study for the development of models of evaluation of their 
synergy (CABRAL, GRILO and CRUZ-MACHADO, 2012; VERRIER et al., 2014; FAULKNER and 
BADURDEEN, 2014; FERCOQ, LAMOURI and CARBONE, 2016, VERRIER, ROSE and CAILLAUD, 2016). 
 
ROBECOSAM (2017), in strategic partnership with S & P Dow Jones Indices, has a sustainability assessment method 
based on the social, environmental and economic pillars. This is an important sustainability assessment tool that, 
despite not directly using the Lean/Green terms, has the ability to evaluate companies within these two fields. This 
evaluation model is based on a set of 80 to 120 questions applied annually to more than 3,400 companies worldwide. 
Through this data, more than 600 indicators have been analyzed in more than 4000 companies. The complexity of this 
extensive evaluation system, and the fact that it is used only by a select group of companies, limits its use. 
 
Being in an early stage of studies, the use of software to facilitate the evaluation of the Lean/Green synergy is still 
little used. Among the models mentioned above, only ROBECOSAM (2017) has an evaluation method supported by 
a software platform. The lack of a systematized support is a limitation for the already developed models, since it is 
not feasible to perform complex calculations manually. On the other hand, it is difficult to perform a reliable evaluation 
without the use of calculations with a higher level of complexity. 
 
To solve some of these difficulties, the SLG platform was thought to be a tool accessible to every company. SLG is 
an evaluation model that allows to establish the level of maturity of a company through the use of consolidated metrics 
in the literature. The SLG is divided into two parts, the first one collects the values of a set of 20 performance indicators 
specifically selected for the industrial sector to which the company belongs, and in the second part a questionnaire is

4. Conclusions 
The combined use of the Lean and Green production systems is a trend and has aroused the interest of many authors. 
However, Lean/Green maturity assessment models are at an early stage and need further study to provide a reliable 
response for the companies. 
 
The SLG model makes an important contribution to this area of research by presenting a set of metrics that are easy 
to implement by companies of different sizes and industrial sectors. The SLG metrics are based on the literature and 
the model recommends that its can be validated by specialists. The small number of metrics as well as the simple set 
of variables that compose them makes possible the adoption of the SLG model by a wide set of companies. 
 
The online platform that is presented in this study makes possible the use of SLG, since this model uses calculations 
with a higher level of complexity, which increases the reliability of the model, but makes it difficult to use it without 
a support tool. The radial graph that the platform generates also allows the quick visualization of the critical points 
that the company must address in order to increase its level of Lean/Green maturity. 
 
For future studies we suggest improvements in the tool interfaces, to make its use easier and more intuitive. In addition, 
together with the radial graph, the tool can provide indications about what needs to be improved for the company 
reaches the next level of maturity, according to the result obtained through the analysis. Evaluations of both the SLG 
model and the platform should be conducted through case studies in companies of different sizes and industrial sectors 
to bring to light possible failures and make possible the improvement of both.

Abstract 
Waste is now considered a valuable resource and the waste management call is shifting from waste 
disposal to waste utilization and resource management. In order to achieve the call for waste utilization, a 
number of players are involved in the waste management arena. This study analyses the strategies for 
incorporating the informal waste collectors (IWCs) into a formalized systems. A number of studies 
suggesting the integration of the informal waste collectors into formalized systems were analyzed. The 
study provides evidence that in most developing economies, waste recovery is performed by the informal 
waste sector (IWS) and that there is need to integrate the IWS into formalized systems. Suggested 
strategies attributing an engineering management approach are identified. Further, the studies indicate 
that, there is need for an empirical research on the strategies for integrating the informal waste collectors 
into formalized systems from an informal waste collector‚Äôs perspective.

1. Introduction
In developing economies, waste recovery is an activity mainly performed by the informal waste sector. It consists of 
different categories of groups and all serving the purpose of resource recovery. Appropriately 2% of the urban 
population work in the informal waste sector in middle and low income economies (GIZ, 2011). In the society, the 
sector has contributed to the creation of recycling norms and initiated the development of recycling practices at 
household levels (Zen and Siwar, 2015). Most of the waste recovery and recycling is through the IWS in developing 
economies (Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata, 2012). Although the IWS is the key player in the recovery of recyclable and 
reusable waste, limited amounts of municipal waste are recovered and recycled (Buenrostro and Bocco, 2003). 
According to the World Bank (2012) only 4% of municipal solid wastes (MSW) are recovered. Even though the 
recovery rate is significantly low, the IWS continues to play a major role in sustainable resource recovery and 
recycling. They contribute to resource utilization and therefore looking up for the future generations. Despite this, 
little recognition has been given to the IWS. In Egypt state government recognition of the IWS resulted in 74.3% of 
waste been recycled by IWS in 2006 as compared to 10.6% recycled by the formal sector (Wilson et al, 2009). 
Recognition of the informal waste sector can result in an increase to resource recovery and therefore contributing to 
sustainable solid waste management.  
Several studies have focused on the IWS and waste recovery. Integration of the IWS into formalized systems has 
been suggested by some authors. The integration of the IWS has been suggested as a method for waste management 
overall costs reduction for the formal sector (Masood, 2013; Wilson et al, 2009; Matter et al, 2013; Velis et al, 
2012). Others have focused on frameworks for integrating the IWS with the formal sector (Davis et al, 2006; Velis 
et al, 2012; Paul et al, 2012; Wilson et al, 2012; Masood, 2012; Tsai, 2008; Wang et al, 1997). Recognition of the 
importance of the IWS to resource recovery was highlighted in these studies. However, most of these studies 
focused on framework design and used qualitative approaches and hence suggested strategies for integrating the 
informal sector into a formalized system.  
Most of these studies have suggested strategies for integrating the informal waste collectors into formalized systems. 
Even though these strategies have been suggested, most of the informal waste collectors have not been integrated

number of intervention strategies for incorporating the IWS into formalized systems. Examination of the 
recommended strategies indicates that most of the studies focused on strategies to be implemented by other 
stakeholders as consideration and beneficiation of the informal waste sector. Wilson et al (2006), Atienza (2010), 
Gunsilius (2012) Medina (2002) suggested organization of the IWS.  Gutberlet (2008) and Sembiring and 
Nitivattanon (2010 Storey et al (2015) suggested that formation of partnerships with other stakeholders would 
contribute to sustainable resource recovery. Atienza (2010), Medina (2002) and Gunsilius (2012) highlighted law 
enforcement and political support as intervention strategies. Matter et al., (2013) and Storey et al (2015) indicated 
separation of waste at source as the intervention strategy. Other studies suggested training, formation of information 
platforms and many other strategies. Implementation of these strategies can benefit the informal waste sector. 
Nevertheless, the methodology used in the formation and conclusion of these strategies is purely qualitative and 
isolates the quantitative proof of the informal waste sector.  
Analysis of the strategies from an engineering management perspective, a number of studies suggested strategies 
from that perspective. Gutberlet (2008), Chaturvedi (2011), Sembiring and Nitivattanon (2010), Atienza (2010), 
Storey et al (2015) and Fei et al (2016) recommended strategies such as; sustainability: long term perspective, 
producer responsibility, packaging reduction, Collection and channelization mechanism; secondary raw material 
quality improvement; Appropriate technology; Economic and technical assistance; Continuous collection of reliable 
data on recyclable waste; Training; Price Advantage; information platforms setups and recycling systems layouts 
optimization. These strategies have an engineering management perspective to achieve sustainable waste recovery 
and management if properly implemented.  
Engineering concepts such as reverse logistics can be designed for the recovery of waste. However, integration 
between the formal and informal waste sector as well as the community and manufacturing industries should be 
established in order for the recovery system to be sustainable. Further, the identified engineering strategies can be 
incorporated in the recovery system of waste using engineering concepts of reverse logistics.  
 
5. Research Gap 
A number of strategies regarding informal waste sector integration have been recommended together with workable 
frameworks. However, most of these studies developed these strategies in isolation of the voice of the informal 
waste sector. The methodology used was purely qualitative and did not focus on the IWS as the main respondents to 
the suggested strategies. Therefore, the next studies should develop workable and quantifiable questionnaires based 
on some of these strategies and empirically assess the informal waste sector. Further, future research should focus on 
designing recovery systems that integrate the engineering solutions to the constraints faced by the IWS in the 
recovery of waste.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The benefit of integrating the informal waste sector into formalized systems is for all stakeholders. In order to 
achieve sustainable recovery and maximize on resource utilization, waste management stakeholders; service 
providers, service users and local authorities should properly and carefully implement these suggested strategies. 
During the implementation of these strategies, it is important that the views of all stakeholders are considered for 
effective and workable solutions. The informal waste sector should not be isolated in decision making as they are the 
major waste recoveries and recyclers in developing economies.  
Therefore, the identified strategies from an engineering management perspective should be considered during the 
formation of questionnaires for investigating sustainable strategies for incorporating the IWS into formalized 
systems. Once the strategies are designed into a questionnaire, they should be empirically analyzed so that, there 
placement in the integration system is validated.

Abstract 
Plastic solid waste (PSW) recycling can lead to sustainable resource utilization and reverse logistics is a 
concept that can enable the recovery of this waste type in the supply-chain. In developing economies, 
informal waste recovery is predominant and in need of recycling and reverse logistics systems to enable 
sustainable recoveries. The paper analyses studies that have focused on recycling and reverse logistics 
(RLs) as a way to determine the significance of this relationship to sustainable resource utilization and 
waste management. The study has identified a number of merits in implementing reverse logistics 
systems and these can benefit the developing economies. Nevertheless, most of the studies analyzed have 
been conducted in developed economies were plastic waste recycling and reverse logistics are in 
existence. The study identified no studies on reverse logistics and plastic recycling in Africa and therefore 
recommended that more research is needed on this topic to enable plastic manufacturing companies and 
waste managers make sustainable decisions and systems.

1. Introduction
Plastic materials have captured the manufacturing industry because of their favorable properties. These properties 
have enabled the production of many products out of plastic materials. However, the manufactured plastic products 
continue to increase the amount of waste generated and there is need for proper management and disposal of this 
waste type (Ferri et al., 2015). The continuous use of plastic materials in the packaging industry has resulted in more 
virgin resources been used and solutions to prevent the diminution of the virgin resources is needed. Production and 
usage of numerous million tons of plastics as packaging materials happens every year (Blanco, 2014; Papong et al., 
2014.). Approximately 50% of manufactured plastic products are utilized for single disposable applications 
(Hopewell et al 2009).  As such, there is a rapid increase in the amount of plastic solid wastes (PSWs) produced as 
most plastic products‚Äô life is short.  
RL is an engineering management concept which has been used in the recovery of end-of-use or end-of ‚Äìlife plastic 
products by manufacturing companies. It is described as a means of assisting firms perform, resulting in the 
recovery of materials that were once generated as waste while  helping in the reduction of societal and 
environmental  impacts (Santos et al, 2014; Chaves et al., 2014). Increased public awareness on environmental 
preservation combined with waste opposing ideas and raw materials scarcity are among the factors for RL systems 
development (Fehr et al, 2010). These developments are planned as environmental concerns and economic motives. 
As a result, a lot of firms have been encouraged to explore on the product recovery and take backs as a way forward 
to sustainable management of waste. 
RL and waste management relationship activities on waste focus on recycle, reuse and proper disposal in the reverse 
distribution channels (Kinobe et al, 2015). Due to this, recycling is one of the options considered sustainable for 
managing plastic solid waste. It is considered one of the best options in the waste management hierarchy. Recycling

The study has shown that most of the reviewed studies on reverse logistics have designed networks for RLs using 
mathematical programming for the purpose of maximizing returns or minimizing costs. However, in developing 
economies, few studies have been conducted on RLs in the plastic industry and therefore the study has identified the 
way forward for future researchers.  
The benefits of reverse logistics systems and recycling can proof sustainable and provide a number of solutions to 
the challenges of managing waste faced in developing economies. Incorporating RLs in the manufacturing and 
waste management sector can reduce disposal capacity at the landfills, lessen emissions from dumpsites, reduce 
expenditures on collection and energy utilization, reduce litter and provide more jobs to the people involved in the 
recoveries. The research has also shown that more studies on reverse logistics and recycling systems are needed in 
developing economies of Africa.  
However, it is important that waste managers and manufacturers understand that the implementation of such systems 
is not easy. An understanding of the needed outcomes from the system is necessary before the actual 
implementation. It is vital to identify the needed players in the recovery programs in order to optimize the recovery 
of the PSW. In developing economies, where most of the waste is recovered by the informal sector, it is necessary to 
consider the incorporation of the informal waste sector in the recycling and reverse logistics systems to enable 
sustainable recoveries.

Abstract. 
The purpose of the present study case was to determine the best feasible solution for a typical load allocation 
problem with different constraints associated with the technical conditions of the case. The model proposed 
intends to maximize the profits when transporting the loads, by an adequate transport plan, according to the 
capacities of the vehicles, the characteristics and the demand of the loads. Taking into account the 
magnitude of the problem and its computational complexity, to solve the problem. The Metaheuristic 
Genetic Algorithms were implemented, which allows solving problems of optimization and search. The 
algorithm was developed in Visual Basic for Applications, defining and creating an initial feasible 
population, from which it proceeds to develop the entire evolutionary process associated with the genetic 
algorithm. Finally, the results were compared with those obtained at the GUSEK software, which offers the 
optimal solution for the allocation problem studied. From this comparison, it is evident that the method 
developed in the present research offers feasible solutions very close to the optimal one with a 
computational cost considerably lower than offered by the GUSEK program.

Abstract 
In the light of growing concerns over resource conservation, environmental protection and the 
development of recovery systems, reverse logistics (RLs) has become a key factor for many 
manufacturing companies. If properly implemented, RLs has the potential to contribute positively to 
environmental concerns and economic gains. As more and more plastics products are produced for once 
of use, it has become necessary for plastic manufacturing industries to develop RLs systems for their end-
of-life products in order to reuse, recycle or remanufacture them. An examination of the drivers that 
influence the implementation of reverse logistics from the producer‚Äôs perspective was conducted in the 
plastic manufacturing industry. A survey of PET beverage companies in Zambia was conducted focusing 
on environmental concerns, economic gains and government legislations as drivers of analysis. A 
structured questionnaire was administered to mangers of the selected companies and a decision matrix 
was used to averagely rank the companies‚Äô drivers according to their preference. Analysis of the 
questionnaires indicated the following RL drivers as having the most influence towards RL 
implementation in the PET beverage companies; decreasing waste production, getting prepared for future 
legislations, environmental regulations and directives and national legislations.

1. Introduction
The estimated global production of plastics for 2013 was 299 million tons representing a 3.9% increase over the 
2012 output (Gourmelon, 2015). Smithers Pira Organization (2012) indicates that, by 2017, 19.1 million tons of 
Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) packaging is forecasted to be consumed globally. The increase in plastic 
production results in a proportional increase in the amount of end-of-life plastic products. Consequently, these end-
of-life plastic products become solid waste and immediate actions are needed to manage them. Reverse Logistics 
(RL) is one of engineering management concepts used to sustainably recover end-of-life products. It involves 
planning, controlling and implementing of the backwards movements of packaging, finished goods, raw materials 
and/or in process inventory from use, manufacturing or distribution points to proper disposal or recovery points (De 
Brito and Dekker, 2004). It is a concept that is linked to waste management. The reverse logistics relationship with 
waste management in the reverse distribution channel involves activities such as proper disposal, recycling and 
reuse of waste (Kinobe et al, 2015).  
With the current rate of plastic manufacturing and the anticipated plastic waste generation, it is necessary that plastic 
manufacturing companies design reverse logistics networks in order to recover their materials for recycling purposes

4.3 Government Legislations  
 
Figure 4 depicts government legislations results. These indicate that, most companies have implemented reverse 
logistics because of the national government regulations. It means sense that companies compel with existing 
country legislations before compelling with the international legislations. Legislations are fundamental in 
influencing countries and companies to implement recovery programs and reverse logistics systems. Xevgenos et al 
(2015) affirms that countries such as Germany had existing legislations on the recovery of packaging waste before 
the establishment of the packaging and packaging waste (PPW) directive in the European countries. Therefore 
companies in Kitwe have indicated that, existing legislations have influenced their recovery programs.

4.4 Decision Matrix Results 
 
A decision matrix was used to verify the results from the questionnaire. Economic gains attributes, environmental 
concerns and government legislations attributes were tabulated and each criterion was given a score. The most 
influential criteria were assigned a score of 4 while the least preferred was assigned a 1. Table 2 depicts an average 
analysis of the results from the four companies that participated in the study.  
Analysis of the results from the decision matrix indicates, environmental concerns drivers with the attribute of 
Environmental regulation and directives had the highest ranking of 4 while international legislations, pressure from 
stakeholders and decreasing the use of raw materials had the lowest ranking.

5. Conclusion  
 
The rise in the amount of end-of-life PET bottle waste production continues and without establishment of strategies 
to recover this waste, environmental degradation will continue as well as losing valuable resources. In developed 
economies a number of strategies have been put in place to manage PET bottles and manufacturers‚Äô of this end-of-
life plastic bottle are mandated to develop systems for recovering this waste type. Reverse logistics is an engineering

management concept that has been implemented in a number of industries in developed economies. However, the 
implementation of RLs systems is influenced by a number of drivers.  
This study has identified economic gains, environmental concerns and government legislations drivers that have 
influenced PET beverage companies to implement RLs systems in Zambia. The identified drivers will prove useful 
decision making information for a number of companies in developing economies that need to develop RLs systems. 
The fact that most of waste recovery is performed by the informal sector, the result from this study will enable small 
to medium enterprises consider establishing RLs systems. 
The decision matrix has strategically ranked the attributes of RL drivers according to the preference of the 
companies and this information provides a useful platform for companies in the plastic industry as well as other 
industries.

Abstract 
This work aimed to study the Environmental Agenda in Public Administration - A3P in two public 
institutions in Brazil: Federal Institute of Tocantins ‚Äì IFTO and Technological Education Federal Center ‚Äì 
Cefet/RJ. A3P implementation is intended to insert an Environmental Management system, mitigating risks 
of loss in public assets and natural resources waste. In addition, it proposes new management approach 
encouraging environmental education. Environmental Agenda in Public Administration - A3P encourages 
Civil Servants to embody environmental management principles in their daily activities saving natural 
resources, reducing public spending through the more rational use of public goods and proper residues 
management. This work can contribute as a source of information about topic, whose publications still are 
scarce in the country, thereby encouraging the adoption of A3P in other Brazilian public institutions.

Although it still does not meet all the thematic axes of PLS, CEFET/RJ has taken great steps in this direction. 
As in all work involving environmental education and, consequently, a change of behavior, the results will appear in 
the long term; Therefore, the importance of persisting in the pursuit of objectives and periodically monitoring the 
processes. With regard to CEFET/RJ, it is noted that the institution is willing to react positively to the proposal, having 
as responsibility to maintain good practices in all its pillars of action - teaching, research and extension. In this way, 
CEFET/RJ, as well as all educational institutions, must invest in the training of professionals who become aware 
citizens for the better quality of life. 
5. Final Considerations
Much of the waste that goes to landfills and dumps is made up of materials that can be recycled or reused, a 
feature very common in societies that have not yet adopted effective policies for the preservation of the environment 
and social actions that promote the generation of Income opportunities and social inclusion of those working in dumps. 
When considering the selective collection, as an alternative that induces the development of the activity of recycling 
of waste, that seeks to minimize the environmental impacts and that promotes social equity in opposition to the high 
polluting potential of the garbage and the situation of social degradation of the families that survive from collecting 
materials' disposal, a practice of sustainability is configured, under the three spheres: social, environmental and 
economic. 
It is worth mentioning the inexhaustible source of debate, justifies the exploration of the subject, as a new 
niche, which needs professionals prepared for good administrative practices. Thus, every demand that emerges has as 
a condition sine qua non the need to be studied to provide more information, classify it, characterize it and adapt it to 
the current molds used in public organizations. 
Throughout both IFTO and Cefet/RJ case studies it can be inferred how public management could be directed 
towards a more sustainable future. Although major obstacles in the development process of the program are the 
behavior of resistance to change, inherent to the human being, who in such an attitude institively intends to protect, 
considering the comfortable situation, and the safety of not throwing himself in Still unknown situation susceptible to 
failure. Often, the difference between failure and success lies in knowing how to realign expectations, that is, in 
adapting strategic plans. 
It is necessary, control that the results do not stop, due to lack of continuity in the technical qualification of 
the managers and collaborators, or lack of strategic vision to formulate the critical analysis necessary to evaluate the 
results and use of the indicators to feedback the cycle of Planning and realignment of decisions. Therefore, the problem 
is not only to define how to do, that is purely managerial, with definition of the action plan and its follow-up, but to 
identify what should be done to improve, plan and control. 
The issue addressed is undoubtedly extremely important, given the high demand for new sustainability 
practices, and the application of viable means of allying the principles of public administration, such as economy, 
efficiency, among others, with day-to-day management practices Administrative, as well as the lack of further studies 
in the area, helped to delimit the topic addressed in the present study. 
The use of the A3P Program, which aims to stimulate public managers to incorporate principles and criteria 
of social and environmental management into their routine activities, leading to the saving of natural resources and 
the reduction of institutional expenses through the rational use of public goods, waste management, sustainable 
bidding and the promotion of awareness-raising, training and quality of life in the work environment, extracting the 
need to evaluate the administrative practices applied and whether the proposed results are being achieved.

Abstract 
This paper aims to present Business key concepts contributing to Engineering courses development. 
Therefore, as multiple case study, Mud Runner BAJA SAE team and Equipe Venturi AERODESIGN SAE 
projects, at well-known and respected Brazilian Public higher education institution, CEFET/RJ. Teams 
were facing up to competitions promoted by Society of Automotive Engineers ‚Äì SAE, and this study was 
developed during 2015 and 2016. The fieldwork was carried out through participant observation teams over 
three semesters. Thus, it was intended to show how strategic management, quality management and people 
management, working as management tripod driver, can influence and add value to these team performance. 
The collected data and experience may be well used not only in Brazilian scenario but also worldwide.

possessed Engineering students. In this way, the projects have expanded the intellectual capital of its staff and have 
gained new and versatile skills, essential for extension to respond to the demands of the environment, survive and 
develop over time. 
Regarding the national competition held by SAE, the Mud Runner team in 2017 is the best BAJA team in the 
State of Rio de Janeiro and is in the top 15 in management in the National competition today, leaving the 40th position 
in 2015 and increasing 25 positions in management . In relation to the national competition of SAE for AERODESIGN, 
there is no individualized note for the annual improvement of the management in aeromodelling teams. Thus, even 
the final report of the project having topics on the evolution of the management performed in the team, it is not possible 
to establish a correlation between the note of the report and the development of the management of the air project. 
It is possible to conclude that the project aimed to present, through the Case Studies of the Venturi 
AERODESIGN SAE aerospace team and the Mud Runner BAJA SAE motorsport team, CEFET / RJ engineering 
extensions, the contributions of strategic management, quality and applied personnel To engineering teams, in addition 
to exposing the applicability of management tools for decision making, which, when practiced, provide a clearer, more 
objective and systemic view of the extensions and their processes. It is recommended, for future studies, that the 
administrative modernization project be continued through new team monitoring and development work, in order to 
continue generating process optimizations and improvements in the management of the CEFET / RJ engineering 
extensions.

Abstract 
The environmental crisis, pattern of unbridled consumption associated with intensive production model in 
natural resources usage provokes deep transformations in Nature, as well as the mindset of green thinking 
and acting, bringing enlightenment to Sustainable Development concept. For instance, the afore mentioned 
topic becomes the global agenda. This scenario is not apart from universities: this fact does not apply only 
including environmental subjects in curricula, but also in rethinking campuses daily operations and their 
adaptation to sustainability parameters. In this sense, the present article aims to discuss the relevance of 
including the environmental dimension in management action plan on university campuses, pursuing a 
convergence with main governmental and nongovernmental recommendations. Therefore, this 
bibliographic research, in qualitative and exploratory basis, intend to present a global environmental state 
of art towards a Brazilian viewpoint.

administrative and operational routines of higher education institutions. In this sense, understanding that this 
discussion does not end easily, we seek to contribute with reflections that, in synthesis, point to the need to understand 
that the results need to be perceived, not only in the economic effects directly related to the campuses, but in a more 
profound and In the long run, to naturalize the commitment of the university community regarding the results of its 
present environmental actions and their impacts on the future of the planet and the next generations.

Abstract 
A small calcination company is starting up in Zimbabwe. The main challenge at the company is the 
abatement of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions. There are 2x3 tonne kilns that have just started 
operating and are releasing flue gases directly into the air. Data was collected through visits to the 
calcination plant and interviews of key personnel. Research into how CO2 can be removed from the 
flue gas before it can be released into the air was carried out with specific reference to the plant. The 
results showed that environmental sustainability is achievable by minimising the emissions of CO2 into 
the environment and reducing energy and material inputs. Addition of chimneys to the kilns will 
increase draught column and preheating of limestone hence raw materials utilisation will improve. 
Addition of an exhaust will make collection of CO2 more convenient. As the flue gas is collected it is 
made to pass through an amine system that then captures CO2. The collected CO2 will be sold to 
companies that use it as a raw material. Addition of vermiculite insulating material between the brick 
layers will improve insulation and energy is utilised. Steel reinforcements to the kilns will extend their 
life span as well.

1. Introduction
1.1 Calcination 
Calcination is essentially the process of converting (by burning) limestone into lime. It results in quicklime, 
Calcium Oxide. Hydrated lime or Calcium Hydroxide is produced by reacting quicklime with sufficient water to 
form a dry white powder. The residue is called quicklime or caustic lime. Pure quicklime is white and amorphous 
or crystalline. The specific gravity is 3.2 and melting point 25780C (Brady G. S., et al, 2002). Lime is employed 
by a wide range of industries for innumerable uses. It is used widely used in the following industries: steel industry, 
waste water, cleaning of industrial gases before they are released into the air, paper, paint, ink and plastic industry, 
cement manufacturing, sugar refineries and gold refineries. 
1.2 Background ‚Äì JMK Trading Company 
In Zimbabwe many companies in the industry are slowing down even shutting down due to a number of challenges 
and mainly the economic challenges facing the country. However a new company, JMK Trading (JKMT), has 
just started up in Gweru. The main line of production is the Calcination of Limestone producing limestone. The 
company employs 20 people at full capacity and all reporting to 1 manager and owner of the company. The main 
challenge at JKMT is the emissions of Greenhouse gases. There are 2 x 3 tonne kilns, shown in Figure 1. As seen 
in the picture these gases are being released into the air directly. There are no measures in place yet to mitigate 
the greenhouse gases that are being emitted directly into the air. (Mashavakure, 2016)

aminoethyl) piperazine (AEP) solution emerged as a new absorbent (Choi J.H., et al, 2016). AEP is a cyclic amine 
that includes a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary amino group in a molecule. The AEP molecule exhibits 
desirable physical properties, such as a high boiling point (218-222oC), low vapor pressure (0.05 hPa at 22oC) and 
good solubility in water (fully miscible). It has been proposed that an innovative blend of piperazine (PZ) with 
AEP exhibited superior absorbency for CO2 capture (Du Y., et al, 2013). Aqueous PZ/AEP showed high CO2 
loading and stable degradation resistance without the precipitation problem of highly concentrated PZ. The CO2 
absorption characteristics of an aqueous AEP solution, which features primary, secondary, and tertiary amino 
groups, were studied by comparing the solution to the representative commercial amine, MEA. The results at 60oC 
showed that AEP exhibits 2.2-fold greater CO2 loading than MEA. AEP exhibits all the characteristics of primary, 
secondary, and tertiary amines. Three different amino groups in the AEP reacted with CO2 in following the order: 
primary greater than and secondary greater than tertiary. The AEP exhibited excellent CO2 absorption 
characteristics, including CO2 loading and the absorption rate. Additionally, AEP also exhibited high stability for 
thermal degradation compared with MEA. Therefore, AEP could be expected to replace MEA as an absorbent. 
Nonetheless, additional research is still needed to replace the absorbent as physical properties, oxidative 
degradation, nitrosamine formation, foaming potential, mass transfer under absorber conditions and CO2 cyclic 
capacity (Choi J.H., et al, 2016). 
2.10 Compression of the CO2 
After capture, the high CO2 content stream need to be transported for geological storage or for CO2 utilization 
(Leung D. Y. C., et al, 2014). In all cases CO2 is required at high pressure in order to be transported. Ship transport 
requires liquefaction. The CO2 is only at moderate pressure, e.g. 0.6 MPa (although it has to be compressed as 
part of being liquefied) ( Feron P.H.M., et al, 2005). The purpose of CO2 capture is to produce a concentrated 
stream of CO2 at high pressure that can readily be transported. In principle, the entire gas stream containing low 
concentrations of CO2 could be transported and injected underground (geological storage), energy and other 
associated costs generally make this approach impractical. It is, therefore, necessary to produce a nearly pure CO2 
stream for transport and storage (Manovic V., et al, 2009).  
3. Conclusion: Proposed Solutions to JMK Trading Company 
3.1Energy & Material Utilisation and CO2 Capture 
The most urgent requirement at JMK trading company is taking care of the environmental concerns. These will 
be achieved by minimising the emissions of greenhouse gases into the environment and aiming at reducing energy 
and material inputs. 
1. Addition of chimneys to the kilns. This will increase draught column hence preheating of limestone 
as shown in Figure 14. The energy and material utilised will then reduce while achieving the same 
output. Figure 16 is also showing the exhaust, when this is added to the kilns the capture of the flue 
gases, hence CO2 becomes much more convenient. As the flue gas is collected it is made to pass 
through an amine system. Amines will react with the CO2 to form water soluble compounds. Thus 
CO2 is captured from the stream with a low CO2 partial pressure. This technique will produce a 
relatively pure CO2 stream. AEP solution is giving hope of better CO2 absorption properties, but 
more work is still being done on its physical properties. At this time Amines systems would work 
the best.

Abstract 
Most Micro Hydro Power Systems (MHPS) in developing countries, are not delivering their best 
possible power output due to sub-optimal design and construction of their various components. For 
existing MHP plants the turbine is much more adaptable to retrofit than any other part of the MHP while 
keeping the overall project cost per kilowatt produced within acceptable range. Therefore this becomes 
a feasible cost effective strategy to improve the efficiency of a hydro- turbine with the effect of 
improving the overall efficiency of the system. This research showed that the main factors that affect 
efficiency of Pelton wheel turbines, which are commonly used in Southern Africa, are the fabrication 
processes; material used; the control of the water jet movement and flow rate. The fabrication process 
and the material used determine the roughness of the turbine produced. The roughness determines the 
friction which in turn affects the efficiency of a turbine. Current fabrication processes were compared 
to other processes such as laser and electron beam cutting and welding, pressure die casting, investment 
casting and milling. These processes and use of stainless steel resulted in the least rough finish. This 
gave an overall increase of 20 ‚Äì 25% on the turbine efficiencies.

1. Introduction
In Southern Africa, rural areas are not connected to grid electricity. In such areas perennial rivers Micro-Hydro 
Power Plants (MHPP) are an attractive option for providing electricity. In the construction of micro-hydro power 
plants in developing countries, Pelton and Cross-flow turbines are predominantly used. This is because these 
turbines are cheaper to construct and require less specialisation compared to other types of turbines. A Non-
Governmental Organisation based in Zimbabwe is currently working on the development of ten micro hydro 
power plants for different rural communities in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi. For the construction of 
these micro-hydro schemes, the organisation designs and fabricates Pelton wheel turbines whose efficiency is 
estimated to be 60%.  At this percentage turbine efficiency micro-hydro schemes seem to be underutilising 
resources hence engineers working on these micro hydro schemes have suggested that these turbine efficiencies 
can be improved while the micro-hydro projects remains financially viable. It is known that in a micro hydro 
scheme the turbine has the lowest efficiency, compared to other components. Therefore, improving turbine 
efficiency has the best chances of improving the overall efficiency of the whole micro-hydro system. 
2. Literature Review
2.1 Introduction to Micro-Hydro Power Systems 
Hydro power is the harnessing of energy from falling water, such as water falling through steep mountain rivers. 
The energy in flowing water is converted into useful mechanical power by means of a water wheel or a turbine. 
The mechanical power from the turbine can be converted into electricity using an alternator or a generator. A 
hydro power system is classified as micro when it generates power less than 100kW. MHPS are relatively small

for MHS. This is because they are alloys of Copper which is a very expensive metal. Its price is about $8 per kg. 
(Metalcorp, 2012) 
 
Aluminium has a price close to Stainless Steel and the lowest roughness, but is susceptible to damage if debris 
such as stones and sand find their way to the turbine. This is because it has the lowest hardness.  The roughness 
of Grey Cast Iron is too high. This compromises the turbine efficiency despite having a low price and a fairly high 
hardness. 
 
4.2 Performance Measurements 
After the turbine has been set up and the micro hydro is just starting to run, it is of utmost importance to measure 
the efficiency of the turbine in order to verify if it is meeting the expected efficiency. This is done using a 
tachometer. This is done at the initiation of a project and after it has run for six months to check if all is performing 
as expected. During the period of study the tachometer was used to check the performance of the turbine at Site 
B where the project had been running for six months.  
 
4.3 Effect of Increasing Turbine Efficiency on the Micro Hydro Scheme Power Output 
Turbine manufacturers who use manufacturing processes that give the least roughness possible using Stainless 
Steel supplied quotations and their superior Turbine efficiencies. Two MHPS being constructed by the NGO were 
analysed further looking at the change that these turbines will bring in terms of the power output. The change in 
actual power output due to increase in turbine efficiency of the two MHPS that were studied is shown in the Table

In both cases there is a remarkable increase in power output coming from the same resources. MHS are small 
projects that are usually donor funded. Therefore using the materials and manufacturing processes that give the 
highest possible yield from each site and resources is most ideal. The prices of turbines in the quotations supplied 
were such that the project costs remained within the budgets. 
5. Conclusion & Recommendations 
This study has revealed that turbines of better efficiencies can be manufactured, made available for MHS and the 
projects remain financially viable. This was achieved through the comparison of current fabrication methods used 
at the NGO to methods used by different suppliers of turbines. Even though the better efficiency turbines are more 
expensive than the ones being used currently the overall benefit is clear. More electricity is generated hence the 
cost per unit kW actually decreases making the projects even more viable. The financial viability of a project was 
determined by the project cost per kilowatt produced. Use of better efficiency turbines will make it possible to 
harness more electrical power from the same resources. 
 
The NGO is highly recommended to consider investing in processes that produce turbines with higher efficiencies 
such as: 
‚Ä¢ 
Pressure die casting of turbines. They may be cast as whole turbines or as segments made up of a 
number of buckets. 
‚Ä¢ 
Investment casting of whole turbines. 
‚Ä¢ 
CNC milling of Pelton buckets. 
‚Ä¢ 
Cutting of Pelton runner and Cross-flow runner and blades using CNC laser, CNC plasma. 
‚Ä¢ 
Electron beam and laser welding of blades to runners.

These processes offer far less roughness compared to current methods that include sand casting, flame cutting and 
oxyacetylene welding. That reduction in roughness lessens friction and the overall efficiency of a turbine is 
increased.

Abstract 
There is increased recognition of supply chain management (SCM) by organisations globally, in order to 
gain a competitive advantage. The benefits of implementing a structured quality management system are 
well documented. The purpose of the study is to propose a logical approach to evaluating and managing 
risks in the supply chain.  The investigation focused on an exploratory case study approach based in a 
beverage manufacturing organisation.  The study investigates the impact of ISO 9001:2015 on supplier 
performance which leads to customer satisfaction and ultimately organisational performance.  A pilot study 
was conducted as ISO 9001:2015 is a recently revised standard.  The hypotheses were tested using a 
multiple regression analysis and it was found that there is a strong positive relationship between the 
predictor variables and dependent variables.  The results of the regression analysis validates that supplier 
performance and customer satisfaction have a strong impact on organisation performance.  A risk analysis 
was conducted using four phases of the risk management process and no critical risk factors were identified. 
Preventive measures and corrective action plans were implemented for risk factors with a medium to low 
rating.

1. Introduction
The ISO 9001:2015 quality management system is designed to be adapted and applied across multiple sectors of the 
business environment (Norton, 2016).  ISO 9001 was comprehensively reviewed in 2015 and the new requirements 
for compliance were introduced which included ‚Äúrisk-based thinking‚Äù (Chiarini, 2017 and Crute-Morris, 2016). It is 
not just an effective tool for improving processes, but also a reliable method for reducing associated costs and 
improving profit margins.  ISO 9001 has been implemented to a great degree globally, by innumerable organisations, 
particularly in the manufacturing sector with the aim of improving the organisation‚Äôs performance and ensuring 
customer satisfaction (Gryna, Chua and DeFoe, 2015). At a time when global competition is extensively increasing 
and supply chains are becoming expanding and becoming more complex, the probability / likelihood of not achieving 
greater supplier performance is ever increasing as well, due to the risk of supply chain failure (Tummala and 
Schoenherr, 2011). 
1.1 Objectives of the study 
The main objective of the study is to investigate the impact of ISO 9001:2015 on supply chain performance in order 
to improve quality results through supplier relations, supplier evaluation and supplier-customer satisfaction.

The risk factors have been depicted as a chart, in order to monitor and control the highest factors and implement 
preventive measure for future non-occurrences.   Fig. 2 shows that the highest factors are 48 at item numbers 1 and 4.  
These relate to non-conforming products and services from suppliers, and process delay due to insufficient resources, 
respectively.  In order of priority, these factors should be addressed first and corrective action plans put in place.  In 
this regard, supplier underwent a supplier audit to determine the reason for non-conformance.  This is still under 
investigation as this was a pilot study which had been undertaken.  The next highest factors are 40 at item numbers 20 
and 21.  These relates to the lack of sustaining a competitive advantage and lack of customer requirements analysis 
which leads to customer satisfaction, respectively.  This can be attributed to item 1, in which supplier provide non-
conforming products which lead to customer dissatisfaction.  The following risk factors of item 11, 13 and 19 relates 
to accidents and human errors, uncertainty of demand and supply, and competitor pricing, respectively.  These factors 
can have a huge impact on supplier performance and this affects organisational performance.  Risk factors below 30 
were not analysed in detail as it did not have a major impact on supplier and organisational performance.

5. Conclusion 
 
From an academic perspective, the study contributes a conceptual risk assessment framework.  ISO 9001 confirms 
that the supplier organisation is robust and has effective systems deployed for the management of supplier and 
customer needs.  The organisations should build on relationships with suppliers in order to maintain an effective and 
efficient quality management system.  The results of the study shows that supplier who provide raw materials and 
items to organisations, significantly affect the quality of the final product and leads to customer satisfaction. The risk 
management process was an exploratory study conducted in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of 
suppliers focusing on the risks associated within the supply chain.  Poor supply chain performance could lead to poor 
quality of goods and services.

Abstract 
A fundamental requirement for employee satisfaction is a working environment which allows employees 
to perform their work at an optimal level, in a conducive and comfortable environment.   The working 
environment plays an integral role toward employee satisfaction as well as the impact of employee 
satisfaction on productivity.  A causal study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the working 
environment has on employee satisfaction and productivity at a shoe manufacturing factory. Five 
determents of the work environment were considered for the study, which is, working conditions, 
remuneration, training and career development, fairness of treatment and job stability. A questionnaire was 
developed and validated using Cronbach Alpha Coefficient (Œ± = 0.928).  Data was collected using simple 
random sampling to select employees from middle and lower management levels. A total of 212 
questionnaires were distributed. Multiple regression analysis and structural equation modelling were used 
to predict the correlations.   The findings of the study indicated that there is a very strong casual effect 
between the work environment and employee satisfaction which leads to increased productivity.

1. Introduction
All organisations perform their duties with the assistance of resources such as manpower, machines, materials and 
money.  Each of these resources depends on each other for total production to be successful.  Performance of an 
employee usually refers to whether the employee does their job and duties to the best of their ability.  Employee 
performance has proven to have either a positive or negative effect on productivity (Robbins, 2000). Employees play 
a crucial role in an organisation and contribute widely to the production process.  Various factors have an impact on 
employee duties, which in turn affect their overall performance and productivity. Employee satisfaction is not seen as 
the main factor causing individuals to work at different rates (Daniels, 2001).  Employee satisfaction is the positive 
impact of employees toward their jobs or working environments.  Additionally, the determinants of the study include 
work environment, remuneration, training, job security and fairness of treatment.   The responsibility of any institution 
whether it is an large organisation or a small firm, is the ability to attain higher levels of productivity having employees 
as the dynamic operative organisational system. Attitudes of the current employees, whether satisfied or dissatisfied, 
regulate the magnitude at which the organisation possibly will achieve its goal. In light of this concept, it is of

a)
Predictors: (Constant),
b)
Dependent variable: Organisational performance
The coefficient of determination (r2) is an estimate of the percentage variation in the dependent variable (OP) which 
can be predicted from the independent variable (determinants of working environment).  This coefficient demonstrates 
how well the multiple regression model fits the data.  A value close to zero shows a weak fit whereas a value close to 
one implies a good fit.  The r2 ‚Äì value of 0.786 in Table 7, indicates that 78.6% of the variation in (OP) can be 
explained by the predictor variable of employee satisfaction, identified in the regression equation.   
The estimated multiple regression model is given in the regression equation derived from the b ‚Äì values in Table 8 
below:

The beta (Œ≤) coefficients reflected in Table 8, are the values for the regression equation for predicting the dependent 
variable from the independent variable.  The larger beta (Œ≤) coefficient is 0.269, corresponding to productivity 
(independent variable), which means that one standard deviation increase in employees satisfaction, is followed by 
0.269 standard deviation increase in OP.  It is evident that productivity (t = 1.827), has a significant impact on 
organisational performance.  Therefore, based on the above multiple regression analysis, the H3, is supported. 
Therefore; 
a)
every unit increase in the employee satisfaction variable, a (0.125) unit increase in (OP) is predicted while
the other independent variables are held constant.
b)
every unit increase in the productivity variable, a (0.154) unit increase in (OP) is predicted while the other
independent variables are held constant.
5. Conclusion
In view of the research conducted, there is indeed a strong correlation between employee satisfaction and productivity 
on organisational performance.  It was found that the determinants of the working environment have a significant 
impact on employee satisfaction.  Employees whom are satisfied with their jobs, understand the type of impact that 
their performance will have on productivity in the organisation.  Satisfied employees tend to be more efficient and 
motivated to do their jobs, this will lead to enhanced work performance and increased productivity.  Improvement in 
employee work performance, adds value to productivity processes.  The results of the study indicated that employees 
are highly satisfied with their jobs as this was due to good remuneration, fairness of treatment, conducive working 
conditions, greater job security and more training and development. Employees considered the organisation to be

pleasant and comfortable place to work as well greater job satisfaction which led to happier and more productive 
workers.  Greater employee satisfaction levels is the key to success for overall organisational performance.

Abstract 
The study presents an attempt to evaluate the significance of industrial new product development idea generation 
capability supported through the concepts of transformational leadership, strategic thinking, and organizational 
innovation to harness new product development stage and gate process, in a multinational scenario. The current 
research survey is conducted at three selected work locations; The UK, Norway and Finland, having obvious 
differences in terms of product scope, product‚Äôs nature and size, manufacturing requirements, customer base as well as 
the involved stakeholders i.e. energy solutions, marine solutions, environmental sustainability solutions, respectively. 
The results of the study confirmed clear requirement to adopt more than one flexible stage gate models to offer 
focused NPD approach, focused and well defined industrial working processes, less wastage of resources (i.e. time, 
money, and expert skill potential etc.) as well as operational accuracy, control and accountability.

innovation, new product development stage and gate process. 
1. Introduction
Taking lead in introducing innovative products by crafting effective product development processes through 
combining the efforts of collecting new product ideas from external environment (i.e. customers, suppliers, 
competitors, policy formulators etc.) as well as internal resources (i.e. connecting designers, marketers, engineers, 
accountants auditors etc.) is today¬¥s greatest challenge for industries while coping with tough global competition 
(Griffin 1997; Ozer 1997; Ottum, and Moore, 1997). Modern industries, engaged in product development, have 
adopted at least some form of stage-and-gate based new-product processes (Cooper, 1990) to develop and offer new 
products, that are innovative, can resolve major client related issues and promise value to the users by being top 
drivers of industrial success and profitability.  
The quest for new ideas to create exceptional products originates with a deeper level of understanding about the 
customers‚Äô desires. In addition, the traditional NPD model, in which companies are exclusively responsible for coming 
up with new product ideas and deciding which products should ultimately be marketed, is increasingly being 
challenged by innovation management researchers and practitioners (Fuchs and Schreier, 2011; Cone, 2006; Lakhani, 
2006; Pitt et al., 1996; Chesbrough, 2003; Von Hippel and Katz, 2002). This is anticipated that a new product or 
service must hold a ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor or `aha moment` (Dorst, and Cross 2001) by offering something that is missing from 
the range of products already available in the market. However, conceiving such a new product idea seems beyond the 
reach of most of the companies today. 
The above confirms that the entire new product development team (i.e. technical and marketing), in addition to the 
organization¬¥s operational teams must tactfully collaborate, design and lead the new product development strategic 
plan  internally while additionally interacting with the real customers/users, and learn their desires, problem areas, 
needs as well as challenges. The referred strategy is much different from merely depending on the sales and marketing 
teams to obtain market demands and requirements, which is often criticized for being filtered, biased, and incorrect

Abstract 
Organisations in South Africa now, more than ever before, need to introduce Total Quality Management 
(TQM) in their organisational culture to provide outstanding products and services to their customers.  
Although TQM has been introduced to improve organisational performance, it is perceived that some 
organisations have not accomplished much over the years. Achieving results by implementing TQM is 
challenging and depends on (i) leadership, (ii) employee involvement, (iii) customer focus, (iv) strategic 
planning, (v) supplier relations, (vi) process management and (vii) information analysis. These principles 
must be incorporated in the organisational performance measures in terms of (i) quality improvement, (ii) 
product/service quality, (iii) customer satisfaction, (iv) employee satisfaction and (v) supplier performance. 
Current research in both the manufacturing and service industries in South Africa reveals that TQM does 
have an influence on the five organisational performance measures and plays an important role in the 
performance and success of an organisation.  
Keywords 
Total quality management, organisational performance, performance measure, customer satisfaction 
1. Introduction
The impact of global competition is forcing organisations to place greater emphasis on providing customers with high 
quality products and services [Baloyi, 2013] [Dale, 1999] [Edosmwan, 2002]. Consequently, improving the quality of 
products, processes and services is a major challenge facing South African organisations as well as organisations 
worldwide. Many organisations fail because they do not take cognisance of the long-term benefits of Total Quality 
Management (TQM) practices. Organisations do not realise the value of integrating these practices into their daily 
operations.  
Therefore, 
the 
following 
objectives 
have 
been 
developed 
for 
the 
study: 
a)
To design and administer a questionnaire to determine the role and impact of quality improvement, customer
satisfaction, employee satisfaction, product/service quality and supplier performance in the manufacturing
and service organisations, which lead to organisational performance.
b)
To determine the relationship between TQM practices and organisational performance by means of
hypothesis testing.

Abstract 
The main purpose of manufacturing industry is to produce goods economically in order to gain profit and 
be able to deliver products on time. Ineffective and efficient production processes lead to non-current 
production. Lean production systems help companies to be competitive, especially in terms of reducing 
waste (waste) that occurs in their operations. This study aims to reduce production waste in one automotive 
company by using Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM), Waste Assessment Questionnaire (WAQ) and Value 
Stream Mapping (VSM). Activities in the automotive Industry is to design, develop, manufacture, market 
and sell motor vehicles in the world. The three methods are intended to identify and analyze the waste 
(waste) that occurred and make improvements to eliminate waste. From the research results obtained type 
of waste ""form"" is waiting and motion. While the type of waste ""to"" the inventory. The three types of waste 
is the greatest procession to occur in the process of assembly trimming on the production line of Daihatsu 
SIGRA 1.5 L 3NR-Ve, DOHC Dual VVT-i at PT. Astra Daihastu Motor. Then performed the improvement 
implementation by using WRM and VSM method obtained the results of waste efficiency that occurs in the 
type of waste from the motion from 17.65% to 15.75%, waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and lead time down 
from 14.202 minutes to 12.322 minutes in one assembly process trimming. Some suggestions for 
improvements made are the implementation of the FIFO system (First in First Out), Improving changes in 
movement and movement of workers, and line balancing on the assembly line trimming process lines of 
automobile production processes.

process in AT-07 is also done by one worker. Especially for waiting in the area of AT-02 and AT-06 where waiting 
to be processed on AT-03 and AT-07 authors do their own analysis to provide input to the production. The analysis is 
to measure the cycle time between the three work stations (AT-02, AT-03, AT-04) and (AT-06, AT-07, AT-08) to 
determine the actual cycle time of the three operations. From the measurement found that the average CT for AT-02: 
is equal to 0.571 minutes, AT-03: 2,506 minutes and AT-04: 1.125 minutes. The work area of AT-03 and AT-04 is 
done by the same operator so that it works sequence (sequential) from AT-03 process after that just doing assembly 
on AT-04.  
When measuring the time of this cycle the material resulted from the work by the AT-02 process operator must 
wait for AT-03 to complete assembly. Because in fact the standard time for this process is only 2.05 minutes (standard 
time specified by PT Astra Daihatsu Motor). While the CT on AT-06 is 1013 minutes, AT-07: 2.134 minutes, and 
AT-08: 0.673 minutes. AT-07 and AT-08 are performed by one operator so that it is sequenced sequentially. This 
results in waste from one point causing another waste at another point. The AT-07 is still more than the standard time 
set by the company. The conclusion is the work of the operators in all three WIPs at point (AT-06, AT-03, AT-04) 
and (AT-06, AT-07, AT- 08) is not balanced. For that to balance the work of the operator so there is no waiting time 
the authors suggest to combine these three machines with the concept of first in first out or FIFO and Line Balancing 
for the division of workload on each operator so that the system works will be balanced in one line prduksi assembly 
electronic components This car. From the implementation results applied to PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor Training 
Center, the result of the repair of the original waste waiting 15.88% decreased to 13.12%. From the results of these 
improvements on waste reduction and waiting waste impact on the total lead time of this car trimming assembly 
process. Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the 
car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate 
the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 becomes 
the time for 11 assembly process that is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 
4. Conclusions
Based on the results of research with the method of Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM) and Value Stream
Mapping (VSM) can be drawn the following conclusions: 
1. Waste identification result using WRM (Waste Realtionship Matrix) and VSM (Vakue Stream Mapping) method
on assembly trimming process resulted 3 biggest waste that happened that is Inventory, Motion, and Waiting.
2. Waste type ""from"" that is Motion and Waiting has the largest percentage of 17.65% and 15.88% which means that
waste Motion and Waiting if it happens then have a large enough effect to cause other waste that will increase the
production lead time.
3. Waste type ""to"" the Inventory has the largest percentage of 18.24% this indicates that waste inventory is the waste
that most affected other waste.
4. From the improvements made to eliminate waste motion & waiting is by improving the FIFO system (First in First
Out), Improving changes in the movement of workers, and Line Balancing in the assembly trimming process
produces some efficiency such as:
‚Ä¢ Reduced Motion waste from 17.65% to 15.75%, and
‚Ä¢ Waste Waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and
‚Ä¢ Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car
production process.
In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub 
process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 into the time for 11 assembly 
process is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 
5. Recommendations
For future research related to the current research, the authors provide some suggestions as follows: 
1. Preferably the object of research is not only limited to the area of assembly trimming course because this area is
only one of the whole 5 line car production process.
2. Conducted an overall analysis with regard to factors in other production lines because there is a possibility in the
process of production of the car there is another waste that occurs therein.
3. Created simulations with software with several production process scenarios to determine the impact or benefit of
any repair recommendations and for the purpose of saving the cost of checking the improvements made.

Abstract 
Maintenance performance is crucial for the viability of many manufacturing organizations as the 
maintenance status of equipment has a direct impact on manufacturing performance. In turn, the 
manufacturing performance has a colossal effect on business performance generally as many 
manufacturing enterprises‚Äô survival is hinged on manufacturing output. The significance of high 
maintenance performance need no over-emphasis as costs for manufactured goods can spiral out of 
control only because of low equipment reliability. Whether maintenance performance is measured as a 
direct or indirect business objective, it is irrelevant as it can affect manufacturing performance output 
momentously if it goes unchecked. Thus, for equipment intensive manufacturing enterprises, it is 
imperative that the maintenance performance is measured and tracked to prevent any downward trending 
slant. Thus this research was carried out to unravel the significance of measuring and monitoring 
maintenance performance and the value derived from such measurements. The feedback loop to 
performance improvement need to be further pursued to enable consistent maintenance improvement.

1. Introduction
Performance measurement is essential to sustain or improve business performance largely. Oftentimes the 
significance of performance measurement is disdained by many businesses, and more so especially in terms of 
maintenance performance as in some instances, the maintenance function is regarded as a support function to the 
production function. A majority of organizations, especially in South Africa, still regard the maintenance function as 
a cost centre, and not a profit centre, as it should rightfully be regarded as. The detrimental effect of not measuring 
and monitoring the maintenance function performance, and especially the equipment reliability is most times 
realized when it is too late and costly to maintain the equipment for reliability.  
With the prevailing economic doldrums, the worldwide rivalry and the swelling anticipations from consumers, there 
is a distinctive requisite to advance manufacturing performance, and this in a way puts maintenance performance as 
principally pertinent for a business to sustain productivity and profitability (Muchiri, et al. (2011), Van Horenbeek

Figure 5. Plant MTBF graph for a South African Manufacturing Company 
The key observations that were identified concerning the MPM for the South African manufacturing company were 
as follows: 
1.
there was no strategic link between the MPIs with manufacturing and business strategies
2.
there were no resultant action planning documented on MPIs that were trending below targets, this was
noticed on the number of technical stops which were not within the targeted range
3.
on a positive note, the MPIs like MTTR were cascading down to individual equipment levels and that
means not only the overall plant measure was being tracked
4.
Their main focus was on a few key MPIs as depicted on table 1 above and that is where most of the
maintenance resources were channeled towards
5.
There was no categorization of the hierarchical allotment of MPIs
6.
A SAP CMMS system was utilized for managing maintenance information but the data integrity was a
major concern as a lot of critical information fields were not completed, thus discrediting the credence of
the data
7.
The information on the charts was upto date, but some shop floor maintenance team members professed
ignorance on the value of the MPIs
5. Discussion and Conclusion
In essence, the crucial aspect unveiled is that maintenance performance should never be established in isolation from 
the business strategic thrust. Equipment reliability, and therefore maintenance function performance can derail the 
overall business performance if not managed properly through effective performance measurement. Customization 
of performance indicators at various levels of the enterprise will ensure a synchronized business performance with 
all levels contributing their worth.  
Human factors also need to be considered as employee buy-in is essential for the success of the MPM scheme. 
Employee learning and understanding is crucial and many good systems fall through the hands of implementers 
because of lack of understanding of the value derived or benefits attained by embarking on such business processes. 
Leadership commitment is always essential to envision the organization towards the right performance attributes and 
the business leadership need to drive the MPM program. Adequate resources need to be allocated to ensure the 
requisite infrastructure for data collection and analysis is availed at all levels, e.g. CMMS and computers hardware.

Most importantly, the maintenance-performance-measurement system should be migrated to a maintenance-
performance-management system as great value is derived if the system is systematically managed. A deviation 
reporting system should be availed to capture any shortcomings in performance and an action closure loop has to be 
devised to ensure control of all actions necessary for the business to attain its strategic objectives. 
Figure 6. Proposed Feedback loop for maintenance performance management 
The feedback loop will ensure that timely actions are taken to address the maintenance performance issues that can 
prevent the business from attaining its business objectives.  
Lastly, future research activities should be focused more on the management aspects of the maintenance 
performance system and ways to ensure that models are developed for maintenance practitioners to adopt in the 
field.

Abstract 
Industrial equipment‚Äôs reliability is affected by various aspects, but the fact that over 90% of industrial 
equipment utilize rolling element bearings makes the reliability of bearings of crucial significance to the 
overall equipment reliability in industrial plants. One of the major causes of failures for rolling element 
bearings is brinelling. Rotating equipment are prone to the impacts of true and false brinelling, and the 
industrial impact of brinelling has compelled bearing manufacturers to research extensively on ways to 
minimize the impact of brinelling on industrial equipment. Recently, there is an upsurge of patented 
greases and equipment designs all done with the objective to minimize or eliminate the effect of true and 
false brinelling on industrial rotating equipment. This research was carried out to evaluate the measures 
applicable to curtail the effects of brinelling on rotating equipment reliability. Literature review was 
carried out to reveal measures necessary to prevent or alleviate the impact of brinelling on rotating 
equipment and then followed by a survey to ascertain industrial practices relevant to preventing 
brinelling.  
Keywords 
False brinelling, true brinelling, fretting corrosion, indentation, rotating equipment. 
1. Introduction
Equipment under idle conditions such as standby capacity or storage phase are generally located under ‚Äúsafe‚Äù 
conditions all with the objectivity of delivering the equipment in perfect working condition once it is installed or 
called to use. But sometimes premature failure is experienced on equipment that is recently drawn from stores and 
installed in the plant, or when standby equipment is put into operation. Many maintenance practitioners will then 
wonder why ‚Äúnew‚Äù or ‚Äúsafe‚Äù equipment like these fail prematurely in the field. Equipment like electric motors, 
gearboxes, bearing assemblies and pumps are among the multitude of equipment termed as rotating equipment and 
they are prone to such failures.  
 Bearings constitute one of the vital components of all rotating equipment, whose primary purpose is to support the 
equipment and to support the rotary motion of the shafts relative to the motionless construction, and above 90% of 
machineries utilize rolling element bearings (Gupta and Pradhan, 2017:2085). Although inexpensive, the functional 
failure of bearings may result in complete failure of the equipment, thus, their critical position in industrial settings 
as components of high criticality is upheld as their reliability and sturdiness most times dictate the state of the 
equipment (Sehgal et al., 2000: 39). Operational requirements dictate that bearings are imperiled to substantial and

As a major discussion point, storage maintenance and field maintenance for standby equipment was poorly done by 
the companies that that were surveyed, and this signifies that a lot more effort needs to be channeled to appraise 
maintenance practitioners on the menace of brinelling on rotating equipment reliability.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Because of the essentiality of bearings to industrial processes, anything that drastically reduces the bearing life (L10) 
which is depicted by the overall sum of revolutions that a bearing accomplishes fittingly under prescribed 
environments before any failure ensues, should be curtailed in order to improve equipment reliability (Gurumoorthy 
and Ghosh, 2013:111). With relevance to heavy equipment, slight flaking or spalling incurred on the bearing might 
not be reflected as an instantaneous functional failure and the bearing lifespan may be extended with appropriate 
maintenance action, but it may not be so with small bearings (Gurumoorthy and Ghosh, 2013:110).  This research 
has explored one of the phenomenon that affect industrial processes especially in the advent of using quite a number 
of rotating equipment. Brinelling ‚Äì true and false is a phenomenon that is currently affecting industrial operations 
and quite a number of bearing manufacturers are involved with research in pursuit of fighting the problem of false 
brinelling,. These efforts are evidenced by recent patented greases like the SKF patented grease for reducing false 
brinelling by 50% in 2016, and designs in wind turbines to protect the equipment from false brinelling. Further 
studies need to be pursed to find ways to further reduce false brinellling as this failure mechanism is costing 
industries due to reduced equipment reliability in the event of malpractices that excludes maintaining equipment to 
prevent false brinelling. Bearing life need to be extended and all actions that are relevant to improve rotating 
equipment life need to be adhered to.

Abstract 
Global competitiveness has compounded pressure on a lot of organizations to perform in their own local 
markets as competitive products are landing in the markets with enhanced features and competitive 
prices. Many businesses embark on business improvement approaches to extricate themselves from the 
competitive jungle that they find themselves in, by deploying superior or cutting edge methodologies like 
Six Sigma. Six Sigma‚Äôs success in saving companies millions of dollars has been proven for a very long 
time and its relevance as a product differentiator in the product market is still valid currently. The basic 
creeds of Six Sigma are able to carry an organization to competitive advantage if it is successfully 
implemented by an organization and the results are measured as per the methodology. This paper‚Äôs aim is 
to unravel the product differentiation prowess of Six Sigma in the market and its capability to render 
competitive advantage to the business through its performance attributes. A comprehensive literature 
review was done pertaining to the basic tenets of Six Sigma and its applicability in the manufacturing 
industries. Published articles and recent books on Six Sigma were reviewed to extract the dominancy and 
relevance of Six Sigma as a business competitive tool. With many business improvement approaches at 
the disposal of manufacturing organizations, the literature review and case study sought to unveil the 
underlying advantages embedded in applying the Six Sigma approach and why it is still the option of 
choice. Organizational decision-makers are granted a platform to evaluate the Six Sigma practices and the 
limitations posed by ineffective implementation.

1. Introduction
Each enterprise should generate cash in one formula or alternative to remain in business and if the enterprise 
expends further than it earns, then it will go out of business, leaving the task of each business being to become cost-
effective at whatsoever it does so it can stay doing whatever it does, this then pins Six Sigma (SS) experts to learn an 
master the first principle of the S-bar calculation: $! (Munro, 2008). Out of the numerous approaches meant for 
productivity enhancement and cost diminution, LM and SS are widely acknowledged as exceptional due to their 
ability to unswervingly transmit waste alleviation and variability decline as a technique of backing business 
effectiveness and competitiveness (Pacheco et al, 2015:161). The application of SS and Lean Manufacturing (LM)

Noteworthy progress was managed owing to effective application of the SS framework through the business with 
seven projects that were identified and the outcomes exposed that there was strategic expansion, market expansion 
and financial as well as quality successes that were reaped through the key performance metrics such as Process 
Yield, process capability and OEE that were enhanced. The efficacious outcomes of SS application for the chemical 
manufacturing enterprise were recorded as follows:  
ÔÇß
Process yield improved by 7. 85% overall and due to process scrap reduction
ÔÇß
OEE improved by 5.73%
ÔÇß
Process changeover time reduced by 16.42%
ÔÇß
Total cycle time was condensed by 8.79%
ÔÇß
Environmental impact reduction as landfill material was condensed by 10.22%
ÔÇß
Manpower reduced by 3%.
ÔÇß
Customer complaints dropped from 25 Complaints per month to less than 5 per month
ÔÇß
Production rate improved by 11%
ÔÇß
Inventory levels reduced by 6.4%
ÔÇß
Unit cost of chemical product sold dropped by a substantial 14. 35% culminating in 8% reduction in
product price
ÔÇß
Market share rose by a whopping 7.5% in 2016
6. Conclusion
SS is has been deployed efficaciously by organizations that have displayed market leadership for their products, it 
therefore means that any business that meaningfully embarks on SS is setting itself for market or global preeminence. 
SS is a regulated approach and it is branded by the pursuit of the DMAIC and DFSS schemes. Deviation from the 
tenets of the structural approach is tantamount to executional miscarriage of SS. Also, the impact of the application 
of SS was assessed for a chemical manufacturing business in South Africa and the successful implementation of SS 
projects rendered competitive advantages as quality differentiation was realized in the market and the company grew 
in terms of cost effectiveness, delivery performance, customer satisfaction, market share and positively impacting on 
other stakeholders like employees and shareholders.  
Apparently, documented organizations present a conducive atmosphere for SS application than undocumented 
organizations, and in this respect, the business warranted that their ISO 9001 QMS certification was fully exploited 
for guaranteeing the systematic application of SS projects. 
This research signifies that SS is an effective approach in differentiating the businesses‚Äô products in the market and 
that it can be used effectively by any organization to attain competitive advantage in the market place.  
Above all, SS can be compiled into a compendium of enterprise-wide strategic toolbox, to attain organizational 
goals to counteract market threats posed by competitors, and as such, further research into the strategic flexibility of 
SS need to be further pursued to harness its contemporary fit with prevailing strategic thrusts.

Abstract 
Solutions to Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (RCMPSP) were traditionally based 
on priority rules (PR) heuristics, and meta-heuristic approaches such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and 
Evolutionary Strategies are recently proposed. In order to improve performance of these solutions, this 
paper solves the centralized RCMPSP using Priority Rules (PR) heuristics as best-case scenario for GA 
initial population. Using recently improved heuristics, this research analyze 12 well known priority rules 
on 14 different sets of simultaneously scheduled multi-projects commonly found in literature, with some 
generalized characteristics such as activity on node, deterministic durations, limited global resources and 
minimum Total Makespan (TMS) as objective. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the initial population 
performance, experimental results are compared, in terms of TMS and average project delay (APD). 
Analysis results shows that GA approach can lead to better solutions in some cases, in terms of TMS and

The best PRs in terms of TMS, are: MS, MINLFT and EDD. The initial populations of these PRs were used to execute 
AG with the following parameters: 1. Initial population: sequences obtained from each PR, 2. Number of generations: 
500, 3. Number of children per generation: 10, 4. Crossover: 30 %, 5. Inversion: 30%, and 6. Mutation: 40%. However, 
only the first 3 instances for identified PR could be reported, because this is an ongoing research. The results for 
instances 34, 53 and 113 are shown in Table 5.

6. Conclusions, recommendations and future work 
 
6.1 Conclusions 
This study deals with the Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (RCMPSP) and the use of initial populations 
for AG, using solutions commonly found in literature (PR heuristics). In order to improve performance of these 
solutions, this research analyze 12 well known PRs on 14 different sets of simultaneously scheduled multi-projects, 
with some generalized characteristics such as activity on node, deterministic durations, total global resources and 
minimum Total Makespan (TMS) And average project delay (APD) as objectives. 
For TMS, the best PRs are MS, MINLFT and EDD, with TMS averages of 202.00, 202.29 and 203.86 for all 14 
instances. For APD the best PR were MINLFT, MS and EDD with averages of 53.58, 55.02 and 55.29 respectively. 
Finally, for the computational time Tc, the best rules were TWF.EST, WPP and SASP, with 18.06, 18.33 and 18.57 
seconds respectively. 
In general, the best PR, with which all performance measures can be minimized, is MS (Maximum Successors). This 
PR is activity-based, that is, it takes into account the attributes of the activities and not their use of resources. The 
good behavior of this PR in all performance measures is due to the fact that by prioritizing activities with the greatest 
number of successors, it is indirectly given a ""transitivity"" priority to all the activities below the network, reducing the 
possibility of delays. 
As for AG, the results showed a better solution for instance 113, both for MS method and TMS performance measure, 
as for APD and MS, MINLFT and EDD methods. This proves that it is possible to achieve better solutions starting 
from a previous improved initial population, obtained by the best PR according to the goal sought by the portfolio or 
program manager. 
6.2 Future work 
The scope of the study is to improve and analyze the solution performance of different PRs as the initial population 
for GA. However, there are numerous possibilities to analyze that could improve the solutions found. Here are some 
possible future research lines: 
‚Ä¢ 
In case of a tie, the criterion used as a tie breaker is random, but different PRs may be used as a second or 
third rule. These results can then be used to run AG and try to get better solutions.

1209","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bogota, Colombia, October 25-26, 2017 
‚Ä¢
This study used random as a tie breaker (second PR). This case should be analyzed with a larger number of
runs (eg 5,000) to evaluate the variability. These results can be used later to execute AG and improving the
solutions when comparing random as initial population versus the best solution found by PR as initial
population.
‚Ä¢
The analysis was performed with respect to Tc, TMS and APD. It is also important to evaluate the behavior
of PR and AG with respect to other performance measures, such as mean flowtime, number of tardy projects
and number of tardy jobs, as well as the use and distribution of resources.
‚Ä¢
Static models do not represent reality in the best way, so it is necessary to analyze cases that allow times of
transfer of resources, use of local resources, preemption in activities, priorities for activities and projects,
stochastic durations, other types of dependencies, multiple modes, multiple skills, dynamic environments
with different activities and projects arrival dates, and other variants that allow better representation of reality,
developing new heuristics and metaheuristics for them.
‚Ä¢
The parameters used for AG were obtained based on researchers experience, but in order to improve results,
it is necessary to analyze better GA parameters combinations. Likewise, only 3 instances were tried and it is
necessary to continue with 14 instances experimentation.
‚Ä¢
Similarly, and in line with the aforementioned research lines, the impact on the project and program / portfolio
cost (budget) should be analyzed.

Abstract 
A linear programming model for integrated production planning study for methods, procedures and 
practices of a South African bread producing firm. The study considers the entire planning activity in the 
firm as an integrated process involving several closely related functions. The mathematical modelling 
considers production costs, production throughput rates, customer specifications and demands, sales 
process and facility capacities and designs an optimal production planning. The firm produces two 
perishable products that should be stored for fixed periods. There is a series a of vehicles responsible for 
delivering the products from the firm to distribution centers in specific quantities. Computation of results 
and analysis reveals that the integrated methodology is feasible and practical.

1. Introduction
In the past years, managers in the food industry have encountered difficulties and to instantaneously reform, adapt and 
up their game as they were faced with international changes within the food industry, because of safety regulations 
and legislations, advancement in technology, market globalization and emerging quality objectives. Organizations are 
now placed under pressure to improve certain aspects in their businesses such as manufacturing, quality control, 
marketing, etc. Managers need to understand that such changes, need to be accompanied by supply chain management, 
to ensure that the control process does not halt at the manufacture but continues to distribution and after sales firms. 
The goal of supply chain is to efficiently create a link between suppliers, producers, distributors, storage facilities, 
sellers and customers (Liang, 2008), Therefore supply chain integration should provide the end customer with 
maximum value of quality products, while coordinating a balance between requirements of customers with materials 
coming from suppliers, including supply chain issues of designing low cost products, and keeping inventory at a 
minimum. 
This paper takes a supply chain management approach, the paper takes a discussion on the facilities and processes that 
are required in the production and delivery of products from supplier to customers at a bakery that process pita bread 
and wraps. The paper further illustrates Scheduling and management of raw materials, manufacturing, packing, storage 
and distribution services. 
1.1 
The case study. 
The bakery is a supplier of pita bread and Wraps, it also specializes in producing Shawarma‚Äôs and hamburgers. The 
bakery supplies major retail stores, including coffee shops and supermarkets.  
When analyzing the bakery there mainly two areas that stand out, the production area and the distribution Scheduling 
area. Production planning that is carried out by the production manager, addressing and tackling decisions of how to

(figure 3) Suggested Transportation model that contributed to lowest possible fuel costs.  
In regard to figure 3, the Model yields a minimum cost of R 3 100 in relation to the objective function developed (5), 
thus also satisfying RQ3- H3. 
It is noted that within this problem the total supply is 300 + 300 + 100 = 700 and the total demand is 200 +200 +300 
= 700. Therefore, in this case total demand is equivalent to total supply making it a balanced transportation problem.  
5. Conclusion
In this research, we were presented formulations for integrating production planning and distribution Scheduling of 
baked products within a supply chain.  The problems are in relation to the supply chain network (a single 
manufacturing facility and multi delivery centers). There is also a fleet of internal vehicles that is in control for 
transporting the products from facility to distribution centers. In each period of Scheduling, a vehicle can at most make 
a single trip to a distribution center. The produced items are perishable, that is they can be stored for only a fixed 
period. The manufactured capacity is limited and there can be no shortage in distribution centers. The decisions to be 
made in each scheduling period are product quantities, distribution centers that should be visited, and the levels of 
inventory to be delivered. Based on the above a linear programming and a balanced transportation model where 
developed formulated. The proposed method is efficient considering solution for quality and time performance. In 
addition, it can provide robust results. In addition, it is proven that the complexity of the proposed method depends on 
linear multiplication of three parameters, number of distribution centers, vehicles and Scheduling period. The studied 
program also contains some limitations into decision making for other companies within this industry. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the linear programming model for integrated Baking production and distribution Scheduling 
with raw materials considerations, is working well rather than independent production to distribution.

Abstract 
The study presents an attempt to offer a feasibility cum analytical review aimed to suggest the establishment of future center 
at the Ostrobothnia region for energy sector‚Äôs support. The study is formulized on the basis of the method of community need 
assignment as well as the support of the concept of emotional intelligence. The results of the research analysis confirmed the 
potential of establishing of the `Energy Future Center` for the sector‚Äôs uplift as well as sustainability.  
1. Introduction
The current research paper is a feasibility cum analytical review aimed to investigate following research dimensions: 
ÔÇß
Worth of supporting a proposal on the establishment of `Energy Future Center` for Energy Sector of Ostrobothnia,
a region located in Western Finland.
ÔÇß
Ways to achieve attention of small and large scale energy companies to initiate a two way communication process.
To obtain the above research objectives, the author tries to highlight and justify the location of Ostrobothnia as a suitable 
venue for the establishment of innovative Future Center(s). The fact behind selecting the referred region is its vital resources 
[i.e., long term industrial history of the area, existing infra-structure, communicational facilities and the presence of the 
majority stakeholders (i.e., Companies, researchers, funding and regulatory authorities) confirming the area to be the best 
choice.  The paper further throws light on the process of `need assessment` of the Ostrobothnia Energy companies. The core 
idea is to find out the ways to initiate a healthy `Communication Process` on the basis of `contextual intelligence and emotional 
intelligence` to make the message more strong and appealing for the target population. Later, the concepts, relevance, and 
significance of `Future centers¬¥, with regards to the European as well as Ostrobothnia locations will be highlighted on the 
logical ground. In the end, a list of the energy sector companies located in Ostrobothnia, with regards to their size and nature 
of operations are placed. The final stage of the paper helped in arriving at the list of challenges or the areas of interests` for 
the Ostrobothnia Companies to build a strong base for initiating a healthy mutual communicational process.    
2. Ostrobothnia Region and Energy Sector
The region of `Ostrobothnia¬¥ identified as a historically significant region situated in western Finland. It is considered most 
picturesque western coast. This region holds great potential, due to having strong energy sector infrastructural. 
2.1 Strong spread of energy industry 
According to the estimated projected figures, there are more than 120 businesses in the Ostrobothnia region that 
operate as energy technology subcontractor. Furthermore, these energy sector companies are operating with an 
approximated total of 12,000 as their work force, and are contributing to the national economy through a remarkable 
turnover of around 7.5 billion euros.  
      2.2 Research Opportunities in Ostrobothnia Region 
The Area is well served through the strong network of Universities, training centers and research institutes. 
University of Vaasa, VAMK, University of Applied Sciences, Hanken, Vaasa Energy Institute are few prominent 
names to start with.

view the suitability of location, its infrastructure as well as the allied facilities. This fact further supports the communication 
process formulation through the key elements of `emotional intelligence` and `contextual intelligence¬¥ to assess the `Need ` 
of the target population (i.e., Large and Small Energy Companies of Ostrobothnia). 
 
6. Future avenues 
Current research investigation can open following avenues for exploration in future.

Abstract 
When mangoes are consumed or processed, their peels and seeds are generated as waste. The waste is an 
environmental concern, but it is a natural and renewable resource. In this project, a process was developed 
to convert mango seeds into carbonized adsorbents. The effectiveness of mango seed-derived carbon in 
removing a dye from water was evaluated. Water containing methylene blue was treated with mango 
seed-derived carbon.  The concentration of methylene blue in the water before and after the treatment was 
monitored by a do-it-yourself ‚Äúspectrophotometer‚Äù.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
Mangoes are consumed worldwide, and there has been an increasing demand in the past few decades.1 However, 
fruits have the highest wastage rate of all foods.2 A mango‚Äôs peel and seed consist up to forty percent of its total fruit 
weight. Since mangoes are abundant in a multitude of countries, a large amount of waste is produced and difficult to 
dispose of.3 Places such as Africa face economic issues, and do not have sufficient clean water. Nevertheless, Africa 
has become one of the biggest producers of mangoes due to its geographical advantage.4 The mango industry has 
been growing rapidly in many other places as well. In areas like Thailand, mangos are the most popular tropical 
fruit.5 Although Thailand‚Äôs water quality is generally fine, agricultural and industrial pollutants resulting from 
human activity can lead to the deterioration of water quality.6  
One possible solution to the agricultural waste and polluted water issues is to convert mango seeds into activated 
carbon, and use the resulting carbon to remove contaminants from water.  Many past experiments have involved the 
removal of methylene blue from water with materials such as: acorn shells, dehydrated peanut hulls, and tea seed 
shells.13 Equilibrium adsorption, thermodynamic and kinetic study results were compiled from all the experiments 
and indicated that such materials are renewable resources, and can potentially be used as adsorbents for removing 
methylene blue. 
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Absorption Measurement Setup 
The absorption measurement setup consists of a sheet of orange construction paper, a cardboard box, a light source 
and a phone with an installed spectrophotometer app. There were three holes in the box: one to hold the glass vial 
during the measurement, one to restrict light that enters the cardboard box to shine on water solution, and one for the 
spectrophotometer to measure the light going through the water solution. The orange construction paper was folded 
in half and placed behind the cardboard box with a light source facing the paper. The spectrophotometer app 
measures the intensity of red, green and blue components of the light in a specific section of the camera‚Äôs view. The 
amount of absorption in each solution sample can be calculated from the intensity of the red component. The 
absorbance for standard solutions 26.2, 20.0, 15.0, 10.5, 5.20, and 2.60 mg/L were used to generate a calibration 
curve which resulted in the following equation: 
1233","Figure 8. Percent removal of methylene blue in relation to amount of carbon 
4. Conclusion
A carbonization was used to convert mango seeds into carbon at 500 ¬∞C under nitrogen protection.  Two adsorption 
experiments were conducted with changed variables, and the results show that the mango seed derived carbon can 
remove methylene blue from water. Surface atoms of the adsorbent are partially exposed so the adsorbate molecules 
can be attracted. Methylene blue molecules can adhere physically to the surface of the carbon, and are separated 
from water.  
Through the adsorption equilibrium experiment, the results concluded that the solutions with lower concentrations of 
methylene blue became clearer, almost like water. The equilibrium relationship between the amount of methylene 
blue adsorbed per unit mass of carbon (Qe) and the equilibrium concentration (Ce) showed that Qe increases with Ce 
initially, and it gradually levels off.  Eventually when the concentration is so large, the amount of methylene blue 
adsorbed by the carbon stays relatively the same. The carbon has reached its adsorption limit and is no longer able to 
adsorb more methylene blue.  
Through the effect of amount of adsorbent experiment, the data and graphs show that as larger amounts of carbon 
were used in the experiment, more methylene blue was adsorbed, and the water became clearer. As the amount of 
carbon increases, the % removal gets more steady and flat as it slowly approaches 100%. After a certain amount of 
carbon was added, the line became completely straight.  These two experiments show that the methylene blue 
concentration and the amount of carbon in the solution play a big role in the process of removing methylene blue 
from water.  
In the future, the accuracy of the spectrophotometer needs to be improved.   Different methods of carbonization and 
activation will be investigated.

Abstract 
The aim of this project is to investigate the causes of derailments in the locomotive industry. The focus is on a specific 
locomotive Yard. Several derailments have occurred on this line and an investigation is critical in finding out what is 
causing these derailments. The primary objectives of this research are to determine whether the use of poka-yoke 
devices can be utilised in managing derailments, and to further investigate the applicability of poka-yoke devices. 
Past evidence from literature points out that railway derailments have a huge impact on operations, production and 
the employees‚Äô health and safety. Data is collected from a population of 60 employee‚Äôs. The investigation provides a 
recommendation of using poke-yoke devices to detect potential failures in an operation and the cause of erratic process 
behavior with the objective of minimizing and avoiding freight derailments. The analysis of results revealed that 
66.67% of derailments at the Yard were caused by operational failures (human errors), while 16.67% is caused by 
infrastructure failures, rolling stock and other failures contribute 8.33% of failures which lead to derailments. This 
paper contributes to the continuous discussion on processes failures reduction in the locomotive industry.

SECTION 1: 
1.1.Introduction 
From the past evidence, one can easily identify that defects can really have a negative impact on the company‚Äôs image. 
Mistakes happen all the time and they often have a significant effect on our everyday lives and even at the workplace. 
Most of these mistakes often happen sometimes without the worker even being aware that he or she is committing an 
error. The outcome of mistakes in organizations often leads to the production inability and high costs of 
reworking/repairs of these products or processes. This means that workers must put in extra work in fixing these kinds 
of mistakes and this is time consuming and costly and slows down production and organizational efficacy. The 
implementation of mistake proofing devices might reveal avenues or somewhat give an indication of eliminating 
railway derailments to avoid further damage to rolling stock and infrastructure. 
The paper further outlines the introduction of poka-yoke devices in minimising and or eliminating the misfortune of 
derailments at in the locomotive industry. Poke-yoke was first developed for manufacturing environments but has 
drastically improved to accommodate the service sector and any other organization. Shigeo Shingo invented poka-
yoke in the 1960‚Äôs to industrial processes in the attempt of preventing human errors. Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word 
means ‚Äòmistake proofing‚Äô, a term that was adopted and formalized by Shigeo Shingo as part of the Toyota Production 
System(TPS), it was first called Baka-Yoke which meant ‚Äòfool proofing‚Äô or in the modern terminology ‚Äòidiot proofing‚Äô 
and then after thorough consideration it was reduced to a milder poka-yoke ‚Äòmistake proofing‚Äô, (Shigeo 1986).

RECOMMENDATIONS 
the use of mistake proofing devices will assist in minimising derailments at TFR. Correctly set yard points will serve 
as a mistake proofing device as most derailments occur due to the lack of administering correct yard points. If this 
device is set out correctly drastic changes will be evident and the overall operational capabilities of yard capacity will 
be achieved. 
Based on objective 1 of Investigating the means of minimizing defects in the locomotive industry. 
1 
Correctly set yard points are fundamental to safe yard operations. The automated point‚Äôs mechanical system 
(interlocking system) ensures that a signal indicator to allow a train to proceed over points is only given when it 
is safe to do so.  
2 
The automated points are interlocked with a track detection equipment to ensure that the switches cannot be 
operated whilst a train movement is in process. With hand held tumblers there is no way of asserting that the 
blades are in position other than by physically assessing them.  
3 
The automated switch includes a double blade detector to ensure that the switch is completely set and locked. If, 
however, the switch fails to be correctly set the indicator remains red alerting the train Driver and yard personnel 
of the potential danger. 
Based on objective 2 of investigating the applicability of derailments at TFR. 
correctly set yard points will serve as a mistake proofing device as most derailments occur due to the lack of 
administering of correct yard points. If this device is set out correctly drastic changes will be evident and the overall 
operational capabilities of yard capacity will be achieved. It is further recommended that training should be 
implemented immediately for yard points and two other yard safety officials must be employed in the purpose of 
improving operations at the yard. Very often the derailment is caused by a combination of several contributory causes 
e.g.: Combination of faults infrastructure and rolling stock and unfortunate train handling/operation. Derailments will 
continue to be a problem which hampers the objective of the company to be reached. Hand tumblers points (human 
error) is found as a major cause of derailments within marshalling yards. The problem of hand tumblers points not set 
correctly can be solved by introducing automated yard points in replacement of manual points tumbler operations 
within the yards. The automated yards control points are done, points not set correctly and points switched whilst 
trains or wagons were moving over points will be resolved with this kind of technology. 
SECTION 5 
CONCLUSION 
Derailments are the most common type of train accident on each track type, and most of trains derailed due to points 
related accidents. Poor adjustment of points and equipment failures are the primary causes of train derailments within 
the yards, whereas the use of switches and switching rules has a substantial effect on derailment frequency on siding 
and yard tracks. The interactive effects of derailment speed and accident cause affect train accident frequency and 
severity. 
With the implementation of poka-yoke devices TFR will improve its overall operational capabilities if these devices 
are being put to work. This will minimise or rather avoid derailments and help find root causes as to why TFR is 
experiencing such setbacks.

LIMITATIONS 
A limitation of this study would be the extent in which management would describe their process designs and models 
thoroughly as confidentiality can still be reserved or let alone limited to us and thus not getting the precise information. 
Other business units might consider the use of these mistake proofing devices as a waste of time and this could have 
a negative impact on our study. Different Business Units use different inspection techniques and they might overlook 
poka ‚Äì yoke because they have never heard of it before or they don‚Äôt just consider it simply because of the entire 
change of systems process. Another limitation would be the lack of cooperation by employees with the mindset of 
losing their jobs and not see this as an opportunity for productivity in the workplace.

Abstract 
Taking into account the need for companies to become increasingly competitive, the interest 
arises to carry out the present work, which aims to develop a proposal called Supply Chain 
Quality Management (SCQM), which consists of the integration of management of quality and 
the supply chain in a construction company and in a food company contributing to the orientation 
towards an improvement in the performance of each one of these. 
On the other hand, the integration of quality management and the supply chain (SCQM) 
promotes permanent communication and teamwork through the interaction that it implies with

Abstract 
Apart from Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and World 
Class Maintenance (WCS) are the other two most popular inclusive maintenance strategies and they are 
broadly applied in the industrial settings. Some companies are currently applying TPM whilst others have 
opted for WCS or other variants of maintenance strategies. The underlying factors for selecting one of 
these two strategies need to be unveiled and the points of departure and similarities in these two strategies 
need to be exposed. A literature review approach was undertaken to analyse the basic tenets of the two 
strategies and ascertain their compatibility or immiscibility.

1. Introduction
Global rivalry demands quality as a precursor to market survival, and equipment maintenance to assure quality 
ascendancy is being pursued by countless enterprises.  Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and World Class 
Maintenance System (WCS) populate the innumerable strategic arsenal that businesses employ to outsmart rivals 
and gain unassailable momentum in the marketplace. Unified approaches are being trialed in organizations, like 
coupling TPM with Lean Manufacturing (LM)/TQM and establishing viable correlations (Ahmad, et al., 2012). 
Quality and maintenance of production structures are interrelated disciplines of any business, and the recent bygone 
era has unveiled 2 models - TPM and Total TQM sideways with others to attain world class manufacturing (Singh, 
et al., 2013). World class manufacturing (WCM) incorporates the world class maintenance system (WCS). 
Maintenance is budding up as the nexus to present day manufacturing organizations and it is more so to enterprises 
that are embracing maintenance as a revenue spawning industrial constituent (Jain, et al., 2015). TPM is effectual in 
the arena of maintenance and it is efficacious in uplifting reliability and equipment safety with evenhanded outlays, 
and  it is therefore imperative  for corporations to hand-pick the fitting maintenance strategy (Jain, et al., 2015). 
Consumers value three characteristics in a product, and these are quality, cost and delivery lead period; and the 
development of maintenance strategies to ensure that consumer expectations are met in this regard have become 
crucial (Bakri et al., 2012).

In essence, WCS in an enhanced TPM system as it is founded on the TPM fundamentals. All the TPM elements are 
enmeshed in WCS as elements like quality maintenance, autonomous maintenance, maintenance prevention and 
planned maintenance are all included in the Professional Maintenance and Autonomous Maintenance technical 
pillars of WCM. The paramount practices in maintenance are engrained as components of WCS as an answer to 
surpass the limitations of TPM, as WCS is constructed centered on the principal notions of TPM, but fused the 
paramount practices within each constituent of WCS - one of the downsides of TPM is that a suitable application 
ideal is not obtainable (Mishra, et al., 2015). WCS has diverse sub undertakings such as spare parts controlling, 
inventory control, worker participation, lubrication management, of which a comprehensive list of essentials and 
their accompanying practices has been drafted in the outline for application of WCS (Mishra, et al., 2015). These 
practices are derived from the basis of prevailing TPM understanding and the execution of preeminent maintenance 
practices in numerous establishments as described in the literature (Mishra, et al., 2015). 
5. Conclusion
Application of WCS is an interminable practice and devoting in WCS application is a highly worthy investment with 
well paying returns, although it often denotes a selection of an enduring exertion that entails a boundless covenant of 
commitment, management devotion, monetary investment, endurance, and resolve (Mishra, et al. 2015). WCS is an 
advanced version of TPM, and without understanding the TPM fundamentals one cannot implement WCS 
effectively. The only difference between TPM and WCS is that WCS is TPM that is gunning for best practices and 
modeled for implementability. Therefore, it is time to move from TPM and start embracing WCM and WCS as they 
are contemporary strategies that exude more benefits than TPM. Further research need to be taken on exploring the 
deficiencies and limitations of WCS and thereby recommending further improvement actions to make it more robust 
and adaptable to a diversity of firms.

Abstract 
To students learning statistics, the central limit theorem can be a difficult concept to understand. This 
project demonstrates several important points using JAVA and SPSS tools. JAVA was used to create a set 
of uniform random numbers to use as the parent individual data. That data was then split into subgroups 
to create the child mean data. Descriptive statistical tools were used to compare the two distributions and 
verify that the child mean distribution was a normal set of data, proving a main point of the central limit 
theorem that the child mean distribution followed a more normal distribution than the parent individual 
distribution. To prove the next main point, the standard deviations were compared to prove that the child 
means‚Äô standard deviation was narrowed by n0.5. In the end, two experiments of random sample followed 
uniform and skewed parent distribution respectively proves the match with central limit theorem.

1. Introduction
Central limit theorem is the most important theorem in Statistics. It states that given a sufficiently large sample size 
from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be 
approximately equal to the mean of the population. Furthermore, all of the samples will follow an approximate 
normal distribution pattern, with all variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population divided 
by each sample's size. Most of the students take this theorem as granted as it is very hard to prove in real life.  
This project will show a simple proof of the two main points of the central limit theorem. The first point shows that 
the child mean distribution is closer to normal distribution than the parent individual distribution. This means that 
even if the parent distribution is not uniform, the child mean distribution will still be normal. The second main point 
shows that the standard deviation of the child mean is proportionately smaller than the parent distribution by n0.5.  
2. Objective
The objective of this project is to prove the central limit theorem using JAVA to create two experiments, showing 
the effects each one creates on the central limit theorem. Other SPSS tools will be used such as skewness, kurtosis, 
and finding the standard deviation. Skewness will be used to measure symmetry in the distributions and kurtosis will 
be used to measure the shape. For uniform distribution, the expected skewness value is zero and kurtosis value is -
1.2. For normal distribution, the expected skewness value is zero and kurtosis value is zero.

Through this project, I used JAVA to create random numbers for two experiments. I proved two main points, that 
the child mean distribution is still normal even if the parent distribution is not uniform, as well as proving that the 
standard deviation of the child men distribution is proportionally smaller by n0.5 I also proved that the standard 
deviation of the child mean equals the standard error of the parent individual distribution. The second experiment 
showed the central limit theorem on a skewed distribution, and also proved the standard error of mean formula more

accurately as well. Overall, these points show that with the central limit theorem, you can accurately generalize a 
population based off a sufficient amount of samples. The central limit theorem is useful for gathering information 
from a large group of people, since you can gather data from different samples of the population instead of 
surveying each person individually. To expand this project in the future, I would like to prove other parts of the 
central limit theorem as well as create more experiments to see what effect they would have, such as changing the 
number of subgroups and subgroup size.

Resumen  
Ante la presencia e importancia de las tiendas de barrios en el pa√≠s, se han creado diferentes relaciones entre 
los tenderos, proveedores y consumidores, permitiendo el inicio de estudios sobre las negociaciones y 
productos que pueden ofrecer a cada uno de sus clientes. Pero se detect√≥ la poca informaci√≥n verificable 
sobre los agotados en estos establecimientos, creando la necesidad de realizar un dise√±o de una metodolog√≠a 
que mida  este tipo de productos en el canal de tienda a tienda y permita conocer en un futuro las categor√≠as 
de productos que presentan mayores agotados, causales de agotados y generar conocimiento a los canales 
involucrados, contribuyendo de manera directa con el mejoramiento de inventarios en las tiendas, 
incremento de ventas y servicio al cliente. La ciudad de Barranquilla fue la escogida para el desarrollo de

Abstract 
On the presence and importance of shopping districts in the country, have been created different 
relationships between the merchants, suppliers and consumers, allowing the start of studies about the 
negotiations and products that can offer to each of its customers. But detected little verifiable information 
about the sold out in these places, creating the need of a design of a methodology that measure the exhausted 
in the store to store channel and allows to know in future product categories presenting older exhausted, 
causality of exhausted and generate proposals for knowledge to all the channels involved contributing 
directly to the improvement of inventory in the stores, increased sales and customer service. The city of 
Barranquilla was the choice for the development of the investigation, including all their locations and social 
strata.

Abstract 
This project simulates poker probability. The game selects three cards from four shared cards with the 
two player cards to form the best hand to determine is the winner.  In order to simplify the probability 
scenario, partial deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, and A) is used to increase the probability of higher ranked hands 
such as Four of a Kind and Full House. I used a JAVA program to run simulations so I could calculate 
each player‚Äôs winning probability. The program is programmed to generate random cards for both 
players. I compared the simulated results with the expected probability derived based on calculations and 
confirmed that the JAVA simulated probability could match the expected probability. This project 
successfully integrated JAVA computer science and statistics/probability with the poker application.     
Keywords 
Java, Statistics, Probability, Randomized 
1. Introduction
Most poker players lose money in poker since they play without applying the probability and assessing their risk on 
each play. The objective of this paper is to use JAVA to simulate poker probability and study Sample Size effect on 
Statistics and decision making.  The project scope is for learning purpose, not for gambling purpose.  Authors used 
partial deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) of 24 cards to simplify JAVA poker simulation.  Figure 1 has listed the rankings of 
different matched patterns for the full deck (52 cards) scenario.  The full deck poker for 6 to 7 random cards is very 
popular in most Poker tournament]. There is also an US Patent [3] that studied the partial deck on Royal Flush 
probability.  In this paper, the authors will study the Poker Probability on the 24-cards Partial Deck and use JAVA 
programming to verify the winning probability between two players.  The ranking of Partial Deck may be different 
from the Full Deck.    
2. Study Partial Deck Probability
I used partial deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) of 24 cards to simplify JAVA poker simulation. Partial Deck can increase the 
matching probability on higher ranked patterns such as Four of a Kind, and Full House.  Partial Deck Poker may 
also simplify JAVA simulation process concentrated on higher ranked patterns which may be critical for real time 
decision making on each betting move.

5. Conclusion
Based on my calculations and experiments, I conclude that the player with a higher starting hand is more likely to 
win. 
In the future, I will try to find the probability of winning with one player only fully randomized, find the probability 
of winning with both players fully randomized, and find the probability of winning with board only randomized

Abstract 
The implementation processes management systems generate phenomena of resistance to change, which 
can affect decision making in organizations and the normal development of their activities. The eagerness 
to carry out processes of implementation of management systems without due internal analysis, from the 
products that affect the organizations, has generated disadvantages that affect the economic and 
organizational stability. 
Previous studies indicate that there is still much debate about the impact of the implementation of 
management systems on the productivity of companies, similarly studies have been developed on the need 
to continuously improve the organization's inside in terms of organizational communication and 
organizational change, to the effective taking of decisions. In order to analyze the elements that affect the 
implementation of management systems and productivity and competitiveness, a review was made 
regarding the application of the PROACT method (Problem Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, 
Transactions) from the framework of the goal-based choice. On the other hand, the influence and 
dependence of the aspects that affect decision making are analyzed, based on the results of the exploratory 
study carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Bogota D.C. On the impact of the 
implementation of quality and environmental management systems on productivity.

Conclusions 
The analysis of the results of the exploratory study based on the Goal Based Choice approach helps to 
determine the important aspects where a researcher and expert can direct their efforts in determining 
strategies of change, for the decision making. 
Based on this information established in criteria and subcriteria, different instruments can be applied that 
help to present an illustration of possible contexts that focus on elements of improvement in decision 
making. For the case of studies by V√°squez-Bernal & Mosquera-Laverde, (2016), one of the tools used was 
the analysis of influence and dependence. In fact, a spectrum of possibilities opens up in the combination 
of techniques, for example, V√°squez-Bernal & Cort√©s-Aldana (2015), apply the combination of PROACT 
and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) for the criteria demarcation in the certification of engineering 
professionals. 
The results found on the subcriteria and related criteria of major importance are important to focus new 
research and establish improvement strategies in the organizations that were the object of study. Establish 
strategic alliances that contribute to the University-Business relationship (V√°squez-Bernal, 2011)

Abstract 
This paper shows a CVRPTW (Capacited Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) problem applied 
to collecting donations from a food bank. The main objective is to minimize the costs and operating times 
that are affected by the fact of being subject to a dynamic variation in the programming of donors to visit. 
This problem is solved by means of a mixed integer linear programming model that allows defining the 
best route system, using information extracted from the Google Maps API for calculating the distance 
matrix. The model plans the sequence of visits that the vehicles must make, which includes the main, donor 
and secondary nodes, which are common points between the routes through which the vehicle must pass.

1. Introduction
The Archdiocesan Food Bank of Bogot√° (BAAB for its acronym in Spanish) is a non-profit organization (ESAL for 
its acronym in Spanish) that receives donations of different companies such as food, clothing, furniture, appliances 
and other items for vulnerable populations. Because it is an ESAL has few resources and as a main activity for its 
operation must go to donations of different organizations and companies along with the solidarity contribution those 
beneficiaries must pay. The problem is that the routes are empirical programming and requires minimize the total 
transport cost. 
For that reason, we use a mixed integer linear programming to solve a CVRPTW applied to collecting donations for 
a food bank. After that, we obtain of Google Maps API input information as distance and travel times. Finally, we use 
GNU solver which applies ‚ÄúBranch and Cut‚Äù and ‚ÄúBranch and Bound‚Äù methods for achieve the optimal solution. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the literature reviews are gave. Section 3 explains the 
proposed mathematical model and graphic interface programming. The computational results, including the generation 
of created CVRPTW data set, are presented in Section 4. As a final point, a summary of the conclusions and future 
researches is provided in Section 5. 
2. Literature Review
The classic Vehicle Routing Problem or VRP was introduced by Dantzig & Ramser [1] and it is a generalization of 
Traveling Salesman Problem or TSP, which was introduced by Flood [2]. A VRP variant is VRPTW, which consists 
of delivering goods from a depot to a set of customers for design routes based on vehicles capacity, customer demands, 
time windows and travel distances. The other VRP variant is VRPBTW and it was introduced by Potvin, Duhamel 
and Guiertin [3]. Its main characteristic is involving two types of customers: the first are delivery points, known as 
linehaul customers with a demand of goods to delivery from the depot or distribution center; the second are pickup

It can be observed in Table 3 that it result 3 routes where the route number 3 is largest than the routs number 1 and 2. 
This is because there are 20 donors. Although the total distance of route 3 in Table 2 is less than that shown in table

This study introduces a VRPRL variant based on characteristics of collecting donation of the ‚ÄúBAAB‚Äù. The model is 
formulates as integer linear programming problem and solves by GNU solver. It is a pilot test. This variant could be 
called CVRP applied to collecting donations (CVRPCD). On the other hand, this study is a part of a larger work that 
intends to implement this model in all national food banks.

Abstract 
This paper examines the process of improving a diabetes disease program in a Promoting Health 
Institution (IPS, the Spanish acronym), in order to achieve a better adherence from the physician to the 
clinical guidelines, and from the patient to the program, through the application of the methodologies 
Chronic Care Model (CCM), Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), and Lean Six Sigma. 
This study analyzed a program in an uncomplicated diabetic population of one IPS, which has introduced 
a growth in diabetes prevalence over the last 3 years. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with the 
program managers, and secondary data were collected in order to identify the main causes of adherence 
process failure, through SIPOC, DMAIC, identification of potential failure modes, critical requirements 
analysis for quality, and necessary resources for timely and focused patient care. 
It was found three main factors affecting adherence to the program. Therefore, several solutions were 
proposed based on: a) system capacity enhancement through care cells by patient profile. The above with 
the aim of improving the opportunity and the physician's resolution, using Jackson networks model (b) 
methods and processes enhancement by involving patients as partners in self-care; and (c) control 
mechanisms improvement through program adherence tools, in order to facilitate monitoring to the 
indicators of patient diabetes control as well as make better decisions. 
The improvement proposals pointed to guarantee a better adherence control. It was also important to 
verify the practical validity of analyzing a health scenario, through sector-specific tools, and industrial 
engineering tools; which allow to solve issues of adherence lack to health programs.

treatment decisions, clinical examinations, date for the next control, assignment of the patient's cell, and 
need for referral to extramural team actors. 
 
Conclusions 
 
ÔÇ∑ 
It is corroborated that the factors defined in the OMS literature regarding the causes of non-
adherence to chronic disease programs are support to patients, social factors, patient-related 
factors, adherence of doctor and family support. 
ÔÇ∑ 
For the analyzed program the factors to intervene as a priority were the improvement in the 
resolution capacity of the doctor and the base team, the patient's involvement and the 
improvement of the control mechanisms that include the patient and generate information closer 
to the decision making. 
ÔÇ∑ 
The Chronic Care Model (CCM) and Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are 
complementary and allow defining standardized processes, traceable, and with information for 
the analysis of results and improvement of the program. 
ÔÇ∑ 
Industrial Engineering tools such as SIPOC, 6Ms, FMEA, QFD and Visual Management, which 
are part of methodologies such as Six Sigma and Lean, allowed us to contribute to the diagnosis 
of the processes related to the identification of failure modes associated with non-adherence 
Program and define improvements to the processes that are part of the Chronic Care Model 
(CCM) and the determination of controls and information to make Clinical Decision Support 
Systems (CDSS) more robust and reliable 
ÔÇ∑ 
Jackson's network model can be used to plan future medical capacity for short-, medium- and 
long-term forecast demands. In addition, the model can be replicated for the measurement of the 
number of actors necessary for extramural equipment and for the design of training and retraining 
workshops for the evolution of the disease in patients. 
ÔÇ∑ 
From Industrial Engineering, through the tools of analysis and improvement of processes used in 
this research, it is considered that influences on the process variable, proposed by Avedis 
Donabedian (1980) that finally influences the results in health. 
ÔÇ∑ 
The enhancement proposals aim to guarantee greater control and audit in the health team of 
adherence to guidelines and clinical pathways, and contributes to the program adherence by the 
patient. 
ÔÇ∑ 
The enhancement proposals should be holistically implemented in the diabetes program in such a 
way as to involve all the actors of the service and the patient, in order to guarantee results that can 
positively influence adherence to the program as presented in the Figure 2. Systemic cycle of 
adherence to disease treatment programs with the aim of improving health outcomes.

Abstract 
Taking a walk around our neighborhood or in the park on a sunny day, if we look around, we will see lots 
of flowers and plants. So, we may wonder: ‚ÄúHow is it that plants can maximize their photosynthesis?‚Äù In 
other words, ‚ÄúHow can the leaves be best laid out to obtain the most amount of sunlight?‚Äù. Intuitively, the 
plant with the leaves that are spread out most evenly would be the most efficient. Based on observations 
and research, different plants have their own constant leaf spacing angle. Utilizing MIT Scratch and 
Python, the author has programmed a ‚ÄúLeaf Calculator‚Äù to output standard deviation of leaf spacing given 
inputs of leaf rotation angle and leaf count. Iterations from rotation angle zero (0) to 180 degrees and leaf 
count one (1) to 30 were completed to produce a Tournament scoreboard, followed by a ‚ÄúFind Winner‚Äù 
program to discover the winner with the lowest cumulative standard deviation. The winner is the plant in 
which the leaf rotation angle grows such that the pattern is the most evenly spread out. A ‚ÄúGrow‚Äù 
program was also written to visualize the leaf growth at any angle and count. In the future, plants may be 
genetically engineered for maximum photosynthesis. Surprisingly, this work is related to the Golden 
Ratio.

1. Objective
1.1 Introduction 
When we look at the question ‚ÄúHow can plants maximize photosynthesis?‚Äù we can think about ‚Äúwhat makes 
efficiency in plants?‚Äù The author did a little bit of research and found something called Phyllotaxis, which is the 
study of leaf arrangement in Botany. In Phyllotaxis, there are four types of leaf arrangements. One of them is a 
pattern with two leaves left and right, and then on top, another two and so on, as seen in arrangement i, Figure 1. 
The second type, is two leaves front and back, and then on top, two leaves left and right, and then on top, two leaves 
front and back, and so on, as seen in arrangement ii, Figure 1. The third type is a set of leaves, and then on top 
another set of leaves and so on, as seen in arrangement iii, Figure 1. Now the fourth type is a type of leaf growth that 
is a constant leaf growth angle as seen in arrangement iv, Figure 1. This means all of the leaves grow at the same 
angle.

Abstract 
In this work, it is intended to address the problem of Urban Solid Waste (USW) progressive generation 
and the decreasing spaces availability for its deposition. Based on this situation, main objective is to 
analyze the technical, economic and financial viability of an USW-organic-fraction-treatment home 
automatic and continuous system implementation, applied in Buenos Aires City, Argentina. In terms of 
the selected methodology, the following technical aspects are firstly studied: 
- Domiciliary system (composter) analysis in its two possibilities of final result: i) deposition through
sewage net, considered for apartments, ii) compost for amendment purpose, considered for houses.
- System implementation viability within Buenos Aires from studies and field measurements.
Based on the technical analysis, economic and financial study has the objective of proving the significant
saving for the city government that the reduction of organic waste fraction can potentially generate. In
order to obtain these results, some of the considered economic aspects are:
- Definition of the budget able to be saved.
- Costs and utility generation since the domiciliary system implementation.
- Choice of a Rate of Return to calculate the Net Present Value of the project.
Regarding the conclusions, the main one is the verification of viability of this implementation in Buenos
Aires.

1. Introduction
Composting plays an important role in the strategies used today for the integrated management of urban solid waste 
in many parts of the world. Composting is the most cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Ayalon 
et al., 2000). 
The domestic waste separation of the biodegradable fraction has been implemented on a large scale and with 
significant success in many European countries, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. These countries 
currently have very high efficiency rates in terms of waste separation, and their policies are aimed to achieve a 
continuous improvement, promoting the compost generation at every home (De Bertoldi et al, 1998). 
Domestic composting should not be seen as an alternative treatment option for all organic waste, but as a 
complementary solution in USW integrated management. Domestic composting provides a flexible and low-cost 
option, facilitating sustainable recycling. However, the active participation of a significant proportion of citizens in a 
given area is required for this strategy to impact the rate of diversion of waste. To this end, the municipalities had 
promoted various campaigns about the benefits of domestic composting (Andersen et al., 2011). 
Among the secondary benefits offered by the use of these devices in the home we must emphasize that, by ceasing 
to dump and mix food waste with the rest of the USW, the type and quantity of them that will require urban

Bogota, Colombia, October 25-26, 2017 
‚Ä¢ Increase in wastewater treatment efficiency, as well as in the remaining sludge
‚Ä¢ Increase in recycling rate due to non-contamination of the rest of the waste fractions
‚Ä¢ Reduction of noise and visual pollution in the streets
It is worth noting that during the financial analysis, the most conservative values of the ones available in each case
were taken to generate the most conservative of the scenarios and thus expect the reality to exceed or equal these
values.
If we take into account that the economic benefits are already obtained in the early years, a policy of total subsidies
could be implemented for users living in homes that cannot access it in any way.
Expenditures on total or partial subsidies will cease in a few years, but advertising and training expenses will
continue to be incurred by new generations, people who are incorporated in old buildings, among other cases.
In addition, over the years an increase in the number of departments is expected because people will progressively
stop living in homes and move to buildings, as was previously said. Additionally, the general habitability index is
expected to fall to 2.35 in departments.
Regarding the economic impact for the buyer of the composter, although this does not influence the government, it
is observed that for the inhabitant of department does not generate a great change in its economy because it is
framed as a sanitary facility more than very low cost, and in the household, it is even shown that the economic
benefit can be perceived by the user if the compost is directly used or marketed in some way.
4. Conclusions
The main objective of the USW management is to recover the highest percentage of waste obtaining value, either 
through recycling, composting or incinerating to generate energy. It is established as necessary the separation at 
origin, and as a regulatory policy are used methods of benefits and punishments for which the regulation fails. 
Buenos Aires propitiates the separation at source (recyclable and non-recyclable) but the percentage of waste 
disposal is relatively high, and little or no value is obtained. The local context of waste generation reflects the need 
to manage solid waste in an intelligent way, with careful selection and sustainable development in the use of 
technologies, establishing a relationship between society and the authorities that manage waste. This forces the 
participants, both government and society, to commit to the ecosystem. 
Throughout this study it was wanted to revise the final deposition options resulting from the treatment of domestic 
composting in terms of its technical and economic analysis. 
As for the technical verification, the option of disposal by sewer, it was possible to verify that there is an affinity 
relationship between sewage sludge and organic waste compost which not only generates the acceleration of the 
digestion process of these sludge, but also Improves its final quality by having it added nutrients and purifying biota 
in this way. The important thing to emphasize also is that the stabilized compost that would dump in the cloaca will 
not add gases to those already generated by the anaerobiosis, since the organic fraction of the RSU already enters 
treated. The same happens with the measurement of organic fraction, which would not increase when the organic 
matter is already digested. 
As far as the possibility of obtaining the compost as a fertilizer from the technical point of view, it is verified that, 
either for its personal use in amendment of gardens or for commercialization with the agricultural sector, this type of 
use generates a benefit for whom it produce. 
As for the economic aspect, it was wanted to verify that in this project would generate a saving for the government 
of the City to reduce the organic fraction of the garbage, and that there would be no loss of capital in any exercise 
from the implementation of the project. The implementation of the composter in sync with Buenos Aires's building 
renovation gives the government a saving in all fiscal periods, allowing part of these funds to be distributed to 
training, publicity and subsidies to house dwellers, favoring the latter decision to increase the benefits every year. 
Although a horizon of confidence was determined for the 3-year project values, after this time, an ex-post analysis 
could be done to evaluate the existing conditions. In light of the results obtained on both the technical, economic and 
financial aspects, the domestic installation of the composter is convenient for the reduction of the USW in Buenos 
Aires, generating savings in the City budget. It is hoped that this project will serve as a guide and pilot test for the 
development of the same type of plan in other cities of the country, and tomorrow we will be able to insert 
Argentina into the global commitment to the future of our and the next generations.

Abstract 
Cloud computing enables offering of manufacturing services over the Internet. Manufacturing related 
transactions such as product data, order data, production planning and status updates can exchange in the 
network. Close to real-time information provided by manufacturing portals can create manufacturing 
ecosystems, where machine owners, product designers and customers may collaborate and compete. This 
paper reviews potential models for cloud based manufacturing ecosystems and presents possible 
implications for practice. A prototype model of CloudEcosystem is presented. 
Keywords 
Manufacturing ecosystems, virtual enterprise, supply chain management, cloud manufacturing. 
1. Introduction
The advances in cloud technology enable new models of collaboration and competition in the field of manufacturing 
and supply chains (Ren et al 2015; Wu 2013). Manufacturing oriented portals are being introduced for exchange of 
production related data and transactional information related to managing the supply chains (Hao et al 2013). 
Developments in Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet Plus have connected the manufacturing machinery 
to the cloud and many companies are currently testing business potential of portals (Huang 2013). The objective is 
very often to achieve responsiveness, robustness and resilience for the global manufacturing (Kristianto, et al 2015). 
The concept of manufacturing ecosystems relates to networked value chains, holonic enterprises, virtual enterprises 
(Gunasekaran & Ngai 2004), distributed manufacturing (Fujii et al 2000) and in some extent to non-hierarchical 
networks (Shamsuzzoha et al. 2016). The ecosystem offers a niche for each agent to operate, form collaboration and 
compete (Gawer & Cusumano 2014). Apple AppStore is a well-known and often mentioned reference of a business 
ecosystem where a large central operator offers to smaller agents, i.e. software developers, an access to the market

5. Conclusions 
Scalable cloud based computing infrastructures empower building multi-tenant manufacturing environments with 
functionality supporting ecosystem like interaction. Current leading industrial solutions are coming from additive 
manufacturing domain as many supporting software has been built on cloud from the beginning. Similar functionality 
can be built to support traditional manufacturing processes such as cutting, milling, extruding, welding and assembly 
operations in various industries. The experiences from 3D printing and other advanced digital manufacturing should 
be enhanced for other manufacturing technologies. 
 
The CloudEcosystem prototype model designed shows that a generic data model support the key requirements for 
three different portal types. The main challenges are handling the interactions between customers, designers and 
manufacturers in a common system and provide a mechanism for handling product design, order fulfilment and 
quoting processes in an efficient and automated way. Cloud based architectures allow an efficient ‚Äúmanufacturing as 
a service‚Äù infrastructure with separation of multi-tenant global part with factory level software entities. Three 
identified portal types are all possible scenarios for implementing manufacturing as a service.  
 
Further research should be paid on techniques supporting manufacturing license handling and safe intellectual property 
rights in a distributed ecosystem. Linkage to financial side such as invoices, letters of credits, escrow systems and 
payments is also interesting and present some key characteristics in mobile phone ecosystems. In the future, these 
functionalities should be tested in real environments for all three ecosystem types.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to describe some links between Just in Time (JIT) manufacturing strategy and 
performance financial analysis in financial statements. A rational, deductive, analytical and objective 
method was used; based on previous findings, a series of functions along with pre-post and linear 
regression analyses models are described as explicative of the relationships between JIT and financial 
statements analysis. Results show that Dirac function, value transformation function and transform kernel 
provide the foundations for a conceptual link between JIT and company performance in financial 
statements. Besides, the JIT relationship to business performance is explained by the following three 
models, selected from literature: a) pre-post model, explains changes in inventory and asset turnover, and 
their relationship to JIT; b) two-stage self-selection regression analysis model, explains how sales, 
inventory, company size and JIT adoption influence ROA changes; and c) lean manufacturing model, 
including JIT, allows explaining firm¬¥s financial data. The conclusion is that JIT is part of a financial 
sequence of analysis strongly related to the structure of financial statements and company performance.

Resumen 
En la prestaci√≥n de servicios a clientes internos influyen muchos factores, en ocasiones ciertas demoras 
pueden considerarse aceptables, ya que desde el punto de vista econ√≥mico una disminuci√≥n de los tiempos 
en el sistema puede ser onerosa; sin embrago, en una farmacia de quir√≥fano, el punto vista netamente 
econ√≥mico debe pasar a un segundo plano, ya que cualquier demora puede generar riesgo en el 
procedimiento practicado y afectar la vida del paciente. En este estudio se parti√≥ de trabajos anteriores 
donde se estudi√≥ la composici√≥n de la canasta quir√∫rgica y se dise√±aron m√©todos de pron√≥stico de la 
demanda.  
En el presente estudio se usaron herramientas de Lean Manufacturing (producci√≥n esbelta) y de 
Investigaci√≥n de Operaciones, para disminuir el tiempo de espera que los clientes internos pasan frente a la 
farmacia de quir√≥fano, cuando necesitan algo que no se encuentre en la canasta del procedimiento que se 
est√© realizando. Inicialmente se estudi√≥ la distribuci√≥n de los productos y se realizaron algunos cambios 
para evitar p√©rdidas de tiempo (disminuci√≥n de mudas), simult√°neamente se generaron instrumentos para 
definir los puntos de renovaci√≥n de pedido de los diferentes √≠tems, a la vez se trabaj√≥ con modelos de l√≠neas 
de espera que es donde nos centraremos en la presente ponencia.

En muchos casos las demoras y los tiempos muertos se pueden disminuir con peque√±os cambios que no 
necesitan de una inversi√≥n tan alta. En este estudio se demuestra que con un recurso adicional, que no supera 
los $2.000.000  millones de pesos mensuales desde el servicio farmac√©utico de salas de cirug√≠a se puede tener 
una operaci√≥n m√°s efectiva, mas controlada y generando un mayor nivel de oportunidad al cuerpo asistencial.   
 
 
3. Conclusiones 
 
‚Ä¢ 
Un recurso adicional permite fortalecer las actividades de control dentro del servicio farmac√©utico 
evitando una mala dispensaci√≥n, perdidas de inventario y errores de cobro a paciente (evitando 
glosa). 
‚Ä¢ 
Se puede minimizar los tiempos de espera del cuerpo asistencial logrando obtener beneficios en las 
actividades que se desarrollan dentro de salas y en el paciente. 
‚Ä¢ 
Se pueden obtener una reducci√≥n por encima del 50% en los tiempos de espera, en la disponibilidad 
del sistema y en los tiempos de ejecuci√≥n de las diferentes actividades que se desarrollan dentro del 
servicio farmac√©utico. 
‚Ä¢ 
Las limitaciones f√≠sicas que se tiene en la farmacia no permiten tener un modelo multicanal, sin 
embargo se pueden tener reducciones importantes dentro de la operaci√≥n con un modelo unicanal 
que sea m√°s r√°pido al original ya sea disminuyendo los tiempos de atenci√≥n o colocando apoyos al 
servidor que permitan mejorar los tiempos de atenci√≥n

Abstract 
Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an important but irrational number in math. It is a 
frequently used number which can be used to find the circumference and area of a circle, as well as the 
surface area and volumes of spheres and cylinders. The purpose of this project to find pi with higher 
accuracy. A Java Monte Carlo simulation method is developed to generate random points in the coordinate. 
By counting the number of points inside and outside the circle, we can calculate the Pi. The sample size 
can be controlled in the Java program. For each sample size, it was repeated for twenty times see how the 
relationship between accuracy and the sample size. In the end, the Monte Carlo Method was revised to 
further improve the Pi accuracy. 
Keywords 
Monte Carlo Method, Java 
1. Introduction
The first thing that was done when starting this project was to find why the accuracy of pi is so important. An example 
of this would be in the very place that humans all live on, earth. This planet‚Äôs radius is about 3959 miles. 2 different 
estimates of pi were used on different accuracy levels(3.14 and 3.1416) to calculate an approximation of the earth‚Äôs 
circumference. The two results were 24862.52(about 39 miles difference) and 24875.1888(26 miles difference). Just 
by 4 digits of pi, the accuracy of the circumference is increased. 
2. Objectives
When starting this project, 3 questions were asked. One, is simulating pi by using java possible? Two, what was the 
relationship between the sample size value in the simulation and the result? Three, how many digits of pi do people 
really need? Later on as the project was continued, another goal was added- to shorten the code while increasing the 
accuracy. 
3. Methods
3.1 Overview 
To achieve the goal of using Java to simulate pi, the first step was to find the most effective Method to implement into 
Java while still getting accurate results. After researching, I narrowed my choices down to 2. The first one was the 
traditional Method. This Method involved cutting up a circle into many small(near) triangle pieces. After rearranging, 
the user is left with a(near) trapezoid. Then one side of the trapezoid was divided by the other, leaving the result with 
pi(this ratio was close to that of the circumference of a circle to the diameter). The second Method was the Monte 
Carlo Method, which was later picked because it was easier and faster to implement into java. Later on, 2 other 
Methods, the sphere and upper triangle, were devised to attempt increasing the accuracy of the result while shortening 
the code.

After all of the results were generated, Figure 5 below was made to find out how many digits of pi is actually 
needed. This graph was generated by subtracting various accuracies of pi from the results of the 3 Methods. The x-
axis displays the number of digits of pi and the y-axis displays the amount of error. In Figure 3, at 6 digits of pi, 
there is a saturation point. From this, it is concluded that only 6 digits of pi are needed.

5. Conclusion 
 
 
When the project was completed, all goals were achieved. Java was used to successfully simulate pi, it was concluded 
that the sample size impacted the result, determined that only needed 6 digits of pi, and the code was shortened even 
though the accuracy improved. For the future, another goal will be added, which is to measure the computation time 
for each of the codes, then compare them. 
 
The Sphere Method did not work as well as the other two Methods. After some investigating, the root cause of this 
was found. First, the Monte Carlo Method with the Upper Triangle Method were compared. The concentration of the 
dots was higher within the same sample size for the Upper Triangle Method. However, that wasn't the only reason. 
The further away the dots were from the circumference of the circle, the less accurate the value of the data was. The 
Upper Triangle Method took care of these outliers by limiting the location to the upper half. This concludes that the 
accuracy is also dependant on how the data is to the circumference.  
 
The results from the same sample sizes in the Monte Carlo Method and the Sphere Method were compared. The Monte 
Carlo Method did have the outliers, but the error was exponentially increased after using the Sphere Method. It is

concluded from these observations that because the dot distribution in the Sphere Method is less concentrated than in 
the Monte Carlo Method, therefore results for Sphere Method are the least accurate. 
 
In the end, the first few digits of pi were consistently outputted. In the future, I plan to expand the range of numbers 
and increase the consistency of the accurate results by changing the variables that show correlation to accuracy.

Abstract 
In this paper, a hybrid method, AHP-weighted TOPSIS, has been used to determine the service 
quality of aviation industry as well as the best airlines and major criteria from customer perspective 
in Turkey. We have decided to choose 7 Turkish domestic airline companies using 9 criteria which 
have been determined with a survey with 92 participants. 9 criteria have been determined as the 
most important factors for airline selection for customers as follows: ticket price, flight comfort, 
time reliability, company image, staff quality, baggage allowance, in-flight service, flight 
availability per day, number of destination flown. An interview is carried out with 24 people to 
determine the relative importance of these 9 criteria. 5 expert opinions, who work as manager, 
have been collected for the relative qualitative comparisons of the criteria. The weight of the 
criteria obtained by the AHP method is used in the TOPSIS method for the final comparison of 
the 9 airline companies.  The results of the study produced an enriched perspective to determine 
the service quality of airline companies as well as the best airlines and major criteria from customer 
perspective.

1. Introduction
Service quality of airline companies and customer selection in aviation industry is a continuing topic. Service quality 
has been discusses in many articles (Gr√∂nroos, 1982, Parasuraman et al,, Li et al., 2002). There are various types of 
service quality. Aviation industry is the one of the most discussed topic in the service industry and multi criteria 
decision methods have been used widely for aviation industry.  There are various studies regarding multi criteria 
selection methods (Goceri et al., 2017, Soner et al., 2006, Tsaur et al.2002).  
In this study, we tried to determine service quality in aviation industry as well as the best airline companies and the 
most important criteria for Turkish airlines‚Äô customers.   
We selected domestic companies for this study. The airline companies listed in this study are denoted as A, B, C, D, 
E, F, and G which represents Anadolu Jet, Atlas Global, Bora Jet, Onur Air, Pegasus, and Sun Express respectively.

As seen above in Table 6, using the AHP-based TOPSIS method, retail store G, Turkish Airlines, has been determined 
as the airline company. The main reason behind this selection was ticket price, baggage allowance and in-flight 
services (which include food, snacks, Wi-Fi, etc.). Ticket price is the most important criteria for flight selection. 
Additionally, baggage allowance and in-flight services have been found significant for consumers. Even though, 
majority of domestics flights are than 2 hours in Turkey, flight attendants still demand more baggage allowances and 
in-flight services such as Wi-Fi, snacks and so on.  These two options are offered free by Turkish Airlines which 
affects its service quality positively from customer perspective. Flight availability and number of destinations flown 
have been found less important for the customers. Since airline industry is still developing in Turkey and people still 
using other transportation options, these two least important criteria could be understandable.  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In this study, service quality in aviation industry as well as the best airline companies and major criteria from Turkish 
people perspective has been determined using AHP and TOPSIS method. The results provided valuable information 
and perspective for airlines‚Äô service quality. Additionally, the most important criteria for airline selection from 
customer perspective have been found. Using AHP based TOPSIS method was an enriched approach to determine the 
quality of service in airlines companies. 
 
The main weakness of the study was the size of each airline companies because Turkish Airlines is the dominant in 
the market and other companies‚Äô flight network is smaller than Turkish Airlines. This part could be an excellent 
starting point for further research by comparing Turkish Airlines with the same size companies.

Abstract  
  
In this paper, multi criteria decision making approach been used to determine service quality of 
fast-food restaurants in Turkey. To measure service quality of fast food restaurant, a hybrid 
method, AHP and TOPSIS methods together, has been used.  We have decided to choose 10 
nationwide fast-food restaurants. 228 participants attended to a survey which consists of 20 
questions. Afterwards, 6 criteria has been decided using exploratory factor analysis.5 restaurant 
mangers‚Äô opinions, as expert, have been collected for the relative comparisons of the criteria. The 
weight of the criteria obtained by the AHP method is used in the TOPSIS method for the final 
comparison of the 10 fast-food restaurant.  The results of the study produced an enriched 
perspective to determine the service quality of fast-food restaurant as well as the best restaurants 
and major criteria from consumer perspective.

1. Introduction 
 
 
Service quality has been discusses in many articles (Gr√∂nroos, 1982, Parasuraman et al,, Li et al., 2002). There are 
various types of service quality.  Fast food, industry is the one of the most discussed topic in the service industry. Fast-
food, a type of mass-produced food, which is prepared and served quickly, has been introduced in the 1950s in the 
United States. Popularity of fast-food has been increased over the decades in all around the world. The selection of 
the fast-food restaurants have been discussed over the decades. There are variety reasons behind the selection of a 
restaurant. In this article, we explore the major and minor criteria for restaurant selection. In order to uncover the 
criteria, we decided to choose fast food industry in Turkey. Fast-food concept develops constantly in Turkey. 
Therefore, market is remarkable for researchers. In this article, we selected the nationwide restaurants across the 
country.   
 
Fast-food restaurants listed in this study are denoted as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J which represents, Burger King, 
Chicken World, Popeye‚Äôs, Pizza Pizza, Domino‚Äôs Pizza, Carl's JR, Papa John's, Mc Donald‚Äôs , KFC, and Arby's 
respectively.

As seen above in Table 6, using the AHP-based TOPSIS method, restaurant I has been determined as the best, 
Domino‚Äôs Pizza as the second best fast-food restaurant.  Additionally, service quality and certification have the highest 
impact on restaurant selection for customer where amenities have the least effect. The reason behind amenities‚Äô impact 
on customer selection could be explained because all shopping centers offers free parking for customers and most 
restaurants and offers free Wi-Fi. Additionally, accessibility to internet is becoming easier by network providers 
through the mobile devices.  However, in another study (Goceri MS, and Goceri T, 2017) for airline selection, 
accessibility to internet was one of the most important reasons for selection of fast food restaurant because in the air 
there is no network provider except the airline companies. This confirms that why amenities has been found less 
important for fast-food customers.   
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this study, service quality of fast-food restaurant as well as the best restaurants and major criteria from consumer 
perspective has been determined in Turkey using AHP and TOPSIS method. The results produced valuable insight 
for fast-food companies as well as customers for fast-food consumers. The most important criteria for the selection of 
fast food restaurant from customer perspective have been found. Using AHP based TOPSIS method with statistical 
tool was a sophisticated approach to determine service quality of fast-food restaurants. This study could be a 
significant research for fast-food restaurant regarding the details customer expectation from a fast-food restaurant.  
 
Applying survey to only Turkish fast-food consumers was the main weakness of the study. This could be an excellent 
starting point for future researches.

Abstract

Within an organization, the most important are the relationships that are established with the clients, being 
more evident when we speak of service delivery. For this reason, great care should be taken in the attention 
to the user, providing a quality service, with greater effectiveness using less resources, fulfilling the client's 
expectations in the best way and generating a positive impact both internal and external. 
When the efficacy of quoting in customer service, no one refers to the quality in the provision of a service, 
which should be optimal in such a way that users feel a good impression, do not feel uncomfortable with 
the service they Is being provided Regarding time, attention and opportunity, thus avoiding the generation 
of complaints, discomfort and discomfort on the part of the user. That is why a group of Students of the 
University of Rosario decided to carry out a research work at the Hospital Universitario Mayor M√©deri, 
observing the schedules, customer service times and number of people attended per minute, to propose a 
system that optimize the times to improve the attention and the service to the client, taking into account the 
logistic tools learned in class.

Abstract 
This article unveils the current situation in Zimbabwean film and television industry based on its history, 
regulatory laws, digitalization and the new technological innovations. The paper attempts to conceptualize 
on how to create a viable and consistent film and television industry in Zimbabwe. Based on the secondary 
sources and random interviews with filmmakers, it was observed that more research is required to 
strengthen the Zimbabwean film and television industry in order to produce quality films and compete with 
the current market demand. The industry needs qualified personnel to run companies effectively, investment 
to produce films, new equipment to operate efficiently, co-productions with other countries to exchange 
skills, and public support especially from the government and the citizens to promote the sales of the film 
for it to become sustainable. Furthermore, the industry needs to take measures to establish a well-defined 
policy that promote films in Zimbabwe and accommodate foreign investment in order for the industry to 
develop.

1. Introduction
The Zimbabwean film and television industry is under developed compared to other African countries like Botswana, 
South Africa and Nigeria. Currently, the Zimbabwe‚Äôs airwaves are dominated by Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation 
(ZBC), however most of Zimbabwean audience do not watch it because it usually broadcasts outdated content. The 
1990 Korean series and South African old soap episodes, like Generations, have been aired repeatedly over the past 
10 years. The broadcasting television is still transmitting its content (audio-visual moving images) using electronic 
transmitters, which does not reach very well in every parts of Zimbabwe. Currently, the Zimbabwean film and 
television industry is one of the industries which needs to be resuscitated. In contrast to the agriculture sector, the film 
and television industry is not considered as an employment and income generating industry. Therefore, there is a need 
to find feasible measures to create a sustainable entertainment industry. Some African countries, like Nigeria have a 
well-developed film industry which have gone as far as having different channels and websites too, such as 
Africamovies.com, tvnolly.com and ibakatv.com, however Zimbabwe doesn‚Äôt have one yet. The Zimbabwean film 
and television industry has many obstacles, which include censorship, insufficient funding, lack of government 
support, regulatory laws by Broadcasting Services Act, and unqualified and inexperienced people in the field.

Inclusion in budget 
The government should allocate budget for the film industry, which 
can be used as a capital to develop new and experienced disadvantaged 
filmmakers. This will generate employment, develop skills and talent. 
7 
Hosting film festivals 
Zimbabwe is blessed with plentiful of beautiful locales, and hence 
hosting international film festivals will attract international filmmakers 
and generate revenue through tourism. Such film exhibitions provide a 
platform to showcase local film products.  
Films leave positive impressions and leaves a long lasting connection 
with the audience about nation‚Äôs culture, landscapes and society.

Mobile cinemas 
There is a need to have more mobile cinemas in rural areas in order to 
reach to the rural community and spread the skills and information. 
9 
Open market and 
International collaboration 
Government shall spearhead partnership with international filmmakers 
to attract successful filmmakers from around the world. 
There is a need to create and develop international relations with 
popular television broadcasters, film distributors and exhibitors. 
Open market allows new investors to open new television channels or 
satellites that benefit the development of the industry, with the first 
priority given to potential local companies. 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations
This article provides a comprehensive overview of a Zimbabwean film and television industry and a detailed 
breakdown of challenges and opportunities associated with the creation of sustainable film industry in Zimbabwe. The 
paper discusses ways to develop and create a sustainable film industry so that it can actively participate in the 
Zimbabwean economy as it has the potential to create employment. Although there are many problems to be addressed 
in the film and television industry, filmmakers should try to improvise the use of technology, handle film crew, and 
collaborate with international counterparts to run the project successfully. Film and television, as media and a form of 
communication, have a great impact on other forms of communication like advertising, hence its success has positive 
influence on all other industries. For instance, a television advert showing popular actor using a mobile phone or 
showing off the latest unique advanced features of the phone may prompt viewers to purchase the phone. Another 
example is the film making a song or singer popular, a very good example is ‚ÄòMy heart will go on‚Äô from Celion Dion 
in the movie Titanic. 
If the suggested initiatives are embarked on, the industry is poised to grow significantly over the next decade. The fact 
that the government is advocating for digitalization shows that there is a green light for the future of the industry and 
this could lead to employment creation resulting in the economic growth. Even though the government institutions 
and other commissions like BAZ have a crucial role to play, it is in the hands of film practitioners to take the most 
decisive impact for this revolution. It is, therefore, essential for the authorities together with Zimbabwean filmmakers 
to have constant conference to pave a way forward to ensure that the legislative laws allow potential media companies 
to privately set up televisions broadcasting satellites and find ways to accommodate foreign investors. Having foreign 
investors will promote exchange of information and skills, and open new markets for the television programs such as 
films from our own locally produced productions. This will position the industry into a global radar, and fundamental 
to this is the creation of international exposure and recognition, which will maintain a well-developed film and 
television industry in Zimbabwe. 
It is suggested that the filmmakers should come up and run a pilot project together which will unfold the relevance of 
film industry in Zimbabwean economy and its positive impact to other industries and its contribution to the nation. 
This pilot project mandate will have to convince, attract and unearthing the value of the industry to the investors and 
the positive impact that the industry have in the growth of the economy and in creating employment, especially for 
the youths. This can be arranged in the form of a documentary showing other successful film and television industries 
or feature film instead of using research articles. For easier comprehension, this can be listed as the following:

Abstract 
This article discusses the importance of operations management in film industry and examines how 
operations management affects the processes of filmmaking that leads to the production of good quality 
films. The study also seeks to find effective methods of strengthening operations management in the 
Zimbabwean film industry. An intensive review of literatures was conducted to assess the processes of 
production and distribution of films, and it was observed that there is a need to improve the operations 
management of film industry in Zimbabwe. Most companies are operating without operations managers, 
thus resulting in poor quality productions and services.

1. Introduction
Film portrays a mirror to human society with the elements of reality; therefore, it has become a medium for every 
country to share their history, culture, stories and future predictions. Compared to other forms of arts, film has become 
popular due to its dynamic images and story-telling style through the movement of frames and the sound that has a 
power to emotionally connect with viewers. Because of its features, film has become a significant universal art within 
human culture, which is highly popular as it connects people from different territories through multiple broadcasting 
platforms such as satellite, Internet Protocol (IP) and Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD). Furthermore, it has 
proven to be the most influential instrument to disseminate information - a vehicle for culture, education, leisure and 
propaganda than other forms of media.  
In this 21st Century, there is a stiff competition in any professional field due to the globalization of markets (Goldsmith 
and O‚ÄôRegan, 2005), hence it is crucial to stay ahead by standardizing the product and constantly satisfying customers. 
Film is a product that is tangible and a service that entertains and educate people about art and culture, and imagination. 
In Zimbabwe, there is only one television channel that broadcasts all the television programmes, which means that 
there is less market and limited growth for indigenous films. The Zimbabwe television (ZTV), which is a national 
broadcasting television, has not moved to digitalization yet, which has been limiting some companies from producing 
quality films because their digital gadgets are not compatible with analogue system that ZTV is still using. Since late 
90s when Zimbabwe witnessed the production of films like Neria (1992), Flame (1994) and Everyone‚Äôs Child (1996), 
the nation has not been actively participating in the film industry. Exceptional filmmakers like Marlon Murape - who 
produced Tariro (2004), and Joe Njangu - who produced The Gentlemen (2014) and Escape (2016) have been

Policy 
Regulatory laws plays a significant role in the distribution of artistic and 
technological work. The government must place a policy to reduce the 
distribution of films on street markets. 
 
The operations managers from all film companies in the country should meet 
and set up a committee to draft a film policy which will benefit all the 
stakeholders, improve the quality, and help in the growth of the industry.  
 
 
The operations manager has a responsibility of monitoring and analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of the whole 
film production system, and must re-strategize and find new ways of improvement if the production system is found 
to be poor. The operations managers, as leaders, should be able to set clear goals and have a long term plans or 
strategies for a successful film industry. For smooth running of the operations management in the film industry, the 
operations manager must: (i) have a good experience in the industry; (ii) be able to perform a variety of tasks; (iii) be 
familiar with concepts, practices and procedures of variety of fields; (iv) rely on experience and judgement to plan 
and accomplish goals; (v) lead and direct the work of others; (vi) plan and control change; (vii) manage quality 
assurance programmes; (viii) conduct research on new technologies and alternative methods to increase the efficiency; 
(ix) set and review budgets and manage cost; (x) oversee inventory, distribution of goods, and facility layout; and (xi) 
be creative and able to connect with international filmmakers. It is the responsibility of operations managers in 
Zimbabwean film industry to draft a national film policy, which will drive the industry to greater heights of 
development. The role of operations management is pivotal for the success and growth of the film industry in 
Zimbabwe. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Film is a powerful mean of the world recreation and an artistic work that should be seriously considered in Zimbabwe.  
Film genres, such as documentary, have become a teaching tool in academic institutes to deliver information to 
students on history, science and other disciplines. It is a service that entertains and educate, which frames how other 
countries perceive the country. The Zimbabwean film industry is lacking proper operations management, which is 
resulting in poor quality products and hence the industry is losing its audience. The film industry needs to strengthen 
operations management in order to create a viable film industry and compete with international film companies. This 
will also create employment and positively contribute to the economy of Zimbabwe. If the nation focuses on adapting 
operations management of international standards and uses new technology and moves into digitalization, then the 
Zimbabwean film industry will run smoothly and be able to secure itself a place in this global world.

Abstract 
The people in Zimbabwe prefer Western / Indian / Nigerian films than the local films, which is mainly due 
to the poor content of the local production. The lack of quality is also hindering Zimbabwean films to enter 
the global market. This article investigates methods and mechanisms of strengthening quality management 
in the Zimbabwean film industry in order to produce quality films that can be competitive in the global 
market. It was observed that the Zimbabwean film industry has inadequate leadership, film structure and 
policies. The industry has been operating without any proper national policy, thus there is a lot of illiteracy 
concerning quality management, resources for improvement or innovations and lack of planning on 
operations of the film industry. Henceforth, it is essential to explore the industry, seek strategies of 
continuous improvement of producing quality films that satisfy the consumer‚Äôs expectations. Film industry 
in most of the countries, such as Nigeria, has been contributing economically over the years; however, 
Zimbabwe is one of the nation that has not been able to fully explore and benefit from the film industry. 
Thus, the Zimbabwean film industry must establish quality management team and implement management 
practices to improve the quality of its production and become sustainable.

1. Introduction
In the first two decades of independence, the film industry in Zimbabwe exhibited its potential for growth by producing 
quality films like Jit (1990), Neria (1992), and Flame (1996), some of which were the highest-grossing movies. The 
current economic situation has limited the activities of the Zimbabwean film industry; hence, most of the filmmakers 
are making their films on a very tight budget. In order to cut the production cost, Zimbabwean filmmakers have now 
adopted the approach of working in small crews and started using mobile phones for digital video capturing (Mboti, 
2016). This is resulting in the production of low quality films and losing local audiences. The quality of the films is 
also being compromised by the selection of poorly written scripts and lack of story lines, which do not even relate to 
what the society needs. New generation filmmakers somehow are lacking filmmaking skills and knowledge. 
Furthermore, film institutions and organizations in Zimbabwe such as Zimbabwe International Film Festive (ZIFF), 
African Script Development Fund, and Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA), are 
not being able to contribute much towards the development of the film industry. Zimbabwe has only one broadcasting 
television (ZTV) service and it has not been able to move towards digitalization yet, which has been limiting 
companies in making quality films.

making in schools. This will empower employees to improve their work and 
make better films. 
Empower employees 
It is essential to employ qualified management team and financial advisors to 
strategize on effective mechanism of producing quality films and develop the 
film industry. 
Government regulations 
There is a need for the government to review some regulations pertaining 
shareholding of foreign investors in Zimbabwean film industry. International 
investment also brings international expertise that can be transferred to local 
filmmakers to produce quality films. 
 
4. Conclusion 
   
The film industry in Zimbabwe is struggling to attract local audience due to the production of poor quality films which 
do not satisfy the expectations of consumers. This article aims to strengthen the quality management of the 
Zimbabwean film industry in order to improve the quality of films that can enter and compete with global market. In 
order to be established and sustainable, the film industry must improve the quality of films. The industry should absorb 
the trainees from Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA) and other institutes who 
have passion and formal training in the production of quality films. A reliable funding source should be established to 
fund proposals and production houses which have been evaluated to be worthy. The technological advancement has 
redesigned the traditional way of film production, and has resulted in the production of 3D and HD cameras which 
offers greater image quality coupled with different editing software that gives special effects to the film to make scenes 
as real as possible. It is important for the Zimbabwean film industry to take initiatives and create quality films that are 
beyond the customer‚Äôs imagination. The Zimbabwean film industry needs to accelerate its project on digitalization 
and improve its quality to enter and establish itself in the global market. It is also significant to do a research on 
recipients of the productions and understand the genres that most people are interested in and produce what people 
want. The implementation of quality management tools will ensure quality films, which will result in better business, 
increased cash flow, satisfied filmmakers, and high customer loyalty.
