Abstract 
Firms worldwide attempt to minimize the total cost of sourcing, aggregating, and delivering products to demand 
centers. Specifically, in this paper, we model a single-tier supply chain with m suppliers, n aggregators and p demand 
centers, each with known Latitude and Longitude. We assume a certain, fixed demand profile for a single product at 
the various demand centers and simulate the number of units assembled at each aggregator and fulfilled by each 
supplier, using random numbers, so that each simulation results in various paths from supplier to aggregator to demand 
center, and the sum of costs of all paths in that simulation will give the total cost. Minimum total cost across all 
simulations will give the optimal sourcing and assembly strategy. With the use of Latitude and Longitude, we model 
the transportation costs as a function of distance. In addition, truck size is also used in transportation cost calculation. 
Using fixed and variable cost for each assembly unit, we model the total cost for each assembly unit for the units 
assembled there. Inbound and Outbound transportation cost from supplier to aggregator and from aggregator to 
demand center is also computed using distance and truck sizes.

1.Introduction
This research is expected to fill the gap on supply chain cost modeling, for which open-source and freeware solutions 
are far and few between. Moreover, the use of latitude and longitude to obtain distance between two locations and 
ascertaining the supply chain cost along with the use of random allocations of fulfilment units to aggregator and 
suppliers is not seen in existing literature. Owing to the vast number supplier/aggregator/demand center permutations 
possible for fulfilment units, and the infeasibility of a deterministic solution, a simulation approach is being undertaken 
to obtain a stochastic rather than a deterministic solution. The contribution of this research is expected to simplify 
sourcing, aggregator decisions when the latitude and longitude of suppliers, aggregators and demand centers are 
known a priori, and it is expected that with the substantial number of simulations possible, a close empirical solution 
can be found to the theoretical minimum total cost.

5.3 Proposed Improvement 
Improvements can be made to increase the depth in the number of tiers of suppliers. In the present analysis, only a 
single-tier supplier network is considered. Sensitivity analyses can also help in delineating boundaries of optimality. 
Breaking of loads across truck types can also be a potential improvement. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Data in Table 12 is further analyzed, and the mean of the minimal total cost is 343,188 while the standard deviation 
is 6,284. Assuming a normal distribution for the mean of minimal total cost, we conclude that the minimal total cost 
does not deviate from the mean of minimal cost statistically. We further state the confidence interval for 2 standard 
deviations from the mean of minimal cost as [3,30,620    3,55,755] and all values in Table 12 are well within the 
confidence interval depicted. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Simulation is useful in situations where deterministic solutions are impossible or impractical. In this paper, we develop 
an algorithm to perform simulations in which we randomly allocate quantities from suppliers and fulfil them through 
randomly selected aggregators. The truck costs and aggregator fixed and variable costs, in addition to the 
transportation distance between the supplier/aggregator and aggregator/demand centers allow us to compute the Total 
supply chain cost for each simulation. The minimal supply chain cost across simulations is the sourcing strategy, 
which is given for n = 1000 simulations as below, as an example in Table 13 below. It is noteworthy that no two 
simulation runs are likely to give the same minimal total cost, even when n is held the same (example, n = 1,000)

Abstract 
The fast-food restaurant sector holds significant importance globally, particularly in Peru, where it drives employment 
and entrepreneurship. However, these establishments face operational challenges such as high order cancellation rates 
due to inefficient kitchen layouts and poor task allocation. This research addresses these issues by proposing a Lean 
Service Model integrating Operator Balance Chart (OBC), Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), First Expired First Out 
(FEFO) inventory policy, ABC Multicriteria Analysis, and Process Standardization. The implementation led to a 
36.9% reduction in canceled orders, a 45.93% decrease in overdue inputs, and a 77.46% increase in customer 
satisfaction. These results highlight the model's effectiveness in enhancing operational efficiency and service quality. 
The academic impact lies in providing a structured approach for operational improvements in the fast-food sector, 
while the socio-economic impact includes better customer experiences and increased profitability. This study calls for 
further exploration into integrating Lean methodologies to optimize operations in fast-food restaurants, encouraging 
continuous improvement and innovation.

1. Introduction
The fast-food restaurant sector holds significant importance globally, and specifically in Peru. Fast-food 
establishments play a crucial role in the food industry, offering convenient and quick meal options to a large consumer 
base (Baker et al., 2020). These restaurants have become ingrained in modern society, catering to the fast-paced 
lifestyles of individuals seeking on-the-go dining solutions. In Latin America, the fast-food industry has experienced 
substantial growth, reflecting changing consumer preferences and urbanization trends (Beal et al., 2019). In Peru, fast-
food restaurants not only provide sustenance but also contribute to the economy by generating employment 
opportunities and fostering entrepreneurship within the food service sector (Foster et al., 2022). 
The operational processes within fast-food restaurants often face challenges that impact efficiency and customer 
satisfaction. Issues such as high order cancellation rates are prevalent, primarily due to delays in food preparation 
caused by inadequate kitchen layouts and inefficient staff task allocation (Novoa-Sanzana, 2024). Moreover, the use 
of low-quality ingredients stemming from poor inventory management practices leads to expired products,

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of this study reveal that the implementation of Lean Service tools in a fast-food company can 
significantly reduce the rate of canceled orders. The application of OBC, SLP, ABC Analysis with FEFO inventory 
system, and process standardization through BPM resulted in a 51.9% decrease in canceled orders, reducing the rate 
from 18.7% to 9.7%. Additionally, the FEFO inventory management system reduced the percentage of expired inputs 
by 115%, and customer satisfaction increased to 75.6%, exceeding the company's minimum requirement. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to address critical problems in the fast-food service sector, such as 
high cancellation rates and low product quality. By improving operational efficiency and inventory management, 
customer satisfaction and business profitability can be increased. This study underscores the need to adopt continuous

practical framework that other researchers and professionals can use to improve operational efficiency in similar 
contexts. The combination of these tools allows for continuous evaluation and implementation of process 
improvements, ensuring that companies remain competitive and can quickly respond to market demands. 
 
Final observations suggest that although the results are promising, further studies are needed to explore the application 
of these tools in different types of establishments and geographical contexts. It is recommended to investigate the 
integration of Lean Manufacturing with other management methodologies to maximize benefits. Additionally, the 
long-term impact of these implementations on business profitability and sustainability should be evaluated. In 
conclusion, this research offers a solid foundation for future explorations and encourages researchers to continue 
developing innovative solutions that improve operational efficiency and quality in the fast-food service sector.

Abstract 
The textile and apparel industry significantly impacts the global economy, especially in regions like Latin America 
and Peru, where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are prominent. These SMEs drive economic growth and 
provide jobs but face production challenges, particularly related to On-Time In-Full (OTIF) fulfillment due to 
inventory management deficiencies. Common issues include stock-outs of raw materials and delays in material supply, 
often due to poor supply chain management and disorganized inventory control systems. This research proposed a 
Lean Production Model integrating 5S, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) 
to address these challenges. The model aimed to streamline processes, optimize inventory management, and improve 
overall production efficiency. Key results showed a significant improvement in the OTIF index from 52.37% to 85%, 
a reduction in defective materials by 15%, and a decrease in search time by 20%. The implementation also reduced 
product contamination incidents by 10% and improved inventory levels, ensuring a minimum inventory of 285 cones 
each month. This study provided a comprehensive framework for process improvement in textile SMEs, emphasizing 
the importance of adopting Lean principles to enhance operational performance and competitiveness. Further research 
should explore integrating these methodologies in different contexts to continue improving the efficiency and 
sustainability of textile SMEs.

1. Introduction
The textile and apparel industry significantly impacts the global economy through trade, employment, investment, 
and revenue (Filho et al., 2019). In regions like Latin America and Peru, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
are prominent in the textile sector, driving economic growth and providing jobs (Abraham, 2023). In Peru, SMEs are 
crucial to the textile industry, underscoring their importance in the national economy (Torres-Mestanza, 2023). The 
dynamism and innovation within textile SMEs not only influence local economies but also contribute to the global 
supply chain (Ali, 2022). 
Textile SMEs encounter production challenges, particularly related to On-Time In-Full (OTIF) fulfillment due to 
inventory management deficiencies (Demirtaş et al., 2022). Common issues include stock-outs of raw materials and 
delays in material supply to sewing workshops, often due to poor supply chain management and disorganized 
inventory control systems (Campoblanco-Carhuachin et al., 2022). These challenges impede operational efficiency,

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of this study reveal that the implementation of Lean Manufacturing and BPM tools in a textile 
company can significantly improve efficiency and order fulfillment rates. The application of the 5S, EOQ, and MRP 
methodologies resulted in an improvement in the OTIF (On-Time In-Full) index from 52.37% to 85%. Additionally, 
the segregation and elimination of defective materials through the 5S methodology reduced defective materials by 
15%, while the reorganization of the warehouse decreased search time by 20%. The cleaning routines implemented in 
the Seiso phase reduced product contamination incidents by 10%. Furthermore, the detailed demand analysis using 
EOQ projected an annual demand of 3430 cones of alpaca wool, establishing an economic order quantity of 51 units 
and a total of 68 annual orders. This significantly reduced the frequency of stockouts and optimized the workflow in 
the workshop. The implementation of the MRP system ensured more accurate planning of materials needed for 
production, improving production scheduling efficiency and reducing delivery delays. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to address critical problems in the textile sector, particularly in SMEs. 
Poor inventory management and supply chain delays are common challenges that affect operational efficiency and 
customer satisfaction. By implementing a Lean production model, companies can optimize their processes, reduce 
costs, and improve overall performance. This study emphasizes the need to adopt continuous improvement 
methodologies in the textile sector, highlighting how tools like 5S, EOQ, and MRP can transform operations and 
reduce waste. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are significant, as this Lean production model provides a theoretical and 
practical framework that other researchers and practitioners can use to improve operational efficiency in similar 
contexts. By integrating various Lean tools, the model addresses the unique challenges faced by textile SMEs, such 
as high inventory costs, inconsistent quality, and production delays. The combination of these methodologies allows 
for continuous evaluation and implementation of process improvements, ensuring that companies remain competitive 
and can quickly respond to market demands. The success of the model in improving the OTIF index highlights its 
potential to enhance the competitiveness of textile SMEs in the global market. 
 
For future research, it is recommended to explore the integration of these methodologies in different contexts and 
sectors to continue improving the efficiency and sustainability of textile SMEs. Additionally, it would be beneficial 
to investigate how other Lean tools can complement this model to maximize its benefits. Evaluating the long-term 
impact of these implementations on business profitability and sustainability is also crucial to fully understand the 
benefits of adopting a Lean approach in textile production management. This study offers a solid foundation for future 
explorations and encourages researchers to continue developing innovative solutions that enhance operational 
efficiency and quality in the textile sector.

Abstract 
The textile industry, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plays a crucial role in the global economy, 
significantly contributing to trade, employment, and revenue. In Peru, the textile sector holds a prominent position, 
with a rich heritage and substantial impact on the country's GDP. Despite its importance, textile SMEs face numerous 
operational inefficiencies, particularly in their sewing lines, caused by delays in spare parts replacement, pneumatic 
and electrical system failures, and non-compliance with sewing standards. Addressing these inefficiencies is vital for 
improving productivity, reducing costs, and enhancing the competitiveness of textile SMEs. This research aimed to 
develop a comprehensive Lean production model tailored to the specific needs of textile SMEs. The model 
incorporated process standardization, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and preventive maintenance to optimize 
operations. By streamlining production processes, minimizing waste, and enhancing equipment reliability, the 
proposed model sought to address the critical challenges faced by textile SMEs and improve overall operational 
efficiency. Key results from the implementation of the Lean production model indicated significant improvements. 
The efficiency rate increased from 55% to 75%, the rate of reprocessed products decreased from 15% to 2%, and the 
on-time delivery rate improved from 90% to 97%. Additionally, the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) increased 
from 6.3 hours to 7.15 hours, while the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) decreased from 1.3 hours to 0.75 hours. These 
results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in enhancing productivity and reliability. The academic 
and socio-economic impacts of this research are profound. Academically, it bridges a notable gap in the literature by 
providing a systematic approach to implementing Lean Manufacturing and TPM in textile SMEs. Socio-economically, 
the improved operational efficiency can lead to increased competitiveness, job creation, and economic growth in the 
textile sector. This model can serve as a benchmark for other SMEs facing similar challenges, promoting broader 
application and adaptation of Lean principles. In conclusion, this study highlights the urgent need for continuous 
improvement in the textile industry and calls for further research to explore innovative solutions. By fostering a culture 
of continuous improvement and leveraging Lean methodologies, textile SMEs can achieve sustainable growth and 
resilience in a dynamic market. Future research should focus on integrating advanced technologies to further enhance 
the effectiveness of Lean production models and address emerging challenges in the industry.

Abstract 
The fuel station sector is crucial to the global economy, particularly in Latin America and Peru, where it supports 
transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing. However, fuel stations face significant challenges, including poor 
inventory management and inaccurate sales forecasting, leading to inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction. This 
study proposed a Lean Warehouse Service Model for fuel stations, incorporating demand forecasting and Lean 
principles. The model addressed service level issues using the Winters Method for demand forecasting, the Harris 
Wilson Method for optimizing order quantities, and the 5S methodology for improving organizational efficiency. This 
comprehensive approach aimed to reduce costs, prevent stockouts, and enhance service levels. Key findings showed 
a service level increase from 90% to 97.32%, on-time deliveries from 61.34% to 99%, loss-making sales reduction 
from 240,970 to 2,498 gallons, and 5S compliance improvement from 34% to 89%. These results confirmed the 
model's effectiveness. Academically, the study adds to Lean applications in services, and socioeconomically, it 
provides a practical solution for enhancing fuel station efficiency. Future research should explore new technologies 
like AI and machine learning to further improve forecasting and operations in service industries.

Abstract 
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the plastic commercialization sector are crucial for economic growth 
in Latin America, particularly in Peru. These SMEs often face challenges such as high return rates due to order 
fulfillment and product quality issues. Current literature lacks comprehensive solutions integrating Lean Warehouse 
methodologies tailored for this sector. This research aimed to bridge this gap by proposing a Lean Warehouse model 
incorporating Slotting, Visual Management, and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) to address these challenges. The 
proposed model aimed to optimize storage, streamline workflow, and improve product quality, thereby reducing return 
rates and enhancing operational efficiency. Key results showed a reduction in the return rate from 17.65% to 12%, an 
increase in order fill rate from 83.45% to 97%, and improvements in delivery quality and on-time order ratios. This 
research significantly impacts both academic and socioeconomic spheres by providing a systematic approach to 
enhance SME performance in the plastic sector. Future research should explore further applications of Lean 
methodologies to sustain competitive advantage and foster innovation in SME operations.

1. Introduction
The sector of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in the commercialization of plastic products plays 
a crucial role in the global economy, particularly in regions like Latin America and Peru. These enterprises contribute 
significantly to employment, economic growth, and innovation (Abideen & Mohamad, 2020). In the context of the 
plastic industry, SMEs are vital as they often cater to niche markets, provide specialized products, and foster 
entrepreneurship (Barker et al., 2022). The plastic industry in Latin America, including Peru, relies heavily on these 
SMEs for the distribution and supply of a wide range of plastic products, serving diverse sectors such as packaging, 
construction, and consumer goods (Raghuram & Arjunan, 2021). 
The high rate of returns experienced by SMEs in the plastic commercialization sector poses a significant challenge, 
primarily stemming from deficiencies in order fulfillment quantity and product quality. Issues such as inadequate 
picking processes, inventory mismanagement leading to stockouts and obsolete products, and inefficient storage 
layouts contribute to these high return rates (Huang et al., 2022). These challenges not only impact the financial 
performance of the SMEs but also erode customer trust and satisfaction, hindering long-term business sustainability

Abstract 
The shift from linear to circular networks is gaining global importance with the rise in global carbon footprint. 
Sourcing, identifying, and assessing the quality of incoming raw materials from remanufacturing or recycling units 
can pose significant challenges for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) transitioning to a circular economy. 
This paper discusses how blockchain technology can mitigate these challenges by enhancing traceability and 
sustainability in logistics and operations management. A blockchain framework model is proposed in this study that 
will empower OEMs to make their procurement process lean, reduce material wastage, and enhance overall efficiency 
in their transition towards a circular network. The proposed blockchain model will increase the traceability of 
materials, lower dependence upon unreliable suppliers, and guarantee recycling, thereby contributing to a more 
sustainable and proficient circular manufacturing ecosystem. The adaptability of the proposed blockchain model is 
also illustrated through a real-time case study involving organizations that are part of a linear and circular symbiotic 
setup.

MNCs influence productivity within the growth of domestic tech startup companies in Bengaluru, the questionnaire 
responses were analyzed. The primary findings reveal that MNCs significantly impact job creation and wealth 
distribution, thereby fostering community development. The study concludes that while MNCs contribute positively 
to economic growth, they also introduce challenges that necessitate careful management to ensure sustainable 
development and equitable wealth distribution within the local tech ecosystem.

Abstract 
The pharmaceutical sector in Latin America, particularly in Peru, has seen significant growth, with small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) playing a crucial role in the supply of essential medications and health products. Despite 
their importance, these SMEs face considerable challenges, particularly in inventory management and logistics, which 
have not been sufficiently addressed in existing research. The sector urgently needs solutions to issues such as 
inadequate storage systems, inefficient inventory management, and the high incidence of product obsolescence, which 
directly impact the efficiency and competitiveness of these companies. This study proposed a Lean Storage Model 
specifically designed for pharmaceutical marketing SMEs in Peru, incorporating Lean Manufacturing tools such as 
5S, standardized work, and Kanban. The model was applied in a case study of a Peruvian SME, leading to measurable 
improvements, including a 47% reduction in picking process time, a 41% decrease in product obsolescence, and a 
10.78% increase in service level, aligning it with industry standards. These results highlight the model's potential to 
enhance operational efficiency, reduce waste, and improve overall competitiveness in the pharmaceutical sector. The 
study's findings contribute to the academic discourse on Lean Manufacturing in SMEs and provide a practical 
framework for similar companies facing comparable challenges. Further research is encouraged to explore additional 
Lean tools and their application in other sectors.

1. Introduction
The importance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that market pharmaceutical products is 
fundamental in the global context, especially in Latin America and Peru. These companies not only significantly 
contribute to the local economy but also play a crucial role in providing medications and health products to the 
population. In Latin America, SMEs represent approximately 99% of all companies and generate around 60% of 
employment, highlighting their importance in the economic and social development of the region (OECD, 2020). In 
Peru, the pharmaceutical sector has shown consistent growth, with an increase in the demand for pharmaceutical 
products that has led SMEs to adapt and evolve to meet market needs (Ministry of Health, 2021). This growth is vital, 
as SMEs not only provide essential products but also foster innovation and competition in the sector, resulting in better 
prices and quality for consumers (Burgos, 2019). However, despite their relevance, SMEs face numerous challenges 
that can affect their ability to operate efficiently and effectively in the market (Cruz & López, 2020).

6. Conclusions 
The key findings of this research demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing a Lean storage model in a small 
pharmaceutical trading company in Peru. The application of tools such as standardized work, the 5S methodology, 
and the Kanban system significantly reduced operational times and improved inventory management efficiency. 
Specifically, a 47% reduction in picking time, a 41% decrease in product obsolescence, and a 10.78% increase in 
service level, meeting industry standards, were observed. These results confirm that integrating Lean Manufacturing 
principles can generate substantial improvements in the competitiveness and sustainability of SMEs in the 
pharmaceutical sector. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to the knowledge and practice of inventory management in 
SMEs, a sector that often lacks specific studies. By addressing critical issues such as inefficiency in storage processes 
and the high rate of product obsolescence, this research provides a framework to optimize operations, improve service 
quality, and increase profitability. Additionally, it reinforces the idea that SMEs, despite their resource limitations, 
can significantly benefit from adopting Lean methodologies, enabling them to compete more effectively in a highly 
regulated and competitive market. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are numerous and significant. Firstly, this study expands the application of Lean 
Manufacturing in a sector that has been historically underexamined. Implementing the Lean model in a pharmaceutical 
SME not only improves operational efficiency but also provides an adaptable framework that can be used by other 
companies in similar contexts. Moreover, the results offer empirical evidence that Lean methodologies can be 
successfully adapted and applied in SMEs, overcoming the specific challenges of such organizations. This study also 
suggests that adopting tools like Kanban and 5S can improve not only internal efficiency but also customer satisfaction 
and market positioning. 
 
Regarding final observations and suggestions for further study, this work highlights the need for continued research 
into the application of Lean tools in SMEs within highly regulated sectors, such as the pharmaceutical industry. It is 
suggested that future studies explore the integration of emerging technologies, such as automation and the Internet of 
Things (IoT), to further enhance the efficiency and accuracy of inventory management and storage processes. 
Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate the long-term impact of Lean model implementation on the 
sustainability and growth of SMEs, as well as their ability to adapt to changes in demand and market regulations. This 
call to action encourages researchers to delve deeper into the application of Lean methodologies in SMEs and explore 
new directions that could contribute to the development of innovative and effective solutions in operations 
management.

Abstract 
The company where the research is being conducted belongs to the agricultural sector whose operations began in 
January 2021. It has 35 hectares of arable land and 20 employees exposed to the problem of occupational hazards due 
to inefficient management. The importance of this work is to provide workers with a risk-free work environment. The 
main objective of the research is to minimize occupational hazards through a pilot test design in which 3 tools were 
developed (ISO 45001, HIRARC Matrix, 5S) with the following methodology: organizational context, risk 
identification, risk treatment, monitoring and review in order to improve the low profitability of the company. As a 
result, the financial statements reflect the positive impact of the experimentation, where profitability improved from 
7% to 10% and the cost overrun of man-hours decreased in the cost of sales from 84% to 74%. With respect to the 
dashboards, in accordance with the optimum range requested by the company, the personnel efficiency index improved 
to 85%, the overall absenteeism rate to 3.5%, the personnel turnover rate to 5%, the accident rate to 0%, the training 
program to 100% and attendance at training courses to 90.8%.

Introduction
According to the World Bank Group agriculture in 2018 worldwide represented 4% of GDP so we notice there is an 
important gap to improve in this sector in order to contribute to economic growth, in developed countries it can be up 
to 25% of GDP, at the national level according to the Ministry of Agrarian Development and Irrigation - MIDAGRI 
in Peru agriculture represents 5.3% of GDP and employs 26% of the National EAP and 65.5% of the EAP of the rural 
area. According to MIDAGRI, agricultural activity is characterized by production disorder, decreased profitability 
and competitiveness due to the lack of a wholesale market system, which leads to high marketing costs that mainly 
affect agricultural producers, indicating that there are 7 intermediation links: producer, collector, transporter, 
wholesaler, distributor, retailer and consumer; therefore, the agricultural sector faces high costs, production losses, 
deficient infrastructure, and activities in the field require multiple technical assistance due to exposure to occupational 
hazards for proper business management.  
The company in which the research is developed is dedicated to the agricultural sector, with a cultivable land of 35 
hectares of which 10 are of olive trees with a total of 2,040 seedlings and 25 hectares for other bread products. For

6. Conclusions 
The check list carried out in accordance with ISO 45001 helped to identify the gaps for improvement that the 
company required as a baseline, with the HIRAC matrix we identified 64 occupational risks that the 20 workers 
are exposed to, with the 5S we mitigated the operational impacts and with the development of the 5 clauses of 
ISO 45001 we mitigated the administrative impacts, taking into account that the last clause will help the company 
to carry out and schedule half-yearly monitoring that will help to assess the rectification of impacts. 
 
When developing the indicators in the course of the development of the pilot test, the following results were 
obtained: personnel efficiency rate 85%, overall absenteeism rate 3.5%, personnel turnover rate 5%, accident 
rate 0%, training programme 100%, attendance at training courses 92.5%, all data are within the interval (to be) 
that the company handles as optimal data, however, it should be borne in mind that these results are from a time 
span of 6 months. 
 
With the results of the profit and loss statement as of 30 April 2023, it was possible to observe the recurrent 
problem of profitability of 7% and the cost overrun that the company presented in man-hours of 30-35% (table 
N° 3.3) reflected in the cost of sales in comparison to the financial statement as of 31 August 2023 (table N° 3.4) 
where the expenses of the pilot test are shown, reflecting the positive impact of the experimentation where 
profitability improved to 10% and the cost overrun in man-hours decreased in the cost of sales to 74%. 
 
Suggestions for the next stages of implementation of the research are to draw up a manual of functions and 
procedures according to the activities carried out per post, develop safety documents RIT (Internal Work 
Regulations), PETAR (written procedure for high-risk work), ATS (analysis of safe work), among others.

Abstract 
In the struggle to achieve environmental management goals, wind energy is essential. On the other side, the 
effectiveness of the wind turbines is a prerequisite for wind energy to reach its full potential. The purpose of the 
research is to examine how artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied to wind speed. In the context of wind 
speed forecasting, three network parameter optimization algorithms—AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam—are applied 
and contrasted in this work. The wind speed data used in this article came from the Saudi Arabian Jeddah Al Jazeera 
database. The four metrics used to evaluate performance are mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), 
root mean square error (RMSE), and R-squared. According to the experiment's findings, the Adam algorithm performs 
better than the other optimization techniques.

Abstract 
The validation scenario was conducted in a case study focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the 
bottled water industry, which play a vital role in Latin America, especially in Peru. Previous studies have highlighted 
inefficiencies, particularly in production processes, due to machine stoppages and poor inventory management. 
Existing research suggests that Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) can address these 
inefficiencies. The key challenge identified was the low production rate caused by unproductive activities during 
washing and packaging. Addressing this problem was critical to improving efficiency, lowering costs, and ensuring 
access to affordable, high-quality bottled water for the population. The study integrated Lean and TPM tools to create 
a model that increased productivity and reduced waste. The research findings showed a 48.79% reduction in washing 
process time and a 50.78% decrease in bottling process cycle time. Equipment availability rose to 76%, and production 
efficiency significantly improved, with a yield increase from 76.83% to 94.02%. The impact of this research was 
notable both academically and socioeconomically, providing SMEs with practical tools to enhance competitiveness 
and operational efficiency while supporting public health through better water accessibility. This study calls for further 
exploration of Lean and TPM integration in other sectors to unlock similar productivity gains and cost reductions.

1. Introduction
The bottled purified water small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) industry play a crucial role in the global 
economy, particularly in Latin America and Peru. This sector not only meets the growing demand for drinking water 
but also significantly contributes to local employment and economic development. According to recent studies, the 
bottled water market has experienced steady growth, driven by increasing concerns about health and water quality 
(Brei, 2017). In Latin America, access to quality drinking water remains a challenge, making bottled water SMEs 
essential for providing a safe alternative (Morinville, 2017). In Peru, the sector has seen a rise in investment and 
innovation, enabling these companies to compete in an increasingly saturated market (Ichoroh, 2021). However, 
despite their importance, bottled water SMEs face numerous challenges that limit their ability to operate efficiently 
and sustainably.

production time by nearly 50%. The production rate increased from 74.05 jugs per hour to 92.37 jugs per hour, 
achieving a 25.48% improvement in overall productivity. Furthermore, the application of TPM reduced machine 
downtime, increasing equipment availability from 73.45% to 76%. These results confirmed the effectiveness of 
integrating Lean and TPM methodologies to optimize production in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
The importance of this research lies in its potential to address widespread inefficiencies in the water bottling industry, 
a sector crucial for public health and the economy, particularly in developing countries. By enhancing operational 
efficiency, the implementation of these methodologies can reduce production costs, improve product quality, and 
ensure the timely delivery of essential resources such as purified water. These improvements also lead to better 
resource utilization, which is key to addressing the growing global demand for water while maintaining sustainability 
in production. 
 
In terms of contributions to the field, this study offers a practical framework for improving productivity in SMEs that 
can be applied across various industries. The integration of Lean Manufacturing and TPM provides a comprehensive 
approach to tackling both human and equipment-related inefficiencies. This model not only reduces waste and 
production time but also enhances equipment reliability and product quality. The research fills a gap in the literature 
concerning the application of these methodologies in the bottled water industry, which has often been overlooked 
compared to larger sectors. It serves as a reference for future studies looking to explore the combination of Lean and 
TPM in other industries. 
 
The final observations suggest that while this study has demonstrated significant improvements, there is still room for 
further exploration. Future research could focus on automating additional stages of the production process to further 
reduce human error and variability. Additionally, it is recommended to investigate the long-term sustainability of the 
improvements introduced, particularly in terms of cost savings and environmental impact. Understanding how these 
methodologies affect the workforce, including training and job satisfaction, would also provide valuable insights. 
Expanding this research to other industries and regions could help validate the model's applicability and refine its 
effectiveness. 
 
In conclusion, this research underscores the need for continued efforts to integrate process optimization methodologies 
in SMEs to enhance both productivity and competitiveness. As global demand for resources like purified water 
continues to rise, the lessons from this study serve as a call to action for both industry leaders and researchers to 
explore further innovations in Lean Manufacturing and TPM. Embracing these methodologies is essential not only for 
improving operational efficiency but also for ensuring long-term sustainability and growth in critical sectors.

Abstract 
This research examines inventory management of machine spare parts in the prepared food manufacturing industry. 
The objective is to determine the optimal order quantity for a case study company and compare costs before and after 
analyzing the appropriate order quantity using the Silver-Meal Heuristic. Based on theoretical studies and detailed 
data from the case study company, which specializes in manufacturing and importing food industry machinery along 
with after-sales services, the complexity of inventory management becomes apparent. The case study company faces 
high inventory management costs, primarily due to a lack of effective ordering tools and reliance on employee 
expertise for ordering processes. To identify the optimal order quantities, an analysis was conducted using ABC 
Analysis and FSN Analysis, resulting in a Matrix Analysis that categorized products into nine groups. Groups AF, 
AN, and AS, comprising 44, 164, and 278 items respectively, represent the highest value products, totaling 
$715,878.33 per year, which accounts for 80% of the total inventory value. Further analysis of variance coefficients 
showed that these groups had a relatively stable variance, with only 13 items having a variance less than 0.25 and 172 
items exceeding this threshold. The results indicate that inventory costs before applying the Silver-Meal technique 
amounted to $152,804.03 per year. After implementation, the costs decreased to $97,994.70 per year, demonstrating 
a reduction of $54,809.32 annually. Thus, the application of the Silver-Meal technique significantly improved 
inventory cost efficiency.

1. Introduction
The ready-to-eat food industry heavily relies on both the domestic market and exports. Domestic sales are projected 
to contract by 1.0% to 2.0% in 2023 due to the diminishing impact of COVID-19. However, an average growth rate 
of 3.0% to 4.0% per year is expected from 2024 to 2026, driven by factors such as increasing purchasing power and 
the development of health-focused products. Meanwhile, exports are anticipated to grow by 2.7% in 2023, with an 
average growth rate of 5.0% to 6.0% expected between 2024 and 2026. Despite the potential for growth, risks remain 
from variable weather conditions, taxation, high living costs, and geopolitical conflicts, all of which can impact

Summary 
It is concluded that in one year, a total of 9 orders for this product code are necessary. Given the relatively high 
holding cost per unit, it is most suitable to place orders on a monthly basis according to customer demand. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The ABC-FSN Matrix analysis underscores the significance of categorizing products based on their value and 
turnover rates. The product categories are as follows: 
• 
Group AF: 44 items, valued at 274,352.52 USD 
• 
Group AS: 70 items, valued at 150,748.83 USD 
• 
Group AN: 164 items, valued at 290,776.99 USD 
• 
Group BF: 9 items, valued at 3,179.23 USD 
• 
Group BS: 35 items, valued at 11,726.05 USD 
• 
Group BN: 480 items, valued at 118,730.98 USD 
• 
Group CF: 3 items, valued at 81.34 USD 
• 
Group CS: 14 items, valued at 731.65 USD 
• 
Group CN: 2,548 items, valued at 43,887.80 USD 
 
From the above data, it is evident that the product groups requiring attention or improvement are Groups AF, AN, and 
AS, which together have a total value of 715,878.35 USD, accounting for 80% of the total inventory value. Therefore, 
these groups will be selected for purchase order analysis with the aim of determining optimal order quantities, which 
will enable the case study company to effectively compare costs before and after the analysis. 
 
Additionally, an analysis of Groups AF, AN, and AS to calculate the variability coefficient revealed that there are 172 
product codes with unstable variability. When comparing the current purchasing method with the Silver-Meal 
Heuristic, it was found that the total purchasing cost under the current method amounts to 152,804.03 USD, while 
using the Silver-Meal technique results in a total purchasing cost of 97,994.70 USD. This indicates a potential 
reduction in purchasing costs of 54,809.32 USD per year.

Abstract 
This paper explores the role of sustainable commuting options in enhancing employee well-being across both 
government and private sectors. The primary goal is to assess the impact of sustainable transportation choices 
such as walking, biking, carpooling, and public transit on reducing emissions, improving air quality, minimizing 
traffic congestion, and promoting better health among employees. Furthermore, the study investigates how 
flexible work arrangements, including telecommuting and off-site work, can reduce commute-related stress 
and improve work-life balance. Sustainable commuting not only offers environmental benefits like a significant 
reduction in carbon footprint but also enhances employees' physical and mental well-being, contributing to increased 
job satisfaction and reduced stress levels. This paper aims to highlight these outcomes by focusing on both individual 
and organizational perspectives. A quantitative analysis method was employed to quantify these impacts, with data 
collection focused on governmental employees and those in the private sector. The analysis used the R 
programming language to examine the statistical correlations between commuting habits and their environmental 
and personal health effects. By identifying the influence of sustainable commuting on employee well-being 
and its contribution to environmental conservation, this study aims to provide actionable insights for 
policymakers, organizations, and employees to adopt sustainable commuting as a strategy to foster a 
healthier, more balanced, and environmentally friendly working culture.

Abstract 
With the new arrangements of work setup, such as working from home due to COVID-19, there are benefits as well 
as challenges that need to be addressed, including but not limited to environmental workplace suitability and possibly 
obesity. The Department of Health and several related organizations stated that among Filipino adolescents, 
overweight has tripled in the last 15 years. Additionally, there is a gradually increasing trend, with 3 out of 10 Filipino 
adults classified as overweight and obese. This study shall be a guide for the Human Resources department and 
industrial engineers to develop a way to manage and alleviate obesity complications in the workplace. The study aimed 
to determine the factors that affect BMI and predict what variable significantly influences it. The researchers focused 
on employees who are in a work-from-home setup and are still experiencing working from home in the Philippines. 
The researchers utilized SPSS to analyze the data. The data was analyzed by using regression analysis, specifically 
Multiple Linear Regression. The predictive model created was shown to be significant. The two significant 
independent values, specifically, Fast food Consumption and Work Stress, were determined by looking at the 
significant values in the coefficients table.  The data and model satisfied the multiple linear regression assumptions; 
thus, the model is valid. Given the results, the proponents recommend that the company, especially HR employee 
relations officers, implement policies and create programs that promote eating habits as well as alleviate work stress 
in the workplace.

1. Introduction
Ever since the pandemic hit the world, more and more adults have started working from home. The prevalence of 
work-from-home (WFH) arrangements in firms has grown in recent decades, primarily due to advancements in 
information and communication technologies (ICT), which have revolutionized everyday work and life in the 21st

Table 13. Residual Statistics Table 
 
 
 
The table above (Table 13) shows the Cook’s Distance, which determines if there are any significant outliers. 
According to Penn State University, if the data value is more than 0.5, a significant outlier may be influential. In the 
table shown above, both the minimum and maximum of Cook’s Distance have a value of 0.000 and 0.106, respectively. 
This indicates that there are no significant outliers that may influence the data. 
 
And lastly, the last assumption is to determine if multicollinearity exists in the data. It goes back to Table 8, focusing 
on the Collinearity Statistics column, specifically Tolerance and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). According to Daoud 
(2017), having tolerance values of less than 0.1 indicates collinearity. For the VIF, the perfect value that shows no 
multicollinearity is 1. To indicate whether it has multicollinearity is if the VIF value is 5 to 10 or lower than 0.1 to 
0.2. For the values, it is shown that they are both within the range, which indicates that there is no multicollinearity. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The arrival of COVID-19 has forced companies to shift their work to Work from Home (WFH). Due to its flexibility 
for workers, companies have still implemented this setup. However, the rise of WFH workers, especially in the 
Philippines, contributed to the prevalence of obesity.  Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease that accumulates 
excess body fat and leads to adverse effects on health. Determining the body classification such as obese, body mass 
index (BMI) is computed. Due to limited movement, many employees or workers engage in insufficient physical 
activity, leading to obesity. Thus, it is crucial to determine not all but possible leading causes that contribute to 
obesity.  
 
In conclusion, two significant independent variables, namely, work stress and fast food consumption, affect the 
Work-from-home employees' body mass index (BMI). As observed in the SPSS results, the P-values of these 
independent variables are 0.034 and 0.021, respectively. A hypothesis test that acquires less than 0.05 entails that it 
is statistically significant (Bobbitt, 2021). On the other hand, factors like employee satisfaction, cigarette 
consumption, alcohol intake, and job satisfaction do not contribute to the increase in BMI in the respondents. 
 
Given that it has been found in the study that the significant effects that contribute to the obesity of work-from-home 
employees are the factors of fast-food consumption and work stress, it is recommended that, especially its HR 
Employee Relations officers to implement policies or create programs that will promote healthy eating habits as well 
as alleviate work stress—encouraging their employees to participate in several trainings and seminars, as well as 
supporting/providing healthy choices from respective cafeterias and vending machines. 
 
The researchers could further explore different variables that could be affecting the obesity of work-from-home 
employees. Since there are a lot of variables that could affect obesity, the researchers have opted for the independent 
variables that are presented in this research. Having more variables can showcase a whole different result for future

research. The demographic variables can also be increased as this study is limited to the Philippines. The number of 
respondents can be increased to extensively analyze the different lifestyles of several populations.

Abstract 
Safety has been said to be the priority in all sectors of society. Although safety has been a priority, there has been an 
emerging trend of unsafe acts involving Gen Z Filipinos (PSA, 2022). The emergence of unsafe acts of Generation Z 
Filipinos have been unnoticed, this study focuses on understanding factors influencing behavioral intentions in safety 
culture. The study aimed to investigate the factors that influence behavioral intention in safety culture among those 
born within Gen Z. A survey questionnaire was constructed with various variables such as Risk Perception, Safety 
Knowledge & Practices, Technology Use, Perceived Behavioral Control, Social Norms, Attitude toward the Behavior, 
Perceived Severity, Perceived Vulnerability, Physical Ergonomics, Cognitive Ergonomics and Macro-Ergonomics are 
considered. A total of 505 respondents answered the survey questionnaire. The results showed that Risk Perception, 
Safety Knowledge & Practices, Perceived Vulnerability, Social Norms, Attitude toward the Behavior and Macro-
Ergonomics provided a significant impact to the Perceived Behavioral Intention in Safety Culture of Gen Z Filipinos. 
The findings can be used to inform and develop policies in improving the safety culture of Gen Z Filipinos.

1. Introduction
Safety culture involves shared attitudes, values, and perceptions, playing a key role in risk management by evaluating 
psychological and behavioral factors. Its goal is to reduce losses by identifying risks and their causes. The Institute of 
Occupational Safety and Health emphasized the importance of individual behavior in risk management as the United 
Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) stated that risk management in disasters plays a role in the 
establishment of resilience and reduction of losses. 
In 2021, the WHO reported nearly 2 million workers are exposed to 19 occupational risk factors, primarily from non-
communicable diseases and injuries. It was said by the International Labour Organization that Asia and the Pacific 
accounted for 1.2 million of these deaths. It is stated by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 
Younger workers, especially those under 25, face higher injury rates. Human errors like neglect, fatigue, and poor 
training cause 80-90% of workplace accidents.

Abstract 
The migration of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) significantly impacts their families, particularly the academic 
performance of children left behind. This study investigates the effects of four key factors: a child's mental health, the 
duration of separation from the parent, physical separation, and personality type. Findings reveal that both mental 
health and years of separation are crucial to academic performance, with physical separation serving a mediating role. 
The study recommends that OFWs prioritize their children's mental health and maintain consistent communication to 
mitigate the effects of separation. It also suggests further research on the interplay between parental involvement, 
personality traits, and academic success to understand better how parents can effectively support their children in 
navigating these challenges. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of addressing the emotional and 
psychological well-being of children whose parents are OFWs. It emphasizes the need for support systems and 
resources to help these children cope with separation and maintain their academic performance. Furthermore, the 
research suggests that schools and communities should be more active in supporting and guiding OFW children, such 
as counseling services, mentorship programs, and academic assistance. By addressing the multifaceted challenges 
OFW children face, we can help ensure their overall well-being and academic success.

1. Introduction
The wish to provide for a family back home is engraved in a Filipino parent. It is in them to give their children better 
opportunities for education and a lot more within the context of ensuring enhancement to their family’s lives. What 
comes with giving them a better life is that they must be willing to be separated from their families through working

6. Conclusion and Future Research 
This study explored the effects of parental migration on children's academic performance by analyzing factors such 
as Mental Health, Years of Separation, MBTI classification, and Physical Separation from an OFW parent. Using 
PLS-SEM, the researchers found that Mental Health and Years of Separation significantly impacted the student's 
academic performance. Mental health affected motivation and interest, while more extended periods of parental 
separation led to lower academic performance. Contrary to previous studies, MBTI and physical separation alone were 
insignificant factors. The study also identified mediating variables, with Years of Separation influencing both mental 
health and MBTI concerning academic outcomes. 
 
Relating to B.F. Skinner's Theory of Learning, the study highlighted that mental health and parental separation act as 
stimuli impacting academic behavior. The analysis showed how mental health issues, such as anxiety from separation, 
could hinder academic success. Additionally, the study used reliable psychometric measures, such as Cronbach's 
Alpha, and fit indices like SRMR and NFI, to confirm the validity and accuracy of its findings. The research 
emphasizes the importance of mental health and prolonged separation in shaping academic outcomes, recommending 
communication strategies and professional support as key interventions. 
 
The study recommends future research to delve deeper into significant factors, explore alternative data collection 
methods, expand the sample size, and investigate the relationship between parental involvement, children's personality 
traits, and academic performance. This would contribute to a better understanding of the challenges faced by OFW 
children and provide tailored strategies to support their academic success.

Abstract 
Retirement can come with difficulties, particularly in the Philippines, where a considerable large number of seniors 
lived below the poverty line. Despite Social Security System (SSS) contributors expecting a maximum monthly 
pension of Php 20,000, most retirees lack adequate funds, highlighting the urgent need for effective retirement 
planning. This study investigates retirement planning among National Capital Region (NCR) private sector 
employees, focusing on factors like income, lifestyle, savings patterns, investment knowledge, health, and 
generational differences while considering demographic moderators such as age, sex, type of company 
(local/multinational), total years of work experience, years of work experience in the current company, and salary. 
The research, involving 204 participants, employed WarpPLS and PLS-SEM for statistical analysis. The results 
showed that investment knowledge, employee health, and generational differences significantly affect retirement 
planning. Additionally, demographic factors like age, sex, company type, work experience, and salary play key roles 
in shaping retirement outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, employers, and 
individuals, emphasizing the need for customized retirement strategies to meet the diverse needs of NCR private sector 
employees.

1. Introduction
As people grow older, it is only natural that they come to a point where they stop working and rely on their savings to 
fend for themselves. People’s lifestyles change when they retire. Full-time jobs end with retirement, relieving people 
of their daily work in the office. According to Republic Act 7641 or the Retirement Pay Law of the Philippines, an

6.Conclusion 
The study has, therefore, effectively answered all the research objectives, satisfying the assumptions for focusing on 
key factors that affect retirement planning with an understanding of moderating factors of age, sex, work experience, 
and type of company. Hypothesis 1 of investment knowledge, hypothesis 2 of employee health, and hypothesis 4 of 
generational differences were supported because they had valid positive direct effects on retirement planning. 
Furthermore, control variables, including the years of work experience and salary in the current company, enabled a 
further understanding of how these elements affect retirement preparedness across demographic groups. Interestingly, 
years of work experience as the demographic variable was found to moderate more than one relationship. The research 
also adds value to the body of knowledge by emphasizing the impacts of health status and generational perceptions 
on retirement planning. Besides, it re-emphasizes this progressive research endeavor of the conspicuous need to adopt 
a unique way of dealing with individual differences and other organizational factors that would provide a better 
retirement experience for the employees. This study will help policymakers, employers, and employees understand 
the rationale behind creating better retirement planning programs that address the uniqueness of their workers. Lastly, 
a conclusion has been drawn regarding early retirement planning to enable post-employment life to be economically 
and financially sustainable.

7. Conclusion 
Applying the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial automation is a major technological advancement in 
decision making. Real-time analysis of extensive data as well as adaptability when it comes to the conditions has made 
AI an essential part of present industries such as predictive maintenance, process improvement, and robotics. However, 
there are critical issues that converge with the use of an AI system for industrial automation; for instance, compatibility 
issues when automating different systems, data quality and preparing the AI system for decision-making complexities, 
high costs and energy of real-time operational automation. Further, the ethical issue and security concerns are also 
some of the issues that should warrant handling before the implementation of the technology can take place.  
  
However, using the study, it becomes clear that AI and more specifically machine learning, neural networks, and 
reinforcement learning models present the required tools to improve operational performance, minimize the 
interference of human elements and make best decisions in a contexted environment. Currently, industries are shifting 
toward more intelligent and self-optimizing systems due to improvements of AI technologies including the IoT and 
edge computation. For AI to be efficiently utilized in industrial automation there are a number of challenges that have 
been pointed out and below will be advisable to avoid them; Adequate policies and faculties will be required to support 
the use of AI.  
  
In conclusion, the application of AI automation is still in the growth stage but the above disclosers have portrayed that 
it is stretching the process of Industrialization in several ways. While future developments in the automation of 
transport systems will continue to look for ways of mitigating such developments for the present, next generation 
systems are only likely to be even more robust, effective, and sustainable than the present ones.

Abstract 
Big data analysis is a discipline that is gaining momentum as used by big corporations, big institutions and 
governments for decision-making purposes. Corporations that use big data analytics are able to increase their 
profitability by up to 60%. However, SMEs are finding it difficult to adopt and implement big data analytics owing to 
limited access to human resources, such as a skilled labour force that is able to manage and analyse data, and 
insufficient financial resources. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis in which 534 documents were extracted 
from Scopus databases. The top 20 leading authors with the most documents, citations and keywords are outlined and 
discussed in this paper. Density visualisation and an overlay visualisation for 2012 to 2022 are depicted and discussed. 
The study found that “SMEs”, “suitability”, “e-marketing”, “e-services”, “efficiency”, “developing countries”, 
“Africa” and “South Africa” were the dominant terms used in the documents accessed. This study recommends that 
collaborations be formed between institutions of higher learning and government departments that support SMEs and 
focus on science and innovation to speed up the adoption of big data analytics and increase research in the area. The 
field would benefit from future studies on the different frameworks that SMEs can use when adopting and 
implementing big data analytics.

1. Introduction
Currently, global data exceeds the manual count and, in some cases, exceeds the traditional databases. Since there is 
increasingly more data in the world, different organisations are looking for ways to take advantage of the data. Provost 
and Fawcett (2013) state that organisations have realised the importance of hiring data scientists and institutions of 
higher learning are introducing academic programmes in data science. In 2019, the Rector of the University of the 
United Nations, Prof. Tshilidzi Marwala, penned an article published by Forbes Africa in which he suggested that big 
data is the new gold (Marwala 2019). Along the same line, Talagala (2023) has called big data the new oil. Elaborating 
on this comparison, Talagala (2023) cautions that, like oil, if data is not refined it will not be useful. Big data analytics 
can be used to refine big data, with Coleman et al. (2016) suggesting that the adoption and implementation of big data 
analytics provide organisations with information that can be used for decision-making (Alberto et al. 2019). However, 
Alberto et al. (2019) point out that big data analytics is largely adopted by big firms and large organisations, with 
SMEs known to be slow adopters of this technology.  
SMEs are known to play a significant role in the countries in which they are located. Globally, formal SMEs contribute 
about 70% to employment and between 50% and 60% to the gross domestic product (GDP) of developed nations. In

6. Conclusion 
Bibliometric analysis is a growing research area in the business, management and accounting discipline, according to 
the analysis of the Scopus databases, with many articles published in the field compared to other documents. Research 
also shows that big data analytics plays an important role in increasing the profitability of a business by increasing its 
sustainability. However, there are a range of challenges associated with the adoption and implementation of big data 
analytics. As this study followed a bibliometric analysis, it outlined the leading authors in the field of big data analytics 
for SMEs. The benefits of using big data analytics in emerging markets by SMEs were also outlined and discussed. 
The following objectives were addressed: 
 
1.1.1 
To identify challenges that SMEs face when they adopt and implement big data analytics. 
1.1.2 
To identify the leading authors in the field of big data analytics adoption and implementation by SMEs. 
1.1.3 
To identify what was studied between the years 2012 and 2022. 
1.1.4 
To identify opportunities that SMEs reap when they adopt and implement big data analytics. 
 
The practical implications of this study to industry personnel are that they will know the key factors that will play an 
essential role in adopting big data analytics for SMEs. This will help them understand how and where to prioritise 
their resources to ensure employees get the support they need to adopt big data analytics. Furthermore, they will know 
the challenges they will face when adopting big data analytics. In addition, understanding the challenges will help 
them propose solutions upfront, as adopting big data analytics is paramount to the business's success. Similarly, 
policymakers will have a clear picture of what SMEs encounter when they adopt and implement big data analytics. 
This can influence their policies on IT governance to make it easier for SMEs to adopt big data analytics. 
 
Furthermore, to provide training on data management policy to SMEs and ensure sufficient IT infrastructure for them 
to use and be compatible. Academics will know the leading authors and the frequently used keywords and learn about 
similar studies. For researchers wishing to study the adoption of big data analytics by SMEs, they will understand 
what has been studied. 
 
In conclusion, it is important to note that authors play a crucial role in providing a perspective on what has been studied 
and by whom. Collaborative efforts between government departments that deal with science and technology, small 
businesses, and institutions of higher learning, as recommended by this study, will increase research and drive 
innovation towards technology adoption. Future research could review the impact of big data analytics on informal 
small businesses.

Abstract 
The present study addresses the challenges faced by a dairy company in the distribution of sales in the northern region 
of Peru. Through the implementation of the Impact-Feasibility Matrix engineering tool, the company was able to select 
the best option from those generated in a brainstorming session by ranking various factors. This led to a 14% increase 
in gross sales, a 64% reduction in sales discounts, and an enhanced negotiating power and commercial strategy 
compared to the distributor, resulting in a 16% increase in net sales. With the improvement of sales indicators and 
cost reductions, there was a 29% increase in gross profit and a 10% increase in operating profit. Previously, distribution 
was managed by a supplier facing working capital issues and insufficient service to retail customers, allowing 
competitors to gain market share in a sector primarily served by retail channels. Following the process improvement 
in this area, it was concluded that it is more feasible and impactful for the company itself to manage the distribution 
to the retail channel, replacing the outsourcing company. This implementation demonstrated a clear improvement in 
commercial management indicators.

1. Introduction
According to Bernet (1998), in the years leading up to 2000, Peru experienced growth in the demand for dairy products, 
which increased in the main production areas despite the high competition from imported products. It was concluded 
that the prosperity of Peruvian dairy production would depend on the industry's ability to compete with the growing 
demand for imported dairy products. 
Piskulich (2001) supports this by detailing that the per capita milk consumption in Peru was 45 kg per person per year, 
a level that was still low compared to the minimum recommended consumption by the FAO of 120 kg per person per 
year. This leads the author to conclude that the Peruvian dairy industry must aim to provide the population with 
sufficient quantities of dairy products, ensuring quality and competitive prices, in order to change Peru's image in the 
South American market from importer to exporter. 
After a macro review of the dairy sector, we delve into the area of improvement related to the case study: distribution. 
According to Ligña et al. (2018), the dairy sector in general suffers from a lack of control over delivery times for 
orders, which impacts the efficiency of shipments and orders, as the distribution and transportation of products are not 
carried out properly. 
The Peruvian dairy sector is fragmented, with a small group of large companies dominating the market. These 
companies have been losing market share, particularly in provincial areas, to emerging companies, highlighting the 
need for larger firms to improve their distribution levels and regain market share in key regions of Peru (Euromonitor, 
2023).

reduction of 64% was achieved, primarily due to closer management of prices and promotions, as well as effective 
management of merchandise in transit and warehouses, allowing them to consistently meet the needs of the retail 
sector. 
 
Sales and transportation costs increased, directly related to the rise in sales levels, which allowed for a first line of 
profitability corresponding to Gross Profit, with a growth of 29% compared to the similar prior period. In the case of 
Operating Profit, after accounting for expenses related to the implementation of distribution, an increase of 10% was 
achieved compared to the previous year (Table 4).

6. Conclusion 
This case study on the implementation of improvements in sales distribution for the retail sector in a strategic area of 
Peru allowed for increased sales levels and business profitability. This was achieved through the use of the engineering 
tool Impact-Feasibility Matrix, which identified the best alternative through a prior evaluation of weighted factor 
ranking, selecting the solution located in the “Strategic” quadrant of the matrix, corresponding to high impact – high 
feasibility. 
 
After the project was implemented and considering an evaluation of the closed period following the improvement, 
favorable commercial management indicators were obtained for the business. Net sales increased by $4.2 million (a 
16% increase). In the gross cost category related to promotional discounts, a significant reduction of $500,000 was 
achieved over the annual period, representing a 64% decrease compared to the period prior to implementation. 
Regarding the profitability indicator, a gross profit increase of 10% was achieved, equivalent to $600,000. 
 
With the aforementioned data, which represent a positive variation in the results for the retail sector business line, we 
can conclude that the use of the engineering tool Impact-Feasibility Matrix, complemented by Brainstorming and the 
ranking of factors, allows for the identification of the alternative with the highest margin of implementation and 
effectiveness for a diagnosed problem. In this case study, it pertains to sales distribution for the retail sector in a 
strategic area of Peru.

Abstract 
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems prove their usefulness, new models of methodologies, and advancements in 
accuracy and fluency every day across all the different operations worldwide. Today, AI applications have become 
more urbane and involve the different types of human intelligence of culture, demographics, and the development of 
computing systems, as well as the ability to perform various tasks to manage visual perception, speech recognition, 
and translation between languages. As these developments occur, tremendous leaps forward in capability and 
availability will be made, representing an opportunity for additional military applications of AI. However, how AI 
can help different countries manage security in line with the ongoing pace of AI in the defense sector is still not 
clear. Thus, this paper is a novel effort at the potential use of AI, the landscape of technological research on AI, and 
development captured from India's Atmanirbhar Bharat program and tries to fill the gap. A detailed review is carried 
out on AI in defense, and its emergence from history to current times is brought to the fore; the review focuses on 
deterrence demands, sufficient technologies to be internalized, and the ability to apply them for safer control over 
discrete and remote defense operations. Based on the mixed methods approach, the paper presents a qualitative 
synthesis of the modernization of defense, using AI, and technological and operable challenges that may be thrown 
up for broad applications of AI systems. This qualitative and conceptual study shows the implications of how India 
could take a new path or approach to leverage AI and optimize its security apparatus in ways that can enhance the 
economy's growth.

Abstract 
Nutrition practices are often the most important causes of malnutrition in adults. Nutritional support in critically ill 
patients prevent from muscle wastage, proteolysis and metabolic deterioration. Decrease in length of hospital stay, 
improvement in the patients condition, outcomes have attracted the use of nutrition support in critically ill patients. 
This is an comparative observational study. The objective of the study was to Identify the malnutrition of critically 
ill patients. A questionnaire was designed to collect the data about general information about the patients like age, 
martial status, religion, income, medical history etc; and also the anthropometric measurements as well as physical 
activity, life style and socio demographic factors and clinical status of the patients. We are including the age criteria 
of 21-70 years who are having one or more co morbidities. We are not including the Pediatrics, women who are 
pregnant, lactation and below the age of 21 years. And also duration of this study is 3 months. Nutrition can be 
provided in en number of ways based on the condition of an individual person. They are oral nutrition, enteral 
nutrition and parental nutrition. Our main focus is on how nutrition plays a major role in critical care patients, 
Adequate nutrition remains essentials for the long term rehabilitation and the outcomes for emphasizing on the 
sufficient nutritional supplementation for long term patients.  Various physio-metabolic changes occur in critically 
ill patients. Due to severe catabolism occurring in patients which may lead to malnutrition.

1. Introduction
Critically ill patients require adequate nutritional support to meet energy requirement both during and after intensive 
care unit (ICU) to protect against severe catabolism and prevent significant deconditioning. ICU patient often suffer 
from  chronic critical illness causing an increase in energy expenditure , leading proteolysis and muscle loss. 
Malnutrition and muscle wasting generally occur during ICU stay due to the effect of catabolic hormones, an 
imbalance between intake and requirements but also as a result of physical immobilization. Malnutrition is highly 
prevalent in critically ill patients and is associated with the increased healthcare-related cost and poor patient 
outcomes. Identifying the factors associated with under nutrition may assist nutritional care.  
Nutritional support in critically ill patients prevent from muscle wastage, proteolysis and metabolic deterioration. 
Cautions enhancement of nutrition and  modification of caloric and protein intake can avoid under nutrition or 
overfeeding, which is associated with poorer outcomes in the patients. Indirect calorimetry is the preferred assessing 
nutritional tool for the resting energy and the suitable caloric and protein intake to counter the energy and muscle 
loss. Nutrition can be termed in many ways. In simple terms it can be defined as a essential nutrients to meet the 
daily needs of an health individual adults .It is a process of providing and obtaining necessary nutrients for the 
health and growth. 
Physical exercise in terms of physiotherapy may have a favorable effects on muscle care and should be considered

Conclusion
To identify the nutritional risk in patient’s according to NRS 2002 and SGA tool are generally apply as both shows 
identical outcome and 30%  were at high risk of malnutrition reported by Nutric score screening tool, the ICU 
patients require adequate nutritional support to meet their daily energy and protein requirements. Inadequate protein 
intake is one of the major cause of malnutrition. Better outcome can be obtained with the help of Nutric score. 
Nutric score had effective overall performance in the diagnosis of severe malnutrition in an ICU setting. As 
according to SGA all subjects categorized under mild moderately nourished whereas in accord with Nutric score 
30% are associated with worse clinical outcome (Mortality / Ventilation) can be benefited from aggressive nutrition 
therapy. So early identification of nutritional risk in ICU patients with the help of Nutric score is essential to 
decrease the risk of Mortality and Ventilation.

Abstract 
Rotationally symmetric optical imaging systems have been considered which means that, the diffraction effects 
along with aberrations limit the performance of the optical systems. A rotationally symmetric optical system is that 
system, which has the same properties on the circumference of any circle and whose center lies on the symmetry 
axis of the system. Further it is also assumed that the optical system is isoplanatic (the imaging properties do not 
change over a certain distance in the image plane) where, if the object point changes in its location, the image point 
changes only in its location but not in functional form. The diffracted field characteristics have been studied for 
circular apertures in the presence of defocus under the influence of intensity variation to assess the performance of 
the optical imaging systems. Throughout this work rotationally symmetric optical imaging systems have been 
considered which means that, the diffraction effects along with aberrations limit the performance of the optical 
systems.

Abstract 
The goal of this study is to evaluate the WLB of migratory labours in Telangana's industrial sector using a purpose 
sampling technique and Chi-Square test analysis. Telangana's industrial sector, which is rapidly growing, attracts a 
large number of migrant labourers looking for job. However, the surge of migratory labours frequently raises worries 
about their work-life balance, given the difficulties they have in adjusting to a new environment although endeavouring 
toward attacks a strong equilibrium amid their specialized responsibilities, individual exists. A purpose sampling 
technique was used to pick a sample of 100 migrant labourers working in diverse industries throughout Telangana. 
This strategy allowed for the careful selection of individuals who accurately represent the migrant's demographic, 
vocational variety. Data were obtained using structured questionnaires to examine numerous features of WLB, like 
work hours, job satisfaction, social support, and overall well-being. The Chi-Square test was used in the analysis to 
investigate the relationship between demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education level, job-related 
aspects and migrant workers' opinions of work-life balance. The Chi-Square test allowed for the examination of 
potential links, differences within the data set, providing insights into the elements that have a major impact on WLB 
among migratory labours in Telangana's industrial sector. The findings emphasize the necessity of taking demographic, 
occupational characteristics into account when resolving discrepancies in WLB experiences among migrant workers. 
Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of besieged involvements then rules meant at enlightening the 
quality of life for migratory labours in Telangana's industrial landscape

1. Introduction
In recent decades, the industrial landscape of Telangana has undergone significant transformation, emerging as a hub 
of economic activity and industrial growth in India. This rapid development has been accompanied by an influx of 
migratory labours from various regions across the country, drawn by the promise of employment opportunities and 
economic prosperity. As these migratory labours become integral to the workforce in Telangana's industrial sector, it 
becomes imperative to examine the subtleties of their WLB and its inferences aimed at their happiness and output. 
The notion of WLB takes garnered increasing attention in both academic literature and organizational practice, 
reflecting a growing recognition of the importance of harmonizing work responsibilities with personal and family life. 
Achieving a satisfactory equilibrium amid effort and additional facets of lifetime is essential aimed at promoting 
individual well-being, job satisfaction, and overall quality of life. However, for migratory labors in the industrial

Null Hypothesis (H0): Organizational factors have no significant impact on the WLBof migratory labors in the 
industrial sector. 
Chi-square Calculation: 
χ² = Σ [(Observed - Expected) ² / Expected] 
Expected frequency for each cell = (row total * column total) / grand total 
We computed the expected frequencies for each cell under the assumption of no association between organizational 
factors and WLB among migrant workers. Then, we compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies 
using the chi-square test. 
Degrees of Freedom (df) = (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1) = (3 - 1) * (3 - 1) = 4 
χ² ≈ 11.03 
Χ² (α = 0.05, df = 4) ≈ 9.488 (from chi-square distribution table) 
The calculated chi-square value is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is 
a significant association between organizational factors and WLB among migrant workers. 
 
6. Conclusions 
After evaluating the χ², we interpret it by comparing the circumstance to the critical value. If the estimated chi-square 
value is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, showing a statistically significant relationship 
between organizational characteristics and WLB among migrant workers. The predictable χ², stands lesser than the 
CV, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no meaningful relationship between the two variables.  
Based on the chi-square test conducted to analyse the association between organizational factors (such as workplace 
culture, policies, and support mechanisms) and the WLB of migratory labors in the industrial sector, the following 
conclusions can be drawn from the data analysis and interpretation: Workplace Culture: The chi-square test results 
indicate a significant association between workplace culture and the WLB of migratory labors (χ² = [calculated chi-
square value]). This suggests that the perceived impact of workplace culture on WLB varies among migrant workers, 
with a majority indicating either positive or neutral effects. However, a smaller proportion of workers perceive a 
negative impact of workplace culture on their work-life balance. Policies: The analysis reveals a significant association 
between organizational policies and the WLB of migrant work ers (χ² = [calculated chi-square value]). This indicates 
that organizational policies show a part in shaping the WLB knowledges of migrant workers, with varying perceptions 
among individuals. While some workers view organizational policies positively, others may perceive them as having 
a neutral or negative impact on their work-life balance. 
 
In conclusion, the findings of the chi-square test indicate that organizational factors, including workplace culture, 
policies, and support mechanisms, have a significant impact on the WLB of migratory labours in the industrial sector. 
These factors influence the perceived WLB experiences of workers, with insinuations aimed at worker welfare, job 
satisfaction, and organizational effectiveness. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to recognize the importance 
of creating supportive work environments and implementing effective policies and practices to enhance the WLB of 
migratory labour’s and promote overall employee health and productivity. Further research and interventions may be 
warranted to address specific areas of concern identified in the study and optimize the WLB experiences of migratory 
labours in the industrial sector.

Abstract 
MSD and loss of static muscular strength is one of the most common work-related problems among handicraft workers 
who perform labour-intensive and repetitive jobs by hand. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the MSD risk and 
physical strength of glass artware workers. Digital grip dynamometers were utilised to measure the maximal hand grip 
and pinch strength of 120 male operators. The glass artware workers have dramatically variable levels of static muscle 
strength. The variation in grip strength between the right and left hands demonstrates the critical function that 
prolonged use of hand tools plays in developing muscle strength. These results suggest that repetitive use of hand 
tools causes significant variations in static muscle strength. Workers had much lower observed values of muscle 
strength in their dominant hand. According to this study, hand tool interventions with an ergonomic design are 
necessary in order to potentially prevent the progressive loss of static muscular power.

1. Introduction
It has been observed that SME's employ a large portion of the labour population and are the primary source of revenue 
for developing nations worldwide, especially in emerging economies (Hermawati et al., 2014). Therefore, significant 
efforts are focused on the growth of these industries in order to support the economic development of these nations 
(Reverente 1992). Consequently, SMEs face more occupational dangers and risks than large businesses due to their 
limited resources and technical capacity. Since SMEs are frequently disregarded by current safety and health rules, 
the situation is getting worse in emerging nations. According to Hill (2002), SMEs typically cater to tiny, local markets 
and have extremely bad working conditions, low worker productivity, unstable employment, and hazardous working 
circumstances. These factors also lead to low product quality. According to reports, efforts pertaining to occupational 
health and safety in developing nations have mostly targeted large-scale businesses, although small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), particularly those engaged in home-based arts and crafts, constitute a significant and often-ignored 
segment of these economies (Mc Cann, 1996). Lack of knowledge about occupational hazards and their mitigation 
strategies in this field is one of the main shortcomings of occupational health programs in developing nations 
(Loewenson 2000). Consequently, the national productivity as well as the worker's quality of life would be greatly 
impacted by greater focus on enhancing the working environment and health and safety issues in this industry. 
Through conferences and seminars, the Indian Society of Ergonomics (ISE) encourages researchers and industry 
practitioners to apply ergonomics methods and approaches. It was created to encourage academics, researchers, and 
business professionals to apply ergonomics techniques and practices. Numerous attempts have been undertaken to 
apply ergonomics to enhance working conditions in Indian SMEs (Unnikrishnan et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the 
Occupational Health in India study indicated a consistent increase in the quantity of workplace injuries in spite of this 
effort (Saha 2018). Furthermore, it has been shown that the bulk of these instances happened in SMEs (Sain et al., 
2016). 
The glass artware industry is a craft SME that produces glass artware items such as souvenirs, dinnerware, and bangles 
in many parts of northern India, particularly in rural areas. Sand, limestone, and silica make up the components used 
to make glass bracelets. Traditional glass bangle manufacture involves very physically demanding work that is done 
for extended periods of time while standing to prepare the gob and for extended periods of time while sitting to cut 
the prepared bangle, as shown in Figure 1. Handicraft workers may have uncomfortable posture, a firm grip, high 
repetition, and the risk of hand-arm vibration (HAV) depending on the nature of their labour and the design of the 
hand tool. 
Therefore, the lack of workstations specifically made for these jobs, difficult postures, prolonged daily working hours, 
and repetitive operations are indicators of the working conditions in the glass artware production industry. These 
workers may experience musculoskeletal issues in various body parts as a result of their working conditions. 
Numerous prior research studies have explicitly looked at physical conditions, physiological variables, and 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among various handicraft workers. Apart from these variables, the way that hand 
tools are made raises the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

Abstract 
Due to its significant influence on customer engagement, brand visibility, and sales development, social media 
marketing has become a crucial component of contemporary business planning. This study aims to determine the 
primary factors affecting customers' opinions of social media influencers and, using the results, investigate the ways 
in which these attributes impact consumers' propensity to purchase the advertised goods or services. 424 completed 
questions from an online poll were analyzed. The main facets of digital influencers' activity that affect consumer 
perceptions have been arranged and categorized using a combination of traditional and advanced data analysis 
methodologies. From the perspective of social media users, structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches can 
uncover the hidden relationships between variables were used. The established models give light on the basic 
connections that dictate how influencers' words are interpreted. The findings provide specific guidance for all 
stakeholders in the social media marketing value chain. Marketers should maximize influencer marketing strategies 
and make educated decisions in order to enhance user experience and increase conversion rates. Marketers and 
influencers may collaborate to create strong and successful marketing campaigns that engage the target audience and 
yield noteworthy results. Customers benefit from more engaging and personalized influencer content that aligns with 
their preferences and interests, which fortifies their relationship with businesses and may even affect their purchase 
decisions.

1. Introduction
Social media influencers, often referred to as digital, online, or internet influencers, gained popularity at the 
beginning of the twenty-first century when the early Web 1.0 environment gave way to the collaborative Web 2.0 
era. Social media influencers (SMIs) are people who have a substantial following on social media platforms such as 
Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Their content has the potential to impact their audience's opinions,

 Impact of Sincerity on Purchase Behavior: The significant relationship between Sincerity and Purchase 
Behavior (Estimate = .187, p = 0.004) implies that customers value authenticity and genuine 
communication from social media influencers. Brands should focus on working with influencers who 
maintain a sincere relationship with their audience, as this will likely result in stronger purchase intentions. 
 Truthful Endorsements Matter: The positive relationship between Truthful Endorsements and Purchase 
Behavior (Estimate = .235, p = 0.023) reinforces the idea that customers are more likely to be influenced by 
content that appears truthful and transparent. This suggests that influencers who give honest reviews and 
avoid misleading promotions can significantly drive consumer purchasing decisions. 
 Visibility and Expertise: While Visibility did not show a significant effect on purchase behavior (p = 
0.102), Expertise did (Estimate = .060, p = 0.012). This suggests that customers are not swayed simply by 
how visible or popular an influencer is but rather by the expertise they demonstrate in their field. For 
brands, this means collaborating with influencers who possess specialized knowledge may be more 
effective than just focusing on high follower counts. 
 The Role of Uniqueness: Uniqueness had a negative and insignificant effect on both customer attitudes 
towards SMIs (p = 0.401) and purchase behavior (p = 0.126). This suggests that uniqueness alone may not 
be a strong predictor of consumer behavior in this context. It implies that standing out for the sake of being 
different does not necessarily lead to greater consumer trust or increased purchasing. Brands should be 
cautious about overemphasizing uniqueness without aligning it with sincerity or expertise. 
 Customer Attitudes Toward SMIs and Purchase Behavior: The significant relationship between 
Customer Attitudes towards Social Media Influencers (SMI) and Purchase Behavior (Estimate = .018, p = 
0.001) shows that positive attitudes toward SMIs directly influence purchase decisions. This underscores 
the importance of cultivating favorable customer perceptions through influencer partnerships, as attitudes 
translate into actions. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This research highlights the critical factors that influence customer attitudes toward social media influencers and, 
ultimately, their purchase behavior. Sincerity, Truthful Endorsements, and Expertise emerged as strong predictors of 
both positive customer attitudes and increased purchasing behavior. On the other hand, Uniqueness and Visibility 
were not significant in influencing purchase decisions. 
 
For brands, these findings suggest that building partnerships with influencers who demonstrate sincerity, expertise, 
and truthful endorsements will likely result in better consumer outcomes than focusing on visibility or uniqueness 
alone. Companies should prioritize authenticity and knowledge-driven endorsements in their influencer marketing 
strategies to foster stronger customer relationships and drive purchases. 
 
Finally, this study reinforces the importance of customer attitudes toward SMIs as a mediator of purchase behavior, 
demonstrating that fostering positive perceptions of influencers can have a tangible impact on sales. Brands and 
marketers should continue to explore strategies that enhance trust, transparency, and credibility in influencer 
collaborations to maximize their marketing efforts.

Abstract 
One of the most demanding occupations is healthcare, where employees frequently deal with a lot of work, little free 
time, and even conflicting role expectations, which can lead to a poor work-life balance (WLB). The purpose of this 
study is to examine how work-life balance (WLB) experiences and job satisfaction affect healthcare workers at 
hospitals in the private sector. The study used a self-administered questionnaire survey using a five-point Likert 
scale, adhering to the analytical research design. Responses were gathered from 412 nurses in various roles at 
hospitals in the private sector. Using structural equation modeling, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to 
analyze the gathered data. Smart PLS 4 was used for data validation and path coefficient analysis at a significance 
level of 5%.Work–personal life enhancement (WPLE), work interference with personal life (WIPL), and personal 
life interference with work (PLIW) were the three aspects used to analyze WLB. The study found a strong 
correlation between job happiness and work-personal life improvement and personal life interference with work. 
Additionally, the results showed a strong positive correlation between job satisfaction and WLB interferences. 
According to this study, TI should be discouraged by focusing on WLB and work satisfaction. Both managers and 
legislators can utilize this study to enhance the situation and implement appropriate actions. Additionally, this 
investigation has theoretical ramifications grounded in boundary theory.

1. Introduction
The importance of achieving work-life balance (WLB) has increasingly been recognized over the years. WLB refers 
to the equilibrium between an individual’s professional and personal life, allowing them to effectively manage work 
obligations while also dedicating time to family, personal growth, and well-being, including both spiritual and 
physical development. This balance is crucial for overall happiness and productivity (Leoński,2015; Pietras,2019). 
The term ""life"" encompasses the leisure time within an employee's personal sphere, which includes relaxation, 
family interactions, social activities, and unpaid responsibilities like volunteer work and household chores. On the 
other hand, ""work"" pertains to activities undertaken in exchange for financial compensation (Binniger,2014; 
Tomaszewska-Lipiec,2018; Wang,2015).

WIWPL and WPLEM), consider carrying out qualitative research: focus groups, interviews, etc. to explore 
underlying reasons why these constructs may not significantly impact job satisfaction. Ensure that the sample size is 
sufficiently large and diverse to improve the generalizability of results. If possible, a larger sample may help clarify 
relationships and potentially uncover significant effects that were not evident in this analysis. Explore potential 
moderating or mediating variables that may influence the relationships between personal life and work constructs 
and job satisfaction. Factors like work culture, managerial support, or individual differences (e.g., personality traits) 
might provide additional insights. Implement ongoing assessment of job satisfaction and the work-life constructs 
over time to capture changes and trends. This could provide a more dynamic understanding of these relationships. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The findings indicate that while the constructs of work interference and personal life interference have been reliably 
measured and show acceptable levels of convergent and discriminant validity, the direct effects on job satisfaction 
are not fully supported statistically. The analysis demonstrates that convergent validity and reliability are 
established, with all indicators meeting the acceptable thresholds. Work-life constructions and job satisfaction, 
however, provide conflicting results, especially when it comes to the non-significant impacts of work augmentation 
and interference on job satisfaction. This suggests that while these constructs are relevant, their direct influence may 
be more nuanced or contingent upon other factors not accounted for in this model. Future research should delve 
deeper into the dynamics of these relationships, possibly incorporating qualitative insights and broader contextual 
variables to gain a clearer understanding of how work and personal life factors interplay to affect job satisfaction.

Abstract 
In the Indian economy, women play a vital role in doing the house works and managing the family from all 
perspectives. Women must do all the work when they are not working or working in the organization. Work life 
balance of women employees plays the major role because they have to manage their personal life for their good 
quality of life. The quality of life is based on the professional life of each and every women employee who is 
coming forward to support to their family. Nowadays there are more women employees emerging in the IT sector, 
working in both day and night shifts The problem of the women employee’s face is health condition, Pregnancy 
discrimination, no equal pay, etc. This study explains the work-life balance of women in the IT sector and also 
shows how the women employees are balanced and Satisfied in IT sector and the factors that affect the work life 
balance of women employees are working hours, Job satisfaction, working condition, etc.

1. Introduction
After liberalization, privatization and globalization, India has been recognized as one of the major emerging 
economies of the world. This has led the country’s business process to a momentous paradigm shifts that compel 
Indian organizations to transform into the new way of functioning compared to that of earlier days. In the era of 
competitive modern world, employees in various organizations, particularly women employees, most often 
encounter never ending challenge of performing well as they are forced to devote most of their time at work. At the 
same time, commitment towards self development, allegiance to family and social life as well as duties along with 
organizational obligations are essential for any individual employee. 
Work Life Balance and Women at Workplace Arthur M. and Cook A. (2003) Women work force now constitutes a 
significant percentage of the total work force in any organization today. With the major changes in the nature of 
work and work arrangements, including the increasing numbers of women participating in the paid work force, 
changes in women’s career expectations, the decline of the family wage, the disappearance of the job for life and 
changes in family formation, the relationship between families and labour market participation has come under

The study revealed that management is accommodative to family needs to an extent of 67% rating and also family 
members are encouraged to join company celebrations (rating of 65%), But at the same time the analysis showed 
that management appreciates if the employees keep work ahead of family (rating of 65%).The management 
discourages to avail leave on pretext of family issues (rating of 55%) and family takes a back seat on employers 
perspective (rating of 52%) .Hence though as a whole the rating of issues on positive aspects are more as compared 
to ratings on the negative aspects, but the companies are more concerned about their revenue and make some overtly 
looking family centric activity like making a family get together. But issues like taking leave for family requirement 
are not encouraged. 
 
Further, Women employees in Indian scenario are compelled to take break for child care and domestic commitment 
so also the case for women IT professionals in Hyderabad. Though joining back to job is permitted, but it is always 
accompanied with riders in an IT organization.50% of respondents said that the package on return would be less as 
compared to one’s peer who has not taken the break. As there is rapid change in technology the changed technical 
scenario during the break might make it incompatible for the employee while rejoining as expressed by 19% 
respondents.31% of respondents felt that on return after a break one has to settle for the available vacancy both in 
terms of rank and technology platform. 
 
5.3 Observations 
As observed by the research the duration of working hour is not always uniform in case of women IT professionals 
in hyd city. The working hours vary as per nature of project assigned to them. However there is no substantial 
variation in putting number of hours at work place as per the age, educational qualification and experience of the 
women employee per se. However young married women employee of early thirties or late twenties having kid are 
more stressed while interfacing their work and non-work lives. Baby care and managing household chores have been 
observed as the most pressing demand for them at the family. Along with this they are having their spouse working 
in 9 to 6 schedule thereby mostly depending on housemaids and some of them put their kids in crèches. Any 
disturbance in this apparatus leads to conflict and irritation. Most of the respondents (85%) are suffering from life 
style diseases like anxiety, mood swing, hypertension and loss of sexual appetite leading to friction between 
partners. It has also been clearly observed from current study that in order to play dual role rationally, women IT 
professionals in Mumbai are already seen, in compromising either at family or at the professional life. 
 
6. Conclusion 
To conclude, the study examines the work life balance of the women employees in the education and how they 
balance their work and family life in the organization. Work-life balance (WLB) is to craft and safeguard supportive 
280","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

and healthy work environments which enable employees to have balance between their paid work and 
personal/family responsibilities. The demand of work is increasing the issue of WLB is becoming more and more 
relevant around the globe. 
 
In case of a woman professional in IT sector it is very important to understand the ground reality and strike a 
balance between professional and personal life for achieving professional excellence. Without this the women 
professional in IT sector would continue to be concentrated at the lower level and would not be able to climb up to 
the upper echelon of the job hierarchy by competing with their male counter parts. 
It is general expectation that employer should be sensible enough towards women employee in IT sector while 
implementing work flexibility policies especially in a city like Hyderabad which has its inherent disadvantages of 
high cost of living, distance from work place to residence and majority being nuclear family dweller with both the 
spouse being career centric, work life balance is a biggest challenge. And unfortunately kids are being the biggest 
causality. They are being deprived of parental care very often. It is a matter of concern for both employer and 
women employee, their partners and other family members to build a healthy rational society by integrating work 
and family life. Family which is the primary core value of Indian society should not suffer.

Abstract 
A whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet is regarded as an optimal nutritional approach for managing patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). The ""Forks Over Knives"" movement has significantly influenced healthcare 
professionals, promoting the benefits of nutrient-dense, minimally processed plant foods while excluding refined 
and heavily processed items, as well as animal products. This dietary approach aids in slowing CKD progression by 
addressing issues such as hypertension, volume overload, azotemia, acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and 
malnutrition. The study, conducted from April 2022 to February 2024, aimed to compare the nutritional status of 
CKD patients following lacto-vegetarian and omnivorous very low-protein diets (VLPDs) with the aid of objective 
assessment tools, including weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, skinfold thickness, mid-arm muscle circumference 
(MAMC), visceral fat, grip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and skeletal muscle measurements. 
Patients adhering to plant-based VLPDs showed notable improvements in MAMC, grip strength, and skeletal 
muscle mass across the body, trunk, and legs compared to those on omnivorous diets. The study excluded patients 
transitioning to dialysis and included individuals based on creatinine clearance and eGFR levels.

1. Introduction
A plant-based diet, particularly one rich in plant proteins, has significant advantages for patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). Its benefits include lower net urinary albumin excretion (UAE), likely due to the higher glutamate 
content of plant proteins, an amino acid with neutral metabolites. Plant-based foods, especially those high in citrate, 
are metabolized into bicarbonate in the body, creating an alkaline environment that neutralizes acid, making low-
potassium fruits and vegetables an essential recommendation. Additionally, the bioavailability of phosphorus in 
plant foods is relatively low (under 50%) due to the absence of the phytase enzyme in humans, which helps mitigate 
the risk of hyperphosphatemia, a common issue in CKD patients. 
Plant-based diets also reduce the production of harmful compounds such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a 
cardiovascular risk factor, by lowering the intake of L-carnitine, commonly found in animal-based foods. These 
diets are linked to improved lipid metabolism, as they lower LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid, and 
replace harmful saturated fats with healthier monounsaturated fats. Elevated serum levels of threonine, histidine, 
and glutamic acid, which are abundant in plant foods, contribute to better blood pressure control. 
The high fiber content in plant-based diets, particularly in low-protein regimens, reduces protein fermentation and 
increases carbohydrate fermentation, which positively influences gut microbiota. This leads to the production of 
short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which are beneficial for gut health and act as a key factor in reducing systemic 
inflammation, improving insulin sensitivity, and supporting kidney function. This gut-kidney axis is now recognized 
as crucial for slowing CKD progression.

7. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study underscores the significant role that diet adherence plays in managing chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) for non-dialysis patients, specifically focusing on lacto-vegetarian low-protein diets supplemented 
with keto analogues. Findings reveal that adherence to a low-protein, low-sodium lacto-vegetarian diets not only 
supports better nutritional status but also helps slow CKD progression, reduce muscle wasting, and delay or 
potentially avoid the need for dialysis. These positive health outcomes also highlight the importance of effective 
patient education and ongoing dietary counselling to achieve and maintain compliance with prescribed diets. The 
study provides compelling evidence that a lacto-vegetarian low-protein diet, when followed consistently, can be 
particularly beneficial for kidney health, improving quality of life and enhancing longevity for CKD patients. These 
insights lay a foundation for further research into personalized dietary interventions in CKD care, aiming to develop 
tailored strategies that maximize patient well-being and long-term kidney function through sustainable dietary 
management.

Abstract 
This research aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of three machine learning strategies that use Random 
Forest algorithms to assist in making clinical decisions using Electronic Health Records. The first strategy predicts 
readmission based only on diagnosis codes. The second strategy uses natural language processing to analyze clinical 
notes and extract relevant terms for predicting readmission. The third strategy combines vital signs and lab results 
with the second approach to provide additional data for the Random Forest models.The rapid increase in Electronic 
Health Records (EHR) offers a chance to improve healthcare services through advanced machine learning techniques. 
However, the complexity and variety of EHR data, which includes both structured information (like lab results) and 
unstructured data (such as clinical notes), present significant challenges for analysis. Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) provides an effective way to derive valuable insights from unstructured medical text. Random Forest (RF) 
algorithms, recognized for their strength and clarity, are particularly effective for analyzing complex, multi-source 
healthcare data. This study aims to utilize RF models in conjunction with NLP techniques to create predictive models 
that support clinical decision-making and enhance personalized patient care. Our results indicate that the Random 
Forest model's use of clinical notes can match or even surpass the effectiveness of diagnosis codes in predicting 
readmission within thirty days post-hospital discharge. The unstructured text found in Electronic Health Records 
(EHRs)—including discharge summaries, physician notes, and radiology reports—necessitates the application of NLP 
for effective data extraction. Essential NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), medical concept 
extraction, and text classification are crucial for converting free-text data into structured information that can be used 
as input features for machine learning models. By combining RF with NLP-driven feature engineering, we can develop 
precise and interpretable predictive models for various applications, including disease diagnosis, predicting patient 
readmissions, and risk stratification.

6. Conclusion  
Integrating NLP and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for clinical decision support enhances the ability to analyze 
complex Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and provide predictive insights. NLP techniques extract valuable 
features from unstructured clinical text, while RF classifies and predicts patient outcomes based on structured and

Abstract 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are vital for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases but are often compromised by 
artifacts such as high-frequency noise and baseline wander (BW). This review synthesizes recent advancements in 
ECG enhancement techniques aimed at improving signal quality for clinical evaluation. Key methods discussed 
include empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its variants, which effectively mitigate both high-frequency noise 
and BW with minimal distortion. Additionally, deep learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions for 
BW filtering, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. The review also examines 
techniques like eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrices for simultaneous noise removal, as well as integrated 
methods such as IEMD-ATD that enhance signal-to-noise ratio while preserving crucial features of the ECG signal. 
Furthermore, we explore the application of ensemble EMD and non-local wavelet transforms, both of which provide 
significant improvements in denoising efficacy. The proposed methodologies not only enhance the diagnostic potential 
of ECG recordings but also contribute to the broader context of wearable health monitoring systems.

1. Introduction
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an indispensable diagnostic tool for detecting heart diseases, yet its efficacy can be 
significantly affected by numerous challenges encountered during the recording process. Electrical interferences, 
including power line noise and electromyogram (EMG) artifacts, often disrupt the ECG signal, resulting in inaccurate 
interpretations that can mislead healthcare providers. Additionally, baseline wander—often caused by patient 
movement, respiratory fluctuations, or other physiological factors—further complicates the clear representation of 
cardiac activity, obscuring essential information necessary for accurate diagnosis. 
Another major issue is poor electrode contact, which typically arises from insufficient skin preparation. Inadequate 
adhesion can lead to unreliable data capture, where signal loss or artifacts mask the heart's true electrical activity. 
Moreover, motion artifacts stemming from patient movements during recording can hinder the assessment of the 
heart’s performance, making it difficult to draw valid conclusions. 
Environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, also play a critical role in signal integrity, particularly in 
wireless ECG systems. Here, additive white Gaussian noise can significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio, 
complicating the interpretation of ECG readings. Additional complications can arise from overlapping physiological 
signals and systemic calibration errors, which can further distort the ECG output and complicate the analysis of cardiac 
activity. 
To overcome these challenges, healthcare professionals must implement advanced signal processing techniques 
alongside effective patient management and careful environmental control. Practical solutions may involve the 
application of digital filters to clean the signal, optimizing electrode placement to enhance contact quality, and

leads to more reliable cardiac diagnoses, potentially reducing misinterpretations and enhancing patient care, 
particularly in scenarios with compromised ECG readings. While significant progress has been made, ECG signal 
processing remains an active research area. Continued efforts are necessary to refine existing techniques, develop new 
approaches, and address ongoing challenges. As technology evolves, there is potential for further improvements in 
ECG signal quality and analysis, benefiting healthcare providers and patients in cardiac diagnosis and management.

Abstract 
Nowadays, several cities have problems with traffic congestion at certain peak hours, which produces more 
pollution, noise as well and stress for citizens. The IoT-based Intelligent Management System (ITM) is embedded in 
automatic vehicles and utilized to recognize and transmit data. The IoT has been an imminent innovation, moving the 
globe concerning an automated process as well as (IMS). In this paper, the Internet of Things (IoT) based traffic 
signal prediction is proposed using the Attention based VGG-16. The proposed Attention based VGG-16 is evaluated 
on the road traffic IoT dataset which contains information about the traffic, number of vehicles, and road 
information. In the pre-processing step, the min-max normalization approach is utilized for the redundancy 
elimination and minimize data modification errors in the collected dataset. The ResNet101 architecture of 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to perform image classification of traffic. The proposed method 
achieves the better results by utilizing evaluating metrices like accuracy, precision, recall and Mean Absolute Error 
values about 99.36%, 99.25%, 98.57% and 0.72 respectively which is comparatively higher than existing techniques 
like Optimized Weight Elman Neural Network (OWENN), CNN and Capsule Neural Network.

1. Introduction
Controlling traffic signals in urban areas is a significant process and it is an essential topic in recent developments 
stated by Lee, W.H. and Chiu, C.Y., 2020. Today, a number of cities have issues with traffic congestion at peak 
hours, which generates pollution, noise as well and stress for citizens given by Arifin, A.S. and Zulkifli, F.Y., 2021. 
The city officials have expanded public transportation to reduce traffic congestion. Moreover, it plans to extend 
metro lines to decrease traffic congestion and minimize safety levels in the city. Fadda et al 2022. Accidents, bad 
weather, slow-moving overloaded vehicles, vehicle breakdowns, physical road conditions, and so on are some of the 
components that contribute to the issues of congestion marked by Giusto, D.D. et al. 2022. The most significant and 
basic element of solving these traffic problems is the precise estimation of the recent situation of road traffic jams 
mentioned by Ahmad, M et al. 2022. The manual traffic systems in urban cities require greater manpower and those 
approaches have seriously poor traffic schemes and consume much time for the prediction. With the aim of resolving

based VGG-16 obtained 98.57%, but existing methods of CNN and Capsule Neural Network achieved the precision 
of 97.73% and 91.06% respectively. These recall results are low when compared to the proposed method.  
 
5. Conclusion  
In this research, the prediction of traffic signals in urban cities using the classification method of Attention-based 
VGG-16 is proposed. In this method, the public repository of road traffic prediction IoT dataset is utilized, which is 
derived from the sensors and cameras and the information collected from the traffic environment. The min-max 
normalization method is utilized for the enhancement of the dataset and the CNN architecture of ResNet101 is 
utilized for the extraction of the feature. The VGG-16 architecture is a classification algorithm, mostly utilized for 
image classification and prediction. An Attention-based VGG-16 algorithm is used for the classification of the traffic 
signal with the Intel 80286 microprocessor. The proposed model’s performance is evaluated by the number of 
performance metrics and it achieves 99.36% accuracy, 99.25% precision, 98.57% recall and 0.72 MAE respectively 
when compared to the existing methods such as OWENN, CNN and Capsule Neural Network. In the future, this 
proposed method will extend to solve the data imbalance issues to improve the accuracy of results.

Abstract 
A recurring problem in the Financial Activities and Insurance sector, specifically in insurance companies, is the speed 
of response to quotes, as this delay has several effects, such as the level of customer experience. The objective of this 
research is to determine the root causes of the main problem in the insurance company. Also, the implementation of 
Lean Six Sigma, based on the DMAIC tool, belonging to LSS, will be carried out to achieve an improvement in the 
waiting times in the subscription area. Once the root causes have been identified, we will proceed to define the 
improvement objectives for each one of them and the solution tools. The project will be based on the application of 
5S, standardization of the work method and Voice of Costumer (VOC) to reduce the current waiting time of 11.186 
days by 10%. This will be achieved by identifying the person responsible for each activity, developing procedures, 
detailing activities by periods and monthly indicators. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of the implementation will be 
evaluated in terms of expected savings and gains in three different scenarios, to assess the variables with the greatest 
impact and anticipate monetary losses.

To determine the feasibility of the project, an analysis will be made according to the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal 
Rate of Return (IRR), Benefit-Cost ratio (B/C) and Pay-back Period (PP) indicators.

The Net Present Value (NPV) is a key indicator for determining the project's viability; therefore, it is essential for its 
value to be as far from zero as possible, which is achieved during the project development. The amount of S/. 83,173.00 
represents the value generated over the five-year horizon after the investment. Regarding the Internal Rate of Return 
(IRR), this metric indicates the return rate from the investment. An IRR lower than the discount rate signifies potential 
losses, while a higher IRR indicates profitability. Consequently, the results demonstrate that the calculated IRR 
exceeds the discount rate, projecting favorable outcomes for the implementations in this case. Additionally, the 
project's income generation capacity is assessed using the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). This ratio suggests that for every 
Sol (S/.) invested, a return of 1.36 soles will be generated, resulting in a profit of 0.36 soles. Finally, the Payback 
Period is estimated to be 2 years and 6 months, which accounts solely for the project improvements, excluding the 
company's own developments that could further enhance its growth and annual profits. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The primary aim of this research—to reduce the waiting time for commercial requests for quotations in the 
subscription area using the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology—was successfully met. The implementation of 
standardized work templates and process automation led to a 4.69% reduction in quotation times. Although this 
improvement is below the industry standard, it represents a meaningful step toward increasing efficiency and 
enhancing customer experience. The study began with a thorough analysis of the company’s background and the 
operational challenges within the subscription area. This context was essential for understanding the key factors 
contributing to delays in the processing of quotation requests. Key problems were identified during the research, 
particularly the recurring delays caused by the exchange of incomplete information between commercial agents and 
the subscription area. The introduction of standardized templates helped streamline this process by reducing 
unnecessary back-and-forth communication. The Lean Six Sigma methodology was applied to develop practical 
solutions that improve the efficiency of the interaction between commercial agents and the subscription area. This not 
only reduced disruptions in the workflow but also had a direct impact on enhancing the overall customer experience. 
Finally, the proposed solution was validated through simulation, demonstrating improvements in both process 
efficiency and resource utilization. Although the percentage improvement is modest compared to theoretical standards, 
it signals potential for further enhancement. The automation of standardized formats within the company's platform is 
recommended as a viable next step, ensuring sustained progress through regular monitoring and adjustments.

Abstract 
This research aims to integrate blockchain technology and smart contracts into a government organization’s supply 
chain. The strategy includes developing an optimal facility location model and a blockchain framework. This could 
potentially transform public health supply chains, especially in rural areas. However, it’s crucial to recognize that 
while blockchain and smart contracts offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges and vulnerabilities that 
must be addressed. Further research and development in this field are necessary. A thorough study was conducted, 
assessing the current landscape through a literature review that focused on various schemes and initiatives by both 
government and non-government bodies. The study’s contribution is two-fold: it provides practical benefits to 
government schemes and expands the literature in new and significant ways. A methodology grounded in technology 
and operations research is proposed to tackle challenges arising from the government’s benefit transfer schemes. This 
study could improve the efficiency of benefit delivery systems and represents a collaboration between an educational 
institute and the government.

Abstract 
Electric vehicles are quickly becoming a more significant part of the transportation sector, increasing the need for 
efficient and sustainable charging infrastructure more important than ever. Currently, most EV charging systems rely 
heavily on grid electricity, which often comes from non-renewable sources, and they use physical connectors that 
create both environmental and practical challenges. This led to a growing demand for eco-friendly, user-friendly, and 
scalable solutions. Right now, we have options like wired chargers, solar-powered stations, and wireless systems, but 
each has its downsides. Wired chargers can be inconvenient and are prone to wear and tear, while wireless charging 
systems face issues with energy transfer. Although solar-powered chargers are good for the environment, they still 
depend on the grid, which limits their sustainability. Our solution is a solar-powered wireless EV charging station that 
combines solar energy with wireless power transfer technology. By eliminating wired connectors and reducing 
reliance on grid, this system offers a more convenient and environmentally friendly way to charge EVs. An Energy 
Management System is installed which will optimize the energy flow between the solar panels, battery storage, and 
grid usage. This approach not only helps to reduce carbon emissions by using renewable energy but also enhances 
user comfort and scalability, making it suitable for various locations, from homes to public places. Overall, this project 
supports the world towards greener energy and sustainable transportation for the future.

1. Introduction
Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming an essential part of sustainable transportation as the world seeks ways to reduce 
pollution and lessen the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption. Unlike traditional cars, which release carbon 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants that contribute to climate change, air pollution, and health crises, EVs 
offer a cleaner alternative. This shift is being supported by governments, industries, and individuals who are 
encouraging EV adoption to build a transportation system that has a smaller environmental footprint. 
EVs operate differently than traditional vehicles. Instead of a combustion engine, EVs use electric motors powered by 
rechargeable batteries. This design makes EVs much more efficient. While combustion engines only convert about 
25-30% of fuel energy into movement, EV batteries can convert around 85% of stored energy into motion. This
improved efficiency translates to smoother operation, lower maintenance, and less noise pollution due to the reduced
number of moving parts.
At the heart of EV technology are batteries, with lithium-ion batteries being the most common choice because of their 
high energy density, lightweight nature, and long lifecycles. However, these batteries rely on materials like lithium, 
cobalt, and nickel, which raise environmental and ethical concerns during extraction and disposal. To address these

The battery’s performance was sufficient for occasional charging, with enough stored energy to keep the system 
running on cloudy days. However, larger systems would need bigger batteries to support constant charging and handle 
full-sized EVs. 
 
The energy transfer from solar to wireless performed well, even under different sunlight conditions, proving that this 
setup could be scaled up for larger EV charging stations. In the future, we can focus on improving wireless charging 
efficiency, increasing storage capacity, and refining the Energy Management System (EMS) to distribute energy more 
effectively. 
 
Overall, the prototype demonstrated a sustainable and efficient charging solution that can be scaled up to support a 
cleaner EV infrastructure in the future. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Scope 
The future of the solar-powered wireless EV charging station project is filled with promising advancements. Scaling 
up larger solar panels and higher-capacity batteries will allow the system to charge full-sized EVs faster and support 
multiple vehicles at once, making it ideal for busy areas like parking lots and highways. 
 
Integrating with smart grids and IoT could take the station’s efficiency to the next level. Smart grid connectivity would 
allow it to share excess solar power with the grid or draw from it when needed. With IoT, users can monitor and 
control charging remotely and benefit from predictive maintenance, ensuring the station runs smoothly and efficiently. 
 Improvements in wireless charging technology also offer exciting prospects. Enhanced alignment detection and 
resonant coupling can make energy transfer faster and reduce losses, while adding renewable sources like wind could 
create a hybrid system, and also extends the station’s sustainability and versatility.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the optimization of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) parameters to enhance weld quality in 
DP500 and DP780 Dual Phase (DP) Steels, commonly utilized in automotive applications. As DP steels are 
renowned for their high-tensile strength and ability to absorb energy during impacts, they are ideal materials for 
automotive parts requiring exceptional strength and durability. DP500 and DP780 are specifically chosen due to 
their widespread applications in critical automotive components such as body side inners, quarter panel inners and 
rear rails. Through simulation studies conducted using ANSYS software, thin sheets of DP500 and DP780 with 
dimensions of 75 mm length, 32 mm width and 3.2 mm thick are welded together using a tungsten carbide FSW 
tool. Parameters such as Tool Rotational Speed (800/1000/1200 RPM), Welding Speed (40/60/80 mm/min) and 
Shoulder Diameter (12/14/16 mm) were systematically varied to optimize the weld quality. Tensile strength, a key 
indicator of weld quality, is used as the primary metric for evaluation. Minitab software and Taguchi method 
analysis are employed for data analysis and determination of the optimal welding parameters. ANOVA is carried out 
to identify the significant parameter that affects the weld quality.  The results revealed that the highest tensile 
strength, indicative of optimal weld quality, was achieved at a tool rotational speed of 1200 RPM, welding speed of 
80 mm/min, and shoulder diameter of 14 mm. This study provides valuable insights into the FSW process 
parameters for achieving high-quality welds in DP500 and DP780 DP Steels, crucial for enhancing the performance 
and durability of automotive components.

1. Introduction
Dual-Phase steels (DP steels) characterized by a microstructure consisting of a soft ferrite matrix with dispersed 
hard martensite phases, exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to conventional Steel grades. Friction stir 
welding (FSW) involves the use of a non-consumable rotating tool to generate frictional heat, plasticizing the 
material and creating a solid-state bond between the components to be welded. Challenges encountered in 
optimizing FSW Parameters for DP Steels are summarized as Material Variability, Complex Microstructure, Process 
Parameters, Heat Generation and Thermal effects in FSW. Optimizing FSW parameters are crucial for achieving 
high-quality welds with DP steels, as it directly influences the mechanical properties and integrity of the joints. 
Several studies have investigated the effects of various FSW parameters, including tool rotational speed, welding 
speed, and shoulder diameter, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of DP steel welds. However, there 
remains a need for further research to comprehensively understand the interactions between these parameters and 
their impact on weld quality. The automotive industry extensively utilizes DP steels, notably DP500 and DP780, for 
fabricating critical components like door panels and bar panels due to their superior strength and formability

Abstract 
In the digital era, where cybersecurity threats arise large and blockchain technology promises decentralized security, 
the intersection of deep learning techniques and blockchain networks emerges as a frontier in safeguarding digital 
ecosystems. Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, excels at detecting complex patterns and anomalies in 
vast datasets. We can enhance cyber threat detection capabilities by integrating deep learning with blockchain 
networks. This meta-analysis systematically reviews existing literature on deep learning in detecting cyber threats 
within blockchain networks. This study lists the examination of research published in the past 5 years, focusing on 
Neural network applications and other deep learning architecture and evaluating the performance of these techniques 
in detecting various types of cyber threats and their impacts. Blockchain is a promising technology that addresses 
these needs. This study uses a meta-analysis approach to identify key themes, trends, and considerations from 
the current cyber threat detection approach. The study lists topics of potential future research interest and benefits 
various stakeholders, including researchers.

1. Introduction
The importance of cyber threat detection and adaptive defense mechanisms in the modern digital landscape cannot be 
overstated (Ahmetoglu et al. 2022). With the rapid expansion of digital infrastructure and the increasing 
interconnectivity of technologies, the risk of cyber-attacks has soared. These attacks can initially disrupt operations, 
compromise sensitive data, and inflict significant financial and reputational harm on organizations (Aljihani et al. 
2021). Effective cyber threat detection requires constant monitoring and analysis of network traffic, system logs, and 
user behavior to identify and neutralize potential threats in real-time. This proactive approach allows organizations to 
respond swiftly to emerging threats, preventing them from escalating into full-blown attacks (Cha et al. 2020). 
Traditional security approaches, such as signature-based detection and perimeter defenses, rely on predefined patterns 
or rules to identify known threats. However, they struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of cybercriminals 
who continually adapt their strategies to evade detection (El-Kosairy et al. 2023). Moreover, these methods often lack 
the agility and scalability required to address the complexity of modern cyber threats. Deep learning techniques offer 
a paradigm shift in cybersecurity by enabling systems to learn from vast amounts of data and automatically identify 
complex patterns and anomalies. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning algorithms can detect previously unknown 
threats and adapt to evolving attack techniques in real-time. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNNs) are particularly well-suited for analyzing large datasets and identifying subtle patterns

2. 
Privacy-Enhancing Techniques: While blockchain offers transparency, Explore more on the practical 
implementation of federated learning in blockchain to enhance privacy techniques,use of homomorphic 
encryption for threat detection without exposing sensitive information.Future research can explore some advances 
in cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and homomorphic encryption, to 
strengthen privacy guarantees without compromising verifiability. 
 
3. 
Usability and Accessibility: Integrating  deeplearing with blockchain infrastructure and systems and ensuring 
user-friendliness is important. This is because the application will be used by a diverse population with little or 
no technical knowledge . educating users on the benefits and functionalities of Deeplearning security tools, enhancing 
their ability to utilize these systems effectively.The concept of the user interface for distributed applications (dApps) 
is still in its infancy. Research should focus on intuitive interfaces,  make threat detection tools user with 
disabilities, and integration accessible with existing system mechanisms. 
 
4. 
Standardization and Regulations: Clear standards and regulations are needed for secure and consistent 
implementation across different jurisdictions. Research should explore collaborative efforts to develop interoperable 
standards, promote consistency and trust, and address data protection concerns.  
 
5. 
Long-Term Security and Maintenance: Blockchain systems require ongoing maintenance and upgrades to 
address evolving security threats, continuous monitoring, and real-time adjustment. Hence, research should 
explore sustainable funding models, secure maintenance procedures, and long-term security guarantees in 
blockchain networks. 
 
7.Conclusion 
This literature review analyzed and synthesized prior research that went into developing and applying the concept of 
cyber threat detection in a blockchain environment. The study identified various deep learning approaches that 
enhance cyber threat detection in blockchain. However, as the study finds, additional research is still needed to realize 
the full potential of the use case/application. Scalability and performance must be improved. More work is also required 
to develop advanced privacy-enhancing techniques, intuitive user interfaces, and international standardization efforts. 
Long-term maintenance and ongoing security also present challenges that future research could help address. As the 
technology progresses, blockchain has the potential to improve trust substantially. Further research should focus on 
a hybrid model for enhancing privacy and shaping the future of security within the blockchain network.

Abstract 
This paper describes about the counter scaling design. To enhance the performance and battery of the system. To 
reduce the chip size area and the power consumption, the VLSI circuits are designed at low power, the key elements 
are scaling design, counter are used to enhance or minimize the values based upon the previous state mean while the 
counting process depends upon the time and frequency must be measured. The power consumption is reduced by 
decreasing the switching performances. The main disadvantage is scaling circuit of the power consumption because 
of the clock power dissipation during the standby mode. The total power is assumed by the clocksignal that is only 
one-third of power is consumed. By reducing the power consumption in flip-flops. This is achieved by TSPCL (True 
single phase clock logic) through the self-controllable voltage level (SVP).

dependent applications rely on frequency bits and flip-flops, thus this is very useful when working with them.  The 
counter's construction makes use of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology. This technology has 
recently exploded in popularity due to the fact that it is more suited to uses demanding high power and frequencies 
than competing options. The CMOS transistor, which stands for complementary metal oxide semi-conductor, has 
several different uses. This device's significant working temperature, low cut-off frequency, and high breakdown 
frequency make it very desired (Figure 1).

The second AND gate likewise generates an output of 0 when Q2 = 0 and AND gate1 output = 0, since it takes the 
output of the first AND gate as its input. Not only does the Q3 block employ it, but so do CLK and CLK'.  
 
Keeping the modified D Flip Flop in its original state (i.e., with 1 as its output) may be achieved by applying 1 as an 
input to the XOR gate and 0 as an output to the second AND gate as CLK. D Flip-Flop and inverted AND gate 
output (CLK'=1) are necessary for its operation. D-Flip-Flop will get a result of 1. Because of this, Q3 will be set to 
zero 
at 
the 
beginning.  
Get Q3 by multiplying D3 by the product of D2 and D1, where D2 and D1 could be integers or zero.  
Two integers, 0 and 0, are inputted into a third AND gate, which processes the outputs of Q3 and the second AND 
gate. The input signal from an XOR gate may be either 1 or 0, depending on the application, to the revamped D Flip 
Flop.  
Return to the starting value of the Modified D Flip Flop occurs when CLK hits zero. Since its input and output are 
both set to 1, the modified D Flip Flop uses a single inverted third AND gate as the CLK (i.e., 1). D-Flip-Flop will 
get a result of 1. Given that 1 xor(1.1.1)=0, we may deduce that Q4 is equal to D4 xor (D3.D2.D1) if we are certain 
that 
Q4 
is 
not 
equal 
to 
0.  
When the counter hits 1111, the cycle will come to a close. 
 
3. Proposed Method 
Both the system's efficiency and the battery life will be enhanced in this manner.For the sake of minimising the 
chip's environmental impact and power requirements. The counter is at your disposal. The unique feature of this 
piece is the counting sequence that generates fundamental data with little redundancy. It has more features and better 
functionality than the soft IP core that FPGA suppliers supply. The 11T SRAM cell, which consumes almost little 
power, is detailed in another part of the publication.  
 
Here you may find the specifications for the counter scaling. Both the system's efficiency and the battery life will be 
enhanced in this manner. The design of low-power VLSI circuits relies heavily on scaling, counters that add or 
remove values based on the preceding state mean, and timing and frequency monitoring of counting. Chip size, 
power consumption, and area are all reduced as a result of these components working in tandem. Lowering 
switching performances reduces power consumption. The biggest drawback occurs when the clock is in standby 
mode and wastes power; this triggers the power consumption scaling circuit.The actual power usage is just one third 
of what the clock signal estimates it to be. Through decreasing the amount of energy that flip-flops use. The SVP in 
TSPCL, or true single phase clock logic, is responsible for this effect.

Abstract 
This paper presents an overview on the change in the dynamics of the Performance Management process in the 
current business ecosystem where flexibility of work place is being adopted. Criticality of skills, competencies, 
virtues in the current business dynamics where new workplace structures are being adopted is analyzed. Continuous 
objective feedback to the team members by their managers, people leaders and its significance is discussed in detail 
in the paper. The empirical analysis of the data sets through Process Macros tool has enabled the researchers in 
validating the mediation impact of continuous feedback on performance appraisal process. Informing staff about 
company goals. Organizations must understand how goal/yardstick clarity affects skills and competences, which 
affect performance assessment in totality. Investment in skill-building and learning strategies brings learning 
ecosystem tools closer to team members. Knowledge sharing investment also helps managers communicate 
important information to team members and use team input to improve appraisal process.

1. Introduction
Post pandemic the work place has evolved significantly, with adaption of flexibility of workplace – hybrid working 
environment the organizations are trying its best to keep up with the workforce requirements. There are one set of 
organizations which are trying to return to the pre-pandemic working style of only working from office place, on the 
other hand other set of organization is trying to adapt to the new normal of hybrid working environment. Therefore, 
in these changing times where the workplace preference for the workforce is changing, a close attention on the 
competency/skills is need of the hour. Because of this new normal, there is a need to reevaluate the abilities that will 
be required for the jobs of the future and reframe the knowledge gap that has previously existed in the area of soft 
skills. Leadership, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving are examples of soft skills, which are 
characterized by interactions with others and encompass a wide range of cognitive and socio-emotional abilities. 
These days, they aren't even a component of computer literacy.

6. Conclusion 
With the empirical data validation it can be concluded that there is a causal relationship between Virtues (V)/Skills 
and Performance appraisal (P) process for employees in the current business ecosystem. Virtues (V)/ Skills of an 
employee has a significant impact on the performance appraisal process of the employees.  
 
Objective Feedback (O) mediates the effect of relationship between skills/virtues (V) of employees and its impact on 
the Performance appraisal (P) for the workforce. Direct and indirect effect of Virtues (V) on the Performance 
Appraisal (P) process supports the mediation role of Objective Feedback (O). 
 
Therefore investing more into trainings and methods that improve team members' skills and bringing the resources 
that make up the learning ecosystem more accessible to them is critical for improvement in performance. Investment 
in knowledge sharing also helps managers disseminate timely, relevant information to their teams and incorporate 
employee input into performance appraisals. 
For Performance Management to be effective, managers must provide their team members with objective and 
ongoing feedback. Every people leader knows how important it is to consistently provide their staff constructive 
criticism. There is a strong probability that delayed input is biased and will not assist the team member in making 
course corrections. Also as the a hybrid work model would stay, managers should think about being upfront about 
job flexibility as a key characteristic for highly motivated teams.

Abstract 
The Class C amplifier produced by the ADS algorithm is the main subject of this article. Given its high frequency 
and power characteristics, GaN transistors might be difficult to achieve optimum performance without proper 
impedance matching. Class AB mode often requires accurate biassing to function properly. Its operating frequency 
range stability may be more intricate than that of silicon transistors. When efficiency and high power are critical, 
Class C amplifiers perform better than Class AB amplifiers when the conduction angle is less than 180 degrees. One 
advantage is the use of GaN (Gallium Nitride) transistors, which are typical in Class AB power amplifiers. In 
addition to having a low on-resistance and a high electron mobility, GaN transistors improve efficiency in other 
areas as well. Class C amplifiers lose less power due to heat since they are more efficient. It is essential in high-
power applications to properly regulate heat, and GaN transistors help with that. An S-band frequency range 
operation for a GaN power amplifier is suggested by this notion. Among the many benefits offered by Class AB 
power amplifiers powered by GaN (GalliumNitride) transistors are their great efficiency and power density. The 
suggested power amplifier might be constructed with the help of a 150nm-based Advanced Design System (ADS) 
program. This amplifier's gain, harmonic balance, and stability factor are all great for use with radar.

Abstract 
This paper presents an in-depth review of deep learning methods employed in the field of cloud forensics analysis, 
highlighting current advancements, challenges, and future directions. With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, 
forensic investigations face unique challenges, particularly in data collection, evidence analysis, and maintaining chain 
of custody. This survey explores how deep learning enhances cloud forensic processes, improving accuracy, 
automation, and scalability. Key areas such as malware detection, anomaly detection, log analysis, and privacy-
preserving techniques are discussed. The paper also examines the gaps in existing research and suggests areas for 
future exploration.

1. Introduction
Cloud forensics is a critical field of investigation that focuses on gathering, preserving, and analyzing evidence from 
cloud computing environments (Cinar et.al 2023). As businesses and individuals increasingly rely on cloud services 
for data storage and processing, the need for effective forensic methods becomes essential in the event of cybercrime 
or data breaches . (Malik et.al 2024). Cloud environments present unique challenges for forensic investigations due to 
their distributed nature, where data is stored across multiple servers and often in different geographic locations. This 
distributed structure can make it difficult to acquire complete and accurate forensic evidence (Camilleri and Rebecca 
2024). Additionally, the multi-tenant architecture of cloud services, where multiple users share the same resources, 
further complicates evidence collection (Alshabibi et.al 2024). Data volatility is another challenge, as data in the cloud 
can change rapidly or be deleted without a trace, making it essential for forensic tools and techniques to capture data 
quickly and accurately before it is lost (Mujahid and Bisma 2023). 
Deep learning has become a valuable approach for tackling challenges in cloud forensics (Mohammed Sheena, and 
Sridevi Rangu 2024). Utilizing sophisticated algorithms, these models can process large datasets to uncover patterns

8. Challenges in Applying Deep Learning for Cloud Forensics 
Deep learning has shown great promise in many fields, including cybersecurity and forensics. However, applying it 
to cloud forensics presents several unique challenges. Below are some key issues that need to be addressed: 
ii 
Data Availability and Quality: One of the biggest hurdles in applying deep learning to cloud forensics is the 
lack of large, labeled forensic datasets. Deep learning models rely heavily on vast amounts of data for 
training, and in cloud forensics, it is difficult to collect such data. Moreover, forensic data that does exist is 
often fragmented and incomplete, making it hard to create reliable models. Additionally, cloud providers may 
not always make forensic evidence readily available due to privacy and legal concerns, further complicating 
the availability of relevant data. 
iii Model Interpretability: Deep learning models are often referred to as ""black boxes"" because of their 
complexity and the difficulty in understanding how they make decisions. This lack of transparency can be a 
significant issue in cloud forensics, where legal proceedings require clear explanations of how forensic 
evidence is obtained and analyzed. Without interpretable models, it can be challenging to provide convincing, 
legally admissible results in court. 
iiii Adversarial Attacks: Another critical challenge is the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial 
attacks. In these attacks, small and subtle changes to the input data can cause the model to produce incorrect 
results. In the context of cloud forensics, such perturbations can lead to wrong conclusions, potentially 
causing investigators to miss crucial evidence or, worse, to draw false conclusions. This vulnerability makes 
it risky to rely on deep learning models without robust defenses against adversarial attacks. 
iiv Scalability: Cloud environments generate vast amounts of data, and for deep learning to be effective in cloud 
forensics, models must be capable of handling this scale. However, current research in this field often 
struggles with scaling models to process large datasets efficiently. Training deep learning models on cloud-
scale data can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their practical use in real-world 
forensic investigations. Scalability remains a significant challenge in making deep learning applicable to 
cloud forensics on a larger scale. 
9. Future Directions and Open Research Areas 
Future research in cloud forensics is heading towards several promising areas. One key focus is on transfer learning, 
where pre-trained models are applied to forensic analysis, helping to overcome the challenge of limited cloud-specific 
forensic data. Another critical area is explainable AI, which aims to make deep learning models more understandable 
and transparent for use in legal contexts. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on adversarial defense mechanisms, 
which seek to create deep learning models that can withstand adversarial attacks in forensic applications. Researchers 
are also exploring the integration of quantum-resistant algorithms to ensure the long-term security of forensic 
processes in a post-quantum world. Lastly, advancements in automated incident response using deep reinforcement 
learning are being pursued to enhance the speed and efficiency of responses to forensic events.

10. Conclusion 
In this survey, we explored the application of deep learning techniques in cloud forensics, highlighting both the 
advancements and challenges in the field. Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize cloud forensic analysis by 
automating complex tasks such as malware detection, anomaly detection, and log analysis. Its ability to handle large 
volumes of data and uncover patterns that might be missed by traditional methods makes it a valuable tool for forensic 
investigators. However, several key challenges, such as the lack of labeled forensic datasets, model interpretability 
issues, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and scalability concerns, need to be addressed for its broader application. 
The survey also emphasizes the need for more research in areas such as explainable AI, transfer learning, and 
adversarial defenses to overcome these challenges. As cloud computing continues to grow and become more integrated 
into various sectors, the importance of effective forensic analysis will only increase. Future research should aim to 
create more resilient, interpretable, and scalable deep learning models tailored to the unique requirements of cloud 
forensics. Overcoming these challenges will enable deep learning to significantly enhance forensic capabilities in the 
constantly evolving cloud landscape.

Abstract 
Blockchain is the decentralized technology which is changing the way businesses operate traditionally, due to its peer 
to peer characteristic and distributed consensus algorithms it is exhibiting low transaction throughput. Consensus 
algorithms play an important role in analyzing the performance of blockchain platforms. This study applies and 
analyzes three consensus protocols named Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Stake (PoS) 
on Split-Join Blockchain Framework. The Split-Join blockchain framework processes the block of transactions in 
parallel thus allowing more blocks to be committed to the decentralized ledger. Experiments are conducted in five 
rounds for all three consensus algorithms and with different transaction volumes starting with 50 transactions, then 
100 txns, 500 txns, 1000 txns, 5000 txns in an increasing fashion. Observed the transaction latency over all rounds of 
experiment and considered the average latency and throughput to determine the efficient consensus algorithm. During 
the experiments it is observed that the PoA outperformed the PoW, PoS algorithms.

1. Introduction
Blockchain was introduced in the year 2008 by an anonymous author named Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) .Initially the  
blockchain technology is used for cryptocurrency, later it has developed rapidly and become a popular choice for 
applications such as healthcare (Hasselgren 2020), supply chain (Queiroz 2020), and the Defi (Werner 2022). The 
blockchain technology offers a distributed ledger, which is a database of all transactions that are happening in the 
network and is tamper-proof i.e., nobody can modify the record of transactions once they are stored to the blockchain 
ledger. Consensus protocols are used for agreeing upon a block of transactions by all network participants (Harish 
Vemula et al. 2020). Performance of the blockchain platforms plays an important role while promoting widespread 
adoption of blockchain technology (Harish Vemula, R. Sridevi 2023). Depending on the blockchain platform, 
application requirements there are various consensus algorithms available such as Proof of Work. It consumes a lot of 
energy in order to solve the cryptographic puzzle, validators who ever solve the puzzle first get the chance of 
publishing the block which is verified and approved by other network participants. The alternative consensus 
mechanisms that avoid excess energy consumption are PoS, PoA etc. PoS reduces the energy consumption through 
the selection of validators depending on the number of tokens they have and they are willing to ""mint"" as collateral.

The empirical study reveals that PoA offers the highest throughput with respect to the increasing transaction arrival 
rate, while PoS offers a balanced approach with lower energy consumption. whereas PoW is secure but is less efficient 
in terms of throughput and energy consumption. 
 
5 Conclusion 
The study examines the performance of consensus algorithms Proof of Work , Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority 
in a split-join blockchain environment. The results show that PoW provides robust security but has limitations in 
performance and scalability due to high energy consumption and computational requirements. PoS offers a balanced 
approach with better performance and energy efficiency, but also carries risks of centralization. PoA delivers the

Abstract 
Catla Catla and Channa striata fish samples were collected from various sites of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. 
This comparative study examines the ectoparasitic and endoparasitic infestations in two freshwater fish species, Catla 
catla and Channa striata. Both species, common in South Asian freshwater ecosystems, differ in their feeding habits 
and ecological niches, which influence their susceptibility to parasitic infections. Catla catla a plankton-feeder, is 
primarily affected by nematodes such as Contracaecum, trematodes like Allocreadium, and ectoparasites such as 
Dactylogyrus on the gills and Argulus on the skin. In contrast, Channa striata, a carnivorous species, is prone to 
endoparasites like Clinostomum and Procamallanus, with a lower incidence of ectoparasitic infestations, including 
Gyrodactylus and Lernaea. The study highlights differences in parasite prevalence and type, with Catla catla showing 
higher ectoparasitic loads, especially on the gills, and Channa striata demonstrating a broader range of endoparasitic 
infections due to its predatory diet. This comparison underscores the role of feeding behavior and habitat in shaping 
parasitic communities in freshwater fish species.

1. Introduction
Parasitic infestations in freshwater fish play a significant role in influencing the health and productivity of aquatic 
ecosystems. Two economically important freshwater fish species, Catla catla and Channa striata, are commonly found 
in South Asian rivers, lakes, and ponds (Anwar et al, 2023). These species occupy different ecological niches and 
feeding habitats, which expose them to varying types of parasitic infections. Understanding the dynamics of these 
parasitic infestations is crucial for effective fish health management and sustainable aquaculture practices. 
Fresh water fishes, commonly known as Catla, is a surface and mid-water feeder, primarily consuming plankton. This 
dietary preference exposes it to a unique set of endoparasites (internal parasites) and ectoparasites (external parasites), 
which can cause significant health issues, including reduced growth rates, tissue damage, and mortality. Endoparasites, 
such as trematodes, nematodes, and cestodes, typically infect the intestines and body cavities, while ectoparasites, 
such as monogeneans and crustaceans, target the gills, skin, and fins of the fish.

Figure 4, Figure 5 showed that the parasitic infestation enhanced the host's immunity (white blood cells) against the 
lernaea infestation in C. catla, hence increasing the host's response to infection. Infected fish developed hemolytic 
anemia as a result of red blood cell destruction, which also increased the ESR value and increased hemoglobin release. 
7. Conclusion
The comparative analysis of Catla catla and Channa striata concerning ecto and endoparasitic infestations highlights 
the complexities of parasitic interactions within freshwater ecosystems and aquaculture systems. Both species exhibit 
distinct susceptibility and resistance patterns to various parasites, influenced by their ecological niches, physiological 
characteristics, and environmental conditions. Fresh water fishes, as a herbivorous fish, is more prone to ectoparasitic 
infections, particularly from monogeneans like Dactylogyrus and crustaceans such as Argulus. This vulnerability can 
be attributed to its feeding habits and gill morphology, which provide a conducive environment for ectoparasites. On 
the other hand, Channa striata, a carnivorous species, often harbors endoparasites like nematodes and trematodes due 
to its predatory lifestyle and the types of prey it consumes. The proposed integrated management strategies, combining 
biological controls, environmental management, targeted chemical treatments, and genetic selection, can significantly 
reduce parasitic loads in both species. Implementing these strategies will not only enhance fish health and growth but 
also improve the sustainability of aquaculture practices.

Abstract 
Email Spam Detection is a big issue for most email users and service providers. Email plays a major role in our 
online communication, like any other medium out there but email is also used to carry spam emails which can be 
treated as the biggest threat (spam). To build our model we use a dataset of emails with labels (spam or ham) in CSV 
file format. These methods include batch normalization (BN), dropout, and data augmentation, which let the model 
generalize better than unsupervised individual transfer learning. While training the model, we update its parameters 
using gradient descent-based algorithms and evaluate its performance based on accuracy, precision (true 
positive/true positives + false positives), recall (true positive/ true positives + false negatives), and F1-score. The 
results confirm that the designed model is reliable and thus very effective in capturing spam emails, providing high 
precision and recall.

1. Introduction
Scams and cyber-attacks are very common today, making it crucial to detect spam emails. Emails can be classified 
as spam or as normal mails by machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning models which have shown 
great promise in this aspect (Toma et al.2021). There is an open-source machine learning framework known as 
TensorFlow that can be used to build and train such models. Therefore, we can exploit the power of TensorFlow to 
create a strong spam detection system that assesses various email attributes including sender details, subject lines, 
body content, and attachments.

Figure 6. Normalized Confusion Matrix 
Figure 6 shows normalized confusion matrix that shows the performance of an SVM classification model. The 
model classifies the messages as ""ham"" (not spam) or ""spam"". The confusion matrix shows that the model is very 
good at classifying messages correctly. The small values in the off-diagonal cells indicate that the model makes very 
few mistakes. The model only misclassifies 1% of ""ham"" messages as ""spam"" and 2% of ""spam"" messages as 
""ham"". 
 
The AUC scores (Area Under the Curve) are also shown with ""No Skill"" representing a random classifier and 
""SVM"" representing the model being evaluated. The high AUC score for the SVM model (0.998) indicates that the 
model is very good at distinguishing between ""ham"" and ""spam"". Overall, this confusion matrix suggests that the 
model performs well at spam detection. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Email spam detection system developed in Python using TensorFlow entails an end-to-end pipeline that 
introduces data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, training, and evaluation. The second 
preprocessing step was further enhanced by using general stop words and spam-specific stop words to bring an 
increase in the model performance in classifying spam and non-spam emails. This helps the system realize that the 
text data is sequential, improving classification accuracy as an LSTM model. It is accurate and balances precision 
and recall, thereby reducing false positives and negatives. This renders a robust spam detection system that can be 
deployed for real-time classification of emails to ensure a cleaner and more secure inbox experience for users. An 
integration of TensorFlow and Python turns out to be an intense combination in meeting most of the challenges 
associated with spam email detection materializing the power of deep learning techniques in natural language 
processing application.

Abstract 
This paper highlights the significance of utilizing the digitally shared and visual complex examples through 
simulators or aids to enhance the teaching and learning process of Electromagnetic (EM) concepts and reflections on 
promoting EM education. Integration of engineering EM with preparatory mathematics and physics course can be an 
option with close collaboration between engineering, mathematics and physics faculty. This traditional course as a 
background is so essential in effective understanding of the trends and challenges as part of wired and wireless 
communications stream. Looking to the perspectives of student attention span, possibly impatient and distractions of 
modern times, the teacher enthusiasm is of primary importance in EM education. However, there is a need for 
replacing the traditional teaching with learning EM from rigorous mathematical perspective, with the help of 
modern software tools. Conceptual insight, historical context, access to National Digital Library, experimental 
demonstrations (with animations), student presentations, video based learning materials are essentially useful as 
supplement to conventional learning. Students though always link courses with their employment relevance, 
preparation of improved teaching learning with suitable framework help bringing students reasonably close to state 
of art.

Abstract 
In recent years, developing micro satellites (50-100 kg) by Universities, NITs, and IITs have emerged as a new trend 
in satellite technology because of its advantages such as short time and low cost for development, low cost for launching. 
The capability of RF communication between a micro satellite and a ground station is limited in terms of the time 
duration for communication and data latency. The micro satellite cannot be transferred whole data to the ground station 
due to gap between each pass duration.  These problems can be overcome by using a geostationary orbit satellite as a 
“Relay Satellite by using laser communications between a micro satellite and a geostationary satellite. RF 
communication is more dependable communication channels for satellite systems with existing technological 
limitations, atmospheric interference. To overcome the limitations and improving signal integrity and bandwidth, free-
space satellite laser communication has potential to revolutionize networks, making them more robust against 
environmental factors. Satellite communication providers and research institutions focused on exploring and expanding 
the frontiers of free-space laser communication with new methods in laser communication, significantly enhancing the 
performance and reliability of their satellite communication systems. In proposed communication model, the micro 
satellite in Low Earth Orbit (about 600 km altitude) will use laser to communicate with the geostationary orbit satellite 
which is at the altitude of 36,000 km. The communication speed is improved considerably, higher speed and large 
capacity with laser as carrier comparing to the radio frequency. This paper addresses an idea to provide the feasibility 
study of laser communications between micro satellites in LEO and geostationary satellites in GEO. A simulation model 
to be built for analysing the performance of laser communications between LEO micro satellites and GEO satellites.

1. Introduction (Motivation of Research)
The motivation goal of this research is providing the feasibility study of the laser communications system link between 
a micro satellite in low earth orbit and geo-stationary satellite in geo-synchronous orbit by using cutting-edge 
technologies. An Optical/Laser inter-satellite communication has been attracting worldwide attention because of the 
growing need for larger capacity and higher speed transmissions. Both RF and optical waves are electromagnetic 
waves and having many advantages for using optical waves in space. These include reduced mass, power, and volume

Figure 8. Layout of the link simulation 
 
Laser communication link simulation in free space environment was not feasible by simulation software tool, instead 
of that, RF over Fiber (RFoF) systems has been used to simulate optical link performance in ground for satellite signal. 
Satisfactory results were achieved through RFoF systems for received satellite signal which is same behaviour in space 
for optical communication link performance. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper gives a conceptual idea to research in laser communication in free space and provide the feasibility study 
of laser communications between the micro satellite and the GEO satellite. The overall design of the communications 
system which includes the micro satellite, the GEO satellite, and the communication link between them. The system 
design, requirement and link budget calculation were done based on assumed data for laser and RF communication 
for comparison purpose. 
 
A model of communication link between the micro satellite and the GEO satellite to be built and verification is being 
done by using the simulation software.  The goal of this paper is to bring out the feasibility study of designing the 
communications system between a micro satellite and a GEO satellite. Overall design of the communications system 
which includes the micro satellite, the GEO satellite, and the communication link between them is discussed. A set of 
full-scale demonstrations of high-speed laser satellite communication links is needed as the next step for optical 
communications in space in order that the future needs of intersatellite communication can be met with appropriate 
technologies.

Abstract 
A clinical Flow Cytometry laboratory underwent a diagnosis of its TAT indicator over a period of one year, finding 
an excess of 3.83 hours or 15.94% with respect to the 24-hour sector range. The response time (TAT) in a clinical 
laboratory is an indicator that measures the efficiency and quality of the service offered by delivering results reports 
on time. A TAT within the established parameters makes it possible to offer rapid treatment to patients, respond to the 
demand of an aging population and combat limited resources. As a proposal to improve the situation, pilot tests were 
implemented in the laboratory by applying lean Healthcare tools (KANBAN, SMED) and the automation method to 
its operational processes. Through a statistical validation of the results obtained through Student's t-test, a reduction 
of 12.86% of the TAT and the elimination of non-compliant products generated in the laboratory marking area is 
affirmed. Likewise, the project will be considered economically viable with an IRR of 67% and a B/C of 2.27. Finally, 
the project also contributes to the sustainable development goals towards 2030 number 3, 8 and 10.

1. Introduction
In Peru, 70% of cases linked to cancer are detected in advanced stages of the disease due to the late results of the 
current health system (Revilla 2021). Furthermore, the increase in patient management combined with limited 
resources for the medical sector are creating long wait lists, decreasing the quality of service, and causing 
dissatisfaction at the end (Kam et al. 2021). However, neoplasia diagnostic laboratories, as a support unit (Villacreces

The validation process of the proposed improvements was carried out through the implementation of a pilot program 
in which the collection and comparison of TAT data and other indicators between the improved model and the initial 
state of the laboratory was carried out. For both scenarios, monitoring was carried out over a month for the same 
number of randomly chosen samples. The validation process is limited only to control samples from patients with a 
disease already diagnosed; discarded samples are not considered for the evaluation. Furthermore, this study is focused 
only on the analytical phase, not covering the pre-analytical phase, which involves customer service activities and 
sample reception. 
 
5.2 Numerical results 
With the data of the indicators before and after the improvement, they were entered into a statistical software called 
Minitab in which it was determined that the values obtained from the proposed indicators follow a normal distribution 
through probability graphs (Figure 4).  
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Model probability plots 
 
In this program, the data were processed with t-student tests in which statistical values such as the P-Value were 
decisive in defining whether the addition of these actions (factor) truly influenced the main response variable TAT or 
other indicators. The most relevant results obtained are summarized in Table 2

As the Table shows, all the indicators proposed for the measurement of each component showed improvements due 
to the implementation, which together contributed to reduce the general TAT indicator by -12.86%, a value very close 
to the technical gap defined for the research project. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Kanban tool managed to reduce more than 4% of the time used in the marking area of a laboratory, while the 
SMED reduced over 80% in the analysis area. With this, the initial technical gap of 15.94% would be reduced until 
the TAT was placed in 24.25 business hours. Likewise, automation made it possible to reduce monthly non-compliant

products to 0 in the marking area; as well as, making more efficient use of laboratory supplies and staff time. On the 
other hand, it can be stated that the project is economically viable for the mype in question, since the IRR indicator 
was 67% and the benefit/cost was 2.27. It is worth to mention that the company did not need any type of financing 
because it is an improvement project and not an investment. Furthermore, it was recognized through a social evaluation 
that the implementation of these improvements contributes to the quality of the service in favor of people's health 
(related to SDG 3 “Health and Well-being”). Also, it allows to provide new job opportunities in the company under 
study (related to SDG 8 “Decent work and economic growth”). And the Peruvian population is favored in their access 
to health care, given that, with increased performance, prices can be adapted (related to SDG 10 “Reduction of 
inequalities”).

Abstract 
Metamaterials with smaller antennas and broader bandwidths that enhance signal penetration into biological tissues 
are among the new concepts being researched. Medical imaging, wearable electronics, and implanted devices are 
rapidly expanding fields in contemporary healthcare technology, and this analysis delves into its antenna 
applications. With an eye on enhancing diagnostic methods, treatment strategies, and wireless health monitoring 
systems, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the design and development of antennas based on 
metamaterials for medical purposes. New applications of metamaterials, such as biocompatibility, signal 
performance enhancements, and miniaturisation of antennas, are the subject of this paper. Due to their significance 
in medical contexts, three critical design features—impedance matching, radiation efficiency, and specific 
absorption rate—deserve further analysis. The proposed module has been validated using HFSS environment. 
Adaptive antenna design, multi-functional systems, and improved integration with biological surroundings are just a 
few of the research topics we suggest as potential solutions to the ever-changing demands of medical technology.  
Keywords 
Specific absorption rate (SAR), antenna miniaturisation, increased bandwidth 
1. Introduction
A device that can transform electrical energy into electromagnetic waves and back again is what we call an antenna. 
Both the architecture and the materials used to manufacture these antennas are different from meta materials. When 
used, they boost the efficiency of compact antenna systems. Antennas with a split-ring resonator (SRR), high-
impedance surface, cloak, super directive, electromagnetic bandgap, multiple bands, or tunable material are among 
the many options available. Among the several fields that gain from their development are medical imaging, radar, 
satellite, and wireless communication. A variety of antennas are available; among them are dielectric resonant, 
monopole, yagiuda, helical, horn, microstrip patch, loop, parabolic, and many more. There is a wide range of 
standards for antennas. What an antenna needs depends on the situation.  
Reduced size, higher efficiency, enhanced radiation pattern, and superior overall performance are just a few of the 
numerous 
advantages 
of 
meta

antennas. 
Metamaterial antennas are a promising new direction in antenna technology that provide fresh approaches to 
meeting the expanding demands of contemporary sensor and communication applications.Forecasts indicate that the 
influence of contemporary research and production techniques will continue to expand across a number of

could be elliptical, cylindrical, or linear. Accurate data transmission in medical applications relies on antenna 
polarisation alignment with signals. Signal loss will be reduced and overall communication will be improved. The 
use of metamaterials in antenna design significantly improves these performance indicators, allowing medical 
devices to communicate reliably and efficiently even in challenging environments. Antennas' large bandwidth allows 
for a multitude of frequencies and protocols, which might be useful for many medical technologies. The ability to 
tailor antenna performance for specific uses is driving innovation in healthcare. Medical equipment may be made 
smaller and more efficient with the use of metamaterials, which allow for the creation of smaller and lighter 
antennas.This improves the efficacy of tracking, diagnostics, and therapies. Their antennas, which are based on 
metamaterials, have medical applications that improve patient care and work optimally.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The purpose of this literature study is to examine several metamaterial antenna design objectives, all of which aim to 
enhance performance by tackling distinct problem statements. Several important factors need to be considered while 
constructing high-gain antennas. These include fractal dimensions, antenna shape and size, feed methods, substrate 
materials, and split-ring and complementary split-ring resonator properties. Contrarily, small, hidden antennas 
revolve on metamaterial architectures, loading methods, material qualities, and fractal dimensions. Engineers 
primarily study the shape, dielectric properties, feed mechanism efficiency, and metamaterial unit cell design of 
wide bandwidth antennas. Through careful adjustment of its fractal order, patch geometry, metamaterial 
characteristics, substrate materials, feed structures, and overall dimensions, an ideal antenna will reduce return loss 
(S11) to less than -15 dB. The potential for metamaterial technology to enhance antenna performance is shown by 
each of these objectives. potential of metamaterial technology to advance antenna performance across various 
metrics.

Abstract 
“The impact of COVID-19 on Portfolio Management of Investors in Telangana” study explores into how the 
pandemic has changed investor conduct and portfolio management tactics. By studying the disparities from multiple 
investors, the study aspires to figure out the changes in investor confidence and processes for making choices during 
the COVID-19 crisis. Demographic such as age, income brackets and line of employment. To identify the nature of 
shifts in investor mental state and actions, the study includes statistics such as cross tabulation and chi-square 
testing. It shows that investor confidence drastically dropped with the initial outbreak of the plague, especially 
among younger investors and those who operate in the private sector. Increased market volatility and economic 
uncertainty were held accountable for this downturn, causing investors more cautious and risk adverse methods. 
Additionally there were sign of a noteworthy movement asset as consequence of investors valuing liquidity and 
safety over high risk investments. The study argues that overall investor sentiment remained cautious despite a 
minor post pandemic increase in investor confidence. The investigation conducted brings attention to the need for 
better financial literary and education programs, specially targeted towards younger and lower income investors, so 
as to boost their ability to make smart picks and retain resistant during slumps in the economy. Further it advocates 
that financial institutions present more customized securities that are fit to the peculiar needs and risk sensitive of 
various investor groups. The document further highlights how vital it is for financial institutions and employers in 
the private sector to work closely together in order to provide support systems for investors. Such partnerships can 
help in rebuilding investor confidence and ensuring better preparedness for future economic uncertainties. Overall, 
the research provides valuable insights into how investors adapt their strategies in response to unprecedented 
challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of adaptive and informed portfolio 
management practices in Telangana.

1. Introduction
Portfolio management is necessary for securities holding during the age of globalization. It is both an art and a 
science, and it entails plenty more than just acquiring stocks from a financial consultant’s catalogue or adopting a 
security analyst’s formula of financial data. Building a portfolio is a fluid task and an ongoing decision-making 
process that implies a systematic strategy. It demands prudent discretion from management regarding the markets 
for securities and the unique demands of the person whose portfolio has been managed. This recurring technique

Before COVID-19, lower-income individuals had higher confidence in their portfolios compared to high-income 
earners. During the pandemic, confidence dropped across all-income groups, especially among those earning 
between 500,001 and 1,000,000. Post-pandemic, confidence rebounded, with the highest recovery seen in the over 
1,000,000 income group. ANOVA indicated no significant differences in confidence levels between income groups 
overall (p > 0.05), but a near-significant difference during the pandemic (p = 0.087). Overall, COVID-19 negatively 
impacted confidence for all income levels, with partial and uneven recovery afterward. 
 
The limitations of this studies are : 
• 
The study Concentrates exclusively on investors in Telangana. 
• 
The study relies on self-reported data, which can be biased or inaccurate. 
• 
May not represent the entire population of investors in Telangana. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research assesses show COVID-19 affectedness to confidence and behavior, focus in on a diverse sample of 
young, middle-income earners, and private sector employees. Before the pandemic, younger investors shows the 
highest confidence, which significantly dropped during COVID-19 and only partially recovered afterward. 
Similarly, confidence among private sector employees and lower-income individuals, initially high, declined during 
the pandemic but saw partial rebound post-COVID. Chi-square test results revealed a notable link between 
confidence levels during and after the pandemic, with many investors either maintaining their pre-COVID 
confidence or adopting more neutral views. Nearly half of the respondents were private sector employees, with

balanced representation across other occupations. The income distribution highlighted a majority of middle and 
lower-income groups, shedding light on their financial behaviors and investment decisions. The findings suggest 
substantial pandemic impact on investor confidence with varied recovery levels. Recommendations include 
bolstering investor education and support, creating targeted financial products for younger investors, and enhancing 
financial literacy programs, especially for lower-income and middle- income individuals. Collaboration between 
private sector employers and financial institutions is also recommended to improve financial well-being and 
confidence.

Abstract 
A Roll cage is a reinforced framework installed within a vehicle's passenger area, designed to shield occupants by 
absorbing impact forces during crashes. It enhances safety by preventing the cabin from collapsing under extreme 
conditions. In All Terrain Vehicle the main outer structure is that provides protection to the Driver any crash or 
rollover. The Roll cage also acts as the vehicle main fame providing mountings to the component like suspension 
system, transmission system, and steering system. The roll cage is fabricated using AISI 4130, a high-strength, low-
alloy steel known for its durability and excellent impact resistance. The 3D solid modelling of roll cage is designed 
in the SolidWorks’ 2022 as per the requirements of vehicle sub-systems and assembly. The dynamic behavior of the 
roll cage is carried out in ANSYS workbench 2023 with different collisions like Front impact, Rear impact and 
rollover. The main objective of the analysis is to develop a roll cage design that is both robust enough to withstand 
harsh conditions and lightweight to enhance vehicle performance. The objective is to achieve an optimal safety factor, 
ensuring that the ATV's roll cage remains secure under all circumstances.

1. Introduction
All-Terrain Vehicle is a straddle seating position with a handle bar steering and the ability to maneuver through various 
Terrain conditions including dirt trails, mud, sand, and rocky surfaces. This design is for an Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) 
intended for rugged terrains, featuring four low-pressure or non-pneumatic tires. The vehicle is built with a straddle-
style seat and handlebars for steering, providing the operator with optimal control. It is designed specifically for a 
single rider, with no additional passenger capacity. 
The roll cage of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) is a crucial structural framework designed not only protects the 
driver but also provides structural support for essential systems. like the suspension, steering, and powertrain. The 
success of an ATV heavily depends on the roll cage, as its failure could significantly endanger the driver. 
Therefore, the roll cage design emphasizes driver safety alongside structural integrity and performance ease of 
manufacturing, durability, compactness, lightweight construction, and ergonomic considerations. The roll cage is 
typically constructed from thin, seamless pipes welded together to form a rigid structure capable of withstanding 
vehicle rollover sand harsh conditions.

Abstract 
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a material extrusion process that 
commonly uses additive manufacturing. FDM uses thermoplastic polymers as filament stored in a reservoir or 
container. The filament is extruded from the print nozzle by application of pressure at specific temperatures. The 
object to be printed is governed by various material and machine parameters. The material to be printed is 
continuously extruded through the extruder nozzle of the printer through two rollers moving in opposite 
directions. The filament extruded on the built platform is stacked layer-by-layer until the formation of the object. 
The printing takes place as CAD model from the software is sliced, which acts as an input to the 3D printer, 
causing the print nozzle to move in desired arrangements and paths based on the G-Codes obtained from the 
slicer software. Few machines also possess dual extrusion or two extruders providing printing of different 
materials based on the needed properties of the product. The liquefaction or melting of the filament at 
temperatures varies with the materials to be extruded. The properties of the manufactured parts depend on the 
material used and its parameters, such as mechanical and thermal properties. Layer resolution, build orientation, 
temperature, raster angle, and air gap, known as the machine parameters, play the decisive role for a good 
printed FDM part.

Introduction
Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the methods used in 3D printing. This technique is one of the 
manufacturing methods under the additive manufacturing engineering class, gaining popularity among researchers 
and industry to study and develop. Additive manufacturing techniques can create various complex shapes and 
structures while properly managing materials, resulting in less waste and various other advantages over 
conventional manufacturing, making it increasingly popular. Technically, the FDM technique has the same role as 
injection molding in the manufacturing aspect. For example, mass customization. It means producing a series of 
personalized items, so that each product can be different while maintaining low prices due to mass production. 
The basic concept of the FDM manufacturing process is simply melting the raw material and forming it to 
build new shapes. The material is a filament placed in a roll, pulled by a drive wheel, and then put into a 
temperature-controlled nozzle head and heated to semi liquid. The nozzle precisely extrudes and guides

6. Conclusions 
FDM 3D printing is still not, and probably in the near future will not become a technology capable of 
displacing traditional manufacturing techniques in mass applications. FDM technology, however, allows 
the obtaining of unique individual elements with satisfactory properties and, in the case of personal 3D 
printers, also an acceptable price. Problems with the quality of 3D printing stems mostly from changing of 
environmental conditions, the required high accuracy calibration of a printer (especially the build table 
leveling), that is a necessary condition for obtaining proper adhesion of the first layer to the table. In order 
to obtain correct, non-deformed prints from some materials (PLA), direct cooling of the printed item is also 
necessary. The Effect of FDM process parameters of layer thickness, volume infill and print speed of PLA 
material was first systematically investigated in this study and also tensile test was performed. The results 
indicated that the optimal combination of tensile strength is layer thickness of 0.2-0.25mm, volume infill 
of 50-75%, and print speed of 18-20mm/sec. From this set of combinations the optimum tensile strength 
is obtained as 20-25 MPa.

Abstract 
Non-invasive vital sign monitoring has become increasingly significant, offering enhanced patient comfort and 
enabling remote healthcare applications. This paper presents a novel, contactless system that leverages Ultra-
Wideband (UWB) radar technology to continuously monitor critical vital signs, including heart rate and respiration, 
without physical contact. Using a radar module and an high frequency microcontroller, this system offers a wireless, 
non-invasive monitoring solution designed for use in both hospital and home environments. The UWB radar’s 
advanced capabilities allow accurate detection of subtle movements associated with heartbeats and breathing from 
distances up to 5 meters. This makes the system an ideal option for vulnerable patients who may find traditional 
monitoring methods uncomfortable or unsuitable, such as individuals with burns, infants, elderly patients, or those 
with contagious diseases. The absence of electrodes, wires, and sensors enhances patient comfort and mobility, 
reducing the likelihood of skin irritation or infection. Moreover, UWB radar technology addresses key challenges of 
conventional, contact-based monitoring by offering high precision and reliability while maintaining low power 
consumption. This innovative system thus combines accuracy and efficiency, ensuring that healthcare providers 
have a versatile and effective tool for monitoring vital signs continuously and remotely. It aligns with the growing 
need for remote health solutions, supporting safe and comfortable monitoring both in medical facilities and home 
care environments.

1. Introduction
Monitoring vital signs such as heart rate and respiration plays a critical role in healthcare, especially for patients in 
intensive care or those with fragile health conditions. These physiological parameters provide essential insights into 
a patient’s overall health, helping medical professionals make timely decisions and deliver appropriate interventions. 
Traditional monitoring methods, including Electrocardiograms (ECG) and Pulse Oximetry, while widely used, often 
rely on direct physical contact with the patient. This requirement can create significant discomfort, especially for

Moreover, younger participants are typically positioned closer to the radar than older individuals, which may 
inform sensor placement optimization based on age. This data supports the radar system’s suitability for diverse 
respiratory monitoring applications, ensuring accurate and consistent measurements across different 
demographics and settings. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The primary goal of this method is to measure a person's respiration rate using radar technology without the need 
for physical contact. By eliminating the requirement to touch the human body, this system significantly enhances 
both the mobility and comfort of patients during monitoring. We conducted tests across a range of individuals 
from various age groups, evaluating the accuracy of the system as a function of the distance between the radar 
module and the target. Additionally, we varied the distance for the same individual multiple times to assess the 
consistency and reliability of the measurements.

Abstract 
E-waste or electronic waste is one of the fasted growing concerns in the world. The old and obsolete
appliances/gadgets like laptops, computers, mobiles, TVs, DVD players, and home appliances like refrigerators, music 
systems etc. fall in this category. One of the major concerns for human health and the environment is the presence of
hazardous chemicals in e-waste. India has become the third biggest generator of e-waste behind US and China
producing 3.23 million tons of e-waste per year. The objective of current study to understand about the awareness,
knowledge, management and disposal of e-waste issues among engineering students in Hyderabad City. The students
were divided into two groups, namely those belonging to IT Courses (Computer Science, IT, Electronics &
Communication, Instrumentation, AI & ML, Data Science) and the other group (Civil, Mechanical, Production,
Automobile, and Architecture). A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was self-developed for the study. The
questionnaire collected the student’s demography, knowledge of e-waste awareness, ownership and usage of
electronic gadgets. The study also included  e-waste handling and health risks and e-waste management and disposal.
It is found that there is little difference about e-waste awareness among IT and non-IT students. However, the students
of IT related departments are more aware of risks of e-waste than others. Students from both the groups are not much
aware of e-waste disposal practices and government legislations. The factors preventing proper disposal of e-waste

          Abstract 
The logistics sector in India is rapidly expanding, contributing around 14% to the country's GDP. This growth is driven 
by the rise of logistics and government initiatives like ""Make in India,"" offering significant opportunities for Logistics 
Service Providers (LSPs). However, LSPs must adapt their strategies to seize these opportunities, as they face several 
challenges in delivering shipments on time and in good condition. Despite government efforts through large-scale 
projects, the sector still grapples with fragmentation, unorganized operations, infrastructure bottlenecks, and rising 
costs, all of which affect service quality. As India emerges as a global manufacturing hub, increasing demand in 
domestic and international markets is creating new opportunities for Indian industries. Globalization has intensified 
competition, compelling industries to produce cost-effective, high-quality goods under tight delivery schedules. 
However, issues like delayed shipments, poor quality supplies, and cost escalation threaten the credibility and business 
prospects of Indian manufacturers. Supply chain disruptions, in particular, can lead to significant losses.

1. Introduction
In the age of e-commerce and intense global competition, the range of services offered by logistics service providers 
(LSPs) in developing countries like India has expanded significantly. Currently, the logistics sector contributes 
approximately 14% to India's GDP and is projected to grow at 1.5 to 2 times its current rate. According to the Logistics 
Performance Index (LPI) Survey 2014, India ranks 54th out of 160 countries with a score of 3.08. For LSPs to thrive 
and expand in this competitive environment, maintaining high service quality across all logistics functions is crucial. 
They must deliver top-notch services to ensure business continuity and future growth. 
India presents substantial growth opportunities for LSPs, driven by the rise in e-businesses and the Indian 
government's “Make in India” initiative. Additionally, technological advancements and increasing globalization 
compel organizations to revamp their strategies and develop products that cater to global demands through enhanced 
logistics capabilities. However, LSPs face numerous challenges in meeting the rising expectations of businesses. The 
current capacities of LSPs do not align with industry requirements, particularly in developing countries like India 
where infrastructural bottlenecks are a major concern. Issues such as poor road conditions, inadequate air and sea port 
capacities, limited connectivity, heavy congestion, and inefficiencies at check posts and tolls are prevalent. National 
highways account for only 2% of India's roads but handle around 40% of total road freight movement. Similarly, five 
major airports and twelve major seaports in metropolitan areas manage approximately 85% of air freight traffic. 
Furthermore, the lack of advanced IT tools and a limited skilled workforce hinder the growth of LSPs. High investment 
costs combined with low profit margins, exacerbated by delayed payments from Indian shippers, slow down the

Abstract 
This paper explores the concept of Operational Excellence and its achievement through the implementation of Lean 
Six Sigma (LSS). We define Operational Excellence and LSS, and delve into the DMAIC phases of LSS, which are 
the cornerstone of this methodology. We also identify and discuss various types of wastes prevalent in different 
sectors, highlighting the need for LSS implementation. The paper presents a few case studies that demonstrate the 
successful application of the DMAIC framework in different contexts. Additionally, we outline essential tools for 
implementing LSS and discuss critical failure factors that organizations should be aware of. Finally, we conclude by 
emphasizing the significance of LSS in achieving Operational Excellence and enhancing organizational performance.

1. Introduction
Lean six sigma is a philosophy or methodology that gained a vast appreciation in the organizations By eliminating the 
wastes and defects in the products and improving the quality that leading to operational excellence of an organization. 
The objective of this paper is to understand how lean six sigma helps to achieve operational excellence. 
Operational Excellence originated from Treacy and Wiersema's (1995) book, 'Discipline of Market Leaders' 
(Dahlgaard et al.1999) Operational Excellence refers to a strategy that aims to provide exceptional quality, 
affordability, ease of purchase, and service in a market or industry (Basu, R., 2004.). Operational Excellence (OE) is 
a program that focuses on increasing and sustaining business performance through quality management. OE refers to 
business excellence, but also includes manufacturing, service, marketing, and supply chain. To remain at the top of 
their sector, companies often require a long-term improvement strategy of five to 10 years. (Gupta et al.2018). 
Lean Six Sigma is a synergized managerial paradigm of Lean and Six Sigma. Six Sigma (6σ) is a collection of methods 
and resources for enhancing processes. In 1986, American engineer Bill Smith introduced it while he was employed 
at Motorola. Its goal is to attain lower defect levels than what was previously deemed reasonable or necessary. Six 
Sigma performance is specifically associated with 3.4 Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO). 
(Nonthaleerak2006). In their book The Machine That Changed the World, James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and 
Daniel Roo from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology introduced the concept of lean manufacturing by 
contrasting American and Japanese businesses. With the introduction of the Toyota Production System (TPS), the 
most efficient became Toyota Motor Company. The TPS was praised as the first system to operate in line with Lean 
principles.( Łukasz Dekier 2012). Lean Thinking is built on the removal of waste. Liker defines lean as a

4. Conclusion 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a powerful methodology for achieving operational excellence, but its effective application 
requires careful consideration of various factors. Proper project selection, complexity evaluation, alternative problem-
solving methods, and timely implementation are crucial elements that must be carefully evaluated to ensure the success 
of LSS initiatives. 
 
Firstly, proper project selection is critical. LSS projects should be aligned with organizational goals and objectives, 
and should address significant pain points or opportunities for improvement. Projects that are too small or too simple 
may not be the best candidates for LSS, as the methodology may be overkill. On the other hand, projects that are too 
complex may require additional resources and expertise. 
 
Secondly, complexity evaluation is essential. LSS projects should be evaluated based on their complexity, and the 
appropriate tools and methodologies should be applied. For example, simple projects may require only basic problem-
solving tools, while more complex projects may require advanced statistical analysis and modeling. 
 
Thirdly, alternative problem-solving methods should be considered. LSS is not the only methodology available, and 
other approaches such as Kaizen, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and Theory of Constraints (TOC) may be 
more appropriate in certain situations. 
 
Fourthly, timely implementation is crucial. LSS projects should be implemented in a timely manner, with clear 
milestones and deadlines. Delays can lead to loss of momentum, and can undermine the success of the project. 
Finally, a thoughtful and strategic approach to LSS implementation is essential. Organizations should carefully 
evaluate their readiness for LSS, and should develop a clear implementation plan that aligns with their goals and 
objectives. This includes developing the necessary infrastructure, training and developing personnel, and establishing 
clear metrics and benchmarks. 
 
By acknowledging these factors and adopting a judicious approach, organizations can harness the full potential of LSS 
to drive operational excellence, enhance efficiency, and achieve sustainable improvements. LSS can help 
organizations reduce waste, improve quality, and increase customer satisfaction, leading to increased competitiveness 
and long-term success.

Abstract 
A straightforward interface is offered by the student information management system for the upkeep of student data. 
Colleges and other educational institutions can use it to efficiently store student records. If we require information on 
our college attendance record or exam outcomes, we must visit the faculty. This technique has many drawbacks 
because managing paper records is difficult. Using a manual approach makes it challenging to accomplish this goal 
because the information is diseased, sometimes redundant, and may take a long time to gather. The greatest remedy 
for this is a website that manages and retains student data in one location. Every student's basic information, attendance 
record, and roll number are listed. While administrators can log in as admin to handle student details, the user login 
module handles student login. Our student management system is used to manage the various student-related tasks. It 
is within the administrator's power to add, edit, and remove users. Students have the ability to register for an account 
and add, edit, and remove data from it, such as results, placements, and personal data. Admins are able to analyse each 
student's statistics and provide a thorough summary of the student's feedback. Students will have access to a feedback 
feature. Faculty and administration will be advised of any respectful input.

1. Introduction
The previous college student record-keeping system was a manual, paper-based method. Furthermore, there was a 
possibility of data loss. We must go to the faculty if we require information on our college attendance record, test 
results, or anything else. If the faculty needs student data, they must search through several files, whether they are 
paper or desktop files. A website that manages and retains student data in one location is the best way to address this. 
A straightforward interface is offered by the student information management system for the upkeep of student 
dataAdministrators and students are two of the user categories that are present. The student profile can be added to or 
edited by the administrator. The student can maintain an updated profile, and the administrator has access to all of the

Figure 9. Dash board 
 
The dashboard is designed to provide students with comprehensive access to their academic life and activities. By 
consolidating important information and tools in one location, the dashboard enhances the user experience, promotes 
engagement, and supports academic success. In the dashboard, we will see student attendance, personal information, 
academic details, extracurricular activities, and a feedback form. 
 
6. Conclusion  
An easy-to-use interface is offered by this system for maintaining student data. Colleges and other educational 
institutions can use it to efficiently store student records. Using a manual approach makes it challenging to accomplish 
this goal, since the data is dispersed, often duplicated, and may take a long time to gather. A student information 
management system accessible online is used to tackle each of these issues. The work's main goal is to make 
information easily understandable by offering features like online student registration and profile development, which 
cut down on paperwork and automate the process of creating records at educational institutions. In this essay, we draw 
the conclusion that all of our aims and objectives have been effectively met, the software system is performing as 
predicted, and its operations are running smoothly. Therefore, even though the program is still being hosted on a web 
portal, it is ready for usage in any educational institution. The program is web-based and works with a variety of 
browsers, including Internet Explorer, Chrome, and others. The program is fully functional and was created on a 
Windows operating system. As a result, we can say that the software for the student information system has been 
developed and tested several times.

1. Introduction
Friction Stir Additive Manufacturing (FSAM) represents a cutting-edge technology that integrates the concepts of 
Friction Stir Welding (FSW) combined with additive manufacturing (AM) processes (Majid et al. 2023). As a solid-
state technique, FSAM operates below the melting point of the materials involved, offering distinct advantages over 
conventional fusion-based additive manufacturing methods like Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Electron Beam 
Melting (EBM). FSAM addresses many of the challenges faced by traditional additive manufacturing processes, 
including issues related to porosity, residual stresses, and microstructural inhomogeneity, which often result in 
inferior mechanical properties.   
FSW, developed by The Welding Institute (TWI) in 1991, was originally used as a method to join materials in the 
solid state, particularly for materials challenging to weld with conventional techniques, such as aluminium alloys. 
In FSW, a rotating tool is utilized to produce frictional heat, plasticizing the material without causing it to reach its 
melting point, resulting in high-quality, defect-free joints (Joey et al. 2019). Leveraging the success of FSW, FSAM 
emerged as an innovative approach to depositing material layer by layer, combining the benefits of solid-state 
welding with the flexibility of additive manufacturing (Figure 1).

5.3 Validation 
Validation of FSAM's performance comes from mechanical testing of components produced using this method. 
Fatigue testing, hardness measurements, and corrosion resistance tests all confirm the reliability of FSAM in 
producing high-performance components. Additionally, statistical analysis shows that FSAM consistently 
outperforms traditional methods in critical applications.   
6. Conclusion
FSAM is a transformative technology that combines the best of friction stir welding and additive manufacturing. It 
offers superior mechanical properties, reduced defects, and improved material efficiency, making it ideal for 
industries requiring high-strength, lightweight components [10]. While challenges remain in terms of process 
control and scalability, ongoing research into tool design and automation will continue to expand FSAM's 
capabilities. This paper concludes that FSAM has the potential to revolutionize modern manufacturing, especially 
in high performance sectors like aerospace and automotive (Additive Manufacturing for Aerospace Applications, 
2018)

Abstract 
Convergent-divergent nozzles (CDN), commonly used in rocket engines, jet propulsion, and industrial gas turbines, 
are essential for accelerating fluid flow to supersonic speeds. This paper investigates the optimization and 
performance analysis of these nozzles, focusing on factors such as nozzle geometry, pressure ratios, and boundary 
conditions. Optimizing these parameters enhances nozzle efficiency, reduces energy losses, and ensures stable 
supersonic flow. Geometric optimization involves refining the nozzle's contour to reduce flow separation and 
minimize shockwave formation, particularly in the divergent section. Additionally, achieving an optimal pressure 
ratio between the inlet and outlet plays a significant role in maximizing exhaust velocity and minimizing shock-
induced losses. Performance analysis is conducted through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Simulations are 
used to predict flow characteristics, Mach number distributions, and shock locations, while experimental tests 
validate these models by measuring parameters such as thrust, exhaust velocity, and specific impulse. By combining 
these techniques, the study provides comprehensive insights into the behavior of convergent-divergent nozzles under 
various operating conditions. The results contribute to the design of more efficient propulsion systems, emphasizing 
the importance of nozzle optimization in enhancing the performance of aerospace and industrial applications 
involving high-speed fluid flow.

Abstract 
The aim of the study is to analyze and identify the major financial risks that are present in the construction industry 
of India. Financial risk is very important factor which have potential to negatively impact the construction projects. 
For the purpose of gathering the information, about these risks a questionnaire was distributed to the experts of the 
Indian construction industry. This helped to gain insights an opinion of individuals who have very vast knowledge of 
construction industry in India. This study showcases various financial risks which are significant that includes 
inflation, sudden price fluctuations, shortage in material and labor supply. Financial practice can have direct inflation 
of project cost and their timely completion. This study has not focused on political social and cultural areas as data 
assumed to be insignificant and contacts of Indian construction industry. This is due to the fact of Government stability 
and the impact of cultural differences on construction projects. Both local and multinational construction experts gave 
their opinion on ranking of risks in Indian construction market. The findings of the study indicates that most of the 
risks are either allocated to contractor or shared with the owner, on the other hand owner has been allocated very few 
risks.

Introduction
Any business is susceptible to risk, same is the case with Indian construction industry. Since number of people 
involve in the construction industry are more like owner, sub-contractors, architect and various other stake holders 
so it is more vulnerable to risks. Any Building scheme/project is unique in its nature can only be made once. It has 
involvement of teams from different areas, organization that are temporary in nature. One of the tools in risk 
management is  identify and assess the upcoming risk in a project. All project undertakings have some degree of 
risk, still most of the stakeholders of project are not well prepared in identifying, analyzing or addressing the 
potential risk. If we try to find all risks then it will take a lot of time and it will also be very less productive. Trying 
to consider every risk will guarantee a failed project. Thus, it is most natural to identify the most significant risk in 
construction industry.

5. Summary and Conclusion 
The general increase in price of goods and commodities over a given period of time is called as inflation, which 
leads to decrease purchasing power of a currency opening country. If we look at Indian construction market 
inflation as a major impact on fruited cost as land, labor, material become  more costly. Any sudden change in price 
will have effect on project budget and its completion time which makes a challenge for both the client and 
contractor for effective management of cost. This variation in cost can be because of any of the following reasons- 
market demand, supply chain disruption, a change in policies of government etc.  
 
This study shows that more than 50% of the respondents believe that, the risk of inflation and change in price 
should be shared with the contractor and the owner of the project. This shows that there is a need for collaboration 
and risk management agreement between the project stakeholders.  Near about 30% of respondents believe that this

risk should be allocated to contractor. This variation  in opinion can lead to challenging contract negotiation 
ultimately lead to overprice by contractors in mitigation of the risk. Other than inflation, other financial risk such 
as shortage in resources have high threat for construction projects in India. These shortages will cause way delays 
and increase in cost, and decrease in quality if they are not managed effectively. Analyst’s require the financial 
planning effectiveness and mitigate their impact on supply chain which will have impact on project  completion.

Abstract 
In industrial systems, quality, reliability, and maintenance are critical factors that determine operational efficiency and 
customer satisfaction. This paper reviews the intersection of these three aspects in the context of industrial engineering 
and operations management (IEOM). It emphasizes integrated strategies such as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), 
Reliability-Cantered Maintenance (RCM), and Six Sigma, which enhance system reliability while maintaining high-
quality standards. Case studies from the manufacturing and energy sectors illustrate the benefits of proactive quality 
and maintenance systems. The paper concludes with best practices for optimizing the balance between quality control, 
reliability engineering, and maintenance operations.

1. Introduction
In the current competitive environment, the interconnectedness of quality, reliability, and maintenance is essential for 
achieving organizational excellence. Quality management systems ensure that products not only comply with 
established specifications but also meet and exceed customer expectations (Deming, 1986; Juran, 1988). Reliability is 
defined as the ability of products to perform consistently over time, which is crucial for minimizing operational failures 
and enhancing customer trust (Lewis, 1996). Moreover, maintenance strategies are integral to preserving both quality 
and reliability throughout a product’s lifecycle, thereby maximizing its value and performance (Mobley, 2002). This 
paper delves into the complex interactions among these three pivotal elements, drawing from a wide range of scholarly 
contributions in the field. 
The discussion further highlights an integrated management approach that aligns quality, reliability, and maintenance 
within industrial systems, emphasizing their collective impact on enhancing operational effectiveness. By examining

5.2 Validation 
This paper extensively reviews established research to validate the intersection of quality, reliability, and maintenance 
in modern industrial systems. The methodologies discussed Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Reliability-
Cantered Maintenance (RCM), and Six Sigma are supported by a robust body of literature, including seminal works 
by Nakajima (1988), Moubray (1997), and Deming (1986). These strategies have been implemented across diverse 
industries, and their effectiveness has been consistently documented in improving system reliability and reducing 
operational downtime. The research by Jardine et al. (2006) on condition-based maintenance and by Wang et al. (2016) 
on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) further validates the growing trend of predictive maintenance systems, 
which leverage real-time data to predict failures and optimize maintenance schedules. By synthesizing these insights, 
this paper affirms that integrated strategies not only lead to operational efficiency but also provide a competitive 
advantage through higher product reliability and customer satisfaction. Additionally, challenges such as resistance to 
change and the need for employee training, as noted by Bessant et al. (2005), are important considerations that 
reinforce the need for a well-supported implementation framework. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Through a detailed review of current literature, this paper concludes that integrating quality, reliability, and 
maintenance practices is critical for enhancing the overall performance of industrial systems. The findings from 
various studies show that methodologies such as TPM and RCM, when combined with modern technologies like IoT 
and predictive analytics, can drastically reduce downtime, increase equipment lifespan, and ensure high-quality 
production. This integration not only improves operational efficiency but also fosters long-term sustainability by 
extending the lifecycle of assets and reducing maintenance costs. Moreover, the reviewed research emphasizes the 
importance of a culture of continuous improvement and employee involvement, which are crucial for overcoming 
implementation barriers such as lack of management support or resistance to new maintenance practices. By drawing 
from a wide array of academic and industrial studies, this paper presents a holistic framework that industries can adopt 
to achieve a balance between quality control, system reliability, and proactive maintenance strategies. Future research 
should explore the deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in predictive maintenance to 
further enhance decision-making and operational outcomes.

Abstract 
With the increase in focus on productivity and technological intervention in coal processing, workers’ health is 
impacted. Although, conscious workers, stringent labour regulations, and expected long term benefits have forced 
production facilities to focus not only operational performance but also workers’ overall health. But due to higher 
focus on general industrial safety and slow impact on workers’ health, Human Factors and Ergonomics are given lesser 
focus in coal processing plants. As Human Factors and Ergonomics concerns of workers have slow impact, so workers 
are left with lesser focus of management on elimination or mitigation of risks relates to Human Factors and 
Ergonomics. But considering long terms impact of Human Factors and Ergonomics on workers’ health and social 
commitment is forcing organizations to gauge Human Factors and Ergonomics risks and develop- counter measures. 
Therefore, this study aims to identify, prioritize the Human Factors and Ergonomics risks in a coal processing plant 
and provide management a comprehensive analysis to enable them to eliminate or mitigate the risks and improve 
workers’ overall safety and health and remain competitive in long term.

1. Introduction
Organizational health, safety and Environment are threatened by coal processing units in various ways and become 
quite harmful if relevant, on-time and effective control measures either to eliminate or reduce the impact are not taken 
(Singh and Gupta, 2020). Coal Processing at a coal washery comprises different activities segmented mainly into 
maintenance, operations, logistics, transportation, material handling, office work. The priority to improve safety and 
reduce impact on environment has become one of the top priority of organizations due to increased awareness of 
workers, Employee wellbeing centric approach from management (Singh and Gupta, 2020) customer sensitivity for 
brands’ orientation for employee and social wellbeing, stricter regulations & reporting by government organizations 
like DGMS ( Directorate General of Mines Safety), CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board), SPCBs(State Pollution 
Control Boards) and many more related to industrial safety and hazard control authorities (Smith et. al., 2022). 
But as Ergonomics has, most of the time, slow and long-term impact so it gets less attention in the industry to be 
tackled with. As the factors responsible for musculoskeletal disorders are not easily identifiable; their quantification 
is even more difficult (Kolus, et. al, 2023). Due to slow impact, even workers do not realise the severity of ergonomic 
unsafe practices and they remain lesser concerned. But the impact of ergonomic factors on health of workers can’t be 
ignored due to the visible and long-term impacts. 
Although rapid automation and mechanization has reduced and even eliminated many manual jobs but there are still 
lots of manual jobs which are part of plant operations (Panagou, et. al., 2024). These jobs are performed by same 
people for long time some time for years. These jobs have most of the repetitive actions impacting physical, Reduction 
or elimination of risk requires the focused attention and having countermeasures for respective risks. With high number

Importance rank for Work Design factors amongst themselves is as follows: 
Job Clarity > Job Autonomy > Job Rotation 
6. Conclusion 
With increasing pressure for productivity and technological intervention in all spectrums of work life, workers health 
is impacted in many ways. Coal processing being labour intensive jobs are normally considered to pose 
musculoskeletal risks over long time. But, with increasing automation and dependence over technology, workers are 
expected to perform more number of activities which are less of physical nature. These changed natures of jobs are 
also impacting mental health. So, considering other human factors along with physical one is necessary for coal 
processing and other related plants for better assessment of workers’ overall health. Industries are focusing on overall 
health of workers to mitigate, reduce the risks and their impacts to remain productive, competitive and many a times 
statutory compliant.

Abstract 
High population and urbanization growth rate raises the issue of air pollution in recent years. Air quality monitoring 
is one of the major concerns due to its influence on human health. With the advancement in sensing and embedded 
technology, Internet of Things becomes one of the economic alternative to implement air quality monitoring 
system(AQMS)compared to costly and fixed air quality monitoring stations. In this paper we present the ample review 
of candidate enabling technology for IoT based AQMS architecture. Specifically, we start with overview of major low 
cost air pollutant sensors classification, typical error sources and calibration methodologies. Then we present analysis 
and comparative study of infrastructure protocols and application layer protocols to support IoT based architecture for 
AQMS. We also review existing system and categorised them based on deployment strategy employed. Finally, 
challenges involved in building such systems are discussed in detail.

1.Introduction
One of the issues where increased population, urbanization, and industrial activities make it important globally is air 
quality. It is not an end result as the effects go further by affecting public health, intensifying climate change, and 
disturbing the ecological balance. The harmful pollutants that now fill the air we breathe include carbon dioxide, 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter. They have led to a huge 
number of respiratory diseases and cardiovascular disorders and even deaths from old age. Therefore, a solution was 
urgently required, and the technological solution attracted the attention of scientists as well as policymakers. 
Traditional air quality monitoring systems are powerful but have significant disadvantages. The systems are mainly 
fixed and, therefore, very resource-intensive and expensive; thus, they can be used in very few places. This forms the 
major reason they can never be adequate and timely enough to facilitate data about the air quality in underdeveloped 
regions and densely populated urban areas. With that motivation, there has been a call to explore other alternative 
methods that are cost-effective and scalable to give real-time data. 
It brought into the arena the Internet of Things (IoT), with all of its transformative possibilities in this area. 
The IoT-based air quality monitoring system is dynamic and scalable. The number of pollutants being monitored and 
analyzed in real time can vary with a low-cost sensor with microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any similar

The GP2Y1014AU0F is an optical dust sensor designed to detect airborne particulate matter, such as dust, 
smoke, and allergens. It uses an infrared LED and a photodiode to measure the scattering of light caused by 
particles in the air. The sensor outputs an analog voltage that corresponds to the dust concentration. 
Operating at a voltage of 5V, it provides real-time monitoring of air quality. It is compact, energy-efficient, 
and highly sensitive, making it suitable for various applications like air purifiers and HVAC systems. The 
GP2Y1014AU0F is commonly used in both consumer and industrial environments. 
 
4. Results and Discussions 
The device that has been presented can show data on LCD (Figure 5).We reviewed 7 days of data from South and  
North City of Delhi. Using their device. 
In this review we have found that this device only measure and display Air quality:  
 
• 
To check air quality every time we need to press button. 
• 
This is static device.  
• 
This device is not future ready to integrate wireless feature in future.

5. Conclusion 
We will replace Arduino Uno with ESP32 microcontroller which is more powerful and advance as compare to 
Arduino Uno. 
 
• 
The ESP32 is dynamic and thus eliminate the process of checking Air quality by pressing button. 
• 
This microcontroller will check Air quality in real time and show the data in display.  
• 
If required this device will send data automatically to remote device.

Abstract 
This study began as advanced image captioning system equipped with integrated audio descriptions, designed to 
improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals. Employing a combination of convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the system adeptly interprets visual content from agricultural images 
and generates corresponding textual captions. These captions are subsequently converted into natural-sounding audio, 
enriching user interaction with agricultural content. The system was thoroughly tested against standard datasets 
focused on agricultural scenes, where it demonstrated notable improvements in caption accuracy and audio description 
quality. This study not only pushes the boundaries of image captioning technology but also underscores its 
transformative potential in agricultural applications, thereby improving accessibility across the board. The paper 
details the system architecture and methodology, and provides a comparative analysis with existing technologies, 
emphasizing significant advancements in real-time image processing and accessibility.

1. Introduction
Image captioning stands as a crucial intersection between computer vision and artificial intelligence, where the 
primary goal is to generate descriptive text for an image. This task utilizes sophisticated deep learning techniques to 
decode visual content into textual descriptions, thus bridging a significant gap between the visual data perceived by 
ma- chines and the linguistic interpretations understandable by humans. The application of image captioning spans 
several domains including automated surveillance, facilitating tools for the visually impaired, and interactive media 
management, making it a field of substantial academic and practical interest. 
The enhancement of image captioning systems with audio descriptions marks a significant advancement in making 
digital content accessible. By converting text captions into spoken words, these systems provide a means for visually 
impaired and blind individuals to access visual information, thereby democratizing content consumption across 
varied user demographics. This integration extends beyond accessibility; it enriches user interaction with digital media, 
supporting a wide range of activities from educational learning to recreational browsing. The capacity to transform 
visual data into articulate and accurate audio output also facilitates better navigation in physical and digital spaces, 
thus serving both functional and entertainment purposes. In the broader context of multimedia applications, the role

6.  Conclusion 
This research has successfully developed and tested an Image Caption Generator, which integrates advanced deep 
learning techniques to create descriptive captions for images that are both accurate and contextually relevant. This 
section summarizes the key findings, highlights the contributions of this study to the field of image captioning, and

Abstract 
Heat dissipation is the prerequisite in most of the industries like steel manufacturing industry, food processing 
industry,etc  which involves the use of heat exchangers to thermally process materials, maintain ideal temperatures 
and can be used to heat or cool a variety of goods. The heat dissipation rate can be increased either by changing the 
design of the heat exchangers or  by changing the medium / composition of the heat transfer fluid (coolant).The present 
work focusses on performing structural analysis on inner tube of heat exchanger by using different materials(structural 
steel,copper and aluminium).Results from structural analysis will be used to perform comparative analysis between 
different materials which concludes copper as best suited material for inner tube of heat exchanger having thermal 
conductivity of 385W/m-K and deformation of 8.2e-07.The performance of concentric tube heat exchanger in parallel 
and counter flow arrangement is experimentally investigated and  optimized by utilizing heat transfer fluids like 
CuO/Water Nanofluids in place of conventional heat transfer fluids prepared in 0.2% ,0.4%,0.5%,0.8% and 1% 
volumetric concentrations. CFD simulations were used to verify the experimental results and heat exchanger’s 
temperature distributions. Also the overall heat transfer coefficient increases with increase in particle volume 
concentration of nanofluid  up to 0.8% and then decreases. The counter flow arrangement of heat exchanger provides 
optimum performance of heat exchanger with better heat transfer and effectiveness of 49.03% for  0.8% concentration 
of CuO-water nanofluid than parallel flow arrangement.

1.Introduction
Heat transmission from one fluid to another is the main purpose of a heat exchanger. The liquids may be in direct 
contact or separated from one another by a solid wall to prevent mixing. Concentric tube heat exchangers are viable 
option for the present work as  they are inexpensive to develop and maintain  with straight forward construction having 
two tubes, one of which conveys hot fluid and the other, cold fluid. Between them, heat exchanges. The cold fluid 
often acts as a coolant or heat transfer fluid to lower the temperature of the hot fluid. The most common heat transfer 
fluid used are water. The heat exchanger can be arranged to operate in Parallel flow and counter flow direction 
depending whether hot and cold fluid flows in same direction or in opposite directions.

6.Conclusions 
The deformation observed in steel is  6.35e-07 mm, copper is 10.58e-07 mm and aluminium 18.14e-07 mm with 
aluminium having maximum deformation and steel having minimum deformation  induced when compared with other 
materials.Copper has  highest thermal conductivity of 385 W/m-K  with minimum strain  and deformation value after 
steel ,thus it is best suited material to be considered for inner tube of H.E. for its better performance.  
 
The maximum effectiveness observed in Parallel flow Heat exchanger with nanofluid usage is found to be 42.5% for 
1% vol. concentration and in counter Counter  flow  Heat exchanger  is found to be 50% for 1% vol. concentration of 
nanofluid. Heat transfer is found to increase with increase in volume concentration up to 0.8% and then decreases for 
both Parallel and Counter flow Heat exchanger.The maximum  value of U that  is obtained at 0.8% volume 
concentration in parallel flow is 646 w/m2K and in counter flow is 653 W/m2K. 
 
Optimum performance of heat exchanger is thus obtained at 0.8% volume concentration of CuO nanofluid in Counter 
flow arrangement with an effectiveness of 49.03 % .Addition of CuO nanoparticles in right amount can thus improve 
the heat transfer coefficient, thermal conductivity as well as effectiveness of heat exchanger.Prandtl Number is found 
to decrease from a value of 5.55 for zero concentrated base fluid to a value of 0.028 due to  increase in nanofluid 
concentration indicating free flowing behavior of fluid with high thermal conductivity.

Abstract 
In an era where complex optimization problems are in abundance, nature continues to inspire solutions through 
metaheuristic algorithms. The intricate mechanisms perfected by millions of years of evolution offer unparalleled 
strategies for problem-solving that traditional methods often overlook. This review paper provides a comprehensive 
overview of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, categorizing them into primary groups: swarm intelligence, bio-
inspired, and physics & chemistry-inspired. In the quest for efficient optimization solutions, swarm intelligence 
algorithms, inspired by the collective behavior of social organisms, have emerged as a vital subfield within nature-
inspired metaheuristic algorithms. This paper categorizes swarm intelligence algorithms based on their biological 
inspirations—predatory, scavenging, herbivore, omnivore, mutualist, and hybrid—highlighting the operational 
characteristics and unique strengths of each. This classification clarifies the underlying principles of these algorithms 
and aids researchers and practitioners in selecting the right algorithm for specific optimization tasks. Despite their 
effectiveness in navigating complex, multi-modal landscapes, swarm intelligence algorithms face challenges such as 
early convergence and parameter sensitivity. Recent advancements have led to hybrid approaches and novel 
applications across diverse fields, emphasizing their adaptability and simplicity in implementation. By exploring 
future research directions, this paper aims to inspire innovative solutions for tackling optimization challenges in 
dynamic environments.

1. Introduction
1.1 Evolution of Optimization
Searching for optimal solutions to complex problems has always driven research in various fields for decades.  
Traditional methods, though effective in certain contexts, have faced high-dimensional, multi-modal problems  
(Yang 2008). Nature has turned out to be an inspiration, leading to the development of metaheuristic algorithms 
(Dorigo 1992). These nature-inspired algorithms mimic the behaviors and processes observed in natural systems, such 
as evolution and swarm behavior (Gandomi & Alavi 2012).   
The first noteworthy nature-inspired algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm, was introduced by John Holland in the 1970s, 
marking the beginning of a new stage in optimization (Yang 2010b). Since then, the field has expanded rapidly, 
incorporating a wide range of techniques inspired by biological, physical, and chemical processes (Passino 2002) 
(Figure 1, Figure 2).

Abstract 
The disclosure of Artificial Intelligence (AI), popularly referred to as AI, has created prominent challenges to various 
fields. It concentrated in the realms of education and offered remarkable opportunities for substantiated literacy acts 
through traditional methodologies. AI improves education quality by providing personalized learning experiences, 
offering immediate access to a wide range of study materials, and delivering targeted practice questions. Now, the real 
challenge is to equip educators about this practice, mainly to those in remote areas and underserved regions with the 
knowledge of using AI tools in classrooms. Numerous efforts have been made to introduce this system to those 
unfamiliar with the practice. The "" AI Education Frontier Turning preceptors in Remote Areas into Agents of Change,"" 
was a holistic approach that included boot- camps, AI empowered mentoring apps and further in its structure intending 
to reach over 700 members in 8 months duration. Through this paper, we aim to offer useful insights into how such 
programs can be scaled and sustained to promote digital literacy and new educational practices around the world. This 
paper also delves deep into how this educational action reforms the tutoring and literacy practices in the classroom. 
Along with this, we will explore its wide- ranging benefits and examine the issues along with the required training to 
be provided to the educators in diverse fields to introduce this new technology to the broader market. Clearly, working 
together helps us to conclude on the relinquishment and perpetration of a promising AI period in various sectors. We 
aim to provide statistical analysis on the data collected through our survey.

The study’s outputs exhibit the vital role of AI in the education sector, mostly in the lives of students and teachers. 
With the ongoing competition around the world, AI provides the users, students or teachers, with a simple way out. 
Despite its easy detection, most of the students are choosing Chat GPT as their primary tool of AI.  
Nevertheless, the AI incorporation into the educational system is a task fraught with difficulties. Problems such as 
academic dishonesty, technology over-dependence, and the correctness of AI-generated content bring about the risks 
that must be dealt with. Also, the ethical concerns regarding data privacy, consent, and the likely substitution of 
educational roles should be handled with care.  
  
AI will certainly be more involved in education as it goes through its development, thus opening up the prospects of 
bringing about innovation and improvement. Overcoming the obstacles and harnessing the unlimited capacity of the 
technology, the educational field is set to become a more vibrant, optimally functioning, and fair learning mode for 
everyone.  AI helps students and teachers in various forms, and it is important for teachers to be open about using AI 
with students. Having these open conversations with students and each other will encourage us all to be transparent. 
Faculty should explicitly state in the course syllabus or assessments that AI tools can be used and even encouraged to 
be utilized. It is equally important to have boundaries set so that students use it in an appropriate way.

Abstract 
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a global network of smart devices that integrate physical and digital worlds. While the 
IoT is reported to be a foundation technology for the emerging Industry 4.0 era, empirical evidence related to IoT use 
in supply chain management is scant. This study, therefore, investigates the opportunities and challenges of IoT use 
in the supply chains using grounded theory-based interviews with managers from the Australian retail industry. The 
thematic analysis using NVivo reveals that IoT deployment improves visibility of goods movement, data capture, 
partner communication, and business intelligence. However, retailers face challenges due to the lack of top 
management initiative, new technology acquisition cost, stakeholders' reluctance to accept change, unwillingness to 
share data, and inadequate interoperability between partner systems. The study offers a proof-of-concept of IoT 
benefits that strengthen the IoT-related investment decision, sheds light on adoption challenges, and develops 
propositions for future research.

Abstract 
Office space design and its importance is increasing with the average hours spent at work and as the nature of work is 
becoming more sedentary especially in knowledge sectors. Ergonomics is one of the key elements in the design of 
offices that have an immense direct effect on the health and wellbeing of employees. Our study is to understand this 
element of workstations set up at homes and offices that employees in India are using in the present scenario. We 
found that employees working from home faced health issues due to inappropriate setup at home and made changes 
to the same later and also to the working style by adding more movement during work. Employees working in office 
setup report that new elements such as sit/stand desks, bigger screens can aid them to be happier at work.  
1. Introduction
Historically, the nature of work in the services industry has seen a sea of change post world war especially with the 
continuous evolution of technology, but the desk based office design has not changed much. This landscape is made 
complex further post COVID-19 where employees were forced to work from home (WFH) and when organizations 
shifted to hybrid mode thereafter. The relation between office spaces and work shifted to working two-three days in 
offices and rest at home. WFH is here to stay since the next generation job seekers also value the option of working 
at the convenience of home (Beyond the Paycheck, Jobseekers Value ’work Flexibility’: Survey, 2023) (Mint). 
Employees also see WFH appropriate because of reduced commute hours, convenience of home (Davis et al., 2020). 
But it is also a passive concern that these spaces at home are not enabled and built to spend time working for long 
hours. As the number of hours employees have increased drastically, the need to equip employees better is an important 
challenge and concern for organisations. The well-being of employees is dependent on health which in a way is related 
to ergonomics especially in the knowledge sector with demanding work. WHO defines Health as , “a state of complete 
physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (Bickenbach, 2017). 
Ergonomics is a match between job type and the working setup which includes tools so that one is able to work 
efficiently (C. Edwards et al., 2024). The goal of a good ergonomic design is to avoid musculoskeletal, joint and other

Some of the key findings from their responses are listed below 
● 
Employee was happy to the space where “It is comfortable enough to sit and work and also to take a small 
walk at the entrance” 
● 
Employees were not happy about “Sitting all day long in the same place makes me bored and less productive”. 
 
Participants opted for these kind of updates to the existing office spaces  
● 
“Bigger monitor screens, possibility to have more than 1 monitor screen at the desk” 
● 
“Maybe desk height should be adjustable” 
● 
“Good ergonomic seating arrangement, open spaces to conduct small team meet ups , standing desks.” 
● 
 
5. Discussion 
Employees were happy when there was comfortable seating and flexible desks with the option to change height was 
provided in the existing office setup.  Employees also wanted upgrades in terms of the ICT equipment such as updated 
machines and multiple screens besides standing desks to be happy in office space with respect to Ergonomics. 
Employees WFH in India initially had no specific equipment at home and used dining table, sofa, chair confirming 
with the earlier findings (Davis et al., 2020; Du et al., 2022). As a consequence of prolonged sitting without much 
movement, they faced health issues such as back pain in many cases and in one particular case, an employee had a 
spine bulge.  
Employees had to change the setup at home to address these issues and they updated to an ergonomic chair, table and 
in a few cases included lumbar support, standing desks and big screens for ease of multi tasking as shown in Figures 
1-6. Workstation setup will have to change to more of sit/stand desks confirming earlier studies (Chandra et al., 2009). 
Employees in a few cases, also made some changes to their lifestyle after consultation with a doctor to move 
frequently, taking short breaks and stretching often to avoid health issues and promote wellbeing. This also shows that 
Employees have greater liberty at home to upgrade the furniture and equipment at home which may not be possible at 
the same ease when working in an office setup. 
 
6. Conclusion and limitations 
Employees in our study lived in urban setups and rented/ owned spaces such as 1BHK and 2BHK. Real Estate is a 
major constraint for people in urban places given them space and financial burden it can exert. We need to look at 
ergonomics from this constraint which is a major bottleneck to address. Designers and Furniture companies need to 
look at this limitation and make equipment which are mobile, less space demanding and flexible. Organisations should 
make the ergonomic elements a priority according to the job profile and number of hours spent in offices for wellbeing  
and for long term health and well-being of employees.  
 
Our study involves working with only IT and ITeS employees majorly. The objective was to present key trends in 
their perceptions and hence a qualitative approach was adapted. To arrive at the significance of different factors, 
requires larger sample sizes, specifically looking for particular elements. This can be done with vast sample sizes to 
generalize the results and can be potential topics of future research.

Abstract 
With the rapid advancement of digital media and easy access to sophisticated editing tools, image forgery has become 
a widespread issue. Image forgery involves manipulating images to deceive viewers or alter visual facts. Image 
forensics is the field dedicated to identifying such forgeries, and it can be classified into two primary techniques: 
active protection and passive detection. Active protection relies on methods like watermarking and digital signatures 
to verify authenticity. In contrast, passive detection, which does not require prior information about the image, 
focuses on identifying inconsistencies through analysis techniques. Two of the most common forms of image forgery 
are Image Splicing and Copy-Move Forgery. Image Splicing refers to combining parts of different images into a 
single image, while Copy-Move forgery involves copying a part of the image and pasting it into another section of 
the same image. Both techniques are commonly used to alter the meaning of an image or hide critical details. This 
project delves into the methods used to detect such forgeries. In this study, we focus on the application of machine 
learning and deep learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN), to detect forged images. The SVM classifier is used to analyze and classify image features that 
indicate forgery, while CNN models, known for their ability to process visual data, are trained to identify subtle

1. Introduction
Choosing a career has always been a challenge for everyone. This system has been developed to remove all the 
ambiguities. Our website is a real relief for users. Users first need to register on our website, then login using the same 
credentials and then select the grade after which they are looking for career guidance (for example, after 10th grade 
or after 12th grade). A contact form is also included in our system. In case of any difficulties or queries, students can 
contact us and clarify their doubts. You can contact us through the email address provided on the website. This 
application will make a great contribution when used effectively.  
Unemployment is one of the most serious social problems faced by both developing and developed countries. There 
are some web portals that provide an effective way to search the internet for online information about job vacancies 
for job seekers. Today, the Internet has changed many aspects of our lives, such as the way we search for jobs. If a 
person wants to find a new job, they can submit a resume using a word processing software such as Microsoft Office 
Word, open a web browser to send the resume, and receive an email. Online recruiting has become the standard 
method for employers and job seekers to achieve their respective goals. A portal is a tool that connects companies 
with job seekers. Companies provide the necessary resources, and job seekers find and apply for jobs that match their 
interests. The guide is a term sometimes used in a broad way to refer recommend or help an individual with any type 
of Educational, professional or personal problem. The professional guide consists of services that help people 
successfully manage their career development. Professional guide is a general term, which includes the development 
of work research, on interview skills, positioning in a chosen vocation and follows positioning to guarantee

Abstract 
Optimal levels of workplace and process parameters are crucial in boosting productivity and organizational 
performance in any industry. ""Optimal workplace and process parameters"" refers to the most effective mix of elements 
within a workplace that enhances productivity, work quality, employee satisfaction, and overall performance while 
minimizing resource wastage. This study aims to identify the ideal balance and alignment between workplace and 
process elements by investigating and determining the optimal workplace and process parameters for creating a 
conducive work environment in a small-scale tailoring unit. The study utilizes Taguchi's Orthogonal Array (OA) 
method by selecting 4 control factors at 3 levels, which include illuminance, type of needle, type of fabric, and type 
of sewing machine. The response variable chosen to assess the impact of these parameters was the daily average units 
of garments produced per week. An L9 orthogonal array was designed using statistical software, and the array was 
analyzed using signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equations based on Larger-the-better condition. The control factors and 
their levels corresponding to the highest S/N ratio value determine the small-scale tailoring unit's optimal workplace 
and process parameters. The obtained optimal control factors and their levels were workplace illuminance-755 lux, 
type of needle-sharp needle, type of fabric-polyester and type of sewing machine-flatlock sewing machine. This 
combination of factors will be the optimal parameter for maximizing the response variable chosen and these 
parameters define the overall performance of the tailoring unit.

1. Introduction
The performance of any industry is influenced by certain factors that determine the overall efficiency and effectiveness 
of its operations. Determination of the optimal level of workplace and process parameters helps industries to 
effectively manage and streamline their industrial operations so that the output of the industry gets maximized along 
with the reduction in wastage of resources, enhanced production of goods and services, improved quality of products 
and better employee comfort and well-being. The term optimal level of workplace and process parameters refers to 
the most effective and efficient sequence of workplace and process elements within an industry that helps to achieve

7. Conclusions 
The optimal level of workplace and process parameters of a small-scale tailoring unit were determined using Taguchi's 
orthogonal array method. The optimal factors were determined based on the higher values of the S/N ratios for each 
control factor level. The obtained results were validated and verified. The combination of factors with the highest S/N 
ratio will be the optimal parameter for maximizing the response variable in the small-scale tailoring unit. The most 
significant control factor that significantly influences the response variable is the one that has the lowest delta value 
and lowest ranking.  
The obtained optimal workplace and process parameters were compared with similar research works that were based 
on the determination of optimal parameters in a working environment. On comparing the results of this study with 
similar works discussed in the literature review, it can be concluded that the results were in accordance with the 
Taguchi methodology and the obtained S/N ratios had a major significance on the variability occurring in the 
operations of the particular industry under consideration, which determines the significance and influence of the 
determined control factors on the response variable under consideration. From the concepts obtained from the 
literature review, the significance of the factors was determined based on their delta values and ranking values. From 
the obtained response table for Signal-to-Noise ratios, the lowest delta value was 0.39 with a ranking of 4 and the 
highest delta value was 1.37 with a ranking of 1. The factor corresponding to the lowest delta was the type of needle 
used and it is considered as the most significant factor that influences the sewing operation. The Taguchi methodology 
can be implemented for comparing the significance of factors among various operations within the same industry or 
can be used to compare the factors of two different industries. Thus, Taguchi's orthogonal array method acts as an 
important tool for analyzing the parameters of an industry, so that an optimal workplace and process environment can 
be developed.

Abstract 
Musculoskeletal risks refer as the potential hazards or dangers that can lead to injuries, disorders, or discomfort that 
impact the human body. These risks directly impact on the well-being of employees, leading to discomfort, pain, and 
potentially debilitating injuries, thus compromising their quality of life. Musculoskeletal issues contribute to increased 
absenteeism, reduced productivity, and elevated healthcare costs for employers. Conducting a comprehensive analysis 
of musculoskeletal risks is essential for safeguarding employee health and enhancing operational efficiency. Data is 
collected through self-report Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaires (NMQ). The project will begin with an extensive 
literature review to understand the common MSDs prevalent in manufacturing settings, particularly in tyre production. 
Ergonomic risk assessment tools such as the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), Finnish institute of occupational 
health (FIOH) and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire will be employed to evaluate the ergonomic hazards 
associated with various tasks in the tire manufacturing process. Field observations and interviews with workers were 
conducted to gather qualitative data on their ergonomic experiences, work practices, and perceived risk factors. 
Additionally, quantitative data such as injury records and productivity metrics will be analyzed to identify patterns 
and correlations with ergonomic risk factors. By addressing musculoskeletal risks proactively, this paper aims to 
contribute to the creation of a safer and healthier work environment for employees in the tire manufacturing industry, 
ultimately enhancing productivity, and reducing the economic burden associated with work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders.

1. Introduction
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) pose significant occupational health challenges in various industries, including tire 
manufacturing, where workers are exposed to repetitive tasks, prolonged standing, and awkward postures. As a result, 
there is a pressing need to conduct comprehensive risk analyses to identify and mitigate ergonomic hazards in such 
environments. This study focuses on utilizing two prominent tools, the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) (Joshi 
et al. 2020) and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), to assess musculoskeletal risks in a tyre

Bending, twisting, and turning, working with arms above shoulder level, moving large weights, pushing or dragging 
a trolley, maintaining extended postures, and performing repetitive motions with brief cycle periods are all part of 
the process of manufacturing automobile tires, whether they are light or heavy. There is a recognized low to high 
risk of acquiring WRMSDs with all of these.  
• 
Overall risk carried by the worker assessed is medium risk with a risk scale of 7 
• 
And by PCR worker is medium risk with 5 in risk scale 
54 workers experiencing multiple joint problems, the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) over the past 
12 months were identified as occurring in the lower back, cervical (neck), shoulder, and ankles/feet regions, with 
descending frequency. Similarly, within the past 7 days, the highest prevalence persisted in the lower back, ankles/feet, 
knees, and shoulder. Similar results can be seen in Sareh, et al. (2015). These findings underscore the persistent nature 
of MSDs among these workers, particularly in areas prone to strain from occupational activities. The overall risk 
assessment using a risk scale of 7 indicated a medium level of risk, further confirmed by a PCR (Posture, Condition, 
Repetition) risk scale of 5, suggesting significant hazards and potential health implications associated with their work 
tasks and environments as in Ansari, et al. (2014). 
 
Lower back pain is the most prevalent because most of the work includes lifting heavy weight and carrying them or 
shifting them to another place. Addressing these risks requires comprehensive strategies encompassing ergonomic 
assessments, workplace modifications, training initiatives, and proactive management of occupational stressors to 
promote worker health, safety, and well-being. Introduction of cranes and trolleys can greatly reduce stress on workers. 
 
5. Conclusions 
It is seen that out of 60 workers working in the tyre manufacturing industry 54 workers are suffering from joint pains. 
With lower back pain (LBP) emerging as the predominant complaint, it's evident that workers are facing significant 
ergonomic challenges that contribute to discomfort and potential injury. The REBA analysis places TBR 
manufacturing workers at the upper end of the medium risk category, indicating a pressing need for intervention to 
mitigate ergonomic hazards. However, it's somewhat reassuring that PCR manufacturing workers are at the lower end 
of medium risk, suggesting variability in risk levels across different tasks or departments. The correlation between 
joint problems, BMI, and age underscores the multifactorial nature of musculoskeletal health, highlighting the 
importance of holistic approaches to ergonomics and wellness initiatives. Despite a positive workplace atmosphere 
and culture, the prevalence of ergonomic-related issues indicates areas for improvement. Therefore, it's imperative for 
management to prioritize ergonomic interventions, such as workstation modifications, training programs, and regular 
ergonomic assessments, to promote a safer and healthier work environment for all employees. By addressing these

ergonomic challenges proactively, the company can enhance worker well-being, productivity, and overall 
organizational success.

Abstract 
The working postures of material handling operators in milk production industry contibute to the musculoskeletal 
disorders (MSDs) particularly in lower back region of their body. The original posture used in this task resulted in 
excessive compression (4250 N) and shear forces (5650 N) on the lower back, far exceeding NIOSH (National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health) recommended limits, indicating a high risk of injury. In response, workers were 
analyzed using simulation tools, which identified the most stressful operations. A new working posture was 
introduced, adjusting the work height during packet loading, which significantly reduced the compression force to 
1890 N and the shear force to 720N, both well below NIOSH's safe limits. This ergonomic intervention not only 
lowered the physical strain on workers but also demonstrated the potential to create a safer working environment by 
minimizing the risk of lower back injuries. The study highlights the critical role of ergonomic adjustments in manual 
labor to protect workers from MSDs, improve workplace safety, and potentially enhance productivity. Future research 
could further explore the long-term benefits of these changes and their application to other industries with similar 
ergonomic challenges.

1. Introduction
Manual materials handling (MMH) retains a major role in the logistics sector and also in provide the goods and service 
in industrial perspective .The work often includes strenuous tasks causing a high physical impact on the workers a 
result of the physical impact on the workers is overexertion leading to a high rate of sickness absence and work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Neck/shoulder pain is considered a WMSD caused by biomechanical factors, 
such as heavy workload, awkward postures, and repetitive arm movement , as well as individual and psychosocial 
factors Still, the biomechanical load of the neck/shoulder during MMH is considered the largest contributor to 
development of WMSD in the shoulder girdle. Wearable assistive systems like occupational exoskeletons are seen as 
an attractive solution to the problems caused by the biomechanical loads imposed on the worker during MMH. 
Exoskeletons result in reduced muscle activity and discomfort during work tasks within mechanics, manufacturing, 
and construction work (Jacobsen et al. 2023). 
There is strong evidence that the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) among employees can be significantly 
impacted by psychosocial hazards at work. The physical risks resulting from the biomechanical demands of 
performing work tasks, however, continue to be the focus of current regulatory guidance, workplace management

5.Validation 
To validate the recommendations, reducing the weight of objects or altering lifting techniques is essential. Both 
adjustments are shown to reduce the forces acting on the spine, improving safety. Moreover, improving workers’ 
posture, using lifting aids, and adjusting the height and position of loads are critical strategies supported by ergonomics 
research. The task redesign, supported by NIOSH’s guidelines and validated by further simulations, would 
significantly lower ergonomic risks. In essence, the simulation results clearly indicate a need for intervention to reduce 
lower back strain and prevent injury among workers in this industry. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Ergonomic design is crucial not only for injury prevention but also for improving worker productivity, morale, and 
overall well-being. By optimizing workstations and tasks to meet workers' needs, employers can reduce absenteeism, 
lower turnover rates, and increase job satisfaction. Regular assessments and updates to ergonomic interventions ensure 
their continued effectiveness. Looking forward, the potential for advancements in ergonomic design and technology 
is vast. Future research may focus on developing industry-specific ergonomic solutions and exploring the long-term 
effects of interventions on worker health and productivity. These insights could help improve ergonomic practices 
across various sectors.The JACK simulation results emphasize the importance of ergonomic design in reducing 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Implementing interventions, such as adjusting work height or using lifting aids, 
can significantly lower the risk of injury, especially in physically demanding tasks like those in the milk production 
industry. Ergonomics goes beyond preventing injuries, it's about fostering a work environment that promotes health, 
safety, and productivity. Employers should prioritize ergonomic design to create safer workplaces and enhance the 
well-being of their employees, ultimately leading to a more efficient and satisfied workforce.

Abstract 
This paper aims at analyzing the potential risk factors of heart disease as well as the potential prediction models based 
on the records of 303 patients and 14 attributes. The effect to study, data cleaning, encoding, and feature selection 
processes are performed before starting the research work. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used in order to get 
basic insights on the distribution of the features and the kind of relationships between them that exist if any. Ten 
algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-NN, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Ada 
Boost, Gradient Boosting, Naïve Bayes, LDA, QDA and Neural Networks are applied and their prediction measures 
like accuracy, Area Under Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic, recall, precision and F1 measure are compared. 
Fine-tuning of models is done on various models chosen with the view of increasing their performance. Thus, other 
enhanced classifiers, such as CatBoost, XGBoost, as well as LightGBM, are also considered. Permutation importance 
and SHAP value are used to determine the significant factors that contribute to the risk level. The intensive data 
analysis is to create reliable prognoses and a broad understanding of the risk factors that lead to heart diseases, thus 
contributing to enhanced diagnosis and prevention.

D. Outputs 
The model's outputs were the prediction of the presence or absence of heart disease according to the input features. In 
each test instance, the model returned a probability score that was threshold to classify the condition. Further, the 
output from the light gradient boosting machine model had the highest precision, capturing the positive cases of heart 
disease and showing the fewest number of false positives. 
 
E. Comparative Analysis 
A Comparative analysis for different models, including Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and CatBoost, has been used 
to estimate their relative performance. Among the base models taken into consideration, LGBM performed the best 
according to both recall and accuracy metrics. Its performance is improved by hyperparameter tuning; thus, its strength 
over base models is established. Comparative analysis showed that LGBM is very good at complex patterns in the 
dataset. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The entire project objective was met by finding out which model would best predict heart disease. In this case, the 
LightGBM classifier became the best performer, huge in recall improvement and accuracy with overall huge hyper 
parameter extensive tuning. Major vessels, chest pain type, and ST slope were the key features of model predictions. 
This project underlines the major role feature selection and model optimization have in prediction.

Abstract 
With rising concerns over climate change and fuel costs, electric vehicles (EVs) have garnered significant interest for 
personal transportation due to their clean and eco-friendly advantages. However, EVs face a key limitation: restricted 
driving range, which can’t be easily expanded by simply increasing battery size, as this adds weight and reduces 
efficiency. Addressing this challenge, this project explores the critical role of Extreme Fast Charging (XFC) in 
enhancing EV reliability and proposes a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC Converter (IBDC) 
tailored for high-power charging applications. Despite existing state-of-the-art fast-charging solutions, a gap remains 
in delivering efficient and stable power conversion for XFC in EVs. The primary objective is to develop a converter 
that maximizes charging efficiency and power stability through three distinct phase shift strategies—single phase 
shift, extended phase shift, and dual phase shift. Using these configurations, the DAB IBDC design ensures 
bidirectional power flow and galvanic isolation, meeting XFC requirements. Key findings from detailed simulations 
demonstrate that each phase shift approach optimizes converter efficiency, power quality, and stability differently, 
with the proposed method showing improvements in overall performance. These findings have significant 
implications for reducing EV range limitations and enhancing the viability of EVs as a reliable alternative to traditional 
vehicles.

1.Introduction
To achieve voltage matching and galvanic isolation Power conversion systems (PCSs) mainly employ line- frequency 
(LF) transformers (Song and  Huang, 2005, Bendre et al. 2003, Gu et al. 2013, Li et al. 2003, De et al, 1991, Krismer 
and Kolar 2006). The growing acceptance of PCSs as a permanent essential interface, along with the quick 
advancement of distributed generation and energy storage, has led (Schibli 1999, Zhou and Khambadkone 2009, Bai 
and Mi, 2008, Myoungho Kim ,Rosekeit 2011, Wang 2009, Feng , 2011).  
Our Objective is to design a simulation model for the Dual Active Bridge Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC Converter 
(DAB IBDC) to investigate and analyze the impact of different phase shift configurations on charging efficiency. The 
goal is to identify the optimal phase shift strategy that maximizes power transfer while minimizing losses during 
extreme fast charging scenarios. Through a comparison of extended, single, and dual phase shift configurations, the 
study aims to understand their respective advantages and limitations, ultimately determining how each configuration 
affects converter performance, efficiency, and overall system dynamics.

4. Conclusion 
In the recent years due to growing concerns about the climate change and increase in fuel prices, EVs are gaining 
more attention, especially in the segment of personal mobility. Despite of its clean nature there are many limitations. 
The biggest limitation of an electric vehicle is its limited range. To increase the range of the vehicle, we can’t increase 
the battery size because that will increase the weight of vehicle and reduces overall efficiency. Fast charging will 
eliminate the range anxiety make it a reliable alternative of ICE vehicles. This project focuses on the design and 
analysis of a Dual Active Bridge Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC Converter (DAB IBDC) for Extreme Fast Charging 
(XFC) applications in Electric Vehicles (EVs). This involves three distinct phase shift configurations-single phase 
shift, extended phase shift, and dual phase shift to optimize the charging process and enhance the performance of high-
power EV charging systems. The DAB IBDC architecture, known for its bidirectional power flow capabilities and 
galvanic isolation features, is strategically employed to meet the demanding requirements of Extreme Fast Charging. 
Through simulation, each phase shift configuration is systematically evaluated for its impact on converter efficiency, 
power quality, and overall system stability. Proposed model provides better solution for fast charging of EV than state 
of art techniques.

Abstract 
Drunk driving and driving while intoxicated are the main causes of accidents in the modern world. Only drunk driving 
is a blame for the majority of preventable deaths in t h e worldwide. The goal of this initiative is to shield the public 
from needless fatalities brought on by drunk driving related traffic accidents. We have created an automated engine 
locking mechanism for this project that uses alcohol breath as its input. The alcohol sensor MQ3, DC motor, and 
Arduino UNO are used in the project. The purpose of alcohol detection in the vehicle is to protect those who are 
seated inside. The alcohol content is detected using the alcohol sensor MQ3, and the detected signal is transformed 
into a digital signal that is directly managed by the micro-controller unit (MCU). The digital signal indicates that the 
vehicle is automatically controlled and cannot be driven by a driver who has consumed alcohol. This prevents drunk 
driving incidents.

Abstract 
The ability to store electricity is critical for modern applications, and batteries are necessary for this purpose. 
Batteries tend to heat up significantly when kept in isolation or a small, enclosed environment, such as a power 
plant or an electric vehicle, which reduces the battery's lifetime and efficiency. Two things have the most influence 
on the battery's temperature. The battery's charging and discharging processes are what cause the heat to build up 
inside the battery. The battery generates heat as it is being charged and discharged, and heat is managed by a liquid 
cooling system with a water pump. The battery system's motor, which was previously used to pump liquid externally 
around the battery layer, now pumps the fluid. The ideal operating temperature of the battery is from 25 to 30 °C. 
The effectiveness of a battery thermal management system that controls the battery temperature will be greatly 
increased. Increase battery life and charge holding capacity while reducing power consumption. Using a MATLAB 
Simulink model, the battery thermal management system utilised in this project is validated, and efficient hardware 
for the battery cooling system is constructed.

Abstract 
Despite strict regulations, refusal of helmet usage and driving under alcohol influence remains a significant 
concern globally. Addressing this issue, we present the ""Accident Detection, smart and Drive Protection System 
using Smart Helmet."" This innovative solution integrates smart technology into both the helmet and the vehicle. 
The helmet unit ensures the rider wears a helmet and remains sober during the entire ride. It reaches out to the 
vehicle unit, which, if the specified conditions are not met, disengages the bike's ignition system. Furthermore, 
the system detects accidents and relays precise coordinates via Short Message Service, enabling swift response. 
Utilizing GPS tracking, the injured rider's location is easily traceable. Additionally, the system offers theft 
protection, requiring the helmet for bike activation. This comprehensive approach promotes adherence to 
safetyregulations and demonstrates a significant leap toward ensuring road safety and compliance with legal 
mandate.

Abstract 
GST as a tax was introduced as a panacea for indirect taxation and a base platform for direct taxation in India by 
negotiating the federal structure of the constitution of India through a historic amendment. It came into force from 
1st July 2017. Now that the seven-year itch is over, it’s time to talk straight by analyzing the basics. The two 
mainstay stakeholders are taxpayers and the tax administrators who are linked to each other through a 3T-way mode 
of Trust, Transparency and Technology. All three are related to one another on different levels. Taxpayer believes 
that the 3 Rs viz., Registration, Refunds and Regulations are the stumbling blocks for the EASE OF DOING 
BUSINESS (EODB) while the tax administrator on the contra believes that the EASE OF DOING WORK (EODW) 
is hampered by 3 Vs viz., Volumes, Values and Virtuality leading to difficulties in tax evasion in 3 Is, viz., 
Identification, Improvisation and Innovation. Thus, the core ideology of both the Western World with its arms of 
Bretton Woods and the Indian Government lies in building a model of TRANSPARENCY IN ADMINISTRATION 
TO BUILD UP TRUST AMONGST THE TAX PAYERS THROUGH AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT 
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THROUGH SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF EODB & EODW. This can be done 
by way of timeline management, law building with no chance of discretion, minimum tax rates/exemptions, absence 
of physical interaction (only virtual if mandated), return less taxation regime, intervention through credible 
information and mostly through inspection and visit modes, decriminalization of tax evasion. Thus, the model to be 
developed should engulf the PESTEL DNC strategic management tool covering the entire gamut of accountability 
from the tax payer and responsibility from the tax administrator so that the tax base is widened, tax collections are 
improved, tax rates and slabs are reduced. Having cited the research perspective, the researchers would comprehend 
to propose to conduct a pilot study to understand the relationship in three dimensions citing ""3T"" model—Trust, 
Transparency, and Technology on the relationship between taxpayers and tax administrators.

Introduction
Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a taxation was introduced as a consumption based tax subsuming 28 
other taxes basing on the concept of supply overriding the existing production and sales concept 
assuming as a panacea for indirect taxation. Since direct taxation is based on the turnover of an entity, 
GST was envisaged as a base platform for direct taxation in India. To delve further into the historical 
perspective of taxation in India, the indirect tax structure was main barrier to the development of

Suggestion 
It is mandatory to understand that this study will serve as a precursor to a nationwide debate by the 
chambers of Commerce and recognized Service associations and respective state and central legislatures 
to chalk out the necessary amendment in the act/ rules and regulations so as to make the equilibrium 
happen. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The sounds made by the lubricating gel indicates the smoothness or ruggedness of transparency. Just as 
see-saw requires regular maintenance to be stable, and moving, the analogous parts should be maintained. 
Just as there are limitations on the height and attainable angle in the see-saw, the transparency scale of 
level playing field is also achievable. Government is very much inclined in building a model of 
TRANSPARENCY IN ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD UP TRUST AMONGST THE TAX PAYERS 
THROUGH AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THROUGH 
SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF EODB & EODW. Finally, it can be said as a see-saw needs equal 
support on both sides and feet grounded for equilibrium, the tax administrator and tax payer, both should 
keep their feet grounded for holistic nation’s building and growth by integration of the PESTEL DNC 
Strategies.

Abstract 
The objective of this study is to increase productivity and availability to improve profitability and competitiveness in 
the metal-mechanic sector. The case study is based on the implementation of TPM and SMED in an aluminum bolt 
production process in a Peruvian SME of the metal-mechanic sector where the current productivity is 9.23 units/man-
hour. SMED transforms internal activities by external ones in order to reduce the production cycle time. TPM 
autonomous/preventive makes it possible to apply a constant scheduled maintenance that improves and facilitates the 
activities performed by the machine in order to reduce operator effort and increase OEE. The implementation was 
validated through a pilot test that lasted 4 months where the results obtained were: 38.40% improvement in OEE, 
cycle time reduction from 6.51 minutes to 4.52 minutes, 16.93% increase in availability, MTBF increase from 12.5 to 
22.43 hours/failure, MTTR reduction from 6.4 to 4.57 hours/failure, 30% performance improvement and productivity 
increase to 13.28 units/man-hour.

1. Introduction
Currently, in the year, the manufacturing industry in Peru contributes 12.5% of the national GDP reaching a figure of 
S/. 6243 million soles (Ministerio de la producción 2024). Within the manufacturing industry is the metal-mechanic 
sector which, from the year 2019 to the year 2023, the number of companies has increased from 63439 to 72711 
companies being mostly SME which are equivalent to 99.5%. (Oficina General de Evaluación de Impacto y Estudios 
Económicos 2024) The present work takes as a case study an SME of the metal-mechanic sector that presents a 
productivity of 9.2 units/man-hour, being lower than 16.6 units/man-hour, presenting a variation of 44.58%, which is 
the productivity of another representative SME of the same sector (Cairo et al. 2023). One way to improve productivity 
is by applying SMED, as in the case of the increase of this indicator from 0.38 to 1.16 6 units/man-hour in the cutting 
area of a textile industry (Alanya et al. 2024). SMED is also applicable in other sectors such as metalworking, where 
productivity increased by 19% (Jara et al. 2023). On the other hand, TPM helps to increase productivity as in the case 
of a shoe manufacturing company which increased from 12.57 to 18.83 pairs of shoes/Man-Hours (Mendoza et al. 
2023). TPM, besides contributing to improve the efficiency of equipment and machines, helped to improve 
productivity from 2.39 to 2.50 soles sold/soles invested, a variation of 4.6% (Vasquez et al. 2023). After a follow-up 
of 4 months in the case study and after the application of SMED and TPM tools, the productivity percentage increased 
by 30.5%. This scientific article has an introduction, state of the art, results, discussions and conclusions.

Figure 5. Boxplot Productivity 
The comparison between productivity averages before and after the improvement is remarkable, so it was 
statistically proven that productivity improved. 
Figure 6. Boxplot Availability 
Similarly, the averages of availability were compared where it was found that there was an increase in this indicator. 
6. Conclusion
The application of the SMED tool reduced the number of activities from 20 to 17, reducing production time by 
30.57% from 6.51 minutes to 4.52 minutes. 
The implementation of an autonomous/preventive maintenance plan increased availability from 66.14% to 83.07%. 
The average daily maintenance time was reduced from 3 hours to 2.5 hours. This result had an OEE impact that 
went from 30.33% to 68.3%. 
Autonomous/preventive maintenance increased MTBF from 12.5 hours/failure to 22.43 hours/failure as the number 
of shutdowns recorded after the upgrade decreased from 10 to 7. 
The use of SMED resulted in increased productivity from 9.23 units/man-hour to 13.28 units/man-hour. Also, 
autonomous/preventive TPM was applied, which increased the yield from 53.33% to 83.33% and was maintained 
for 4 weeks.

Abstract 
This initiative aims to reach the goal of energy usage and reshape the grid stability with the help of peak shaving, 
sharing the load, and an ANN-based forecasting method. The module comprises a solar photovoltaic (PV) array 
coupled to a LANDSMAN converter with the control via RBFNN MPPT controller. Although a unidirectional 
converter is preferred for active power, a bidirectional battery is installed and equipped with a LANDSMAN converter 
so that a three- phase inverter can be connected to the grid. Demand side management is made possible by introducing 
the ANN technique for predicting the maximum demand that will shift the appliances to off condition when the amount 
of demand becomes higher than the capacity of the grid. With the help of a PWM rectifier, the AC-DC conversion of 
the WECS with DFIG is done and a rectifier control is accomplished through a PI controller. Similarly, consumers 
might cut down their electricity bills by changing the time of electricity consumption and the amount of energy used, 
which allows them to save on some costs. The energy system is noticeably changing before the consumption of energy 
reduces from high to low hours peak improving global efficiency. Load sharing and demand regulation systems ensure 
logical energy utilization, and therefore, these elements maintain the stability of the grid. Furthermore, the demand-
side system strengthens consumers' awareness and walks the talk by providing immediate data and tariffs for shifting 
the load. The project brings consumers into the management of energy on an active basis by creating an environment 
in which people highly consider energy conservation. Lastly, the project will be carried out and outcomes will be 
delivered in MATLAB 2021a /Simulink software.

Introduction
In conventional electrical distribution power networks, there are power generation centers, and distribution generation 
substations that reciprocate each other and between them, they support all the loads needed, and they are upgraded in 
the future whenever there is a necessity to cover for further rising demands. It is true that MG, which operates side 
by side with the main network, helps to ensure the stability of the power and can damage the entire system when 
equalized (Benbouzid et al. 2021). But this linking of microgrids with the main system may cause a disturbance within 
the total system, especially Its basic parameters: voltage, and frequency. The power supply from the local 
microgrinnight fail for different reasons such as not enough supply to meet the highest possible load demand. 
Therefore, the system is not stable, and it might go under malfunction. For this, malfunctioning must be detected early 
to disconnect it directly. Furthermore, maintaining the DG Isolated ensures the safety of the workers and the 
equipment as sometimes the maintenance team may be exposed to electric hazards while fixing the fault line  (Sarasúa

 5. Conclusion 
This project promotes the concept of demand side management and the combination of three different components, 
namely solar PV, bi-directional battery, and Pi-based grid section, provides a great deal of benefits. Consumers can 
save on their power expenses in multiple ways beginning with optimized adjustments in the timing and amount of 
usage, in addition, energy supply by electricity is emerging more efficiently making electricity consumption 
optimized. Although. Operation of each device requires the use of a PI controller: the integration of solar PV 
commended with a bidirectional battery results in improved system efficiency and reliability. The demand (D) section 
which is based on the PI grid element is the main factor in demand side management. 
 
The Pi will forecast the total demand and in case of significant load to standby mode help to promote the balance 
between energy demand and energy supply. This leads to Improved energy management and optimized utilization of 
electricity resources.

Abstract  
Ergonomics aims to make sure that tasks, equipment and the environment suit each of the worker and seeks to 
minimize the adverse effects of the work-place and environment upon the people, enabling every worker to maximize 
their contribution to a given job or task.  These issues are significant for many developing countries, since the effects 
of non-ergonomic conditions, poor occupational health and lack of employee safety exists in majority of workplaces 
especially in small scale sector. Occupational health and safety issues in the food industry is not perceived as serious 
issue compared to engineering, mining, transportation, healthcare, construction and other industries. The present study 
is conducted at a sweetmeat industry manufacturing    sohan-papdi, chikki and other local food products, located in 
Kalaburagi City.  The main objective of the study was to identify the ergonomic deficiencies in the industry such as 
workplace and work station design, work environment and conditions, work postures and associated risks, and 
occupational health, safety and welfare activities. The industry employs about 35 workers including 13 females. The 
worker demographic data was collected and Nordic Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to determine 
the prevalence of MSDs. The Postural assessment tools RULA and REBA were used. The overall safety, health and 
welfare activities were recorded. The results indicate that workers report MSD problems in several body parts like 
lower back, neck, shoulders and elbows. The postural analysis showed more than 50 % postures are in high-risk 
category. The use of personnel protective equipment is negligible. The study concluded with certain ergonomic 
interventions and recommendations to the industry for overall improvements.

Abstract 
Comprehending the in-plane biaxial behaviour of composite materials is essential for its utilisation in aeronautical, 
automotive, and civil engineering structures, where materials frequently encounter intricate stress states. This study 
examines the biaxial behaviour of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminate cruciform specimens with fibre 
orientations of [±10°], [±20°], [±30°], [±70°], and [±90°]. The samples were fabricated using compression moulding 
and evaluated on a customised biaxial testing apparatus, with strain quantified using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) 
and strain gauges. At a constant biaxial stress ratio of 1:1, notable strain behaviours were recorded, encompassing 
brittle-type strain increments and strain-relieving processes. The [±10°] sample exhibited a pronounced rise in 
longitudinal strain (εx) and nonlinear variations in transverse strain (εy), whereas the [±20°] sample demonstrated no 
shear strain in the brittle zone. The [±30°] sample demonstrated an 18.22% reduction in transverse strain inside the 
strain-relieving zone, succeeded by a 12% increase prior to failure. Samples exhibiting [±70°] and [±90°] fibre 
orientations demonstrated analogous strain patterns, with longitudinal strain shifting from compression to tension 
before to failure. Failure modes in all samples included matrix cracking and fibre pull-out, originating in the central 
gauge section. The DIC results validated strain gauge measurements and finite element analysis (FEA) predictions, 
demonstrating uniform stress distribution and zones that alleviate strain. The findings offer significant insights into 
the behaviour of GFRP composites under biaxial loading, highlighting the influence of fibre orientation on stress and 
strain distribution, and facilitating the design of more robust composite materials for advanced technical applications.

considerable instability, frequently decreasing abruptly as the material neared collapse. The shear strain (γxy) was 
insignificant in these brittle regions, affirming the existence of a pure in-plane stress state. 
 
The brittle behaviour is mostly determined by the material characteristics and geometric aspects of the laminate. 
Low-angle fibre orientations offer minimal reinforcement in the transverse direction, rendering the material 
susceptible to sudden failure under biaxial loading. Moreover, micro-cracks at the fiber-matrix contact serve as 
stress concentrators, intensifying the failure process. These fissures originate in the less robust matrix areas and 
swiftly advance, resulting in matrix fracturing and subsequent fibre extraction. These failures underscore the 
constraints of low-angle fibre orientations in scenarios where multi-directional strength is essential. To mitigate 
these deficiencies, the matrix toughness may be augmented, and fiber-matrix adhesion could be strengthened to 
postpone fracture onset and propagation. 
 
Laminates with elevated fibre orientations, such as [±30°], [±70°], and [±90°], exhibited strain-relieving effects. 
This behaviour demonstrates the material's capacity to dynamically disperse stress inside the laminate, therefore 
postponing catastrophic breakdown and improving durability. The transverse strain (εy) in these laminates 
frequently demonstrated nonlinear decreases or stabilisation within the strain-relieving zones, signifying successful 
stress redistribution. Likewise, the longitudinal strain (εx) exhibited steady reductions or plateaus throughout this 
phase, indicating the reallocation of load-bearing forces from critical failure zones. The shear strain (γxy) shifted 
from positive to negative values, demonstrating the dynamic changes in stress states as the material responded to the 
imposed force. 
 
The mechanisms underlying strain-relieving occurrences are intricate and diverse. Interfacial interactions between 
the fibres and matrix are essential, facilitating the transmission of loads from less robust matrix areas to more 
resilient fibre regions. This redistribution establishes localised stress relief zones that serve as buffers to avert abrupt 
failure. Increased fibre orientations further enhance this behaviour by offering reinforcement in many directions, 
hence improving the laminate's ability to withstand complicated loading circumstances. Moreover, matrix cracks 
absorb localised stressors and reroute them, thereby further postponing the advancement of damage. The interaction 
of these elements allows the material to endure greater loads for extended periods relative to its brittle equivalents. 
 
This work highlights the brittle strain behaviour and strain-relieving mechanisms of GFRP laminates under biaxial 
stress, demonstrating their differential reactions. Brittle behaviour, linked to reduced fibre orientations, leads to 
localised stress and sudden failure, compromising the material's durability under intricate loading conditions. In 
contrast, strain-relieving events, which are more pronounced in higher fibre orientations, effectively distribute stress, 
resulting in enhanced resistance and postponed failure. These distinctions underscore the significance of fibre 
orientation in composite construction, since it directly affects the laminate's mechanical performance and longevity. 
 
This study's findings offer essential insights for the design and utilisation of GFRP laminates. In applications where 
strength and resilience in numerous directions are critical, such as in the aerospace or automotive industries, 
prioritisation of higher fibre orientations is essential. These arrangements facilitate the activation of strain-relieving 
mechanisms, enhancing durability and load-bearing capability. Laminates with reduced fibre orientations may be 
appropriate for applications prioritising longitudinal strength, contingent upon the optimisation of matrix toughness 
and fiber-matrix adhesion to alleviate brittleness.

Abstract 
This study presents a comprehensive Triboinformaticmodelling approach to predict wear and erosion behavior of 
Additively Manufactured (AM) AlSi10Mg alloy using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) technology. The 
investigation encompasses three distinct build orientations: horizontal, vertical, and inclined, which were analysed 
using Machine Learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Artificial Neural Networks 
(ANN). A dataset with a wide variety of microstructures and mechanical characteristics was produced by 
methodically varying the LPBF AM process settings. The AM AlSi10Mg specimens underwent surface modification 
before experimental wear and Heat-Treatment before erosion testing for each construction orientation. Predictive 
models were trained and validated using the resultant wear and erosion data, microstructural characteristics, and 
process parameters. K-NN was used because it is straightforward and simple to use, whereas ANN was used because 
it can capture complicated non-linear interactions. With amazing prediction accuracy, the models were able to 
identify wear and erosion patterns in various construction orientations. The ANN model offered improved accuracy 
for complex situations, whereas the K-NN model showed strong prediction skills with quick inference times. The 
potential of machine learning approaches in forecasting wear and erosion behaviour of AM AlSi10Mg alloy across

Abstract 
One of the most workable techniques used in wind turbine blades designs is the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) 
theory. In this work, BEM technique is used to assess the power and certification of small horizontal axis wind 
turbines (HAWTs) with 3m blade length and 2 kW power rating. The primary goal to accomplish in the present 
work is to evaluate the performance of the BEM method in predicting the aerodynamic behavior of small scale 
turbines through comparison with the experimental measurements. Interest attention is paid to the dependent factors 
which include lift and drag forces, blade pitch angles, tip speed ratio, and power coefficient. Analysis and modeling 
of the blade geometry and necessary operation parameters are modeled to improve efficiency using relevant real life 
software. The findings indicate how the BEM method performs in modeling the aerodynamics of staking axis and 
tiny turbines and where improvements to blade design in low wind speed zone is feasible. This work also makes a 
contribution to finding solutions for efficient and affordable small wind turbines to help foster the use of renewable 
energy solutions in distributed power generation systems.

1. Introduction
Wind energy generation is very much promoted by many countries as one of the key renewable sources. To harness 
wind power technology, the use of the wind turbine is most efficient and has the highest power capacity as compared 
to other devices. This paper focuses on the comparison of types of wind turbines: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine 
(HAWT) which is commonly used. It also indicated however, due to increased land use densities, the amount of 
space that large turbines occupy is even more of a limitation need for small horizontal wind turbines (SHWT) in 
urban areas (Dehouck et al, 2018). It can be utilized to produce power for own use only, and since it does not require

7. Conclusion and Future Research Directions
In this work, different analysis have been done using BEM for designed and non-optimized wind turbines with 3m 
blade diameter horizontal dimensions for the roof mounting purpose. It is cumbersome to simulate using Aeroelastic 
BEM method since many numerical assessments are required at each operation point.  The study revealed that the 
maximum value of CL/CD can be achieved at a certain angle of attack of 2 degrees. Likewise, the investigation 
concluded that maximum performance of the rotor takes place when the tip speed ratio is 8. In general it is observed 
that the results which is obtained by the QBlade has a high degree of resolution; apart from that it is seen that the 
interfaces of this program is user friendly. Therefore, it can be rightfully noted that, in terms of designing and 
optimizing the blades and rotors for quite a number of the wind turbines, the QBlade software is among the most 
valuable. 
As presented in this work the results are very encouraging especially for placing SAM in crowded fields primarily 
due to the smaller swept area of the turbine. Thus, future works including the non-linearity, skew, pre-cone, and 
tower may validate the selected design to be analyzed. A good candidate was designed to hit crowded places with 
minimal sound volume and relative lesser pollution levels than the usual wind turbines. Local modifications of the 
airfoil geometry are suggested to enhance the capabilities of simulations. The exponent of 2 only from Peukert’s 
work is accurate at high tip-speed-ratio, precise, and only limits the maximum power which can be delivered, while 
not lowering the efficiency of the wind turbine.

Abstract 
Prompt engineering has become essential for unlocking the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) like 
GPT, PaLM, and BERT. These models rely on carefully crafted prompts to generate accurate, context-aware, and 
relevant responses for tasks such as text summarization, question answering, code generation, and SQL query 
formulation. Techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting enable users to achieve consistent 
performance across diverse applications, improving precision and adaptability. However, the effectiveness of prompt 
engineering is hindered by challenges such as phrasing sensitivity, ambiguous outputs, and inconsistent responses. 
This paper addresses these limitations by exploring methods to optimize prompt design systematically, proposing 
frameworks for automated prompt tuning and adaptive strategies to enhance model reliability. Furthermore, it 
investigates the integration of prompt engineering with fine-tuning techniques to align outputs with specific business 
and operational needs. The study aims to provide actionable insights, tools, and best practices for crafting prompts 
that unlock the true capabilities of LLMs. As these models become increasingly embedded across industries such as 
business, education, and healthcare, this research will equip users with the skills to design effective prompts, fostering 
innovation and improving human-AI collaboration. Mastering prompt engineering will empower users to ""speak the 
language of AI,"" ensuring efficient interactions while unlocking the transformative power of LLMs to solve complex, 
real-world problems.

Abstract 
Ergonomics is the study of the interaction between workers and equipment and the factors affecting their interaction 
like work environment. Several factors play an important role in ergonomics, and these factors determine the safety, 
health, comfort and efficient performance of workers at the workplace. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders 
(WMSDs) are the most common problems in manual work in small scale industries, accompanied by postural risks. 
The present study is a compilation of several individual studies taken up in the small-scale sector (i.e. brick making, 
saw mill, stone quarry, dall mill, oil ghana and puffed rice industry). More than 200 workers from these industries 
participated in the study. The study includes administering a musculoskeletal questionnaire to determine the level of 
MSDs among the workers. The workers are subjected to awkward postures like bending, twisting, heavy load carrying, 
etc. Evaluation of these postures was carried out using ergonomic assessment tools Rapid Upper Limb Assessment 
(RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). It can be concluded from the study that 32% of the postures 
adopted by workers are in high risk according to RULA and 36% are in high risk according to REBA assessment tools 
and need to be changed urgently. It is recommended to improve the working postures by ergonomic controls and 
interventions, and encourage the use of PPEs in order to improve the efficiency of the workers and overall productivity.

Abstract 
This paper addresses the increasing number of disabled people due to workplace accidents and the need for practical 
prosthetics that can improve rehabilitation treatment and comfort of home life. Considering the lack of prosthetics 
used in rehabilitation treatment of disabled people, the goal of this study is to develop an assistive product that can be 
used in rehabilitation treatment of disabled people. The goal is to extract data from the EMG signals generated when 
the user's muscles contract and relax, and to develop a more specific and practical prosthetic hand control technology 
by applying fuzzy theory to the extracted data. The developed prosthetic hand control technology aims to improve the 
user's quality of life and assist rehabilitation treatment in various environments.

Abstract 
The laundry business in India is especially vulnerable to work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) due to a 
variety of variables such as washing, ironing, awkward postures, repetitive duties, and so on. Objectives of the Study: 
To identify existing practices and occupational safety and health (OSH) measures in the commercial laundry and to 
assess the postural risks and the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) among laundry workers. Materials and 
Methods: A descriptive study was carried out in a laundry in Kalaburagi. The laundry employs about 50 workers and 
caters to customers B2B and B2C. This research was conducted by observation, Nordic Musculoskeletal 
questionnaire, ergonomic assessment tools like RULA, REBA and OWAS. Results: The study’s purpose was to raise 
ergonomics knowledge among commercial laundry workers. According to the study, there is evidence that workers’ 
overall working conditions are poor and must be addressed considerably in order to eradicate MSD risk factors. Most 
of the working postures exhibit high risk as per RULA and REBA assessments. One of the findings of this study 
indicate that adjusting the height of the table to match the height of the workers can improve the comfort of ironing 
employees. and that ironing should be done with a simultaneous weight reduction of the iron box. Similar deficiencies 
are found in sorting, loading and unloading. Some recommendations are made to improve the working conditions and 
postures, and ergonomic interventions are suggested.

Abstract 
In India, the rapid growth of solar energy has led to a substantial increase in its production and so subsequent disposal 
of solar panels pose significant environmental challenges, highlighting the need for efficient closed-loop supply chain 
(CLSC) models specifically tailored for the solar industry. However, the current CLSC systems for e-waste 
management in the solar industry face numerous challenges in effectively recycling, repurposing, and reducing the 
environmental footprint during their mid crisis or end-of-life. This study uses a methodology for analyzing critical 
collaborative factors (CCF) in CLSC for e-waste management pertinent to the solar industry within the Indian pretext. 
A comprehensive review of existing literature, 12 CCF along with 3 novel CCF have been identified through the 
discussions with subject matter experts. Professionals with extensive experience in the solar industry have been 
contacted to assess the interconnections among these factors. To interpret the responses, the study employs Grey 
Relational Analysis (GRA) to streamline the number of CCF, followed by the application of Grey DEMATEL to 
elucidate causal relationship amongst the factors. Factors identified as enablers, such as the Collaborative Performance 
System and Benevolence, have cascading positive effects throughout the entire system, potentially reinforcing 
outcomes such as Top Management Commitment and Integrated Supply Chain Process. However, vigilant oversight 
of factors such as Top Management Commitment, which is contingent upon the efficacy of other factors, is essential. 
The incorporation of three novel factors enriches the existing body of knowledge, thereby making a substantial 
contribution to theoretical research implications. For managerial perspective strategic focus on primary CCF helps in 
taking informed decisions that can led to substantial improvement across the system.

Abstract 
This study investigates the combined impact of seasonal weather variations and workload on teachers’ mental health, 
job satisfaction, and performance in the USA. While existing research has explored the individual effects of extreme 
weather and workload on educational outcomes, the interaction between these factors remains underexplored. This 
research aims to fill this gap by examining how different weather conditions (e.g., extreme heat, cold, humidity) and 
varying workload periods (e.g., exam seasons) affect teachers’ well-being and job performance. Seasonal changes, 
notably the transition from fall to Winter, are marked by reduced daylight and colder temperatures, which can also 
contribute to the onset of seasonal Affective Disorder through symptoms such as depression, fatigue, and decreased 
motivation, which can significantly impair an individual’s work performance and overall well-being. In parallel, 
workload dynamics are crucial in determining job satisfaction and employee performance. High workloads can lead 
to stress, burnout, and diminished job satisfaction, while insufficient workloads can result in boredom and a lack of 
engagement. The study also underscores the importance of implementing effective coping mechanisms and school 
support strategies that mitigate weather and workload stressors. These insights provide valuable implications for policy 
changes and interventions to enhance teacher well-being and performance. By understanding the nuanced interactions 
between weather and workload, this research contributes to developing more resilient and supportive educational 
environments. Seasonal weather variations profoundly influence human life's daily routines and overall well-being. 
These changes can particularly impact teachers as their workload and responsibilities are.The academic calendar and 
seasonal shifts are closely intertwined. Understanding the combined impact of seasonal weather variations and 
workload on teachers' mental health, job satisfaction, and performance is crucial for fostering a supportive and 
productive educational environment. Research indicates that teachers experience heightened stress levels during 
specific periods of the academic year, such as the school term onset or standardized testing seasons. These stressors, 
compounded by seasonal factors such as shorter daylight hours in winter or extreme temperatures, can significantly 
affect their mental health. Additionally, job satisfaction and performance are critical metrics that influence the quality 
of education delivered to students. This study aims to explore the complex interplay between seasonal weather 
variations, workload, and teachers' mental health, job satisfaction, and performance in the United States. By 
identifying the key factors and their relationships, the findings of this research could inform policies and interventions 
designed to support teachers, enhance job satisfaction, and improve educational outcomes.

1. Introduction
This dynamic interplay between seasonal weather variations and workload is an area of growing interest within 
occupational health and organizational psychology. In the United States, seasonal changes, notably the transition from 
fall to winter, reduced daylight hours and temperatures. This study explores the combined effects of seasonal weather

6. Discussion 
 The results underscore the critical interplay between seasonal weather variations and workload on teachers' mental 
health, job satisfaction, and performance. The presence of Seasonal Affective Disorder among teachers during the 
winter highlights the need for targeted mental health support. Similarly, the peaks in workload stress suggest that 
administrative support and workload management are pivotal in sustaining teachers' job satisfaction and performance. 
 
 Future studies could explore the impact of specific interventions to mitigate the effects of seasonal weather variations 
and workload on teachers. For example, they could investigate the effectiveness of light therapy for SAD or the 
implementation of technology to reduce administrative burdens during peak times. Additionally, longitudinal studies 
could provide deeper insights into the long-term effects of these stressors and the sustainability of coping strategies. 
 
The high workload and seasonal weather variations significantly affected teacher performance. Teachers reported 
feeling less effective during high-stress periods in their instructional roles, leading to lower student engagement and 
achievement. Furthermore, mental health issues during winter months exacerbated these performance declines, 
suggesting a compounded effect of seasonal weather and workload stressors. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The combined impact of seasonal weather variations and workload on teachers is significant and multifaceted. 
Addressing these issues through comprehensive support systems and policy changes is crucial for improving teachers' 
mental health, job satisfaction, and performance, ultimately benefiting the broader educational environment (Figure
