A New Formulation of Quadratic Assignment Problem 
(QAP)

rrks@iitk.ac.in 
Abstract 
Different formulations of QAP (such as Linear Integer Formulation, MILP formulation, Formulation by Permutations, 
Trace Formulation and Graph Formulation) are given in Loiola et. al. (2007).  Different linearization of QAP are 
summarized in Singh and Sharma (2008). We give here a new QAP formulation and describe its advantages. For many 
different contributions to layout problems refer to Sharma (2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2021 and 2022). In this paper we 
give a new formulation of QAP.  
Problem QAP 
Min sum over (i,j,k,l): x(i,j)*x(k,l)*D(j,l)*F(i,k)      (a) 
Sum(i), x(i,j) = 1 for all j 
 (b) 
Sum(j), x(i,j) = 1 for all i   
 (c) 
x(i,j) = (0,1) for all i and j 
 (d) 
x(i,j) = 1 if facility ‘i’ gets into ‘j’ th slot, D(j,l) is the distance between ‘j’ th and ‘l’ th slot and F(i,k) is flow between 
facility ‘i’ and ‘k’.  
Here we give a new formulation of QAP. We put following constraints. 
x(i,j) + M*(1 – y(i,j)) >= 1  for all i,j 
 (e) 
x(i,j) - M*(y(i,j)) <= 0        for all i,j 
 (f) 
y(i,j) = (0,1)        
 for all i,j 
 (g) 
and add (h) in place of (d) 
x(i,j) >= 0  for all i,j        
 (h) 
when x(i,j) is 1, then y(i,j) = 1; and when x(i,j) is 0, then y(i,j) is 0. Any x(i,j) in open interval (0,1) is infeasible (say 
x(i,j) = 0.5 is infeasible with either y(i,j) = 0 or 1). Thus though x(I,j) is real >= 0, it acts like binary due to (e), (f) and 
(g).  
Then new formulation (NF_QAP) of QAP is 
(a), s.t. (b), (c), (e), (f), (g) and (h).  
It has N2 real, N2 binary and 2*( N2 +N) constraints; and has quadratic objective function in real variables. These are 
the merits of our new formulation of QAP. For a detailed comparison see Singh and Sharma (2008). Similar 
formulations are possible in DPLP (dynamic plant layout problem) also.

1. Introduction
The simple plant layout problem (SPLP or the quadratic assignment problem QAP) is posed as follows. There are N 
slots where N facilities are to be located. Distance between slot ‘j’ and ‘l’ is known and denoted by D(j,l). The material 
flow between machines (facilities) are known in advance (it is determine by product mix of the company and 
technological requirements of sequence in which different operations are performed on different jobs). We seek to 
minimize the material handling cost of the total shop when all machines are considered. It results in quadratic objective 
function involving binary variables s.t. linear constraints. It is a single period problem. When material flow between

Abstract 
In this work, we advance the solution approach to the single stage capacitated warehouse location problem (SSCWLP) 
problem. We took six formulations given by Sharma and Berry (2007) for SSCWLP with various constraints 
combinations and added a new promising constraint (∑capj * yj  ≥  1). The computations done after additional 
constraint results in statistically better results reduction in number of nodes searched as well as in CPU time taken to 
solve the problem. We created random 50 samples of problems of size 15x15x15, 30x30x30 and 50x50x50 size 
problems and solved using GAMS software to show the computational advantage even in such large magnitude 
problem. We performed paired t-test on all the six pairs of results to observe statistical significance of improvement 
with the new constraint. Results with new constraint were observed statistically significant and better at two-tailed t-
test with 95% confidence interval.

1. Introduction
Warehouse Location problem involves identifying the specific locations, which can serve as temporary storage and 
redistribution point to optimize the total cost of maintenance and transportation in meeting the varying demands of 
markets, than serving directly from supply points. All the major companies (like Nestle, Unilever, etc.) catering to 
multiregional, multiproduct and multi-plant management use the warehouse distribution model (also referred to as 
hub and spoke) model to address the vast global market demand. It also helps in deconsolidating the large shipment 
to less container loads (LCL) through other smaller transportation modes and serving the purpose of consolidation by 
aggregating smaller shipments from various plants to large as required by large demand point.  
A single stage capacitated warehouse location problem (SSCWLP) is a class of linear programming problems that 
involves selection of cluster centers or redistribution points that gives the most economical shipping routes for transfer 
of a uniform commodity from a number of sources to a number of destinations. The set of potential warehouse

5. Conclusion
In this work, we add one new promising constraint in the various formulations proposed in the style of Sharma and 
Sharma in the quest of finding the strength and computational benefit of the new constraint added. All formulations 
were solved on GAMS with Branch and Bound algorithm. After performing the statistical analysis it can clearly be 
established that the formulations having the new added constraint (∑capj.yj≥1) take less no of node searched also can 
be executed in lesser computational time as compare to their counterpart formulations, not having this constraint. This 
was statistically evident in both small as well as large size of problems taken. 
However, we couldn’t go beyond 50X50X50 size problem because of the termination of program run on the GAMS 
due to low processing capacity of the system but the strength of this constraint can further be checked on problems 
having size of 100X100X100 and beyond. In whole of the analysis, we considered single commodity problem but this 
work can be extended to multi commodity problems as well.

Abstract 
Nowadays, manufacturing companies are looking to improve their sustainability in the market. However, there are 
several factors that negatively affect it, such as workload imbalance among workers, defective parts, and customer 
complaints, to name a few. This paper presents a case study of a workload imbalance in a global customer complaint 
follow-up process in a manufacturing company, generating lagged complaints (no follow-up), which has negatively 
impacted the sustainability of the process. Due to this, the objective of this project is to increase the sustainability of 
the process by reducing the number of delayed complaints. To do this, the causes of the problem are identified. Then, 
an analysis of the process flow map is performed to see the current distribution of the workload among the different 
plants of the company. Moreover, corrective actions are implemented and followed up. Subsequently, the process is 
standardized, transferred by parts to the different plants, monitored for control, and the effectiveness of the actions is 
measured. As a result, there was an increasing trend in terms of compliance in the capture of complaints, starting with 
84% and reaching 97%. Similarly, the total number of complaints received showed a decreasing trend. Finally, zero 
delayed/indefinite complaints (no follow-up) were obtained. Therefore, it is concluded that workload balancing has a 
positive impact on the sustainability of processes in manufacturing companies.

1. Introduction
Sustainability is divided into three dimensions: economic, social, and environmental (Fischer, Brettel, & Mauer, 
2020). This research focuses only on economic sustainability, which is defined as the ability to efficiently use available 
resources to ensure profitability over time (Barile, Quattrociocchi, Calabrese, & Iandolo, 2018). One of the sectors 
contributing most to economic expansion is the manufacturing industry (Olufayo, 2019). However, even today, 
companies face problems that negatively impact their sustainability, such as defects in their products (Goyal, Agrawal, 
& Saha, 2019), customer complaints (Neves et al., 2018), low sales, or low productivity (Fatimah & Aman, 2018), to 
mention few. In addition, the human factor plays a key role in the sustainability of companies (Mercado-Burciaga, 
2020). Therefore, it is required that there is a balance of the workload among workers and that the workload is not 
classified as high so that they can perform their tasks adequately (Fathi, Nourmohammadi, Ghobakhloo, & Yousefi, 
2020; Miranda, Indrawati, & Wulandari, 2018). As a result, manufacturing companies must implement strategies to 
make efficient use of resources (Kishawy, Hegab, & Saad, 2018), and thus maintain a good level of sustainability. 
Although studies have been conducted to assess sustainability in the manufacturing sector, most of them have focused 
on assessing the sustainability of the manufactured product, while efforts to assess sustainability at the process level 
are relatively limited, focusing mainly on specific processes such as turning, milling or grinding (Saad, Nazzal, & 
Darras, 2019).  
For instance, Ngai, Chau, Poon, and To (2013) developed an energy and utility maturity framework for systematic 
measurement and management of natural resource consumption for sustainable manufacturing process. Similarly, 
Jayal, Badurdeen, Dillon, and Jawahir, (2010) presented an overview of recent trends and new concepts in the 
18",,"Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Houston, Texas, USA, June 13-16, 2023

evidence to reject this assumption, since, as the results indicated, the number of delayed client complaints 
decreased, and therefore, the sustainability of the process increased (Goyal et al., 2019). 
 
As mentioned in the Introduction section, customer complaints have a direct impact on the sustainability of companies. 
Based on this background and the results obtained, the contribution of this project is to establish that workload 
balancing through process transfer has a direct impact on the number of customer complaints in the first instance, and 
on the sustainability of companies in the second instance. Therefore, workload balancing allows companies to use 
their resources efficiently. 
 
Finally, it is concluded that the standardization of a process and the training of workers on this process have an impact 
on the reduction of customer complaints and, therefore, on the sustainability of the process and of the company. 
 
4.1 Limitations 
The limitations of this project were the time available, since the necessary resources, both human and material, were 
allocated for the project. However, although the results of the project were as expected according to what was planned 
in the general and specific objectives, if more time had been allocated to each stage of this research project, perhaps 
the results would have been more precise and more favorable. 
 
4.2 Recommendations 
As future work, it is recommended that the company review other processes and the distribution of the workload 
among employees in order to improve its level of sustainability. In addition, it is also recommended to convert the 
variables of the causal model into latent variables, and the assumptions into hypotheses to perform a statistical analysis 
in a sample of more companies and more processes.

Abstract 
The Simple Plant Location Problem (SPLP), an NP-hard combinatorial problem, is used extensively to decide the 
minimum number of plants with unlimited production capacity to serve a certain set of markets demand. The objective 
function is to minimize the sum of fixed costs of locating the plants and variable cost of transportation of moving 
goods from plants to markets. Strong formulation of SPLP gives better bounds than weak formulations of SPLP. 
Hence in a branch and bound method, we find that strong formulation processes lesser number of nodes. But the 
number of strong constraints are quadratic (number of weak constraints are linear); hence at each node we take more 
time to process the node (Sharma and Verma (2012)) and weak formulation does better in terms of CPU time to give 
optimal solution. We add few most promising constraints to weak formulations and see that weak + few promising 
strong constraint formulation of SPLP performs the best.

1. Introduction
A ""Simple Plant Location Problem,"" or SPLP, is a problem in which unrestricted-size facilities are distributed among 
'm' alternative sites or locations with the goal of reducing the overall cost of providing fixed demands defined at 'n' 
independent locations. ""The SPLP is one of the simplest mixed integer problems,"" Guignard and Spielberg(1979) 
write, ""exhibiting all of the normal combinatorial difficulties of mixed (0-1) programming while also having a 
structure that begs the application of numerous specialized techniques."" This assertion implies that SPLP is a difficult 
problem to solve, or, to put it another way, that an exact polynomial time bounded algorithm for its solution will never 
be discovered. The decision issue associated with SPLP is NP complete, while SPLP itself is NP hard. The formal 
theory of NP completeness is built on the concept of deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines.  
For an excellent treatise on SPLP reader is referred to Jakobs and Pruzan (1983). Sharma and Muralidhar (2009) added 
a new valid inequality (linking constraints that link location and distribution variables) which was discovered to be a 
new weak constraint.  
For more complex location problems (multistage, multi-period, inventory and shortage variables) reader is referred to 
Sharma (2018, 2018, 2018 and 2019) and Sharma (2019, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022).

5. Conclusion 
After analysing the above discussion and tables we can conclude that the model B1 is the best model among models 
A1, A2, A3, B1 and B3. . Model B2 is as good as B1. So the contribution in form of most promising constraints holds 
good in solving SPLP.

Abstract 
This paper reviews various articles regarding information and multimedia security challenges in E-learning 
environments and how to safeguard personal and intellectual content from cybersecurity attacks. E-learning is one of 
the leading education methods used in learning environments, primarily because it brings the learning community 
together irrespective of where the student lives and allows them to instantly share their knowledge with anyone in the 
world through web applications. Adaptation of E-learning has grown exponentially as every educational institution is 
eager to adopt it while ignoring the challenges related to the security of contents it presents through web infrastructure. 
Increased use of multimedia in online learning provides an enhanced learning experience. As with any other web 
application, the E-learning platform faces numerous obstacles to safeguarding curriculums' intellectual content from 
hackers. Securing multimedia in a digital learning environment became paramount as the Covid-19 pandemic required 
academic institutions to use e-Learning platforms.  This study explores challenges in protecting information and 
multimedia security and conducts a survey to identify information security awareness among students and educators.

Abstract 
Industrial, infrastructural, and biodegradable structural applications using hemp fibers are of interest to enhancing 
environmental sustainability. The purpose of this research is to develop innovative techniques and combinations of 
constituents to use composites in agricultural, infrastructural and other relevant industries. The products including 
graphite or hemp reinforced polymers with different volume fractions and orientations are considered. While a large 
number of products could be used in the commercial production, we explore only two laminates in this investigation. 
Broad aspects of mechanical response for composites and their products are provided in the user manual of a software 
package developed at AdTech Systems Research in collaboration with Air Force Research Laboratory. After 
identifying important constituents for composites and desirable applications, an attempt was made to investigate a set 
of sample cases by running ASCA Code for 2 representative composite laminates. Using analytical techniques, 
effective response characteristics of representative composites are predicted and given in this paper. Based upon this 
research a set of influencing factors will be identified, specific number of composite laminates will be chosen, 
manufactured, analyzed and tested for their performance characteristics. Further research is in progress for 
comparative studies between predicted and experimental values.

1. Introduction
Composites have several advantages over conventional infrastructure and aircraft production materials, including 
reduced weight, reduced number of fasteners, corrosion resistance, and an extended product life. In addition, 
composites can be designed specifically for certain industrial applications to achieve desired stiffness and strength 
characteristics. Composites are used on virtually all Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems, civil engineering 
and medical applications. Composite structures are proven to reduce weight, fatigue, and corrosion damage, resulting 
in improved range, payload capability, speed/maneuverability, and stealth. The ability to custom design structural 
sections, key in the context of this research, reduces touch labor hours related to component production and 
development. The main disadvantage and largest criticism of using composite materials is the raw materials cost. The 
current life cycle cost models not taking into account various aspects of estimated cost-ratios is one of the most 
important challenges decision makers face in determining whether to continue or start production of a new structural 
system. 
Composite manufacturing techniques and lack of consideration has placed composite materials at a disadvantage 
compared to metallic materials. Current models treat an increase in raw materials costs as an increase in total life cycle 
cost.  These models do not take into consideration the potential cost savings based on reduced part count and touch 
labor hours in aircraft production through the use of composites. This lack of consideration leads to an inflated 
estimated life cycle cost when composites are incorporated into aircraft structures.

5.4 Discussion  
Tables 1 and 2 show the variation in effective stiffness properties of the (0/90)s laminates made with the variation of 
hemp fiber properties 1): EA=2.9 msi,  ET =0.2 msi,  νAT=νTA=.15, GAT=1.01 msi; and 2): EA=5.8 msi, ET =0.4 msi,  
νAT=νTA=.15, GAT=2.02 msi; A stands for axial and T stands for transverse directions of the fiber; giving an idea as to 
how to design a composite for required applications.  
 
Table 3 shows the effective properties of AS4/3501, Vf =0.55, well known quasi-isotropic laminate (0/45/90/-45)s, 
which shows a huge variability of lamina properties. This variability of directional properties stimulates interlaminar 
stresses in figures 3 through 6. These results provide an indication as to the variation in the stress components at 
different locations of the laminate near the free edge. Using these stress components, appropriate criteria can be applied 
to predict the failure. 
 
5.5 Future Plans 
Central State University will be producing hemp fiber to develop our own products. The hemp thus produced will be 
tested to determine the mechanical properties, such as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and tensile strength. A set of 
composite laminates will be identified, manufactured and tested. The composite analysis code, ASCA, will be used to 
analyze the laminates. A comparison of experimental and predicted response characteristics will be done to show the 
efficacy of models used. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A foundation is laid for doing mechanics-based research on hemp-fiber-reinforced composites. There has been 
increasing interest in this field. We have effectively used the mathematical models developed in ASCA for studying 
the response characteristics of Hemp/EPON 828 and AS4/H3501-6 laminates. Future studies will study and improve 
the hemp reinforced composites and products.

1. Introduction
In today's highly competitive business environment, particularly with the global business environment and enhanced 
market competition, the existence of businesses highly depends on their ability to improve their manufacturing 
strategies. There are many manufacturing strategies addressed in the literature to achieve manufacturing excellence. 
Out of various manufacturing strategies, the lean production system (LPS) strategy is becoming an important one 
regardless of the size of the industry.  LPS, which originated from the Toyota Production System for manufacturing 
automobiles (Krafcik (1988), Ohno, (1988)), has been widely accepted as a superior approach compared to the 
traditional mass production system (Lewis, 2020, Xu, et al. 2013).   
The core of LPS is the value defined by customers. The value is created only when waste is eliminated in all processes 
(such as product development, production, and service delivery) and features customers want added to the product 
and services. LPS successfully increases production output per person and reduces the finished goods inventory and 
work-in-process (Seth and Gupta, (2005)). Further, the main goal of an LPS is to produce products of higher quality 
at the minimum possible cost and in the least time by eliminating waste (Dennis, 2007). Commonly referred wastes 
in LPS include overproduction, inventory, waiting time over-processing, transportation, motion, and defects (Chaple, 
et al. 2021).  
2. Methods
LPS is made up of several tools and techniques, which are used together as continuous improvement devices to identify 
and eliminate waste while increasing flexibility in operations (Mathur et al. (2012)). Today's advancements in 
information technology and the importance of business analytics technologies are providing or expected to provide 
extraordinary opportunities for designing, implementing, and expanding lean operations from large-sized domestic as 
well as multi-national industries to SMEs (Singh and Khanduja (2010), Powell et al. (2013), Zhou (2016)).

Conclusions  
SMEs play a very important role in both the economic and industrial growth of every country, irrespective of whether 
developed or developing countries. SMEs are struggling to maintain their capability in meeting their day-to-day 
competitiveness due to the high competition in today's global market. To sustain the capability to meet the competition, 
the SME must be very efficient in their organization by way of reducing many wastes such as overproduction, waiting 
time, defects, non-value-added processing activities, excess on motion, high inventory, and transportation.

Abstract 
A learning curve is a powerful tool for companies producing large lots or cutting-edge products, enabling them to 
negotiate cost savings. New products and services are crucial for the growth of any business, particularly in the 
technology sector. However, they also come with inherent risks. One of these challenges is the learning curve 
associated with new offerings. Companies can assess the cost savings of acquiring new skills by applying the learning 
curve. A common mistake is to price new products solely based on their initial manufacturing costs. However, if 
businesses utilize the learning curve effectively, it can be a valuable tool for estimating costs, improving productivity, 
and achieving long-term profitability. Understanding and implementing the learning curve empowers companies to 
make informed pricing, resource allocation, and project management decisions. It allows them to optimize their 
processes and identify opportunities for cost reduction and improved performance. The study aims to determine the 
learning rate for emerging or exceptionally large-scale products where traditional learning curve theory may not 
readily apply. This research will show how large corporations and defense organizations can effectively use the 
learning curve to manage extensive projects involving emerging products and services. 
Keywords 
Learning curve, Learning rate, Emerging products. 
1. Introduction
The learning curve holds significant relevance in the business context, finding various applications. One such 
application involves its utility in estimating the actual cost of a project. The learning curve illustrates that as time 
progresses, productivity increases, albeit at a diminishing rate as production levels rise. It signifies the enhancement 
of efficiency or productivity through repetitive task execution. According to Investopedia, the learning curve is defined 
as ""a concept that visually represents the relationship between cost and output over a specific time period."" In this 
study, we explore how applying the learning curve can assist in estimating the learning curve of emerging products. 
By leveraging the learning curve, a company can determine the rate at which acquiring new skills translates into cost 
savings. A steeper slope on the learning curve implies higher cost savings per unit of output. As employees gain 
proficiency, tasks demand less time and resources, leading to improved performance. A common misconception arises 
when pricing a new or emerging product solely based on the initial manufacturing cost. This approach makes it 
unlikely to achieve the long-term cost objective. Initial units are unlikely to attract significant purchases, preventing 
the accumulation of quantities necessary for cost reduction and long-term profitability. Pricing a product should be 
based on its market value while considering the learning curve estimation, enabling early profitability. 
The foundation of the learning curve concept rests on the premise that a process improves over time through learning 
and increased proficiency. As the process is repeated and mastered, tasks require less time and resources, resulting in 
enhanced performance. This study provides further elaboration on these concepts, accompanied by relevant examples. 
Its demonstration aims to benefit students, new employees, and professionals working across various industries, 
including defense companies like Raytheon Technologies (Raytheon, Collins, Pratt & Whitney) and General 
Dynamics (Electric Boat). While many individuals comprehend the applications of the learning curve in terms of 
knowledge acquisition, skill development, and productivity enhancement through repetitive tasks, it is worth noting

From the above equation, Tn is the time required to produce the nth ship. The natural logarithm of the time to have 
the first ship gives 10.53. The number -0.178 is the slope of the learning curve. For selected data, the estimated 
parameter, b, obtained by a simple linear regression method, will illustrate the learning rate by 2b. Using the above 
values, the range of the expected learning rate would be u = 2-0.178, approximately 88.4%. It's worth noting that the 
learning curve model provides a framework for understanding production efficiency improvements and estimating 
costs. However, it is essential to regularly monitor actual production performance and adjust cost estimates and 
contingency plans as the project progresses to ensure effective cost management and risk mitigation. 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
This example illustrates how the learning curve effect can be applied to estimate the cost of producing the next product 
unit based on the cumulative production volume. The regression analysis indicates that the natural logarithm of the 
time taken to make the nth ship decreases with the logarithm of n, and the slope of the learning curve is -0.178. This 
means that the time taken to produce each ship reduces by 17.8% every time the number of ships produced doubles. 
The learning rate is, therefore, 88.4%, which is within the range of the expected learning rates for shipbuilding projects 
(i.e., between 85% and 89%). 
 
Businesses can use available data and regression analysis to estimate the learning curve parameters for emerging or 
large products. This information can inform decision-making and help achieve cost savings and improved efficiency 
over time. For example, a company planning to produce a new type of ship can use the learning curve to estimate the 
time and cost of production for the first few ships. This information can be used to set realistic expectations and make 
informed decisions about the project. The learning curve is a powerful tool that can be used to improve efficiency and 
productivity. By understanding how the learning curve works, businesses can make better product and process 
decisions. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The proposed model will improve the perception of the learning curve as the Effect of learning efficiency, cognitive 
learning, and productivity, as most people usually get better at repeated processes. The learning-Curve Effect as a 
negotiation tool requires careful analysis of data and a clear understanding of the efficiencies gained over time. By 
highlighting experience, a company can negotiate based on efficiency gains and negotiate better deals and agreements. 
Continued improvement could be used as a negotiation tool to estimate the project cost. This example illustrates how 
the learning curve effect can be applied to calculate the cost of producing the next product unit based on the cumulative 
production volume. The provided tables show an example of shipbuilding data and the results of the learning curve 
model. The R-squared value of 0.9 indicates a strong relationship between the hours and the shipping number, 
demonstrating the learning curve effect. The estimated parameter b, obtained from the linear regression, represents 
the learning rate. In this case, the expected learning rate falls within the typical range for shipbuilding projects (around 
88.4%). 
 
A human phenomenon is that an employee gets quickly in performing repetitive tasks and becomes proficient over 
time. The study showed that the learning curve could be used to predict the cost of production during large-scale 
production. This information was helpful to the company in making decisions about how to develop and launch large-
scale emerging products such as a new containership or super tanker. A high learning curve indicates that the initial 
cost is high, but the tasks might be intensive to employee training. As the learning curve has many applications, a 
company can identify the significance of dedicated training for new procedures, allocating employees' time, or 
allocating costs across a new product or an extensive unit and use the information for negotiation. Future research 
direction is how a project manager or industry leader can use various learning curve applications to derive financial 
forecasts, estimate the budget, anticipate due dates, and meet customer demand.

Abstract 
The first product in a baby's diet that makes a difference in their health is infant milk. Infant Formula Milk (IFM) has 
experienced many turbulences throughout history and has always been a target for smugglers and those attempting to 
make illegal high profits. The biggest scandal in Chinese IFM trading occurred in 2008, and the recent massive recall 
of IFM products in the US in February 2022 following the recognition that the products contained microbial 
contamination. Among the bacteria found are Salmonella Newport and Cronobacter Sakazakii. Throughout this study, 
the objective is to identify the most critical risks that may affect the quality of IFM in the supply chain and determine 
mitigation strategies to improve the performance measurement of IFM in the supply chain. We are developing a model 
to reduce adulteration and contamination rates in the IFMSC and maximize safety. The steps to achieve the study 
objectives include: 1) Identifying the importance of IFMs for infant nutrition and their risks. 2) Establishing mitigation 
criteria for evaluating the performance of the IFMSC to maximize its quality; and 3) Analyzing each mitigation criteria 
to maximize the safety of IFMs. Based on pairwise comparisons conducted by professionals in Food Supply Chain 
(FSC) decision-making, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model is used to analyze and prioritize mitigation 
alternatives. According to the contamination quality risk agent, the mitigation alternative (QR.M2) ranks highest. It 
illustrates how important it is to avoid risk when dealing with public health, especially the health of infants, and how 
IFM must undergo precise testing and quality checks at every stage of the supply chain to ensure its quality.

This research proposes a framework to develop interactive dashboards and evaluates the effectiveness of using them 
in improving data management, data analysis, data visualization, and information sharing. A case study in an 
electronics manufacturing company located in the United States was conducted to implement the proposed framework 
with a main focus on business and financial information. The framework is comprised of four main phases; pre-
assessment to assess the current situation, standardizing the format of the databases, creating interactive dashboards, 
and post-assessment to evaluate the suggested improvements. The proposed framework proved its effectiveness in 
creating standardized databases and interactive dashboards based on the results of the pre/post assessment.  The 
assessment showed positive feedback on how the use of dashboards helps in improving the four-evaluation metrics; 
data management, data analysis, data visualization, and information sharing.   
Keywords 
Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Interactive Dashboards, Information Sharing, and Data Management. 
1. Introduction
In the last decade, with the increased technological development in different industries, the volume of data generated 
and transferred by different sources continues to grow, this emerges the need of applying effective techniques by 
companies to manage, analyze and visualize their data in a way that supports the process of making different business 
decisions and keep them competitive in the market (Hu et al. 2014). However, implementing these techniques in 
practice remains a challenge due to different factors such as the lack of a well-established systemized framework to 
transfer from the traditional approaches of making decisions to the use of data analysis and visualization techniques 
to draw different insights and trends which will help in making key business decisions. 
Interactive dashboards are considered one of the main emerging tools that facilitate the process of analyzing and 
visualizing data by offering a single display that shows the most important business information based on the available 
data (Alhamadi et al. 2020). Despite the wide adaption of this technique, the number of researchers that discuss the 
best way to integrate this technique in practice and real case examples is still limited. In addition, the evaluation of 
the effectiveness of using dashboards to support different business decisions still needs to be further studied using real 
industry feedback.  In this study, a framework to build interactive dashboards has been proposed to improve data 
management, data analysis, data visualization, and information sharing. This will be applied in an electronics 
manufacturing company with a main focus on managing the business and financial data of the company projects. 
Please note that any examples used herein are with hypothetical values and customer interactions in order to protect 
confidentiality and IP concerns.   
The proposed framework consists of four main phases.  The first stage is pre-assessment of the current state.  This 
phase is comprised of defining the dashboard layout, data selection, data collection, and a pre-assessment survey that 
will be used to evaluate the current tools in terms of data management, data analysis, data visualization, and

that using the standardized databases and dashboards improves the four measures, namely, data management, data 
analysis, data visualization, and information sharing.

The results of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test are shown in Table 4. For all metrics, we rejected the null hypothesis, 
since the P- values are less than our significance level (0.05), which means that using dashboards has a significant 
effect on the metrics and it is effective to use them to improve the metrics being measured.

Abstract 
This paper outlines a proposal for serving working professionals in industry by offering them two programs of study 
to enhance their education and improve their job prospects. The programs were specifically designed to meet the needs 
of the manufacturing industry in Texas. Many students with associate degrees need four-year degrees to move into 
supervisory positions (2 + 2). Online education allows them to keep their job and pursue higher education, so they can 
move up in their careers. A two-year online course rotation cycle was developed for the Technology courses. The 
students are able to enhance their skills in order to be promotable. Based on the success of the undergraduate 
technology program we have designed a Master of Science program in Industrial Technology (2 + 2 + 2). Students in 
the Master of Science program will take two online courses each semester for two years just like the undergraduate 
Technology Program. Many technology students with bachelor’s degrees need graduate degrees to move into upper 
technical leadership positions. The advantages of online education are learning anytime and anywhere which is 
especially good for working adults including those that have to travel as part of their job. E-learning is the new name 
applied to internet based online education. Many online students are older working adults balancing studies with the 
demand of family and work.

1.Introduction
With the widespread use and the rapid growth of the Internet, educational and training institutions around the globe 
are racing towards using the Internet as a new medium of delivery. The world-wide-web is a powerful and exciting 
medium for communication and as such is a valuable resource for faculty for delivering online instruction.  Its ease of 
use and the capacity as a repository of information and the interactive delivery of content makes it an effective option 
for furthering knowledge and skill. The advantages of online education are learning anytime and anywhere which is 
especially good for working adults including those that have to travel as part of their job. Another advantage of a web 
course is that they can easily be reviewed and changed for currency and accuracy compared to textbooks. A textbook 
takes an average of two years from the time of completion to publication. With an online course, the contents can be 
changed by the author anytime the author chooses to do so (Kerka 1996). As the world-wide-web becomes a state-of-
the art delivery medium there is a need among educators and trainers to obtain knowledge about the tools needed for 
developing and implementing web courses. Easy access to education and training to potential students is a growing 
need, as well as servicing industry needs through asynchronous learning for employees. Historically, distance 
education has been thought of as a means to deliver instruction between geographically separated people (Everett 
1999). Numerous institutions have entered the distance learning arena because it makes economic sense. The hope 
has been to attract non-traditional students, as defined by age, marital status, or employment status, to the academic 
market. The attempt has been to capture a group of students who might not otherwise attend classes in a traditional 
setting. In today’s global marketplace, organizational success is increasingly built on a foundation of skilled, self-
motivated, and engaged individuals with the capacity for managing their continuous learning needs. 
1.1 Objectives 
We developed a plan to offer two new courses online every semester. Continuing students can enroll in two new 
courses every semester for two years until graduation. We tailored the online courses to meet the needs of the 
working online students based on their input.

4. Results and Discussion 
Students with associate degrees need four-year degrees to move into supervisory positions. Online education allows 
them to keep their job and pursue higher education, so they can move up in their careers. Students with bachelor’s 
degrees can take the graduate courses and get a master’s degree to move into upper technical leadership positions. 
 
The advantages of online education are learning anytime and anywhere which is especially good for working adults 
including those that have to travel as part of their job. The use of online education in technical education is growing. 
E-learning is the new name applied to internet based online education. Online education also helps with scheduling 
and program costs. Many online students are older working adults balancing studies with demand of family and work.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The internet has become an effective delivery medium for providing easy access to education and training needs, as 
well as facilitating asynchronous learning. Having a good understanding of the tools needed for developing and 
implementing courses on the Internet is imperative for educators developing online courses. Online courses compare 
well with traditional courses in effectiveness and student satisfaction.

Abstract 
Pharmaceutical products can be found in hospital, drugstore, and even supermarket for over-the-counter products. All 
pharmaceutical products have expired date or date which indicates the limit of best consume products, customers 
should not consume the products when it already exceeds the expire date. Distributors are responsible to return all 
inventory of expired products to the manufacture starting from three months before the expire date. This is a backward 
flow where products from the end of chain are travelled back to its origin, known as reverse logistics. Reverse logistics 
often underestimate by the manufacture yet the activities from it cannot be removed. BPOM (Badan Pengawas Obat 
dan Makanan Republik Indonesia), a government agency in Indonesia dealing with food and drugs, similar as FDA 
(Food and Drug Administration), oblige pharmaceutical manufactures to control all of their expired products. 
Therefore, manufactures should estimate the quantity and time of the expired returned products that will be received 
in their warehouse in order to prepare all the resources needed to process the administration and disposal. Using Grey 
Model, manufactures can forecast the quantity and time of their returned expired products that will be received in their 
warehouse. Grey Model enable manufactures to have their forecasting calculation of the future with small size of 
historical data without know the statistical distribution first. This paper will use two years of historical data and 
calculate the forecasting of pharmaceutical returned products using Grey Model.

Abstract 
In the current era of globalization, industrial development is progressing rapidly. This situation makes the condition 
of business competition more intense. Competition becomes a challenge for the company to continue to improve its 
performance in order to produce the output that is able to meet customer needs. The output to be produced by the 
company is strongly influenced by the quality of the products provided by supplier. Therefore, supplier performance 
measurement and evaluation activities are important for the company in order to improve competitive strength, 
customer satisfaction, and company profitability. This study uses Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory 
(DEMATEL) and Analytical Network Process (ANP) methods. DEMATEL method is used to obtain a Total Influence 
Matrix where the matrix can be known which criteria and sub-criteria are the most important and which affect the 
most. The results of DEMATEL method are used as input to ANP method to calculate the weight of each criteria and 
sub-criteria. From the weight of the criteria and sub-criteria that have been obtained, the weighted value of each 
supplier can be calculated to find out which supplier has the highest to lowest value.

1. Introduction
The increasingly intense market competition makes companies race each other to provide the best quality. Competition 
is a challenge for companies to continuously strive to improve their performance in order to produce the output that 
is able to meet customer needs. Each company must have certain criteria such as what specifications are needed in the 
material and the quality of the material must be in accordance with company standards (Bayazit, 2006). In other words, 
the output that will be produced by the company is strongly influenced by the quality of the products provided by 
suppliers. Therefore, the activity of measuring supplier performance is one part that is always emphasized in the 
quality management system (ISO 9001:2015).  
Suppliers are one part of the supply chain that has an important role in the procurement process. Suppliers affect the 
sustainability of the company’s operating system. If suppliers are less responsible in fulfilling material needs, it can 
cause problems in the production floor (Kumar et al, 2018). Companies that have many alternative suppliers must be 
selective in selecting suppliers as the company's business partners. The company must conduct an evaluation to find 
out how much supplier's performance is in meeting company's needs which is then used in making supplier selection 
decisions. Thus, between companies and suppliers can create a mutually beneficial relationship to increase the ability 
to achieve their respective targets (Elmuthi & Kathawala, 2001). 
The manufacturing industry in general cannot be separated from the role of the packaging industry. In terms of 
material, the packaging in circulation is divided into three categories as shown in Figure 1, namely 44% in the form 
of flexible packaging, 14% in the form of rigid plastic packaging, and 28% in the form of paperboard packaging. The 
proportion of flexible packaging is believed to increase higher than other types of packaging driven by the rapid 
increase in the digital market which makes product mobility even higher (Kementrian Perindustrian Republik

6. Conclusion 
In this study, we have supplier performance measurement system that formed with DEMATEL and ANP methods, 
obtained as many as 22 sub-criteria from 7 criteria that have been selected by the experts. The 7 criteria are Product 
Quality Capability, Financial Capability, Delivery Capability, Technical Capability, Service Capabilty, Willingness 
to Share Information and Communication Ethics, and Willingness to Engage in a Long-Term Relationship. 
Meanwhile, the order of the 22 sub-criteria that have the largest to smallest global sub-criteria weights include Quality 
(0.058), Product Reliability (0.056), Repair Service (0.044), After-Sales Service (0.041), Cost Reduction Program 
(0.036), Response to Claims and Warranty Policy (0.036), Technology Development (0.035), Process Capability 
(0.034), On-Time Delivery (0.032), Leadtime (0.032), Production Facilities and Capacity (0.032),  Accuracy of Item 
Quantity (0.031), Long-term Relationship (0.030), Impression (0.029), Closeness of Relationship (0.027), Consistency 
(0.025), Willingness to Design and Participate in Product Development (0.023), Willingness to Share Information, 
Ideas, Technology, and Cost Savings (0.022), Respectful and Honest Communication (0.022), Information Disclosure 
(0.021), Ethical Standards (0.021), and Previous Experience with Suppliers (0.016). Meanwhile, based on supplier 
performance measurement system, supplier performance was evaluated with the following result: the top 3 OPP 
suppliers included S3, S2, and S1; the top 3 PET suppliers included S3, S9, dan S8; the top 3 Nylon suppliers included 
S9, S10, dan S12; the top 3 Aluminium Foil suppliers included S9, S12, dan S11; the top 3 CPP suppliers included 
S13, 16, dan S17; and the top 3 LLDPE suppliers included S13, S18, dan S19.

Abstract 
Working capital management is a very important element of financial management because many firms require large 
amounts of cash for working capital and hold large amounts of short-term debt as a source of financing. The Cash 
Conversion Cycle is the time lag between the expenditure for the purchases of raw materials and the collection of 
sales of finished goods. It can be obtained by adding the number of days inventories to number of days accounts 
receivable and subtracting number of days accounts payable. What is the relationship between working capital 
management and profitability? In other words, does the profitability of a firm increase the more efficiently it manages 
its working capital? One of the factors that may affect the profitability of working capital management is that working 
capital management is efficient when inventories are sold quickly, leaving the firm with a large amount of cash. In 
such a situation, the company can use the cash to purchase and sell more profitable products and services. Studies that 
have demonstrated whether CCC and its components increase profitability have found that CCC has a negative impact 
on profitability. However, the results are not consistent, with half of the previous studies showing a positive impact 
of number of days accounts payable on profitability and the other half showing a negative impact. In addition, with 
the exception of one study, the validity of the results in other previous studies remains problematic due to small sample 
sizes. Furthermore, previous studies have examined the relationship between CCC and profitability in the same period, 
and it is not clear which is the result, and which is the cause. The purpose of this study is to determine how firms' 
working capital management affects their profitability. Specifically, we examine the relationship between working 
capital management in period t and profitability in period t+1 using data from 20,236 (firms/year) firms listed on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Regression analysis of working capital management in period t and profitability in period t+1 
shows that CCC, number of days accounts receivable, and number of days inventories are statistically significant for 
profitability in period t+1. However, number of days accounts payable is not statistically significant. Therefore, in 
order to shorten CCC and increase profitability, it is better to shorten number of days inventories and number of days 
accounts receivable.

Abstract 
Accounting fraud is defined as ""the intentional material misstatement of financial statements or financial disclosures 
(in notes to the financial statements or SEC filings) or the perpetration of an illegal act that has a material direct effect 
on the financial statements or financial disclosures"". Detecting accounting fraud at an early stage is important, because 
fraudulent activity reduces public reliability in capital markets and hinders economic development. Therefore, studies 
have been conducted to establish a model for the detection of accounting fraud using quantitative data, such as 
accounting and financial information, and qualitative data, which are descriptions in security reports, such as Form 
10-K. Previous studies employed quantitative data to develop a fraudulent accounting detection model using logistic
regression, with factors affecting the occurrence of accounting fraud as variables. In contrast, one study used Random
Forest (RF) to create a list of words with high predictive power in association with accounting fraud (e.g. a list of
words related to merger activity or legal issues). These words were used as input variables to build a fraud detection
model using a support vector machine (SVM). Previous studies have confirmed that text data are an effective indicator
in the construction of fraudulent accounting detection models. However, to the best of our knowledge, no accounting
fraud detection model using text analysis exists in the context of Japanese companies. Therefore, the objective of this
study was to construct a fraudulent accounting detection model using textual analysis for descriptions in the MD&A
section of Japanese companies' annual securities reports. Following the procedure of previous studies, a fraudulent
accounting detection model using RF and SVM was constructed for companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
from 2011 to 2017. Firstly, RF was used to determine the rank order of words that can effectively discriminate between
fraudulent and non-fraudulent accounting firms. Next, based on the top 200 words, SVM was used to estimate
fraudulent and non-fraudulent accounting companies. Accounting fraud and non-fraud firms were also estimated using
RF as a baseline model. Our study indicates that the estimation results using SVM had a geometric mean (the
geometric mean of the true positive and true negative rates) of 74.29% and a sensitivity (the accuracy of the accounting 
fraud firms) of 64.58%, showing a higher accuracy than the results obtained when using RF.

Abstract 
The availability of high-speed internet systems and more advanced digital mediums provided better opportunities for 
transforming knowledge and aiding teaching and learning over the past decade. Academic institutions have been 
encouraging and incentivizing their faculty to collaborate with the technical staff to utilize digital technology in the 
classrooms and to report and present their challenges. With the arrival of the COVID pandemic in early 2020, 
institutions rushed to use digital mediums to transform their delivery methods from face-to-face or in-person to 
synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the institution's readiness. Texas A&M University and one of its two 
satellite campuses in Qatar adopted the same policy. Texas A&M University is one of the few universities successfully 
establishing an international campus. The Qatar campus started its operation in the fall of 2002. Since its inception, 
the campus has offered four ABET-accredited engineering programs in chemical, electrical, mechanical, and 
petroleum engineering, and by May 2022, over 1,300 received engineering degrees. The campus has consistently been 
well regarded for its innovative approaches to teaching and learning methods in the Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA Region).  This article presents the results of an empirical study conducted at Texas A&M University in Qatar 
and Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, in two undergraduate courses taught on these two campuses. 
This study also compared students' participation and academic performance during remote in-class (synchronous) and 
face-to-face learning.

The majority of the Gulf Countries (countries bordering the Persian Gulf) have created strategies to raise living 
standards and convert their fossil fuel-based economies to knowledge-based economies over the previous three 
decades. Education, particularly Western education, is one of the primary foundations of these nations' vision. In a

6. Conclusion 
There were some commonalities in the comments given by undergraduate students from the two institutions. The 
ability to use information technology (IT) effectively is essential for synchronous learning. High-speed internet 
accessibility had an impact on how students interacted with their peers and participated in class. However, because 
neither the academic institution nor the course instructors had any influence over the network's uploading or 
downloading speed, no questions about this issue were included in the questionnaire. It is also important to note that 
theoretical classes were favored to have access to course instructors and receive face-to-face training because these 
methods might hasten the learning process. 
 
The survey results also revealed that students in classes that included laboratory components were less supportive of 
synchronous remote learning. The capacity to conduct practical experiments and conduct research is the primary 
drawback of remote learning for engineering students.

Abstract 
Industrial electronic manufacturers must survive to encounter the effect of Covid-19 and the 2023 global recession. 
Many companies initiate designing risk mitigation strategies for their production systems. Jig is one part of production 
systems and special tools which has a function to support production set up easier and ensure uniformity in the shape 
and size of products in large quantities and shorten production time. Risk mitigation is the risk identification process, 
arranging risk, and establishing strategies to manage risk prevention action. Risk mitigation must consider quality, 
cost, and delivery aspects. This paper establishes risk mitigation strategies using two combination methods, House of 
Risk and The Ishikawa Diagram. House of Risk is a modification method from FMEA and QFD that prioritizes risk 
sources for the most effective action to decrease risk sources and the impact of risk damage. Ishikawa Diagram is the 
method from Lean Manufacturing that solves problems intended to identify root cause problems. Both methods 
combined two-step analysis, using the data obtained through interviews, literature study, and questionnaires. The first 
step is identifying risk incidents and problems using the HOR, then ranking and analyzing them using Pareto and 
Ishikawa Diagram. After it’s done and get conclusion, the data is used for the second step analysis to identify risk 
prevention strategies and the effectiveness ratio of the strategy using the HOR and ranked with a Pareto Diagram and 
set of mitigation actions or strategies based on quality, cost, and delivery aspects.

1. Introduction
Product quality is something that must be maintained and is the most basic factor for consumer satisfaction. Product 
quality in fulfilling satisfaction for customers can be represented or described with the Kano Model, a theory of product 
development and customer satisfaction developed by Professor Noriaki Kano in 1980 (Sauerwein et al., 1999). In the 
production system at the company, the quality or quality of the product becomes an absolute requirement that must be 
achieved and controlled before and during the production process until it’s sent to the customer, so quality becomes 
an important item that should be focused on in various manufacturing companies. Supply Chain, Productivity 
Optimization, and Quality Control become topics that have been frequently discussed in recent years, plus there’s an 
outbreak of Covid-19 which began in 2019 until now and issues the global recession in 2023 which is starting to feel 
its effect has caused various manufacturing companies to have to think hard about how to survive in the middle 
difficult economic conditions and still maintain the loyalty of customers. Manufacturing companies design Risk 
Management Strategies by reconstructing or rebuilding Production Systems or Production Supply Chains. The 
company sees and reviews how the production system works from upstream to downstream, whether are there any 
disturbances or obstacles.  
Apart from that, manufacturing companies also have to do Productivity Optimization considering the decline in 
consumer purchasing power due to the global recession issue year 2023. One part of Productivity Optimization is the 
use of jigs and analysis of activities using Lean Manufacturing. Jig is special equipment that has functions to hold, 
and support, and is usually made specifically as a tool for the production process to facilitate the settings that ensure 
the uniformity of shape and product sizes in large quantities as well as to shorten production time (Prassetiyo et al., 
2016), and Lean Manufacturing is also one aid in Productivity Optimization because it can eliminate some activities

5. Conclusions and Future Research 
In this study, we have proposed a comprehensive methodology to set priorities for preventive action or risk mitigation 
based on the gap in research of the studies, using The Supply Chain, Productivity Optimization, and Quality Control 
approaches especially jigs with standards control Quality, Cost, and Delivery. It has been intended to support the 
methodology with two combination methods, House of Ishikawa Diagram, both methods combined using two-step 
analysis. The proposed methodology aims to identify events and causes of risks and take countermeasures or 
prevention actions due to risks that occur with a predetermined priority scale. For future studies, the risk research is 
expanded to cover all parts and systems of the company, because causative variables of risk, risk events, and preventive 
measures can be identified in more detail throughout the company’s parts and systems, and improve the quality of the 
goods produced to increase customer satisfaction.

Abstract 
Reliability engineering is needed for scheduling maintenance to improve system or equipment performance. The 
purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations for  maintenance schedules based on reliability, availability, and 
maintainability (RAM) analysis that optimizes the availability of Crawler Cranes operating in Logistic Shore Base 
companies in Indonesia. This paper begins with searching for a critical system using the Pareto principle. The critical 
system is then made a reliability block diagram to facilitate the analysis. However, before conducting the analysis, it 
is necessary to know the characteristics of the probability distribution of the data so that the analysis results are 
accurate and stable. Analysis of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) is then carried out in the 
probability distribution equation for each system. RAM analysis results show that by implementing reliability 
maintenance at t=OD and maintainability for 120 minutes, there is an increase LS system availability by 0.42% 
(98.78% to 99.20%), ESE availability by 0.57% (97.30% to 97.87%) and US system by 0.95% (97.35% to 98.31%), 
and overall system availability by 0.32% (98.11% to 98.42%).In this study, the overall equipment performance of the 
Crawler Crane was not considered, and the performance evaluation was only based on the calculation of availability 
and usage. Future research should include the measurement of key performance indicators (KPIs) with Maintenance 
Performance Level (MPL).

1. Introduction
Equipment maintenance aims to repair or maintain equipment in good and acceptable working conditions. There are 
two types of maintenance based on time, namely corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM). CM 
is carried out when equipment is damaged and then repaired. In contrast, PM is carried out before the equipment is 
damaged to reduce damage and a greater risk of failure.  
In the previous research literature, it is seen that probability distributions (PD) are included to analyze RAM, such as 
normal distribution, lognormal distribution, exponential distribution, and Weibull distribution. In addition, several 
published pieces of literature reveal that previous researchers have continued to investigate RAM-based maintenance 
scheduling, which is used in various industries and equipment.  
However, there are very few cases of its application to lifting equipment, especially Crawler Cranes. Therefore, it is 
interesting to do RAM research on lifting equipment, especially Crawler Cranes. The selection of Crawler Cranes to 
be studied compared to other lifting equipment is based on the consideration that Crawler Cranes are lifting equipment 
that has complex systems and components compared to other lifting equipment such as overhead cranes, gantry cranes, 
and pedestal cranes. The complexity of the Crawler Crane can be seen from the working area, which can move from 
one location to another, and several configurations influence its operation. The configuration effect intended for 
Crawler Cranes is divided into three parts which can also be referred to as the main system, namely the lower structure 
(powertrain, chassis, outrigger, etc.), electrical & safety equipment (lamp, indicators, safety equipment, etc.), and

Figure 7. Comparison of current availability with availability optimization with RAM analysis 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The analysis results show that the highest value of system availability is at maintainability for 120 minutes, and the 
lowest is at maintainability for 180 minutes. Therefore, it is suggested that the company set a system maintainability 
time of 120 minutes. RAM analysis shows that by applying reliability at t=OD and maintainability for 120 minutes, 
there is an increase in LS system availability by 0.42% (98.78% to 99.20%), ESE availability by 0.57% (97.30% to 
97.87%) and US system by 0.95% (97.35% to 98.31%), and overall system availability by 0.32% (98.11% to 98.42%). 
 
5.4 Validation 
The RAM framework proposed in this study will help decision-makers plan maintenance activities according to the  
criticality level of each system and allocate appropriate resources. This research can be expanded by analyzing the 
performance of subsystems or components of each system using the proposed RAM framework for lifting equipment 
or other equipment from different industries. In addition, in the study, there are several assumptions used such as the 
failure rate and repair of each system is constant and statistically independent, only one system fails at a time, the 
repaired system is as good as the new one, and the standby unit follows its last condition, namely failed state or 
operating state. 
 
6. Conclusion  
RAM analysis is quantitative reliability engineering required for scheduling maintenance to improve system or 
equipment performance. This study highlights the importance of RAM analysis for lifting equipment such as Crawler 
Cranes. Crawler Cranes have three main systems, namely LS, ESE and US. Based on the Pareto principle, all three 
are critical systems. The results of the PD test showed that TBFLS, TTRLS and TTRESE had a lognormal distribution, 
TBFESE and TBFUS had a Weibull distribution and TTRUS had a Normal Distribution. The PD equation for each 
system is then used in the RAM analysis to suggest a preventive maintenance schedule. RAM analysis results show 
that by implementing reliability maintenance at t=OD and maintainability for 120 minutes, there is an increase LS 
system availability by 0.42% (98.78% to 99.20%), ESE availability by 0.57% (97.30% to 97.87%) and US system by 
0.95% (97.35% to 98.31%), and overall system availability by 0.32% (98.11% to 98.42%).In this study, the overall 
equipment performance of the Crawler Crane was not considered, and the performance evaluation was only based on 
the calculation of availability and usage. Future research should include the measurement of key performance 
indicators (KPIs) with Maintenance Performance Level (MPL)

For Arsawan et al. (2022), leveraging innovation culture and knowledge sharing as a competitive advantage and the 
incidence of culture with knowledge sharing was the result of a research conducted in Bali (Indonesia) to a 
representative sample of 259 respondents. The relationship of knowledge management and business practices in the 
textile sector where small and medium enterprises in China, the ambidexterity view, which explores the direct impact 
of knowledge management practices mediated by dynamic capabilities, provides evidence of the sustainability of 
entrepreneurship and organizational performance (Qader et al. 2022). Another interesting study by Nalina, and 
Mahesh, (2022), in which they analyze the learning organization process and knowledge management practices in 
small and medium-sized information technology (IT) firms in Bengaluru (India). It is also highlighted that the strategic 
management of knowledge resources is considered a competitive advantage and again takes the theory of 
ambidexterity in the organizational field to relate innovative leadership and intellectual capital, an analysis conducted 
in Ghana (Adusei et al. 2022). 
 
Other authors such as Morais and Ferreira (2020), establish a clear and important relationship between the 
internationalization processes that small and medium enterprises have had, highlighting the rapid and continuous 
growth of this sector; going back a little in time, towards the year 2019, Li et al. (2019) conduct an investigative study 
in which they highlight the great importance that has for companies the development and management of knowledge, 
emphasize over the way, the disproportionate support of human resources in the context of industry 4. 0, analyzing 
and providing solutions to the main needs of potential customers, which gives SMEs a great competitive advantage, 
making them a major sector of the world economy. 
 
For their part, Henttonen and Lehtimaki (2017), Lin, Lai, (2021), and Ngah, and Wong (2020), establish through their 
research studies, the great importance of knowledge management within the development of companies through 
innovation, generating competitiveness strategies; These research studies show that knowledge management has a 
positive effect on competitive strategies with a greater inclination towards the differentiation strategy, compared to 
the cost leadership strategy, which is synchronized with its commitment to research and development and innovation. 
6. Conclusion 
Knowledge management is perceived as the need to integrate the different knowledge acquired by the human being 
in a disciplinary training area that contributes significantly to the development of companies. Knowledge Management 
is consolidated as a fundamental and indispensable factor in strategic decisions and orientation toward quality, 
innovation, and business development. Knowledge management has generated the most significant contribution to the 
growth and positioning of SMEs in the global business framework. Knowledge management processes allow high 
reliability in decision-making, giving the management the tranquility to explore new markets, products, or services.   
Knowledge and innovation management involves the management of knowledge in the entities to improve the 
products and services offered, the management results, and the strengthening of institutional capacity and 
performance; likewise, through innovation and knowledge, organizations of corporate governance can be sustainable 
and environmentally sustainable, as evidenced by the SMEs in Asia that have created awareness about the 
environmental footprint and the ecological seal that they print in their companies with the support of environmental 
policies established by the state. 
 
Knowledge management in organizations is conceived from the idea of the entrepreneur and can be maintained 
through interaction with people who make up the work team. The creation of knowledge memories helps to perpetuate 
the entrepreneur's legacy to the work teams. It facilitates the training processes of new members in the organization. 
It also encourages the co-creation of new knowledge from the experiences lived in the development of the company's 
processes. Finally, knowledge management and innovation seek to generate benefits for the company by transforming 
knowledge into value, creating new products or services, or optimizing its processes to achieve permanence in the 
market.

Abstract 
Along with the development of the Indonesian industrial sector, business competition is increasing, thus demanding 
increased efficiency in all fields. With this system, one method to accomplish this is through good inventory control 
planning, which ensures that the production process runs smoothly and that client expectations are satisfied on time 
and without delay. By utilizing the Material Requirement Planning (MRP), Mixed Integer Linear Programming 
(MILP) and Reverse Logistics Methods, this study assists firms in avoiding the danger of excess or shortage of raw 
materials. Using these approaches, the company can avoid the problem of raw material shortages. The study will use 
data from February to April 2022. Based on the research results, optimal results were obtained in planning gold 
supplies, namely the MRP method with a yield of 51,396 kg, followed by the Exponential Smoothing method with a 
yield of 36,467 kg and the MILP method with a yield of 30,983.7 kg. As for the large effective gold stock, modeling 
mathematics can be used to minimize total production costs. As a result, production costs were reduced by IDR 
600,000,000.00.

1. Introduction
The rapid development of the times encourages companies to be more complex. The complexity of raw material 
inventory is one of them. In addition, companies use methods, technology, money, materials, people and markets as 
examples of resources. Inventory is defined as goods, including raw supplies, process of working, ancillary items, 
and for a specific amount of time-stored supplements. Inventory control is defined as a collection of procedures that 
specify the minimum amount of supply that must be kept on hand, the timing of orders for adding inventory, and the 
size of orders that must be placed. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is one method for inventory control. 
Traditional MRP and MILP models usually do not take into account the effects of product returns being carried 
through Reverse logistic on goods inventory. Reverse logistics is the act of transporting products backwards from 
one location to another with the aim of getting back the value or carrying out the proper processing of the remaining 
product. Especially for the gold jewellery industry, Reverse Logistic has a goal to recover value as an additional raw 
material. The return flow of goods affects inventory levels and the overall cost of stock, so that has to be taken into 
account when analysing an inventory system. The advantages obtained from the system Reverse Logistic is to 
increase customer satisfaction and decrease inventory levels and reduce costs. In the gold jewellery industry, the 
return of goods from consumers is not only influenced by the smooth or slow-moving sales conditions, but also by 
the payment mechanism. In addition, the company experienced material shortages which occurs in the first week of 
April. In the fourth week of March 2022 the company begins to merge inventory items that are slow moving as well 
as returned goods from consumers, so that in the first week of April there was an increase in raw material 
inventories. 
Payment mechanisms affect the return of goods from consumers. Payments from shops are generally permitted in 
gold bars. When payment is due, merchants can choose to pay in cash or gold bars in the amount of the conversion 
price per gram on that day. This affects the condition of gold availability for suppliers. The image below describes a 
flowchart of the shop's mechanism for making gold returns as a form of payment. Apart from that, material 
shortages or supplies of melted materials must be prevented. Therefore, the authors are interested in analysing the

From the modeling above, Equation (1) has five terms that describe the overall manufacturing cost that must be 
minimized. Terms (1a) and terms (1b) symbolizes the costs of ordering, producing, stocking, and using resources. In 
addition, when raw material supply, recycling, and remanufacturing costs are added to the model, backward 
production flows are integrated into it. Term (1c) denotes the cost of recycling and reuse of raw materials. Term (1d) 
denotes the cost of returning, recycling, and remanufacturing the product. The cost of supply is represented by term 
(1e), which maintains a balance between supply and reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing while taking the cost of 
supply into consideration. Given that all cost coefficients are expressed as a ratio of production quantities in units of 
gold, terms (1a) and (1d) include products with the notation gp. The golden amount has been specified as the choice 
variable in terms (1a), (1d), and (1e). The objective is to keep these expenditures overall to a minimum. The 
mathematical modeling includes the sum of production value, inventory, capacity utilization, recycling expenses, 
reuse costs, loss and remanufacturing costs, and raw material procurement costs (Figure 3). The basic objective is to 
reduce these expenditures overall. In the application of mathematical modeling in this study, variables are used 
inventory and recycled materials as a limitation. Next will be shown the results of applying mathematical modeling 
to reduce the overall cost of manufacture.

In this study, optimal results were obtained in planning gold supplies, namely the MRP method with a yield of 
51.396 kg, then the Exponential Smoothing method with a yield of 36.467 kg (Percentage of error = 0.50%) and the 
MILP method with a yield of 30,983.7 kg (Percentage of error = 0.42%). In addition, good inventory planning can 
keep the continuity of the production process running smoothly so that it can be further elaborated using the goal of 
reducing the total manufacturing expenses through mathematical modelling. Based on the results of mathematical 
modelling using two constraints, namely Inventory and recycle raw materials, it is proven that the total production 
cost can be minimized from the initial Rp. 4,665,017,750 (4.67 billion) to Rp. 4,079,000,000 (4.07 billion).

Abstract 
Every industry is competing, especially retail, to transition or increase its sales channels not only through physical 
stores, but also through online channels. Likewise, warehouses are required to be able to participate in the order 
fulfillment process both through stores and online. This research develops an inventory model for dual channel 
warehouses with limited warehouse space and product returns. With the warehouse divided into two parts, namely for 
offline order fulfillment and for online order fulfillment. The development of this model also considers demand 
uncertainty and delivery lead time. The warehouse space constraint is convex nonlinear programming and uses 
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker analysis in solving it. A closed-form solution was developed using normal distribution in the 
case of no limited warehouse space constraints, and an iterative algorithm using bisection method for the case with 
limited warehouse space constraints. Numerical analysis was conducted directly on a warehouse in a sports retail 
company to get a real-world view of the proposed model. The results show that warehouse space greatly affects the 
size of the order quantity. The sensitivity analysis conducted also shows that the proposed model offers an optimal 
solution for the size of the order quantity and reorder point and can also minimize the total warehouse cost. 
Keywords 
dual-channel warehouse, uncertain demand, product returns, inventory management, total cost minimization, 
warehouse space constraints. 
1. Introduction
The rapid development of the Internet and information technology in recent decades has shifted the focus from 
traditional to online sales. The popularity of online marketing motivates manufacturers and retailers to adopt 
multichannel distribution systems to sell products (Zhu et al., 2020; Modak, 2017). Online marketing is one way to 
increase company revenue (Asl-Najafi et al., 2021). Although online marketing drives sales development compared 
with traditional retail, many issues still need to be studied in online supply chain systems and traditional (offline) 
retail, one of which is related to the sales model (Wang et al., 2022). The online and offline sales model is also known 
as a dual-channel sales model. The advantages of the dual-channel sales model are that it makes consumers feel a 
more comfortable shopping experience, helps companies reduce costs and promote their products, and can improve 
traditional industries (Zhu et al. 2020). This is because some consumers reason that they do not like shopping in retail 
stores because of their busy schedules, stores having long queues, weather conditions, and others. On the other hand, 
some consumers also dislike online shopping because they prefer to check the items themselves, ask for advice and 
assistance from the store, and immediately take home the purchased items rather than paying shipping fees and waiting 
for delivery (Modak, 2017).  
Companies that introduce online sales face many challenges, in addition to the usual challenges of conventional 
businesses in terms of logistics and delivery processes. Such challenges include large order volumes with very small 
quantities, short delivery lead times, flexible delivery (e.g., night delivery and even 24-hour delivery), and picking 
and packing processes for single-unit orders (offline only). These challenges require warehouses or distribution centers 
to be prepared for orders from both offline and online stores (Alawneh and Zhang, 2018; Master, 2015). In addition, 
the challenge in running a dual-channel warehouse is how to organize the warehouse and manage inventory to fulfill 
both online and offline (store) orders. The two important differences are the order size and timing. Online orders are

annual demand decreases by 10%, the number of order sizes, reorder points, and total warehouse costs by an average 
of -4.13%, -7.56%, and -3.74%. Then, the number of order sizes and reorder points does not increase if the demand 
during lead time (𝜇𝜇) increases by 10% because the results of rounding up per box per pcs have the same value; it only 
increases slightly if it is itemized or not rounded up. Consequently, the total cost did not change.  
 
However, if the demand during lead time (𝜇𝜇) is decreased by 10%, the reorder point and total warehouse costs can be 
decreased by an average of -14.6% and -0.16%, respectively, whereas the number of order sizes does not change 
because the rounding results are the same. By increasing the total expected annual product return by 10%, the total 
warehouse cost increases by 0.47%, whereas if it is decreased by 10%, it can also decrease the total warehouse cost 
by -0.47% with a decrease in the reorder point of -7.56%. Lowering the warehouse capacity by 10% will not make a 
difference because it is still within the safe limit of the warehouse capacity. However, lowering the warehouse capacity 
by 20% reduced the number of order sizes by an average of 3.94%. It is noteworthy that warehouse capacity has a 
significant effect on the number of orders. This is because the system reduces the safety stock if it encounters space 
issues from the number of order sizes. By comparing the results, it can be proven that the proposed model is optimal. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
This research has developed a model to determine the number of orders and reorder points for dual-channel 
warehouses, namely offline and online. The model was developed based on Alawneh and Zhang’s (2018) dual-channel 
warehouse inventory model by applying the warehouse capacity. The development of the model lies in the presence 
of offline and online product returns and eliminates backorder costs because it does not fit the situation in sports retail 
companies. 
 
The developed model considers the fulfillment of storage on offline and online shelves or channels, warehouse 
capacity, order costs, storage costs, and product return costs. It also considers the minimum total warehouse cost. The 
model also considers demand uncertainty and delivery lead-time. A closed-form solution is developed using the 
normal distribution in the absence of limited warehouse capacity constraints and an iterative algorithm using the 
bisection method for cases with limited warehouse capacity constraints. The products used as research objects were 
products in class A, with 562 items in the warehouse.  
 
Under the condition of a normally distributed demand and deterministic lead time, a lower total warehouse cost of Rp. 
2,249,728,439.03 is obtained when compared to when the demand conditions are normally distributed with stochastic 
lead time or uncertainty, namely Rp. 3,185,060,398.47. Under the conditions of normal distributed demand and 
deterministic lead time, for class A items, the total number of order sizes (Q) on offline channels is 107,582 pcs with 
a reorder point (R) of 98,604 pcs. On the online channel, there are 21,904 pcs for the total number of order sizes (Q) 
and 1,510 pcs for the reorder point (R). Meanwhile, under conditions of normally distributed demand and stochastic 
lead time, for class A items, the total number of order sizes (Q) on the offline channel is 107,582 pcs with a reorder 
point (R) of 188,954 pcs. On the online channel, 21,904 pcs for the total number of order sizes (Q) and 1,510 pcs for 
the reorder point (R). The results of the calculation of all class A items for normally distributed demand with 
deterministic or stochastic lead times did not exceed the capacity of the warehouse provided. 
 
In addition to determining the optimal inventory policy for a dual-channel warehouse, the sensitivity analysis also 
shows that the proposed model offers an optimal solution and provides a tool for decision support for companies 
operating in the context of dual-channel warehouses. Future research could develop models using conditions that do 
not have historical sales, can compare the results between single- and dual-channel accompanied by an analysis from 
an economic point of view, so that it can be a more accurate input to help companies make decisions and can add other 
constraints, such as limited warehouse capacity, the cost of returning goods, backorder transportation, or even a dual-
channel warehouse that is sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Abstract 
A company announces financial results to investors and analysts and discloses information on the status of its operating 
results and financial performance. Therefore, announcements of financial results are important for investors and 
analysts in making investment decisions. In the financial results announcement, the company reports its performance 
for the current period (including the details of performance and the financial situation during the period) and announces 
the earnings forecast by the company's management (referred to as the management forecast). Management forecasts 
are particularly important for investors' decision-making because they are published by managers who hold inside 
information. 
A previous study tested the counting heuristic in an experimental study of MBA students. The counting heuristic is 
the theory that investors make investment decisions based on the number of times analyst EPS estimates are achieved, 
rather than on earnings surprises. The performance surprise is the difference between the actual EPS and the analysts’ 
forecast EPS. Their results showed that the number of times analysts achieved EPS estimates had a strong influence 
on investors' decisions. 
The purpose of this study is to clarify how information on earnings surprises and the number of times management-
forecast EPS are achieved affects investors' investment decisions when analyst forecast EPS is changed to 
management-forecast EPS. We hypothesize that given information on earnings surprises and the number of times 
management forecasts are achieved, investors will give more weight to information on the number of times 
management forecasts are achieved compared to earnings surprises in assessing (a) the common stock valuation of 
the firm, (b) the desirability of the firm (as an investment), (c) the future prospects of the firm, (d) the competence of 
management, and (e) trustworthiness of management. An internet experiment was then conducted with Japanese 
investors. 
First, the hypotheses were partially supported by the results on stock evaluation and managerial competence, as the 
results tended to focus on the number of times management forecasts were achieved rather than performance surprises. 
The results on corporate desirability and future prospects showed equal importance in the number of achievements 
and performance surprises. These results did not support the hypotheses. Finally, the reliability results showed that 
the number of times management forecasts were achieved was more important than performance surprises, and the 
hypothesis was supported. Therefore, it is important for firms to achieve management-forecast EPS to increase their 
common stock valuation, management competence, and trustworthiness. It is also important for firms to focus on 
achieving and significantly exceeding management forecasts to increase the desirability of the firm as an investment 
and the future prospects of each firm.

Abstract 
Hedonic methods have been widely used in real estate price estimation. However, hedonic methods use multiple 
regression analysis, which makes it difficult to consider many of the complex motivations and preferences that shape 
real estate prices due to multicollinearity. Neural networks (NNs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years 
as an analytical method that compensates for the shortcomings of hedonic methods. An advantage of the proposed 
approach is that, by using NNs, there is no need to assume explicit functions between the input and output of the 
studies, because the NN learns directly from the observed data. As research on the NN methodology in real estate 
price estimation has progressed, many studies have compared the accuracy of hedonic methods with NN. One of the 
representative studies compared the accuracy of hedonic methods and neural network models for estimating house 
prices in Turkey and showed that NN can be a better alternative to hedonic methods. However, there are some 
problems with the study of real estate price estimations using NNs. First, the choice of explanatory variables for the 
model has not been examined sufficiently. Previous studies often employ only micro variables as explanatory variables 
in their models, and few studies employ macro variables in their models, even though macro variables such as GDP 
have a significant impact on the formation of real estate prices. Previous studies constructed neural network models 
with microdata and environmental factors (macro variables) such as air pollution as explanatory variables. As a result, 
they reported that a model incorporating macro-variables related to the environment was more accurate. Current 
studies on real estate price estimation using NNs in Japan often consider only micro variables. Therefore, this study 
aims to clarify the impact of the explanatory variable patterns used in the model by comparing two variable patterns: 
one in which only micro variables are used as explanatory variables, and the other in which both micro and macro 
variables are used. We also identify which of the three methods (hedonic methods, NN, and deep neural network 
(DNN)) is best suited for these two cases. The results show that models with both micro and macro variables as 
explanatory variables are more accurate than the ones with only micro variables. The results also show that using a 
DNN is more accurate than using hedonic methods or an NN. However, the method used should be considered on a 
case-by-case basis, as NN may be more accurate in cases with only micro variables as explanatory variables.

Determining Optimum Maintenance Interval of Critical 
Equipment in Geothermal Power Plant Based on Reliability 
Value and Cost Ratio 
Diva Erenst Nataprawira and Zulkarnain

Abstract 
Geothermal industry unit capital cost and electricity tariff has been competing with lower-cost power generators. This 
situation has challenged all people that work for the industry to optimize their plant reliability, increase revenue, and 
reduce cost. Maintenance activities can be considered a critical process which can be very costly if those activities are 
not managed properly. Part of maintenance management is to determine the optimal maintenance interval with the 
lowest maintenance cost. This paper determines the optimal maintenance interval of the most critical subsystem in a 
big-scale geothermal generation facility in Indonesia. The most critical subsystem of the facility is chosen based on 
reliability value. One of the tools chosen in the industry as a framework for evaluating system reliability is Reliability 
Block Diagram (RBD). Based on RBD, the most critical sub-system is the Cooling Tower Structure System which 
consists of two equipment, the Cooling Tower Fan, and the Cooling Tower Structure. The optimum maintenance of 
the Cooling Tower Fan was calculated using the total cost model equation. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out in 
this paper to determine the cost ratio at which maintenance cost and failure cost calculations must be calculated in 
detail. To obtain optimum maintenance intervals with a certain confidence interval value, the data resampling with 
the bootstrap method is applied to the equipment failure data due to the limited amount of data. The difference in 
maintenance interval value between the original data and the bootstrapped data is relatively small with a maximum of 
5.1% difference.

1 . Introduction  
Indonesia is a country located on the boundary of the Indo-Australian and the Eurasian tectonic plate. Those tectonic 
plates generate numerous active volcanoes stretching from Sumatera up to Sangihe Island, resulting in many high-
enthalpy geothermal resources in these areas. The geothermal resource potential of Indonesia is approximately 24 000 
Mwe (Fauzi 2015). This huge resource can be an alternative to replace fossil-based thermal power plants for generating 
electricity and reducing carbon emissions. 
Compared with an oxyfuel power plant, the geothermal power plant has a higher upfront capital cost. The most likely 
investment cost for a 40 MW unit of a geothermal power plant is 57.6 million $ with upper and lower limits 79.1 and 
44.9 million $ respectively. This gives the cost range of 1122 –1992 $/kW with the most likely value of 1440 $/kW 
(Stefansson 2001). Compare with an oxyfuel power plant retrofitted from a typical traditional 2×600MW power plant, 
the unit capital cost is 4926.30 RMB/kW (Fan et al. 2020) or 734 $/kW. The investment cost of an oxyfuel power 
plant is almost a half of geothermal power plant. 
This situation has concluded that only by optimizing plant reliability, decreasing operating costs, and increasing 
revenue, the geothermal power plant can compete with another thermal power plant in the whole life cycle cost. 
Robertson and Jones (2004) surveyed maintenance costs for various industries and showed that maintenance costs are 
ranging from 2% (light manufacturing) to 90% (equipment-intensive industry and utility sector) with an average of 
20.8% of the total operating budget. Based on that survey, it will be significant savings in maintenance costs if the 
operation team can make the right and opportune maintenance decisions (Jardine and Tsang 2013). One of the 
important maintenance decisions is determining the optimum maintenance interval that minimizes maintenance cost.

6. Conclusion  
With this research, it is possible to select the critical subsystem and equipment based on its reliability value and the 
target value of the reliability of the whole system. This research provides an alternative on how to determine the 
optimum maintenance interval and provides a method for determining the maintenance interval in a certain range with 
a predetermined confidence interval. 
 
One of the critical equipment in the geothermal power plant is Cooling Tower Fan. The Cooling Tower Fan has an 
optimum maintenance interval is 412 days with a cost ratio of 6.896. Based on bootstrap data resampling, the range 
of optimum maintenance interval is 391-410 days with a 95% of confidence interval. 
 
As a continuation of this research, future studies about the different resampling methods, higher confidence interval 
of data resampling, combination with the condition monitoring and inspection interval and total cost of all maintenance 
strategies (Predictive, Preventive, and Corrective), will make essential contributions to the maintenance and reliability 
organizations.

Abstract 
This study proposes an improvement for the reusable waste management system in Santiago de Surco, in a way that 
it significantly increases the utilization of the treatment plant, which is demonstrated in Arena Simulation Software. 
Currently, the utilization of Peru’s largest treatment plant is estimated at a quarter of it maximum potential. This 
research proposes the improvement to exploit the installed capacity of the plant and also increase the volume of waste 
recycled. First, a diagnosis of the current conditions of the system is carried out to identify opportunities for 
improvement, followed by a comparison between successful models worldwide. From them, the elements that can be 
replicated are rescued considering the existing limitations both in the district, as well as in the simulation. Finally, a 
proposal is made from the combination of initiatives taken from countries with high recycling rates. This proposal is 
transferred to a simulation model to demonstrate that a significant improvement is achieved.

1. Introduction
The increasing solid waste generation poses a challenge to waste management systems. It is important that solid waste 
management systems evolve so that they can respond effectively to industry and population growth. 
In Peru, 1.9% of total urban solid waste is recycled (Ministry of the Environment [MINAM], 2018), thanks to citizen 
initiatives and district municipalities. However, the average for Latin America and the Caribbean is 4.5% (Kaza et al., 
2018), which leaves Peru well below this point. 
In 1997, the Municipality of Santiago de Surco began to contribute to urban waste recycling and in 2016 it 
implemented a new waste treatment plant with a capacity of 27 tons per day, in which it additionally manufactures the 
orange recycling bags characteristic of this district. The facility located in the “Voces por el Clima” park has an area 
of 10,000 m2 and is the largest recycling facility for a municipality in Peru. 
Currently, the utilization of the treatment plant is estimated in 24.53%. This research proposes the improvement of the 
reusable urban waste management system in the district of Santiago de Surco, Lima, Peru to exploit the installed 
capacity of the plant and also increase the volume of waste recycled, taking as a reference models that are successful 
in other locations. 
Therefore, first, the current waste collection system in the district of Surco will be analyzed. Secondly, the most 
successful waste collection systems, their characteristics and which elements of these successful models could be 
replicated will be identified. Finally, an improvement proposal will be tested and evaluated through a simulation 
model.

Management, Houston, Texas, USA, June 13-16, 2023 
Finally, as Peru is a developing country, in which initiatives for environmental care are recently emerging and being 
promoted, there is the possibility of achieving the expected results in a period of less than 20 years. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This research managed to successfully develop an improvement proposal for the reusable waste management system 
in Santiago de Surco that significantly increases the utilization of the treatment plant, demonstrating it through a 
simulation model. 
 
The diagnosis of the current management system showed that there was a lot of potential to increase the utilization of 
the plant since it only worked during an 8-hour shift. To exploit this infrastructure, some of the most successful 
collection and management models in the world according to the OECD were investigated and elements were extracted 
from them to replicate them in the Santiago de Surco system. 
 
The comparison between the model of the current situation against the scenario in which the elements of Slovenia, 
Korea, and the initiative to work together with other districts are incorporated into the current model showed that there 
really is a substantial improvement in a variety of indicators such as the plant utilization, gross margin and amount of 
waste processed.

Abstract 
All companies must have competitive advantages to survive in this globalization era. Nowadays, the company needs 
a good priorities and systems, work efficiently, on time, good quality and low costs. The coal mining industry is an 
industry that is still in great demand by investors because of Indonesia's large coal reserves and Indonesia's strategic 
location so that the business competition is very tight. In addition, Indonesia is the world's largest coal exporter in 
2020 with export volume reaching 405 million tonnes. Ship loading schedule is a major activity that have big impact 
to company profit and loss such as quality of coal cargo, demurrage ship cost, commercial price and opportunity loss, 
it is also has impact for the customer satisfaction. This research aims to make cargo allocation optimization model to 
minimize demurrage ship cost by using mixed integer linear programming. Laytime stop are the decision variable 
needed to find and software Excel solver is a instrument used for this model. Constraints used for this model are total 
cargo allocation must be equal to capacity of vessel, cargo allocation per day must be equal or less than loading rate 
vessel per day, daily inventory is fully used and excess time must be equal or higher than 0. The results show that the 
demurrage cost decreased 16.47 % compared to manual method. Sensitivity analysis of ship capacity and inventory 
constraints mostly affects to demurrage cost about $ 0.38644 per 1 ton of increase in ship capacity or decrease in daily 
inventory.

1. Introduction
The rapid development and competition of business require business actors must have a competitive advantage to 
survive. Nowadays, the company needs good priorities and systems, work efficiently, on time, good quality, and low 
costs. The coal mining industry is an industry that is still in great demand by investors because of Indonesia's large 
coal reserves and Indonesia's strategic location so the business competition is very tight.  
Indonesia's coal reserves reach 38.84 billion tons. With an average coal production of 600 million tons per year, the 
lifetime of coal reserves is still 65 years if it is assumed that there are no new reserves found (ESDM, 2021).  
From the demand side, low calorific value coal is main supply for power plants in Indonesia. Indonesia is the world's 
largest coal exporter in 2020 with export volume reaching 405 million tonnes 
The process of determining coal loading scheduling priorities has many complex problems with many criteria factors 
such as weather and tidal condition, inventory, and distribution system. Optimal scheduling and loading of coal barges 
will shorten the duration of the barging cycle (cycle time) so that coal shipment is achieved, contract commitments 
with Buyers/Traders are maintained, customer satisfaction is achieved, avoiding lost opportunity barging activity and 
can avoid detention barges claims and demurrages vessels due to delay in coal loading. (S. Yusuf, 2021).

Table 8. Sensitivity Analysis Table Constraint Inventory Day 8-20 
 
 
 
Where the cargo allocation is smaller than the inventory for days 1-21, it can be seen that the inventory for days 1-7 
(Table 8), the allowable increase and decrease in inventory value is 0 so it does not have any effect,  
while the inventory for days 8-21, allowable increase in supply value is 1E+30 or infinity and decrease in inventory 
for day 8-19 is 0, day 20 is 27,460 MT and day 21 is 14,000 MT. However, it does not have any effect on demurrage 
costs because the shadow price value is 0 
 
In the cargo allocation constraint on day 8 to day 20 or the last day the inventory must run out. Every decrease of 1 
ton of inventory will affect reducing demurrage costs by $ -0.38644 on inventory days 8-13, 15-18, and day 20. On 
day 14, a decrease in inventory of 1 ton will give an increase in demurrage costs of $ 0.069 and inventory for day 19 
does not affect on demurrage costs. Shadow prices are affected by a decrease in supply/allowable decrease. 
 
The sensitivity analysis that has been carried out on vessel capacity and inventory constraints mostly has an effect of 
$ 0.38644 on the demurrage cost for every increase or decrease of 1 ton of coal. Vessel capacity will have an affect 
on increasing costs if it is increased according to the allowable increase and inventory will have an effect if it is 
reduced according to the allowable decrease 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements  
The model in this research still has limitations because using the Excel Solver solver is only limited to 200 cells while 
changing variable cargo allocation in this research are 189 cells, so the scheduling with many vessels over a long 
period time cannot be done in the same worksheet. This model can still be developed into a broader transshipment 
model with more complete data such as the number of barges available, cost, distance, and transshipment time from 
barge to vessel. 
 
6. Conclusion  
There is an efficiency with value $ 33,574.69 or 16.47% demurrage costs from the model. This model minimizes 6 
out of 9 ships, namely MV. B, MV.C , MV. F, MV. G, MV. H and MV. I which indirectly improves customer 
satisfaction due to reduced delays because the ship finishes loading faster. Sensitivity analysis on changes in constraint 
values gives an effect if the vessel capacity is increased and the amount of inventory is decreased with most of the 
values that appear are $ 0.38644. This model is more scalable and efficient than the manual scheduling method.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 is a concept developed in Germany to resolve the 'polylemma of production' and reestablish the 
competitive advantage of manufacturing firms in 'high-wage' economies by delivering mass customization through 
integrated manufacturing systems. Digital Transformation (D.T.) projects focused on 'Industry 4.0' implementation is 
capital intensive and require People, Process, Technology, and Data readiness to pursue those projects. Achievement 
of digital readiness does not pave the way for a complete and drastic transformation. Sudden upgradation of operations 
and implementation of drastic changes to attain 'industry 4.0' status has a high probability of becoming another case 
study like the robotics strategy that Roger Smith and G.M. adopted in the 1980s. The ‘speedfactory’ was established 
in Germany and the United States based on the 'industry 4.0' concept. However, after three years, the operations got 
discontinued, and the 'speedfactory' was shifted to a country that would fall under the category of an emerging 
economy. A key question is why would the speedfactory work in an emerging economy when it failed in Germany 
and the U.S.?  This research article seeks to provide a theory as to why based on the ‘Resource Based-View’ theory 
and follows the methodology of interpretive consolidation of quantitative and qualitative research to analyze the 
reasoning behind implementing ‘Industry 4.0’ in emerging economies. Specifically, this article proposes the ‘Resource 
Partnership Model’ for strategic implementation of 'industry 4.0' to realize sustainable competitive advantage in 
manufacturing firms in emerging economies. In this context, Resource Partnership Model describes the utilization of 
socially complex resources and the unique historical position of a manufacturing firm by forming strategic partnerships 
and then proceed to implement ‘industry 4.0’. This model also cautions that rapid adaptation of digital technologies 
(without strategic partnerships) by manufacturing firms in emerging economies would result in serious resource waste 
and performance pitfalls.

1. Introduction
“Industry 4.0” is a German government program to advance the global competitiveness of Germany’s manufacturing 
industry, and it was first announced at the Hannover fair in 2011 (Kagermann et al., 2013; Darth and Hortch, 2014). 
The motivation to initiate this program was to support the shift in the focus on the production of customized products 
by many firms in the German manufacturing industry (Brettel et al., 2014). Even though various definitions for this 
program are causing confusion and lack of transparency, this program is widely accepted as the 'fourth industrial 
revolution' (Darth and Hortch, 2014).  
The first three industrial revolutions were associated with technological evolutions such as (1) steam-powered 
mechanical Manufacturing, (2) electrically powered mass manufacturing, and (3) electronics and information 
technology-powered automation of Manufacturing (Liao et al., 2017). The fourth industrial revolution is associated 
with the development of the internet, which brought the idea of the interconnected world to reality by enabling the 
transformation of inflexible and dedicated mass production lines to become flexible machines that could actively 
communicate with computer systems and engage in manufacturing activities simultaneously (Buer et al., 2018). 
Flexibility is one of the main drivers behind ‘Industry 4.0’ and has been achieved by introducing internet technologies 
into the manufacturing industry. Most of the technical aspects of these internet technologies are already available and

Abstract 
This study presents a supplier selection planning for companies that adopt multi source strategy, where some category 
of components supplied by several suppliers. Having several suppliers can be the right choice when a supplier has 
capacity problems, backup sources are needed to protect against material shortages, and the need to maintain 
competition among suppliers. Criteria for the supplier selection is quality, delivery, and cost activity performance of 
the suppliers. The Delphi method is used to obtain comparison of importance degree between all criteria. After that 
the data become input for criteria priority analysis using AHP method. Finally, the criteria priority data used as criteria 
weight for selecting supplier using TOPSIS method. The result of these three main steps in this study is supplier 
ranking that represents their performance of quality, delivery, and cost activity. Decision makers can use the supplier 
ranking data as reference for deciding future business intention with each supplier.

1. Introduction
To maintain business continuity companies must provide a variety of new products or services that meet market 
demands to satisfy customer needs. In order to realize these goals, companies need sufficient business profits to 
support their growth (Wang et al. 2013). Manufacturing companies are not making all components that required for 
manufacturing their finish goods by themselves. To obtain components they are purchasing it from one or some 
supplier. Companies that adopt multi source strategy likely have several suppliers to supply component to them. 
Having several suppliers can be the right choice when (Firouz, et al., 2017):  
1. Supplier has capacity problems,
2. backup sources are needed to protect against material shortages, strikes, and disruptions from other suppliers,
3. The need to maintain competition among suppliers.
Company will have to assign the order to various suppliers in the multi-supplier scenario (or at least choose one among
several providers), and then place the orders in accordance with the determined order allocation strategy (Wu, et al.,
2023).
Supplier selection allows companies to assess, rank, and identify prospective suppliers (Islam, et al., 2022). Optimized
supplier selection and order allocation processes can reduce costs and increase profit margins and production system
efficiency (Muneeb et al. 2023).
1.1 Objectives 
This research collects required data to assess supplier and then evaluate their performance to provide material 
considerations that can be used by decision makers to make decisions in selecting suppliers. 
2. Literature Review
The process of choosing a supplier is understood to be a difficult multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem 
that takes into account a number of potential suppliers and different evaluation criteria (X, et al., 2021). Because 
decision-making groups for supplier selection typically include several decision-makers from many professional 
departments, this task is getting more and more challenging for decision-makers. The proper decision should be made 
completely from many perspectives, including aggregating different decision makers' preferences, since different 
decision makers and stakeholders may have different preferences and objectives (Z., et al., 2019).

6. Conclusion
Supplier rank sequence based on performance evaluation is supplier 2, supplier 1, then supplier 3. Once the supplier 
rank determined, decision makers should allocate the orders following determined order allocation strategy or to the 
conditions that are most profitable to the company.

Abstract 
Airport or commonly known as an aerodrome is a specific area on land or water (including buildings, installations, 
and equipment) designated either wholly or partly for the arrival, departure, and movement of aircraft. In carrying out 
its operations, an airport requires electricity consumption to power several mandatory facilities that support aviation 
activities. Airports are also one of the largest energy consumers. The daily electricity and heat energy consumed by 
an airport are equivalent to a city with a population of 100,000 and are one of the largest energy consumption centers 
in modern society. Soekarno Hatta International Airport, as one of the busiest airports in the world, particularly in 
Asia, consumes a considerable amount of electricity to support its operational activities. The high consumption of 
electricity directly affects the increased cost of electricity subscriptions. Due to the high consumption of electricity at 
PT Angkasa Pura II, specific energy management needs to be carried out, particularly at the Terminal Building, as it 
is the largest energy consumer at Soekarno Hatta International Airport (74%). The purpose of this research is to 
evaluate the equipment in the terminal that consumes massive amounts of electricity and to provide an economic 
analysis of investments that can be made to save energy.

Abstract 
The high number of vehicle usage in Indonesia, especially motorcycles, has resulted in high gasoline consumption 
which is not balanced with current domestic fuel production. This condition also has an impact on the high number of 
carbon dioxide emissions. Indonesia’s government has been pushing for electric vehicle usage to reduce pollution and 
energy consumption by formulating policies and regulations. However, the low public interest in switching to electric 
vehicles has resulted in the number of users still far below the target. This study aims to analyze factors that affect the 
acceptance of electric motorcycles in Indonesia. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) 
was used in this study to construct user’s acceptance factors. It considered performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
hedonic motivation, price value, habit, and social influence, combined with environmental concern, infrastructure 
readiness, and government policies as facilitating condition. This research uses partial least square structural equation 
modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the relationship among various constructs and moderating variables using data 
collected by questionnaire to current conventional motorcycle users in Indonesia. The results indicate that attitude 
toward use, social influence, and facilitating conditions positively affect the user acceptance of electric motorcycle. 
Attitude toward use is influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value. 
Facilitating conditions is influenced by environmental concern, infrastructure readiness, and government policies. The 
results of this research can be a source of information for electric motorcycles manufacturers and policymakers to 
improve transportation quality, services, and regulations.

1. Introduction
The consumption pattern of fuel in Indonesia over the past five years has consistently been higher than the country's 
crude oil production capacity. Over the past five years, fuel consumption in Indonesia has been significantly higher 
than crude oil production. The gap between crude oil production and demand has resulted in the government having 
to import fuel. In 2017, the import of fuel reached over 220 trillion rupiah and according to the National Energy 
General Plan, it is projected to continue to increase to more than 550 trillion rupiah in 2025 (PLN, 2021). The 
significant dependence of society on fossil fuels is likely to lead to an energy crisis (Subekti et al. 2014). 
Indonesia's population has grown by 1.25%, with a corresponding increase in the number of vehicles by 6.13% per 
year (Gunawan et al. 2022). This condition has also contributed to the high consumption of fossil fuels. Increase in 
the number of motor vehicles is also due to the fact that nowadays, modern society heavily relies on mobility for both 
humans and goods (Maghfiroh et al. 2021). In 2020, motorcycles were the most commonly used vehicles, with 84.49% 
of the total number of vehicles in Indonesia (BPS, 2021). The high number of vehicle users, especially motorcycles, 
has contributed to the emission of CO2 gas in Indonesia. According to the World Air Quality Report released by IQAir, 
in 2021 Indonesia ranked 17th as the most polluted country in the world and was the most polluted country in Southeast 
Asia (IQAir, 2021). Transportation sector contributes 28% to Indonesia’s air pollution, which is the second-highest 
after the electricity sector (Climate Transparency, 2021). The transportation sector is responsible for emitting various 
types of gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), argon (AR), carbon 
monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) (Mathew and Paraprasad, 2020).

From the moderating variables age, gender, and income, age has proven to moderate the relationship between 
performance expectancy and attitude toward use. Younger people may have a higher performance expectancy. Other 
moderating variables has not proven to moderate the relationship between variables. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The main aim of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the acceptance of electric motorcycles among 
users and to determine the relationships between these factors using the UTAUT2 model. The authors believe that the 
findings of the study could be valuable for for electric motorcycles manufacturers and policymakers to improve 
transportation quality, services, and regulations.  
The results indicated that Attitude toward Use, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions significantly affect the 
electric motorcycles acceptance in Indonesia. Performance Expectancy (PE), Hedonic Motivation (HM), and Price 
value (PV) have significant positive relationship towards attitude toward the use of electric motorcycle. Environmental 
Concern (EC), Infrastructure Readiness (IR), and Government Policies (GP) have a significant positive relationship 
towards the facilitating condition in using electric motorcycle.  
The results of this study show that the UTAUT2 framework-based model is a promising approach for analyzing 
customers' acceptance to use electric motorcycle in Indonesia. This study offers valuable insights into the future 
research directions that could increase customers' intention to use electric motorcycle. However, there are some 
limitations to be considered. The findings may only be applicable to Indonesia and cannot be generalized to other 
countries that have different political, environmental, and economic conditions. Additionally, the determinants 
examined in this study may not fully capture all the factors that could influence the acceptance of electric motorcycles. 
Future study could explore other potential determinants that may also have an impact on user acceptance.

Abstract 
The transition from marginal to dominant renewable energy systems in electricity generation globally has posed new 
challenges in terms of intermittency, variability, uncertainty and low-reliability. This situation has led to a significant 
supply-demand gap in terms of temporal mismatch (times of supply and demand) and quantity mismatch (high supply 
with low demand, and vice versa). These mismatches lead to several issues, including surplus or insufficient electricity 
generation, erratic grid operation, etc. Hence, the electricity planners have to match “dynamic supply with dynamic 
demand.”. In managing such a transitioning electricity system, the planning from the electricity supply side requires 
efficient management of existing electric power systems, on rationalizing generation portfolios. Therefore, to address 
these decisions, we have developed a generic linear programming-based optimisation model that dynamically balances 
supply and demand at least cost. In addition to achieving this objective of dynamic supply-demand balance, the model 
is designed to evaluate all the supply-side options and arrive at a least-cost generation portfolio. This would enable an 
RE dominated electricity taking in to account the inherent challenges associated with renewable energy integration. 
The model is validated using data from the electricity system of Karnataka, India where actual data was compared to 
modelled outputs for the calendar year 2019. Precision metrics, which measures standard error, were used to assess 
the model's accuracy. The results indicated that the standard error ranged from ±10%, which is within acceptable 
limits. This model can be effectively used for electricity transition planning and can provide critical inputs to policy 
makers.

Abstract 
As the world becomes increasingly aware of the devastating effects of climate change, national leaders have united to 
tackle the challenge of decarbonisation. Electricity production, being the highest carbon-intensive industry, has the 
largest share in global greenhouse gas emissions, making it an essential target for decarbonisation. Replacing fossil 
fuel-based power generation with non-carbon alternatives such as renewables or nuclear is crucial for deep 
decarbonisation of the electricity system. However, integrating these technologies is not without challenges. Nuclear 
plants pose risks such as radiation leaks, while renewables are dependent on the forces of nature and have variable 
generation. Effective supply-side management strategies are required to overcome these challenges and achieve 
carbon neutrality by 2040. This paper presents two scenarios developed to study the effectiveness of supply-side 
solutions in a transitioning electricity system. We have considered Karnataka electricity system ( a state in India) as a 
base case which is rich in solar, wind and hydro resources endowments. The two scenarios developed are 
KASTATUSQUO, which assumes the existing supply-mix will continue with new capacity additions during 2019-
2040 and, KARENNOTRADE, which assumes full retirement of coal-thermal capacity, zero electricity trade, and 
new capacity additions in renewable energy sources during 2019-2040. The model results suggest that phased 
retirement of existing thermal power plants and increased renewable capacity could achieve the goal. However, 
achieving a closed electricity system with no external transactions or inter-region electricity trade would require an 
additional investment of Rs. 1029 billion. KARENNOTRADE scenario is environmentally viable as there are no 
emissions.

Abstract 
In this research, the indicators that influence the calculation of the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of a 
cutting line in a manufacturing company were analyzed. The main objective was to examine the main causes that 
directly affect the increase in the production capacity of the line. The data collection regarding task performance, 
daily production, amount of nonconforming product and compliance with the daily program was categorized and 
standardized, in order to determine the construction of an interactive spreadsheet. The digital format included data 
recording, calculation of OEE indicators per machine and per product, frequency of events reported as downtime per 
day and per month, and also calculation of economic losses due to monthly inefficiency per product type. 
Subsequently, the results of the OEE calculations were checked and validated. Moreover, the results were graphed in 
order to visualize the behavior of the line. The results showed that the line presents a low OEE level of 65%, due to 
downtime per machine and per product, causing considerable economic losses. The causes of the inefficiency were 
mainly the lack of raw material and the problems with the gumming of the product. The factors that affected the 
OEE were non-conforming product rolls. Finally, it is concluded that the digital format designed for the OEE 
calculation is a successful tool for efficient decision-making in the organization, so it is recommended to implement 
it in other production lines and plants.

Abstract 
The recent health crisis had various effects on society in general, with education being the sector where there were 
severe transformations in the teaching-learning method. The degree/level of technological maturity of the students of 
the Bachelor of Industrial Engineering Administration of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León was studied. A 
survey was built with 15 items, where they were questioned about their degree of familiarity and specialization in the 
use of electronic devices, tools, and digital applications. The results obtained showed that 46% of the students used 
the cell phone for 5 hours or more and another 46% for 3 to 4 hours. While for educational or work purposes, 70% 
used it between 1 and 3 hours and 25% used it for more than 3 hours. Regarding knowledge about digital tools, 44% 
were considered at an intermediate level and 33% at an advanced intermediate level. At the beginning of the pandemic, 
70% of the students found it difficult to adapt to the new digital tools, despite the fact that 90% had the necessary 
equipment and means to use them. 47% of those surveyed had between 3 to 4 electronic devices at their disposal, 
while 39% had 1 to 2 devices. Therefore, 51% of the students considered themselves at an intermediate level of 
technological maturity, while 32% at an advanced intermediate level and only 14% at an advanced level. Finally, the 
level of technological maturity related to the adoption and use of new technologies, students are classified as techno-
optimists.

Abstract 
The steel industry is moving towards the implementation of Industry 4.0, in order to remain competitive in this 
globalized world, where cost reduction and greater interaction in the supply chain must be thought as a whole. This 
type of industry is usually done with different and complex processes, a part that manufactures steel and the other 
where the product is rolled. Due to this complexity and size there is a tendency to implement I4.0 in islands. 
To assess whether a particular company has the ability to implement enabling technologies for I4.0 or at what level 
of implementation it is, aptitude assessment and maturity assessment models are applied. Another return that can be 
obtained from some maturity assessment models is to be a guiding tool for the strategic planning of the 
implementation of I4.0. Having this in consideration, the present work aims to present maturity assessment models 
for the implementation of industry 4.0 and to evaluate and start a debate about its applicability in the steel industry. 
With this aim, eight models applied in several industries were studied and verified if, and/or how, they could be 
applied in the steel industry, due to its particular characteristics.

1. Introduction
From eighteenth to twentieth century the manufacturing industry had an important evolution, a fact that has a direct 
impact on the business models of the markets in which they operate (Yin,Y at all, 2017). In this period the industry 
has undergone several modifications, which have been given the name of Industrial Revolution. These revolutions 
have been called Industry 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. The end of one level and the beginning of another have been marked 
by great changes. And, according to companies, the gap between supply and demand was evolving and forcing the 
industry to develop from 1.0 to 4.0 (Yin,Y at all, 2017). 
Industry 4.0 is described as the fourth industrial revolution. It starts in 2010, when Germany decides to draw up a 
plan for its socio-economic growth over the decade. This plan aims to guide the country's evolution in the areas 
identified as of strategic interest, in order to become a global reference country. This fourth revolution is

The steel industry is considered a capital-intensive segment, in other words, that demand a large amount of capital 
for its operation. Another important feature is that this industry can be found all over the world and inserted in a 
global market. Developments to reduce costs and increase competitiveness are always in the portfolio of projects in 
this industry segment. 
 
In Brazil we can find several players, with different ages, some with Brazilian nationality and others with 
international owners, but all players inserted in the global market. For this reason, every player has to be up to date 
in terms of productivity, cost, business model, product, especially considering the different technologies used in 
terms of manufacturing and implementation date. 
 
With the objective of competitiveness, this industry needs to undergo modernization in some of the processes, with 
increased automation, digitization with sensors for process control, capture and analysis of process data, better 
connection between processes and, if possible, connection with suppliers and customers (supply chain). 
 
The I4.0 is a way to get expected results like above mentioned, with its different enabling technologies. 
As this kind of industry is the continuous process industry, the impacts of the implementation of I4.0 technologies 
should focus on improvements in the production process and the digital prioritize to increase the efficiency of the 
production process and improve business management. The implementation I4.0 through its Technological Clusters 
should be happen in the areas of reduction, steelworks and rolling mills and the main changes in terms of relations in 
the production chain, general organization of the company and organization of production. 
 
Considering all these characteristics and the models presented in this work, the first conclusion is that there is 
applicability for assessment models in this industry, because used some dimensions which can be applied in this 
industry. 
 
Taking in account the I4.0 implementation will be in the processes (and in islands), the dimensions to be considered 
in the assessment models are those related to technology rather than those related to the business model, commercial 
or supplier. 
 
Digitization dimension is considered the base to enable technologies I4.0 implantation. From this dimension met, 
even in isolated processes, the Manufacturing dimension (Production and Operations), with all technological 
maturity items, can be implemented. Both are the main dimensions in this industry. Of course, the Strategy 
dimension must be considered, once that it will take some time for all these technologies to become truly accessible. 
But the steel industry can prioritize critical, since high value to deploy all services can be a barrier of I4.0. 
 
Other dimensions could be applied but not I this time, because its dimension are related with suppliers or customers 
and, how this kind of industry is very big, involving many suppliers and customers, it is hard to have whole supply 
chain with I4.0 implemented. This work shows that the assessment models can be applied in steel industry, since to 
evaluate the stage of I4.0 implementation as to have the role to guide this implementation. The dimensions have to 
be defined in correct way as well as maturity levels. It is worth mentioning that the proposal presented represents an 
initial investigation of maturity assessment models for the implementation of I4.0 and its applicability in the steel 
industry. 
 
Finally, recommendations for future work basically consist of: promoting more detailed modelling studies and 
proposing a model structure more suitable for the industry segment proposed here for study.

Abstract 
Campus can be stressful. The transition away from home, the financial and academic pressure, 
conflicts with peers, and post-graduation planning can all contribute to stress among college 
students. When managing an increase in responsibilities and changes, many students might forget 
to contribute intentionally to their own self-care and well-being. Health and happiness go hand in 
hand. Since the body and mind are so connected, taking care of physical health is helpful for mental 
health. Making intentional healthy changes to our lifestyle can boost our wellness in meaningful ways. 
Good friends bring fun in the good times and support in the bad times. They share in your joys, 
celebrations, hardships, and sorrows, and help keep your happiness quotient and spirits high. Having 
meaningful connections with others significantly reduces stress, boosts self-confidence and a sense of 
belonging, and can even improve the immune system and physical health. Friends see, understand, and 
accept us for who we are. College is a time of immense personal growth. It’s also a time where you can 
make genuine best friends. We all know that the obligations that come with being a college student can 
be difficult, so it’s good to have a helping hand when you’re dealing with that exhausting research paper 
or are having a bad day. We all need someone to lean on from time to time. And, students who make an 
effort to form relationships in college are more likely to succeed academically and graduate on time. This 
paper highlights what makes a campus a happy campus and what the universities and Higher Education 
Institutes should do to make it a better place to study and work.

Abstract 
Survival and thrift in a globally competitive market strongly depend on the improvement of production quality while 
monitoring the pricing for grafting nurseries. Real-time monitoring of irrigation quality is a necessary yet cumbersome 
task for propagation facilities. Even for indoor facilities with automatic irrigation systems, this task remains 
bothersome due to the large greenhouses. The main goal of this paper is to propose an irrigation monitoring system to 
increase production productivity by minimizing the time workers spend on responding to irrigation monitoring calls. 
Here, a two-stage data-driven approach is proposed, where the traveling salesman model is implied on a reduced 
spatiotemporal network provided by Bayesian analysis to optimize workers routing for irrigation monitoring. The 
proposed approach is the final piece of a dynamic data-driven simulation-based optimization framework. The results 
over synthetic data demonstrate a potential reduction of 11.60% in traveled distance per worker per call.

1. Introduction
Survival and thrift in a global competitive market strongly depend on improvement of production quality while 
monitoring the pricing for grafting nurseries. Grafting, a technique that vegetatively joins the roots and the bottom 
portion of one plant (rootstock) and a tender shoot (scion) from the top portion of another plant, has become an 
imperative technique for intensive vegetable production due to providing greater yield, more desirable fruit properties, 
and higher resistant to pests (Lee et al. 2010). Grafting has been increasingly tapped worldwide for cultivation under 
adverse environs posing abiotic (e.g., low/high temperature, drought/flooding, heavy metal and nutrition) and biotic 
(e.g., soil borne pathogens, foliar pathogens, arthropods and weeds) stresses to vegetable crops, resulting in expansion 
of commercial production onto otherwise under-exploited lands (Louws et al. 2010). Compelled by the increase of 
organic production and restrictions on utilizing synthetic pesticides, grafting has become an even more useful tool to 
manage soil borne disease issues in grounds of environmental protection. 
Greater yield, as one of the most prominent characteristics of grafting, opens a fruitful domain for indoors agroindustry 
such as greenhouse productions. Greenhouses are Hi-Tech horticulture farms, where advanced technological 
infrastructure are employed to increase the production efficiency through constant monitoring. The use of 
computational systems and technology such as sensors in agricultural applications has become viable due to the 
continuous reduction in their prices (Serôdio 2001). Vegetable cultivation in greenhouses is one of the main branches 
of agriculture in which the production management must be more controlled, so that the values of a set of parameters 
have to be monitored and approximated to an ideal value.

Abstract 
Electric load forecasting, also known as Probabilistic Load Forecasting (PLF), has played a role in the electric power 
industry. Forecasting the electricity consumption in business is necessary for planning power system operations, 
stability, and energy trading. Many business entities, such as commercial airports, require electric load forecasting to 
meet service and regulatory needs. Therefore, forecasting is needed to become a reference in determining strategic 
management energy. This research aims to forecast the electricity consumption of Soekarno-Hatta International 
Airport using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. The study uses daily 
historical data collected from airport operator companies from 01 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 to build and 
evaluate the model's performance. The findings show that the SARIMA model (1,1,1)(0,1,1)7 has the best model 
accuracy with a MAPE of 4.62%. The study conclusions highlight the potential of the model to support energy 
management practices at Soekarno Hatta International Airport and other similar facilities.

1. Introduction
Electrical load forecasting, or Probabilistic Load Forecasting (PLF), has played a role in the electric power industry 
in the last few decades. The need for load forecasting in business is used as a basis for planning power system 
operations, revenue projections, tariff design, the stability of the entire power system, and energy trading. Apart from 
electric utilities, various business entities such as regulatory bodies, large industrial companies, and commercial 
companies have a need for electrical load forecasting (Hong & Fan, 2016; Tang et al., 2022). Moreover, accurately 
forecasting electricity loads in electricity generation and distribution systems can help better balance electricity 
production and demand (Gunawan & Huang, 2021). The dynamic nature of generating capacity and electricity 
consumption poses challenges due to the inability to store electricity. Synchronizing power generation with changes 
in electricity demand is crucial for maintaining a dynamic equilibrium. Failure to do so can impact the quality of 
electricity supply and potentially jeopardize the safety and stability of the power system (Hu et al., 2017). (Kang et 
al., 2017) research developed a basic model of airport energy specifically by including flight information, time, and 
outside temperature using the Piecewise Linear Regression Technique. Nevertheless, this study lacks the ability to 
fully capture the actual influence of passengers on airport demand. The association between passenger volume and 
the power demand of airports is anticipated to exhibit non-linearity. Airports require substantial electricity for 
fundamental operational necessities, such as conveyors and lighting, which remain consistent regardless of flight 
schedules. In addition, airport power data includes electricity demand for air-side buildings and all facilities, including 
parking lots and hotels. Soekarno-Hatta Airport currently only has historical records regarding the use of electricity 
loads, but does not yet have forecasts of electricity loads. Based on this background, airport management companies 
need an electric load forecasting model as a reference in carrying out strategies related to electrical equipment and 
airport operations. 
1.1 Objectives  
With the background that has been discussed previously, the purpose of this research is as follows. 
1.
Using forecasting methods, create a SARIMA model to estimate the airport's electrical consumption.
2.
Comparing the performance of the performance models used.

The following process is forecasting using the model for the following several periods, where the forecast results are 
compared with the previously prepared Test Data to measure the accuracy of the forecasting model. As a result, the 
model has an accuracy of MAE 31.37, RMSE 38.59, and MAPE 4.62%. A comparison plot of the forecasting model 
with Test Data is shown in Figure 13.

5.3 Discussion 
Because the data has a complex pattern, there may be more than one seasonal effect in the data used. Furthermore, 
there are various environmental factors, such as temperature, day type, and occupancy, which contribute to the 
dynamic nature of the airport electricity consumption model. The current time series model employed in this study 
exhibits limitations in effectively capturing extreme values. Future research endeavors could address this limitation 
by incorporating interventions in time series analysis, such as the inclusion of exogenous factors in Seasonal Auto-
Regressive Integrated Moving Averages models. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research introduces an ARIMA model that including the seasonal patterns of the time series called Seasonal 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). The model was applied to analyze the daily electrical 
consumption data of Soekarno Hatta International Airport (CGK), a seasonal SARIMA (1, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1)7 model is 
built with MAPE 4.62%. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model exhibited a good fit to the data, effectively 
capturing the stochastic seasonal fluctuations with the exception of a few extreme values. The predictions derived 
from this model suggest a gradual increase in electricity consumption for the upcoming month, aligning with the 
observed weekly seasonal patterns. This changing trend could be a recommendation for airport management to make 
proper energy and financial management strategies in response to electricity demand.

Abstract 
To survive in today's increasingly stringent manufacturing market, every business must strengthen its production 
quality control. PT. PHI is a manufacturer specialized in offset printing and packaging, and one of its products is the 
duplex cardboard AA duplex carton packaging. The objective of this study was to reduce the occurrence of the most 
frequently recurring types of defect and improve production quality using the six-sigma method through the DMAIC 
stages (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) and in the improve stage using multiple tools from the seven 
new quality tools method to recommend improvement proposals. Based on the outcomes of data analysis and 
processing, the three most common forms of defect are 58.9% unclean ink, 17.3% pond tilt, and 12.6% spot faults. 
The calculation yielded Cp values of 0.84, CpK values of 0.60, DPMO values of 5861.14, and sigma level values of 
4.02. After doing FMEA analysis and implementing seven new quality tools, it was determined that the biggest causal 
variables for each type of defect were associated with subpar production machine parts. The recommended changes 
are routine maintenance of industrial machinery, increased monitoring of production, and enhancements to standard 
operating procedures.

1. Introduction
In order to maintain customer satisfaction and remain competitive, manufacturing companies must maintain the 
quality of their final products during production (Limanjaya et al., 2015). Good quality finished goods are contingent 
on the company's quality control procedures. Good product quality is determined by the compatibility of design 
specification standards with the functions and purposes of the product itself, allowing companies to produce quality 
products that satisfy market demands (Besterfield, 1994). However, the occurrence of product defects, which can be 
caused by a number of human, machine, method, material, and environmental factors, is a common issue in the 
implementation of quality control (Kotler & Keller, 2016). PT. PHI is an offset printing and packaging company that 
produces food packaging made primarily from duplex cardboard. One of the company's products is duplex cardboard 
packaging for AA products, which is made from duplex cardboard, which can be seen in Figure 1 below.

Control, can oversee the process of implementing proposed enhancements in accordance with the approved project 
charter. PT. PHI can measure the P control chart criteria, Cp and CpK process capabilities, DPMO (Defects per Million 
Opportunities), and production sigma levels to determine the effect of proposed improvements on the increase in 
production quality of duplex cardboard packaging for AA product. 
 
6. Conclusion 
After conducting research and processing data, several conclusions can be drawn, including the fact that, based on 
observations, there are six categories of defects, with unclean ink accounting for 58.9%, pond tilting accounting for 
17.3%, and freckle defects accounting for 12.6%. Process capability calculations determined that production control 
was inadequate, with a DPMO value of 5861 units and a sigma level of 4.02. The results of the analyze phase indicate 
that there are primary factors, with the most common defect problems being associated with suboptimal production 
machine tools. On the basis of the results of the improve stage analysis using the seven new quality tools method, it 
can be concluded that the proposal to increase the production quality of duplex cardboard packaging for AA products 
is based on priority levels, namely the ability to create SOPs for quality inspection of pond knives, preventive 
maintenance check sheets, SOPs and checklists for incoming material quality, and product quality reports, and also 
implement quality report meeting.

Abstract 
This study develops and solves a bi-objective optimization model for an inbound assembly inventory routing problem 
(IRP), considering carbon emission control, stochastic supply failure risks, and uncertainty in customer demand. An 
assembly plant needs three different components to assemble a product based on a particular bill of materials (BOM). 
These components are outsourced from various geographically dispersed suppliers. A depot provides light, medium, 
and heavy-duty vehicles to pick up product components from these suppliers during a particular period. The first 
objective function of the mixed-integer nonlinear model is to minimize the total IRP network cost. The second 
objective function is to reduce the total carbon emission. The model also considers constraints to achieve a minimum 
service level in each period and avert purchasing from high-risk suppliers. The best near-optimal Pareto fronts of 
problem instances are obtained using a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (HNSGA-II). The best near-
optimal Pareto solution is determined using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. The impacts of 
different vehicle fleet types on the inbound IRP network's performance are also investigated. Finally, the sensitivities 
of important time-varying parameters are reported using a full factorial-designed experiment, and several insights and 
recommendations are provided.

1. Introduction
The ability to better concentrate on core capabilities and cost savings are some benefits that drive manufacturing 
assembly plants to outsource product components from various suppliers. These suppliers may be subject to supply 
failure risks (SFR). A 'unique' supply failure event (e.g., workers' strike in a company, machine breakdown in a 
company's workshop, industrial fire) causes the failure of an individual supplier (Bagul and Mukherjee 2022). 
Geographically dispersed suppliers typically experience failure due to 'unique' events (Torabi et al. 2015). In addition, 
an assembly plant can face uncertainty in demand for assembled products. Thus, an assembly plant must consider 
risks and uncertainty while planning to satisfy customer demands. Supply chain coordination helps manage risk and 
uncertainty (Arshinder et al. 2008). Furthermore, an assembly plant also manages the transportation of product 
components. Therefore, an assembly plant may also need to control carbon emissions. Zissis et al. (2018) emphasized 
emission control through supply chain coordination. 
A typical inbound assembly supply network comprises an assembly plant and multiple suppliers. In such an inbound 
supply network, joint decision-making for inventory management and vehicle routing [IRP; Coelho et al. 2014] can 
result in optimal vehicle routes, higher customer satisfaction, and a lower total network cost (
)
TNC . A feasible 
solution in a specific period for a typical inbound assembly IRP is depicted in Figure 1. The assembly plant needs 
three types of components to assemble one product unit. Multiple geographically dispersed suppliers provide these 
components. The depot is situated close to the plant. In Figure 1, one light-duty vehicle (LDV), one medium-duty 
vehicle (MDV), and one heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) are provided by the depot to pick up necessary components from 
suppliers 2, 3, 4, 5, and S . The plant takes inventory and routing decisions (Chitsaz et al. 2020).

emission control, product assembly, uncertainty in customer demand, and a minimum service level constraint. The 
model was solved using a HNSGA-II. Moreover, the impacts of different vehicle fleet types on the inbound IRP

A near-optimal solution scenario indicated that LDV and MDV are used more frequently for product 
component collection. 
(ii) 
A heterogeneous vehicle fleet should be used if the priority is to reduce the total network cost. 
(iii) 
If the priority is to reduce carbon emissions, a homogeneous fleet of MDVs is recommended. 
(iv) 
Carbon emissions and network costs can be reduced in a scenario of low demand variation or high supply 
risks. 
(v) 
The performance of the inbound IRP network is insensitive to variations in the travel cost per unit distance. 
 
Moreover, the following are some important future research directions: 
(i) 
Verify the applicability of the proposed model using real-life case studies.    
(ii) 
Develop and verify a robust decision-making framework under the uncertainty of several parameters (e.g., 
demand, fuel price, vehicle travel cost per unit distance, base prices of product components).

Abstract 
COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus is related to the upper 
respiratory tract family of disorders. It triggers asthma, severe respiratory diseases, cause lung infection and 
bronchiolitis infections. Though the severity of these infections are getting obsolete but may remain in the mild forms 
of waves in our lives. A thorough study about its spread across the globe, its prediction and understanding the 
transmission patterns, through various statistical models might be one of the effective ways to provide an insight to 
various aspects of the disease and suggest prevention strategies. In the light of this, Auto Regression (AR) models are 
developed for the confirmed cases with 5 days lag, in 6 different states of India. The data has been trained from July 
2020 to July 2023 taking into account the three most impactful corona waves. August 2022 data has been used for 
testing & validating the models. Based on the population size and total number of confirmed cases the Indian states 
have been classified into three categories: Most affected, moderately affected & least affected states. Two states have 
been selected in each of these categories for the purpose of research study here. Auto Regression models are developed 
for the purpose of prediction in each of the states for all the 3 waves. Finally, the prediction of fourth wave is done for 
the month of July 2022 by using the third wave AR models. The results varies from state to state for each AR model.

1. Introduction
A new contagious disease was first discovered in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 known as corona virus infectious 
disease or Covid 19. In India, the first confirmed case was identified in the state of Kerala on 30th January 2020. The 
common symptoms observed in the disease are fever, cold, throat pain, tiredness and difficult breathing. It triggers 
asthma, severe respiratory diseases, cause lung infection and bronchiolitis infections. The governments and medical 
practitioners across the globe tried to control the pandemic situation by imposing quarantine restrictions like social 
distancing, wearing mask and travelling restrictions etc, but still the virus took the shape of a pandemic and was spread 
in the whole world in the form of different waves that caused a huge loss of human lives. Though the severity of these 
infections are getting obsolete with time but its impact may remain in the mild forms of waves in our lives.    
The researchers across the world are trying their level best to address the situation in their own best possible ways so 
that the future doesn’t see this kind of pandemic anymore. Mathematical Modelling could also be proved as one of

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The above numerical results and graphical results can be further improved with the help of different lags and also 
finding the error polynomials. The analysis of the same implies that the linear multiple auto regression model is not 
enough to cover the variability of the data. Further plan is to look at the possibility of using ANN to extract the non-
linearity between the data if it exists. In continuation, plan is there to execute an hybrid model to capture the linear 
and non-linear parts of the data. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The AR models are developed by bifurcating the data into three waves for each state i.e. From 1st July 2020 to 31st 
December 2020 data considered as first wave, 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 data as second wave and 1st 
January 2022 to 31st July 2022 data as third wave. These models are trained for 85% , 94%, 87% of the data for first, 
second and third wave respectively and tested for 15%, 6% & 13% of the data for each wave in order. Further, the 
models are used for prediction of COVID confirmed cases for the month of July 2022 in six identified states of India. 
The results show that the error is more in the models created for first & second waves of each state whereas the errors 
reduces when it comes to the prediction of third wave with a correlation of 0.87. Hence it is expected that the 
development of ANN models might work better for the cases where the error is more. Also, it is suggested that a 
hybrid model approach where AR models taking linearity into account integrated with ANN models to capture the 
non-linearity in data can be developed. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 This study identifies the most affected, moderately affected & least affected states of India and choose 2 states 
(Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya as least affected states, Punjab & Jammu-Kashmir as moderately affected states, 
Gujarat & Uttar Pradesh as most affected states) of India in each category for further analysis. Auto Regression models 
are developed for each state under each category for all the three waves. Further the confirmed cases for fourth COVID 
wave are predicted using these models for the fourth wave. The results obtained are moderate and needs some finer 
tuning or maybe a different approach for better prediction.

Abstract 
A&D Technology designs and produces hardware systems with software integration for data acquisition and control 
applications. Every system manufactured at A&D undergoes a manufacturing validation process known as a Checkout. 
To maintain a competitive advantage in industry, A&D conducts continuous improvement projects, following their 
ISO mindset at a cultural level. This paper will discuss an ongoing Lean Six Sigma project in which the A&D 
manufacturing validation process is being improved, following the DMAIC framework with a heavy focus on the 
Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Data from the past two years of projects will be analyzed and new tools and standards will 
be created to improve the validation process of supplier hardware that has been installed in A&D manufactured 
systems.

1. Introduction
To maintain a competitive advantage in industry, companies need to continue identifying and improving processes. 
The process of interest here is manufacturing validation. Manufacturing validation is critical to conducting quality 
control on manufactured systems prior to shipping products to end users. This can reduce or eliminate problems 
experienced by the end user when utilizing the systems purchased. Some companies implement quality control on a 
batch of products while others implement quality control on every product. Frequency is dependent on product and 
manufacturer. A&D Technology has a manufacturing validation process that is conducted on every system prior to 
being shipped to an end user. It is important that this manufacturing validation process be as efficient as possible and 
improved whenever possible. 
1.1 Background 
At A&D Technology, the Application Engineering (AE) team is responsible for developing and implementing 
application code. iTest is the proprietary software A&D sells for data acquisition and control applications. The 
application code the AE team is responsible for is written in iTest’s native coding language known as VCL. Part of 
the implementation process of projects sold by A&D is integrating iTest application code with hardware. This 
hardware is assembled by A&D manufacturing and validated in house by the AE team. The validation process is 
referred to as a Checkout. 
The most common hardware that is assembled into systems created by A&D Technology is supplied by Gantner 
Instruments. In 2018, Gantner released a new line of hardware modules known as X.Series, which was created as an 
eXtended version of the Q.Series, originally released in 2009. Upon the release of this new hardware line, A&D did a 
sudden transition to using the new hardware to maintain a competitive advantage in the industry by using the latest 
technology in their assembled systems. This sudden transition resulted in a significant learning curve that the A&D 
AE team had to navigate to transition from Q.Series to X.Series. The general notion felt by the AE team was that 
checkout timing increased upon the shift to this new hardware line.

6. Conclusion 
This continuous improvement project was sparked by a general notion amongst the members of the AE team at A&D 
Technology that checkout times were increased due to the release of the new Gantner X.Series product line. Three 
phases of this continuous improvement project have been enacted to solidify the process on the A&D side and gather 
data to see if there was any truth to this feeling. After reviewing the data, it was determined that it was impossible to 
tell if checkout times were increased based on how inconsistent checkout times were. The first step needed to be to 
improve consistency of checkout times. 
 
Phase four is the next step in improving the checkout process, which will be to implement Gantner’s module template 
feature of GI.Bench along with an SOP of how to apply the templates. Phase five has also already been planned and 
will be implemented upon completion of phase four. Phase five will be development of a connecting adapter for quick 
interchange between modules; thus, reducing the transition time between verification of each module. 
 
This project came to fruition after the release of the new Gantner X.Series product line. Therefore, another future 
improvement phase could be to brainstorm and develop improvements on reducing the learning curve of future new 
product or hardware launches.

Abstract 
Working as a flight attendant involves significant risks. In this study, JACK Siemens ergonomic tool was used to 
assess and evaluate the L4/L5 spinal forces associated with pushing and pulling a service trolley. Xsens motion 
tracking system was used in conjunction with Unity 3D and an Oculus Rift to create a virtual environment of an 
aircraft. This study revealed that several individual factors, such as body weight and height, had strong correlations 
with compressive spinal force, as did hip and back flexion. These findings have important implications for developing 
training programs aimed at reducing the risk of lower back injuries in flight attendants who perform this task on a 
regular basis.

1. Introduction
Flight attendants have one of the highest jobs, both in terms of elevation and rate of injury. Nearly 5,000 nonfatal 
workplace illnesses and injuries were reported in 2019 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2019). Also, about 13% of 
flight attendants are injured annually, roughly 13,500 per year. Out of that 13% that got injured, 58% were a 
musculoskeletal injury involving the neck, back, or shoulders, with the largest group injured being flight attendants 
with 4-6 years of experience. Since being a flight attendant is a very dynamic job, many different things can happen 
while at work, and all have associated risk factors. The most common causative factors for back injuries are, in order 
of prevalence, turbulence, taking luggage in and out of the overhead bins, pushing and pulling the service trolley, and 
opening and closing the airstair door (US Department of Labor 2023). Moreover, poor ergonomic form used across 
many repetitions of each task is believed to be another major factor in the rate of injury (Cobb et al. 2012; Lombardo, 
2016). As a flight attendant to get the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, they need a month of 
training, but training time may differ for each airline. At this time, flight attendants are required to pass a medical 
exam that is comprised of an eye exam, blood work, ear and sinus exam, and a drug screening. However, there is no 
medical standard for musculoskeletal disorder prevention or a required medical exam to see if they are predisposed 
(US Department of Labor 2023). Help for the injury only happens after the fact, with nothing aside from the initial 
training as a form of injury prevention. 
Currently, virtual reality has been used in many industries, varying from medicine (Mathew 2019) to practice surgeries 
(Desselle et al. 2020) and rehabilitation (Rutkowski et al. 2020), sports (Li et al. 2021) for ergonomic analysis and 
optimization (Zhao and Follmer 2018), warehouse work for injury prevention (Azizi et al. 2018), and even the judicial 
system for virtual court hearings (Munro and Riel 2021). With this level of success in other fields, it can reasonably 
be applied to flight attendant injury prevention.  
Hands-on training for potentially dangerous workplace scenarios, such as dealing with complex or heavy objects, can 
pose risks. Flight attendants may be prone to injuries while learning to perform their tasks, and problems can also arise 
from prolonged use of improper form. To mitigate these risks, virtual reality could be used to provide pre-training for 
flight attendants, using virtual instructors who can offer feedback on form (Buttussi and Chittaro 2021). However, it

The analyzed data revealed a direct and positive relationship between body weight and compressive force, as well as 
between body height and compressive force, which is consistent with the results in (Ji et al. 2023). It directly leads to 
the compressive forces observed in male subjects were higher than those in female subjects, due to the significant 
difference of body weight and body height between genders in this study. The study also observed a significant 
negative correlation between trunk and hip flexion during the routine pushing and pulling tasks, which confirms the 
findings of a previous study by Ji et al. (2022). Anatomically, higher hip flexion during pushing and pulling motions 
may minimize trunk flexion and reduce the risk of injury (Argubi-Wollesen et al. 2017). This observation provides a 
clear explanation for the higher compressive force applied to the back during the push task compared to the pull task. 
The subjects tended to exhibit greater trunk flexion when pushing, which contributed to the larger compressive force 
applied to the back. In contrast, during the pull task, the subjects tended to have more extension, resulting in a lower 
compressive force applied to the back (Kluger et al. 2014). Hence, to use the whole body when pushing and pulling 
would be another way to minimize the trunk flexion. 
 
This study found a moderate and negative relationship between body weight and trunk flexion, suggesting that 
individuals with higher body weights tend to have lower levels of trunk flexion (Gilleard and Smith 2006). However, 
despite reduced trunk flexion, individuals with higher body weights may still experience high compressive forces on 
the lumbar spine due to the weight of their upper body. Therefore, anthropometric variables, such as body weight and 
height, play a critical role in minimizing the risk of injury when pushing and pulling food trolleys. Additionally, it is 
recommended to engage the entire body, rather than just the trunk, when performing these tasks to distribute the forces 
more evenly and reduce the strain on any one area of the body. 
 
In this study, 150N force was used for both hands when measuring the compressive and A/P shear forces using JACK 
Siemens ergonomic software. This value was obtained from the Health and Safety Executive (2023) during a push/pull 
risk assessment for stopping or starting a load for safety purposes. To estimate the appropriate amount of force required 
to lift an object, it is generally assumed that 10N of force is needed to lift one kilogram. If we assume a friction 
coefficient of 1.0, then an object that is being handled should weigh around 15 kg to ensure safe pushing. However, a 
new article on aircraft catering trolleys revealed that a fully loaded meal trolley can weigh up to 100kg, far exceeding 
the established safety threshold (Harbison 2020). Handling such a heavy cart puts flight attendants at risk of injury. 
Therefore, it is recommended that design modifications be made to these trolleys to reduce their weight, making them 
more ergonomically friendly while still being able to fulfill their intended purpose. 
 
This study utilized the Xsens motion tracking system, the JACK Siemens ergonomics tool, Unity 3D, and an Oculus 
Rift to assess L4/L5 spinal forces. Correlations between individual factors such as body weight and height and 
compressive force were identified, indicating that as these factors increase, so does the compressive force. This makes 
taller and/or larger individuals more susceptible to injury. Additionally, a strong negative correlation between hip and 
trunk flexion was discovered. These variables should be considered when training new flight attendants to make them 
aware of factors that contribute to the likelihood of injury. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The findings of the study will be helpful in developing interventions or training programs aimed at reducing the risk 
of lower back injuries in aircraft attendants who perform this task regularly. To validate the accuracy of performing 
tasks in a virtual environment, the same task should be ideally completed in an actual airplane. Furthermore, recruiting 
more volunteers who have worked or currently work in the aviation industry can aid in identifying any discrepancies 
between experienced and inexperienced subjects.

Abstract 
This study investigates the functional equivalency of various random number generation (RNG) models for the PERT 
(Program Evaluation and Review Technique)-beta distribution in Monte Carlo project risk simulations. The existing 
project management literature contains multiple PERT-beta RNG models, which are often used interchangeably under 
the assumption that they possess a level of functional equivalency. Our study highlights that this assumption may be 
inaccurate, leading to potential model selection errors when analysts apply a PERT-beta model without a thorough 
understanding of its unique statistical properties. Our study makes three contributions to the field of project risk 
simulation. First, we identify seven widely used PERT-beta RNG models prevalent in the project management 
literature and specialized simulation software (e.g., @Risk and Crystal Ball). Second, we conduct a comparative 
experiment to characterize the stochastic behaviors of each model. Finally, we propose and test a hypothesis on the 
functional equivalency of these alternative PERT-beta RNG models, employing both parametric and empirical 
approaches. Both researchers and practitioners stand to gain from these insights, as they facilitate the prevention of 
model selection errors and mitigate confusion stemming from latent algorithmic discrepancies among the alternative 
PERT-beta models.

Abstract 
The logistics component of every effective supply chain must be the focus to guarantee the timely, safe, and 
uninterrupted delivery of finished goods to clients. For the finished goods to leave the company's facilities as soon as 
manufacturing is complete and arrive at a specified destination as quickly as feasible, the outbound logistics system 
must operate effectively. Adequate outbound logistics guarantees that demand is satisfied at the destination on time 
and in full, leading to increased sales and ultimately fostering consumer loyalty and satisfaction. Unfortunately, a 
noticeable amount of time loss has been observed in the food factory outbound logistics, mainly the waiting time for 
the truck-loading process. This project aims to analyze and minimize the outbound logistics time. It is a valuable 
opportunity to improve the truck loading process to reduce the negative effect of losing the company's sales and 
goodwill with customers. This project follows the A3 methodology to analyze the current situation and reduce the 
related time waste by using Lean tools to identify waste components and find potential areas for development. After 
data analysis, five suggested solutions were revealed to improve processes and decrease related waste. The paging 
system solution was chosen because it satisfied the food factory waiting time goal, requirements, specifications, and 
constraints. This project has shown a noticeable improvement by reducing the waiting time before truck loading in 
the business-to-business warehouse by 48.18% and retail warehouse by 8.11%. Finally, emotional intelligence 
recommendations were suggested to improve employee's well-being and reduce their occupational stress.

1. Introduction
The outbound logistics process of the food company involves moving and storing goods from the end of the production 
line to the customer. The trucks arrive at the gate, go through the gate clearance process, and then queue up randomly 
based on the space available to load the packs. When the trucks reach the loading area, the warehouse employee will 
check if their shipment is ready based on SKU availability and shipment urgency. If the order is ready, the truck 
loading activity will start, if not, they will leave the area and either park in the parking lane or queue up again. The 
checkout is completed upon receipt of the invoice. A noticeable waiting time has been observed in the food factory. 
The waiting time is a non-value-added waste in the system, and corrective actions must be taken. The number of trucks 
waiting inside the factory cannot be controlled due to the third-party logistics company sending them whenever they 
are free and available, the regulations of Saudi traffic police, and the absence of truck drivers at the loading area. The 
reasons for the delay and absence of the truck drivers include lack of sleep, lack of respect from others, and low forklift 
drivers' morale and sense of doing the job. The food factory primary goal is to decrease the time needed for outbound 
logistics to other businesses and retailers, particularly the time spent waiting for the truck-loading process. To achieve 
this, the company should consider the permissible times for trucks entering and exiting Jeddah city.

weighing with server time of [Random. Triangular (2,4,5)] minutes. After that the trucks will queue to reach the 
loading area, however some trucks arrive at the loading area and their orders are not ready yet, so they queue in the 
line from the start. The percentage of trucks which their order was not ready at the warehouse was calculated from the 
provided Excel sheet by this formula 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  × 100, while the percentage of trucks which their 
order was ready at the warehouse was calculated as [1 −ቀ

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  × 100ቁ], the percentages was 
calculated for both FPD and RTL trucks. Then there is the truck loading combiner that have capacity of serving 2 
trucks at a time with 4 forklifts utilized at each loading area. Each truck is loaded with 25 packs of foodstuffs and the 
loading process is done by 2 forklifts per truck. After loading will be the truck weighing and gate checkout which both 
have processing time of [Random. Triangular (2,4,5)]. 
 
Paging System 
In the paganing system model is shown in the Figure (8), the trucks will wait only one time in the queue. Unlike the 
base model where the trucks are arriving to the loading area based on first come first reaching to the loading area. 
Then the trucks are facing a problem when the order is not ready, so the trucks will queue at the beginning of the line. 
However, in this alternative model, the trucks will wait for one time only, because the truck driver will not go to the 
loading area unless he receives a message from the paging unit that the order is ready. Also, the waiting time was 
reduced by 10 minutes which is the time assumed to be lost in the base model when the forklifts needed to go to call 
the truck drivers to come to the loading area.

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this project worked to improve the logistical processes in the food factory, focusing on the outbound 
logistical process. The problem related to the current situation have been identified in this project previously. The 
current situation was analyzed using the A3 methodology. Additionally, alternative solutions to this current problem 
have also been proposed and evaluated. Accordingly, the most effective solution was selected, which was the paging 
systems solution, since it met the food factory waiting time goal, requirements, specifications, and constraints. The 
team achieved the customer requirements, including ease of implementation, reduction of waiting and turnaround 
time, maintainability, and testing before submission. The project objectives, including analyzing the outbound 
logistics process, identifying solutions, reducing truck turnaround time, and enhancing emotional intelligence, were 
also achieved. The project solved the problem statement by improving the truck loading process and reducing waiting 
and turnaround time. The team recommends improving communication and establishing a schedule among the food 
factory and third-party companies, organizing training sessions for truck drivers, and conducting a feasibility study.

Design of Assessment of Customer Order Acceptance Using 
Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Method in Companies 
Using Make-To-Order Systems

Abstract 
The production system in the manufacturing industry is divided into two types, namely the Make-to-stock (MTS) and 
Make-to-order (MTO) strategies which are distinguished by the time orders are received and the execution of the 
production process. In the MTO system, the customer's order becomes a trigger for the next process and becomes a 
critical point of the system. The decision to accept and reject incoming orders is the most important activity because 
it will have a long-term impact on the overall profitability and reputation of the company. This activity is a very 
strategic action, so support is needed in this activity. This study investigates how the method of receiving orders in 
the MTO strategy is carried out and designs an assessment of order acceptance using the Multiple Criteria Decision 
Analysis method so that it can be used as a support in making orders for acceptance decisions. The AHP method was 
used in this study to obtain priority order criteria and risk probabilities of receiving orders with data obtained from 
expert interviews. The results of AHP show the order of importance in receiving orders, namely the availability of 
raw materials, prices, production capabilities, market situations, customers, targets, order fulfillment, and external 
conditions, also the probability of the risk occurring. Expected monetary value is calculated for each criterion and risk 
which is then used to help make the right decisions in accepting orders. The entire methodology in this study is 
explained by using cases in the steel coating industry in Indonesia. The case study shows that EMV and AHP can be 
used to provide a feasibility assessment of orders received.

1. Introduction
Customer orders are what every company wants. Without orders from customers, it will be difficult for the company 
to get income. If there is no income, it means that production costs cannot be met and the company will not be able to 
survive. In companies that use the MTO system, planning to produce the final product begins when the customer's 
order is received by the company. Manufacturing of certain products does not start unless certain orders are released 
from customers (Rafiei and Rabbani, 2014). In an MTO system all supply chain tasks from procurement of materials, 
parts, and components, to fabrication, subassembly, and assembly, to final delivery, are triggered by the receipt of a 
customer order or award of a contract (Li and Womer, 2012). Therefore in the MTO system, the stage of receiving 
customer orders is very crucial because it will trigger the entire series of processes to fulfill customer requests. 
For a company that implements an MTO system, accepting a customer order will trigger a whole series of processes, 
an error in making a decision when receiving a customer order can be very fatal. The decision to accept and reject 
incoming orders is one of the most important decisions because it will have a long-term impact on the overall profits 
and reputation of the company (Piya, 2012). For this reason, various considerations are needed when making decisions 
to accept customer orders to achieve goals and minimize unwanted risks. The decision to accept an order is a very 
strategic business decision because it will have a direct or indirect impact on the continuity of the company's business. 
Thus, every decision made to achieve a goal must take into account various aspects of the risks and opportunities that 
may arise. Therefore, in selecting alternative decisions to be taken, a supporting method is needed that can be used by

In this flow, the following steps are taken: 
1. If when the order is received, raw materials are available in the warehouse, consideration of raw materials can be 
skipped and directly checks the allocation and production capacity. 
2. If raw materials are not available in the warehouse, then a raw material availability check is carried out at the raw 
material supplier. If the raw material is not available at the raw material supplier, then the order is immediately 
rejected. If raw materials are available at raw material suppliers, proceed to the stages of checking allocation and 
production capacity. 
3. If the production capacity is not available, then the order is rejected. 
4. If production capacity is available, then proceed with price negotiations. 
5. The price negotiation process still uses the ""Margin Calculator"" owned by the company. This price calculation still 
uses the old procedure, namely using a margin calculator which takes into account the cost of production, the minimum 
price, the selling price to consumers, and the expected margin. 
6. If the price submitted by the consumer cannot be agreed upon and will be detrimental to the company, then the 
order is rejected. However, if the order can still provide a margin, a risk calculation is performed. 
7. The calculation of this risk value is carried out to assess whether the expected margin can still cover the amount of 
risk that may occur. The risk calculation uses the EMV value as a contingency fee for the risk of orders received. If 
the EMV value is positive then the order can be accepted by the company. If the EMV is negative, then a renegotiation 
will be carried out on the price submitted. If after renegotiation a price cannot be agreed upon that covers the risk 
value, then the order should be rejected. 
This recommendation for accepting customer orders does not eliminate or replace the price calculation method that is 
already running in the company. This method adds risk calculation as an additional assessment criterion in accepting 
customer orders. The price given to consumers is calculated by the level of risk, using EMV. If the price is still not 
acceptable, proceed with price renegotiation with the customer. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Even though the target of the company is to make a profit, the price factor is not a major factor in the decision to 
accept customer orders. The most dominant consideration factor for the company when receiving an order is the aspect 
of availability of raw materials. In the AHP calculation that has been carried out, the raw material criteria have the 
highest weight of 17.20%. While the price criterion ranks second with a weight value of 14.26%. Therefore in making 
decisions when receiving customer orders, the first thing to consider is the availability of raw materials and then the 
price factor. Other consideration factors then follow, such as production capability and allocation, market conditions, 
consumer conditions, target fulfillment, order fulfillment, and external conditions. 
 
Calculation of risk by using EMV can be done to calculate the risk of orders received even though the value of the 
expected marginal profit by the company is different from the risk value calculated by EMV. This EMV calculation 
does not replace the price calculation carried out by the company, but this EMV calculation can be used as a tool to 
complete the assessment of the feasibility of the price of the order to be received. 
 
To reduce the risk of incoming orders, a new customer order acceptance flow recommendation has been made. The 
company should try to implement this flow and set EMV standards/limits for orders received. Therefore it can be 
easier to evaluate incoming customer orders. Measuring the performance of evaluating customer order acceptance 
with EMV can be carried out again or periodically after the proposed strategy has been successfully implemented by 
the company. This is useful to see whether the proposed improvements that have been implemented can improve the 
company's performance in terms of receiving customer orders or not. Suggestions for improvements to weight, 
opportunity, and impact on EMV calculations can be made by looking at the existing conditions to continue to get 
better EMV calculation results. Recommendations for further research can be carried out, especially in other industries 
that implement MTO to obtain a comparison of the results of EMV assessment performance and also continuous 
improvement for companies in industries that implement the MTO system.

Abstract 
In this paper, we describe a conceptual product design approach based on variational 3D models, parametric 
optimization, and rapid prototyping for facilitating the exploration of the solution space for a design problem. We 
demonstrate the proposed strategy through a case study on the design of an ophthalmic instrument. A template 3D 
model was manually created and fed to a parametric optimization tool to automatically generate design alternatives 
based on a set of criteria, which were then exported for 3D printing and testing in both dry and wet lab environments. 
Our results show that the method facilitates parallel prototyping and enables the exploration of a wider range of 
solutions more quickly and efficiently, particularly in highly constrained scenarios, but it requires designers to think 
of the initial models as families of solutions.

1. Introduction
Human-machine collaboration technologies have consistently been leveraged to enhance the various stages of the 
design process, including ideation and concept evaluation (Camburn et al., 2020-1; Camburn et al., 2020-2; Yuan and 
Moghaddam, 2020). Advanced Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and rapid prototyping tools, in particular, are being 
introduced earlier into the engineering design process (Marion and Fixson, 2019) to allow designers to create physical 
models and validate concepts quickly and easily.  
Parametric CAD is a widely adopted computer-aided design technology where 3D models are controlled by 
parameters, which define relationships between different parts of the geometry. Parametric modeling enables the 
integration of design intent and facilitates model updates by eliminating the need to manually recreate a model every 
time a dimension changes. If the model is structured and built correctly, when a particular parameter is modified, all

This project makes a unique contribution to conceptual product development by laying out a method in which many 
unique variations can be automatically generated and produced from a single model, facilitating the exploration of 
the solution space for prototyping and testing. While generative design and other non-parametric approaches are 
becoming increasingly common in product design, at present these strategies often produce forms that are irregular 
and organic in shape, which can be difficult or even impossible to manufacture using traditional manufacturing 
processes. Other methods appear to be better suited for generating aesthetic variations. Our approach is focused on 
functional solutions for engineering design. 
 
The proposed method was validated through the design, prototyping, and testing of a novel ophthalmic instrument. 
Rather than modeling variations of the same idea individually, we were able to build a flexible and configurable 
model for each unique idea, and then use parametric optimization to generate variations within that unique idea, 
expanding the solution space. These variations were finally exported as 3D-print-ready files and sent for 3D printing 
in batches, to facilitate parallel prototyping and testing. 
 
In general, we found the proposed method to be effective and timesaving for our purpose. That said, the method is 
best suited for situations where physical prototyping is preferred over digital prototyping or simulation, especially 
where 3D printing is used. However, some aspects can still be effective in cases where simulation or digital 
prototyping is viable. Our method is also ideal for situations that require precision in the final design solution, such 
as this case of the surgical instrument design. 
 
Here we have described a conceptual product design approach based on variational 3D models, parametric 
optimization, and rapid prototyping which aims to facilitate the exploration of the solution space for a design problem. 
We carried out a case study on the design of an ophthalmic instrument to demonstrate the proposed strategy. We 
manually created a template 3D model which was then fed to a parametric optimization tool to automatically generate 
design alternatives based on a set of criteria. These models were then exported for 3D printing to create prototypes 
which were tested in both dry and wet lab environments. Our results show that the design approach facilitates parallel 
prototyping and enables the exploration of a wider range of solutions more quickly and efficiently than a traditional 
approach in which each design concept would have been modeled individually.

Abstract 
This research work sought to apply the Lean Manufacturing methodology, with the purpose of improving productivity 
in the finishing area of a rubber company. It has been observed that, in this area, there is a low productivity, due to an 
absence of a culture of order and cleanliness, and a lack of production control. The application of Lean tools showed 
a substantial increase in productivity (from 56.47% to 75.86%), this achieving a progress of 34.33% in the finishing 
area. In addition, in relation to efficiency, the use of average man-hours will be improved from 75.30% to 87.90%, 
resulting in an improvement of 16.74%. And, according to the efficacy, an increase was found in the quantities 
produced, on average, which went from a value of 74.99% to 86.3%, this resulting in an increase of 15.07% in the 
production of 3S 200 mm rings.

1. Introduction
The rubber industry is one of the main sources of natural rubber. This element is an indispensable raw material used 
for the manufacture of more than 40 thousand products (anti-slip flooring, surgical gloves, among others) in the 
medical device and automotive industries. In recent years, due to the increase in operating costs in rubber plantations, 
the low availability of labor, and unfavorable environmental conditions, as evidenced in global trends, the production 
of items using this raw supply have been affected. This results in an unfavorable impact to maintain, in a sustainable 
way, the productivity registered in the rubber industry (Rojas et al. 2017). 
At the national level, between 2015 and 2017, 63.3% of the companies engaged in the manufacture and 
commercialization of rubber and plastic products implemented some type of activity within their production processes. 
In detail, these were the following: (a) the purchase or rental of technological equipment (46.6%), such as machinery 
or transportation equipment; (b) the acquisition of programs (31.8%), which refers to obtaining some type of software 
or database; (c) the application of engineering tools (26.4%), such as Kanban or 5S (Instituto Nacional de Estadística 
e Informática 2017). 
Within this framework, the industrial rubber company currently has 28 years of experience in the field and is mainly 
engaged in the transformation and marketing of rubber for industrial, mining and construction use. In this sense, the 
3S 200 millimeters (mm) rings, a product designed for metric dimension pipes, represents a level of participation of 
up to 92% of the total sales of the business in recent years (Hules Peruanos S.A.C. 2021). In addition to this, the 
starting point was the fact that, in the finishing area of the company, an incorrect use of resources (time, movements 
or others), low productivity, incorrect use of man-hours (m-h), presence of obstacles in the access ways, lack of process 
standardization, disorganization and presence of dirt inside the area were identified. Therefore, these problems end up 
damaging the quality and production of the main product under study.  
To achieve the results of the research it is necessary to perform the following:

It can be said that after the presentation of the results for both situations (before and after) an average value of 25.48% 
was obtained before the implementation of the 5S tool, which after the implementation of the tool obtained a growth 
of 86.95%.

According to Figure 8 and Figure 9 we can reject the null hypothesis because it evidences that the productivity 
increases in a significant way. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Responding to the main objective of the research, it can be affirmed that after the correct implementation of the 5S 
and Kanban tool, productivity was improved because average results were obtained in relation to productivity where 
before the implementation was 56.47% and after the implementation a value of 75.16% was obtained; so there is a % 
improvement of 33.09% in the finishing area of a rubber company. 
 
Improvement actions within the finishing area included a culture of order and cleanliness through the 5S tool (classify, 
order, clean, standardize and discipline) and a greater control of production through the Kanban method, which 
allowed to increase the efficiency of man-hours (m-h) based on what was planned, where before the application of 
Lean tools, an average value of 75.30% was obtained and a value of 87.03% was obtained. In addition, an improvement 
percentage of 15.58% was achieved, which indicates an optimal use of the resources of the production personnel in 
the finishing area of the rubber company.

In the same way, for the efficacy dimension, which is related to the units or quantities produced over the quantities 
programmed in the six-month period, an average value of 74.99% was obtained for the dimension before the 
implementation and 86.35% after the implementation. Likewise, an improvement percentage of 15.15% was achieved, 
which represents an improvement in the total production of 3S 200 mm rings in the finishing area of the rubber 
company. It is recommended that this study on the use of Lean Manufacturing tools be replicated in companies in the 
same sector in order to increase productivity in their different areas.

Abstract 
Solving the one-dimensional cutting stock problem (1-D CSP) has been widely integrated in construction industry for 
better managing cutting reinforcement steel bars (rebars). To provide the required tensile strength to the structure, the 
structural designer determines the diameter sizes of rebars, which can be adjusted as long as the rebar to concrete area 
ratio remains constant. The decision-maker has the option to alter the diameter size to optimize cutting patterns, 
thereby reducing raw material usage. In our study, we address the cutting stock problem by considering not only the 
cutting patterns but also the diameter sizes, with the objective of minimizing raw material usage. Unlike the classical 
cutting stock problem, where the number of pieces to be cut is known in advance, in this case, the number of pieces 
is not known until the diameter sizes are selected. To tackle this challenge, we propose a solution that employs a 
pseudo-polynomial formulation. Our computational study shows that converting diameters could enhance the 1-D 
cutting stock problem's solution quality by up to 6%.

1. Introduction
The construction industry is a significant contributor to the global economy, with many countries relying on 
construction to account for a significant percentage of their GDP. Estimates suggest that the construction industry 
accounts for approximately 6% of the global economy (World Economic Forum, 2016), but its contribution is 
relatively more significant in the GDP of developing countries. In addition to its economic impact, the construction 
industry can also have a significant impact on the environment, with construction waste being a major issue. As a 
result, there is a growing need for cost reduction measures that also promote sustainability. Despite technological 
advancements and cost-saving measures, there is still considerable potential for further improvements in the 
construction industry through planning of construction activities. Such improvements could lead to both economic 
benefits, including cost reduction, and environmental benefits, such as a reduction in construction waste. 
Reinforcement steel bars, commonly referred to as rebars, are crucial components in the construction industry and 
provide tensile strength to the structures. Efficient utilization of reinforcement steel bars is vital for reducing the cost 
of building structures and conserving natural resources. Rebars are custom-cut to meet specific needs, and one-
dimensional cutting stock problem (1-D CSP) is often employed to cut rebars in an economical manner for utilization 
of raw materials. Suppose that there are m item types of rebars, each of them has length wj and demand dj, k different 
diameter sizes, and a sufficiently large number of stocks (j = 1, 2,...,m). The objective is to cut dj copies for each item 
type j using the minimum number of stocks so that the total length of items for each stock does not exceed the capacity.

5.Conclusion 
The construction industry has many improvement opportunities by leveraging Operations Research methodologies. 
One of the most significant cost components in construction is reinforcement steel bars. Although the 1-D CSP has 
been extensively studied in literature and can provide efficient cutting patterns for rebars, incorporating diameter 
convertibility into the decision-making process can lead to even better patterns and reduced trim loss. In this paper, 
we introduce a new problem in the construction industry that considers both diameter selection and cutting pattern 
generation. Our computational experiments, which utilize real data from construction projects, show that project 
properties such as item count and minimum length have a significant impact on solution quality. Additionally, we 
propose a solution approach that involves rounding up length sizes to reduce network size and increase the 
effectiveness of the reflect formulation in attacking the 1.5-D CSP. Our results demonstrate that incorporating diameter 
convertibility can lead to cost savings of up to 6% for the 1.5-D CSP.

Abstract 
This study focuses on production scheduling problems in metal pipe manufacturing, where customer orders differ in 
terms of type, thickness, and quantity. Each order is considered a job with a processing time that varies based on the 
machines involved in the production process. To produce the next job, there is a setup time required that depends on 
the machine, which is assigned to, and the current job being processed on that machine which is referred to as a job- 
and machine-sequence-dependent setup time. Since it is not possible to obtain an optimal solution for a large 
scheduling problem by using the mathematical programming approach, a heuristic method is a preferable choice to 
handle this. Therefore, this paper aims to illustrate the application of heuristics that features dispatching rules to solve 
the aforementioned scheduling problem through a numerical example. These rules, which explicitly consider the job- 
and machine-dependent setup time include the shortest job completion time, shortest job completion time based on 
the longest processing time, and shortest job completion time based on the earliest due date, and shortest job 
completion based on the minimum slack. A comparison regarding the effectiveness of these rules is also conducted. 
The results show that the shortest job completion time based on the minimum slack yields the best performance 
concerning the makespan and the second-best performance in terms of total tardiness. In addition, the shortest job 
completion time based on the earliest due date produces the best performance for both total tardiness and the number 
of tardy jobs.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, four heuristics are proposed to solve the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with the job- 
and machine-sequence-dependent setup time. Their effectiveness is evaluated according to three performance metrics, 
i.e., makespan, total tardiness, and the number of tardy jobs through a numerical example. The results indicate that
SC-Minslack is the most effective heuristic method for minimizing makespan, while SC-EDD provides the best
performance for both total tardiness and the number of tardy jobs. Although SC-LPT is the second-best heuristic
method for minimizing makespan, it produces the worst results for both total tardiness and the number of tardy jobs.
For future research, developing metaheuristic algorithms may be a promising avenue to obtain schedules that offer a
better trade-off among the three measures of performance.

Abstract 
The inventory system of repairable items is a managerial tool used to integrate all information concerning on-hand 
inventories and movements for new and repaired items. The paper describes developing a simulation model for 
managing the inventory of repairable items for a manufacturing system where faulty items are sent to a repair shop 
with uncertain failure rates, lead times, and repair times. The proposed model imitates processing and controlling the 
on-hand inventory of repaired items and replenishing the inventory of new items using the minimum/maximum 
ordering policy in a flexible and risk-free environment. We exhibit the appropriateness and effectiveness of the 
suggested simulation model using a demonstrative case problem. The developed model can be relied on as a tool for 
estimating healthy on-hand inventories of new and repaired items, downtime, and back-ordered items due to the 
unavailability of repaired items.

1. Introduction
Production systems are usually concerned with converting inputs such as raw materials, manpower, and processes 
into products or services that satisfy customer needs. The production systems' primary outputs are finished products 
or services, and the secondary output is degraded or failed items. This secondary output generates demand for 
maintenance. (Duffua and Raouf, 2015) 
Maintenance systems play a key role in achieving firms’ missions, strategic objectives in industries, and profit 
targets (Saeed Osman, 2016). Maintenance systems are responsible for maintaining, repairing, and overhauling 
mechanical items for production departments. Maintenance departments are also responsible for keeping a healthy 
stock of repaired and new spare parts in the inventory. They must conduct timely procurement of new spare parts 
and timely repair of repairable items. The timely repair that a production system requires is essential for continuing 
operations and avoiding lost productions. Maintenance systems need to manage their spare items demand and supply 
effectively and efficiently and manage the on-hand inventory of repaired items. 
Additionally, maintenance systems also take care of all faulty repairable items coming from production systems. The 
repairable items inventory management of a firm can be enhanced by overseeing its inventory level for both new 
and repaired items, the time required to undergo various processes involved in the procurement of new repairable 
items, and the repair of faulty repairable items.  
Firms face problems of managing repairable items inventory levels and having the correct inventory levels of both 
repaired and new spare parts at a low cost. Firms also face problems deciding the best ordering policy considering 
the uncertainty of repairable item failure and repair times. (Saeed Osman, 2022) 
This paper's primary focus is to address these problems by describing and developing a general simulation model for 
imitating the process of generating, processing, and repairing faulty repairable items. The model also mimics the 
procedures for requesting and procuring new repairable items using minimum/maximum inventory levels (smin-Smax) 
ordering policy and managing both the on-hand inventory of repaired and new repairable items. The smin-Smax policy 
is also a periodic strategy by which the inventory levels of repairable items in maintenance systems are checked 
every review period, which may also be every T days, weekly, or every T weeks. However, if the inventory level is 
below a specified value, an order is placed to bring the on-hand inventory to a preferred maximum level.

models for the illustrative case is HP laptop using Windows 10 and MAD Ryzen 5 with 2.1 GHz processor, 8 GB of 
RAM. The number of replications in the Arena simulation software is set at ten replications.  
In this graph shown in Figure 3 we can see that changes in the review period have a major effect on the number of 
backordered items and unavailability/downtime and a minor effect on the on-hand inventories and number of placed 
orders.  
Figure 3. Sensitivity Graph – Illustrative Example 
The results given in Table 3 and graphed in Figure 3 are valuable managerial insights provided into the complex 
inventory system of repairable items. These managerial insights are extremely important for achieving maintenance, 
repair, and overhaul organization's objectives, such as minimizing unavailability and backordered items, minimizing 
inventory costs, and maximizing service levels. 
6. Conclusions
Simulation modeling has become a promising method for investigating real-world processes. This paper described 
the development of a simulation model. The proposed model's objective is to investigate the utilization of the 
maximum/minimum inventory level strategy for ordering new repairable items in a flexible and risk-free manner.   
We presented a case problem of inventory of repairable items to exemplify the proposed simulation model's 
applicability and suitability. The key outcomes are the valuable model for maximum/minimum ordering policy, as 
just building a simulation model into the complex inventory system of repairable items is instructive regardless of 
results. The proposed model provided promising managerial insights about maximum/minimum ordering policy that 
would further be compared with other ordering strategies as a future study. These managerial insights are vital for 
achieving organizations' objectives, such as minimizing inventory costs and maximizing service levels.

Abstract 
Order picking is the process of collecting products from the warehouse to fulfill specific customer orders, which is 
known to be labor- and time-intensive. Order picking significantly determines the warehouse's performance, 
contributing 50% to 75% of operational costs. Therefore, the efficiency of the order-picking process also affects the 
supply chain performance. This study investigates two of five main order-picking problems jointly, which are 
classified in its day-to-day operational problem: order batching and picker routing. The algorithm to solve the problem 
is developed using metaheuristics, the simulated annealing algorithm. The algorithm avoids local optimization to find 
better solutions. The algorithm is validated through preliminary testing against problem instances of online grocery 
shopping cases with 1560 products where each order can consist of many items. The proposed algorithm has proven 
to be more efficient than the previous approach, which gives quality solutions using less run-time, especially for larger 
problem instances.

1. Introduction
Competition in the marketplace has increased in intensity, extending from competition between companies to supply 
chains (Grosse and Glock 2015). In addition, there are increasing customer expectations towards received products. 
Thus, companies must maintain or even increase their competitive advantage by increasing operational efficiency 
through fast and accurate product delivery (Ho and Lin 2017; Grosse and Glock 2015). On the other hand, the COVID-
19 pandemic has stimulated the growth of the digital economy due to restrictions on physical activity on a large scale. 
In 2021, Bain and Company reported that 80% of internet users engage in online transactions. This is supported by 
the growth of e-commerce services along with their users. As there is enormous potential in the digital economy, this 
boosts the growth of the logistics and warehousing sector due to increasing demand for product delivery. Thus, 
companies are starting to focus on building competitive advantages in the logistics and warehousing area as this area 
determines operational efficiency and effectiveness, leading to an increase in the whole supply chain performance. 
Specifically, warehouses have enormous improvement potential as they have a significant role in the supply chain 
(Amorim‐Lopes et al. 2021) and contribute to the performance and cost of the supply chain (Chen et al. 2015). Order 
picking is one of the essential activities in every warehouse, which can be defined as collecting products from the 
warehouse to fulfill specific customer orders (de Koster et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2015; Diefenbach and Glock 2019). 
Order-picking systems are dominated by manual systems consisting of up to 80% of warehouses (de Koster et al. 
2007; Grosse and Glock 2015; Diefenbach and Glock 2019). Manual order picking systems are labor- and time-
intensive, thus also cost-intensive (Diefenbach and Glock 2019) with a contribution of 50% to 75% of the warehouse’s 
total operational cost (Chen et al. 2015; Diefenbach and Glock 2019). Therefore, the efficiency of order picking 
directly and significantly determines the warehouse and, thus, the supply chain performance. As a result, order picking 
is often the prioritized area for increasing productivity (de Koster et al. 2007). In literature, there are five orders picking 
problems that can be classified into the strategic level, namely layout design; tactical level, namely storage assignment,

From the results of the preliminary numerical testing, the 2-Stage SA is shown to be able to provide significantly more 
efficient computation times for the same problem, especially in the cases of larger problems, as seen from results for 
more than 11 orders. Specifically, the more the orders are processed using the algorithm, the larger the time is reduced 
compared to the CG algorithm, with improvement of up to 99.6% for 30 orders. Unfortunately, this faster computation 
time comes at the cost of increased objective function results of distances. The increased objective function comes in 
the average of 13% for all tested instances, with the highest being 48% for the instance of 8 orders and the smallest of 
0% for the instance of 5 orders. On the other hand, note that these increases are less significant than the time reduced 
to obtain the results. These results prove that the 2-Stage SA algorithm can provide quality solutions in efficient 
computation times. Thus, the developed algorithm can be a reasonable choice for practical industrial operations cases. 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 
The developed 2-Stage SA algorithm is a starting point for a more efficient algorithm in solving JOBPRP with better 
quality solutions and reasonable computation times, especially for large instances, as seen in real-life warehouse cases. 
Thus, the future improvements of this preliminary work are to improve the source code of the algorithm in order to 
provide better results in problem solutions with the significant amount of computation time reduced necessary for 
increasing the performance and reducing the cost of warehouse operations, leading to improvement for the whole 
supply chain. Thus, time reduced in computation does not have to come at the cost of solution quality reduced.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper developed an efficient 2-stage simulated annealing algorithm to solve the JOBPRP, especially for large 
problems, in manual order picking systems for multi-blocks warehouses. Order picking, specifically order batching 
and picker routing contributes significantly to warehouse and supply chain costs and performance. Even though the 
order batching and picker routing problems in order picking have received much attention from researchers, some 
limitations exist, providing the gap to be filled by this paper. The algorithm was developed using simulated annealing 
metaheuristics in 2 stages, first for providing initial solution from the batching decision, continued with routing for 
each batch. Preliminary testing results show good algorithm scalability in solving large instances of up to 30 orders 
with a great variety in each order. In addition, comparison with the previous branch-and-cut algorithm (Valle et al., 
2017) shows a significant improvement in computational time reduced, unfortunately at the cost of reduced solution 
quality of an average of 13%. This tradeoff is still reasonable, considering the significant reduction in computation 
times. The main contribution of this study is developing an efficient algorithm that can provide quality solutions with 
significantly short computational times compared to the previous algorithm. The study’s main limitation lies in the 
increased objective function compared to previous literature. Thus, future research can be done in order to enhance 
the algorithm by incorporating methods to improve the computational results.

Abstract 
Further growth of container terminal operators in Indonesia has a varied standardization due to different operators 
before. Due to the range of ports' sizes, types, and services, comparing container terminals based on performance is 
challenging. Nevertheless, since a single state-owned enterprise operates most container terminals as of 2021, this 
work is crucial to enhancing national trade to improve Indonesia's competitiveness in global work. Moreover, 
container terminal performance is calculated based on their efficiency in managing several aspects divided into three 
categories based on their throughput in 2020 in the East, Middle, and West of Indonesia. Data envelopment analysis 
(DEA) using constant return to scale method to examine container terminal performance to perform benchmarking 
among all container terminal operators. The findings in this paper identify the benchmark performance for container 
terminals in each category and the needed output for underperforming container terminal operators to increase their 
efficiency performance in each aspect.

Abstract 
In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business world, supply chain agility (SCA) is essential for survival. The 
primary purpose of this study is to better understand the current state of SCA research in order to better clarify the 
area and summarize prospective future research routes. To gain an understanding of the elements that contribute to 
supply chain agility and how SC agility affects business outcomes. The resource based view (RBV) takes what could 
be called an ""inside-out"" viewpoint, or one that is specific to a certain business when assessing the variables that have 
led to its success or failure in the marketplace. Acquiring valuable, uncommon, original, and non-replicable resources 
and then applying these resources and advantages to generate extraordinary results is how organizations gain and keep 
a comparative advantage over their competitors. This investigation put the predicted connection to the quantitative 
test. In particular, responses to anonymous online surveys were collected. There were 13 hypothesis put up and 
investigated in this study, four were found to rejected which were all mediation analysis.

1. Introduction
Uncertainty and unpredictability abound throughout the fashion industry's supply chain (Lo et al., 2008). Due to the 
ever-changing nature of the fashion industry and the limited shelf life of its products, the retail fashion industry has 
unique and challenging characteristics. Demand and consumer requirements are subject to cyclical fluctuations and 
can experience a reversal at any time of the month or week. If businesses are going to make it through today's rapidly 
evolving, increasingly disposable market, they need to develop products that can adapt just as quickly. The current 
fashion market is characterized by a high rate of change, a short product life cycle, a wide variety of customer needs, 
constant technological advancements, and supply uncertainty. As a result, businesses, particularly manufacturers, are 
facing new and difficult challenges. The fashion industry may appear volatile or unsteady, but it constantly evolves in 
response to shifting consumer preferences (Lewis and Hawksley, 1990).

that further research into the important characteristics, antecedents, and repercussions of flexibility and adaptability 
for companies, managers, especially supply chain partners is required to improve on the information presented here.

Abstract 
This paper aimed to investigate the impact of organizational pressure and environmental consciousness on businesses' 
adoption of Green Supply Chain Practices (GSCPs). GSC management (GSCM) should be incorporated into an 
organization's strategic approach to achieve significant performance enhancement. The target companies for this 
project were Pakistan's leading textile, garment, and apparel manufacturers and exporters. The influence of variables 
such as Knowledge Management Orientation (KMO), Strategic Orientation (SO), Market Orientation (MO), and 
Green Entrepreneurial Orientation (GEO) was investigated. A comprehensive and inclusive survey instrument based 
on the Likert Scale was used to collect data. 261 employees from 261 textile companies participated. The data were 
analyzed, and hypotheses were tested using the structural equational model (SEM) method and the SMART PLS 
software, which permitted the development and testing of a complex and interactive conceptual framework. The results 
will be beneficial for business managers and policymakers. This study demonstrates that institutional pressure has a 
more significant impact than environmental awareness in encouraging businesses to implement sustainable supply 
chain strategies. The economy's recovery would be significantly dependent on the effectiveness of the governing 
bodies. In addition to dynamic capabilities and strategy renewal funded by government capital assistance, critical and 
sustaining factors for SME performance include dynamic capabilities. The research also revealed that the conventional 
pressure exerted by distribution network partners and consumers had the most significant impact among the various 
business pressures, followed by simulated pressure.

Abstract 
Digital technologies are including many different technologies that enable information to be collected, stored, and 
easily accessed when needed. The use of digital technologies is also increasing in the health sector, where service 
processes are intense and complex. Strategic considerations would be appropriate to analyze the use of these 
technologies. For this reason, in this study, a strategic evaluation was made on digital technologies in the health sector. 
With the SWOT analysis, the current situation analysis regarding digital technologies in the health sector was made. 
Then, the weights of SWOT factors were determined with the multiple preference relations (MPR) integrated 
DEMATEL method. Subsequently, alternative strategies were determined and prioritized with MPR integrated 
TOPSIS method. The MPR technique is aimed to analyze the uncertainties and reach more accurate and reliable results 
by gathering the evaluations of experts in different formats or incomplete opinions under a single group decision. The 
proposed methodology integrated with SWOT analysis on digital technologies in the health sector constitutes the 
originality of the study. In line with the results obtained from this study, both researchers and managers will be able 
to create and use more effective digital technology strategies for the health sector. 
Keywords 
SWOT analysis, Multiple Preference Relations, DEMATEL, TOPSIS, Healthcare, Digital Technologies. 
1. Introduction
Digital technologies are a broad term that includes many different technologies such as information technologies (IT), 
mobile and sensor-based technologies, internet of things, artificial intelligence applications, which enable information 
to be collected, stored and easily accessed when necessary. The benefits of digital technologies to businesses today 
are so important that they cannot be ignored. As in every business, the use of digital technologies is increasing in the 
health sector, where service processes are intense and complex (Bayeshova and Omarov, 2019). 
While the health sector improves in diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment processes with the effect of digitalization, 
it also offers solutions to patients and their relatives at many points such as online appointments and easy access to 
the right information in the field of health. In this context, the use of digital technologies in the health sector will 
provide safer and higher quality services, while reducing costs and increasing efficiency and quality of care. To 
achieve these goals, health systems must be constantly monitored and evaluated. In this study, a strategic evaluation 
was made on the use of digital technologies in the health sector. SWOT analysis, which enables the determination of 
the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the enterprises, was made and alternative strategies were 
determined by analyzing the current situation regarding digital technologies in the health sector. 
Evaluation of these factors and strategies includes a group decision making (GDM) approach with multiple expert 
opinions. When considering the GDM approach, the perspectives of the decision makers may differ from each other 
and may want to evaluate them in different formats. Multiple preference relations (MPR) techniques are often applied 
to deal with different forms of evaluation (Buyukozkan and Ilicak, 2019). SWOT factors were evaluated using the 
MPR integrated DEMATEL (MPR-DEMATEL) method, then the most important strategy was determined by 
weighting the strategies with the MPR integrated TOPSIS (MPR-TOPSIS) method.

From Table 5, it is seen that “SO2: A development roadmap should be created by accurately analyzing which 
technologies will be integrated into which processes in health systems.” is the most important strategy. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Today, the use of innovative technologies is seen as an important determinant in increasing the quality of health 
services and patient safety. Along with the strengths that the use of these technologies will bring, their weaknesses 
and opportunities/threats should also be analyzed, and progress should be made in line with appropriate strategies. 
SWOT analysis is the most prominent strategic evaluation methods in the literature. When the literature is examined, 
it was seen that SWOT analysis was not performed with MPR integrated DEMATEL and TOPSIS in the field of the 
use of digital technologies in the health sector.  
 
For this reason, in this study, a SWOT analysis of the use of digital technologies in the health sector was made. SWOT 
factors were evaluated with the MPR DEMATEL method, and alternative strategies were prioritized with MPR 
TOPSIS. It is one of the results of the study that importance should be given to the strengths it will provide for the 
effective use of digital technologies. In addition, in order to benefit from technology in the most effective way, it will 
be important to create a development roadmap first. In the future, this study can be expanded by taking the opinions 
of more experts, and a more detailed study can be made by increasing the SWOT factors.

Abstract 
In the last few years, the world has witnessed major events. While the world was struggling with the effects of COVID-
19, on the other hand, people and companies tried to adapt to digital transformation (DT) with the acceleration in 
technological developments and the needs brought by COVID-19. The pandemic process has accelerated the world's 
adaptation to this transformation. The pandemic process has increased the growth rate of e-commerce, which is already 
growing rapidly, and increased its influence in the air cargo market. Moreover, market growth is not the only challenge 
facing the air cargo industry. Just as it affects every industrial area, DT has started to show its effects in this area as 
well. At this point, the competition has become fiercer than ever before. Air cargo companies need to adapt to DT to 
compete in the growing market, maintain or increase their market share, generate profits, and enable their 
sustainability. Therefore, air cargo companies must consider critical success factors to successfully implement the 
transformation. For this purpose, some critical success factors are collected through a literature review process and 
expert opinions. A case study is conducted using an intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map (IFCM) approach to analyze 
these factors in the Turkish air cargo industry. Furthermore, an IFCM model of these factors is presented. The study 
results show that the most critical success factors are supply chain visibility, digital twin, and piece centricity among 
these interrelated factors.

1. Introduction
Recently launched digital technologies have initiated a new era called digital transformation (DT). It is seen as the 
tsunami of the 21st century by the senior executives of the companies. DT that is a holistic transformation process has 
changed the way the companies work. It has influenced many industrial fields such as healthcare, finance and banking, 
telecommunication, insurance, tourism, and hospitality (Büyüközkan et al., 2019a), including aviation, airline and 
(Büyüközkan et al., 2020a) and air cargo industry. World is changing and the expectations related to products and 
services have become digital more than ever. Launched digital technologies have transformed the way the companies 
do their jobs, business models, decision-making processes, strategies, and their agendas, organizational behaviors, 
workforce, and processes to meet the customers’ expectations. This is valid not only B2C processes but also B2B 
processes. Today, various cargo types ordered by the companies are transported through the air cargo channels. Digital 
technologies such as digital platforms, software, IoT, big data and digital supply chain channels are used to perform 
air cargo processes.

The obtained results showed that the most important factor is supply chain visibility for successful implementation of 
DT in air cargo industry. Digital twin and piece centricity are the following factors, respectively. Linked data and 
source of truth are the two of the most important five success factors. The companies in air cargo industry needs a 
road map for DT since the DT is a holistic transformation process. The IFCM model showed that the factors are 
interrelated and there is a causality between them. The air cargo industry is a multi-faceted and complex supply chain 
structure and the IFCM structure supports this. Companies should focus on these critical factors and the complexity 
of the system for the successful implementation of DT.  
 
5. Conclusions and Perspective 
DT is an undeniable reality of today. The impact of technology on both human life and the business world will be 
even greater. This situation has begun to affect all sectors from end to end. One of these sectors is the air cargo 
industry, which keeps the supply chain in the world alive and makes great contributions to the economy of both 
countries and the world. The air cargo industry, which has grown in line with the demands and needs, has turned into 
an ecosystem where competition is intense with the DT. Therefore, it's more important than ever to focus on the 
successful sustainability of the transformation. In this study, some of the critical factors that need to be considered for 
the successful implementation of DT are investigated and analyzed by the IFCM approach on a real case in the Turkish 
air cargo industry. The obtained results are in line with the points emphasized by the companies in their research 
reports. Scenario and sensitivity analyses can be performed in future studies. The scope and the number of the 
evaluation criteria can be expanded. The results can be compared by making calculations based on different 
extensions. Results from analytical techniques based on the assumption of independence of criteria can be examined.

Abstract 
This article aims to conceptualize the manufacture of outpatient services in a level 3 entity of the health sector, under 
a Lean Healthcare approach. For the development of the proposed objective, it was necessary to characterize the 
system from the analysis of waiting lines due to the variable and non-deterministic behavior commonly observed in 
service systems. The phases of the characterization are composed of a general description of the processes that make 
up the outpatient service, followed by an economic-operational diagnosis, where productivity measurement was used 
with a value-added approach (MPVA) and a questionnaire to evaluate compliance with criteria of the Lean philosophy. 
Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, probability functions are determined and from this the process of outpatient care 
is conceptually proposed.

6. Conclusions 
• 
As described in the statistical analysis, the behavior of the outpatient consultation process of the entity 
providing health services Ltda., object of study shows a great randomness and variability precisely due to the 
diversity of specialized medical services manufactured, which greatly hinders to develop an optimal 
operations management, supported by a process management and a standardized structure. 
• 
Given the randomness and variability of patients and symptoms treated in the entity providing health services, 
the production system developed by the organization is framed in a structure by projects where the service is 
made in a personalized way and tailored to each patient, which largely makes it impossible for care times to 
be the same for each patient, but nevertheless by government guidelines and for the sake of To guarantee 
coverage, accessibility and timeliness to the health care service, standardized care times of between 15 – 20 
minutes per patient have been established. 
• 
Another mitigating factor in the manufacture of medical services offered by the entity providing health 
services is the availability of specialized medical personnel, as can be seen in the schedule the use of the 
system is not 100% which greatly impacts the opportunity in the allocation of appointments. 
• 
From the measurement of productivity with a value-added approach, it can be affirmed that the company 
shows healthy finances, is a company that responds positively to its social interest groups and that 
operationally speaking behaves appropriately and adjusted to the behavior of the health system. 
• 
From the diagnosis of the lean approach, it can be established that an organization that does not focus its 
work on the reduction of waste, given the variability of medical services, symptoms that attend and diversity 
of patients is difficult to standardize processes but nevertheless it would be possible to organize and / or 
synchronize in a better way its activities in order to continuously improve its levels of quality and productivity 
and therefore its profitability. 
• 
It should be noted that the proposed conceptual model serves as an initial framework for future research such 
as the development of simulation models using software such as Flexsim and / promodel as the object of 
validating their behavior and thus proceed to make the respective adjustments and changes in the medical 
protocols that to date are working in the institution.

Abstract 
Technological improvement for the safe and efficient use of self-driving vehicles continues at full speed. The 
development in this area in the coming years seems to affect human lives significantly. By the progress in Industry 
4.0, products and hardware developed with software can exchange smart da-ta to ensure their management and 
optimization. It is possible to say that there will be much work about this technology shortly, even if they are not yet 
widely used. The investments of giant companies in this technology al-so support this development. However, the 
benefits and costs of autonomous vehicles are still mostly hypothetical. Self-driving cars layer their autonomy into six 
categories according to the capability of different levels of self-driving. Deciding on the autonomy of self-driving 
vehicles is a complicated procedure that requires various attributes to consider. Multi-Criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) techniques are built to assist these kinds of decision-making problems. Fuzzy extensions aim to define 
judgments of decision-makers more explicitly and informatively by building on membership functions having three 
distinct dimensions. A new extension of ordinary fuzzy sets has been developed recently based on generalized three-
dimensions called SFSs (Spherical Fuzzy Sets). In this study, the aim is to apply SF-TODIM (Spherical Fuzzy Tomada 
de Decisão Interativa Multicritério) MCDM method to evaluate autonomy selection in self-driving vehicles problem 
in a Group Decision Making environment. The autonomy selection in self-driving vehicles is assessed with five layers 
of autonomy using six criteria in order to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the developed SF-TODIM 
approach.

1. Introduction
The transition to the self-driving vehicle in-vehicle technologies has accelerated in the past few years. Fully 
autonomous vehicles, through the automatic control systems they contain in, able to travel without any intervention 
from the driver by perceiving the environment, traffic flow, and the road without the need for a driver. Nevertheless, 
the automation layer defines the level of intervention from a human driver. Autonomous vehicles can detect 
surrounding objects by applying technologic enablers and systems such as radar, computer vision, odometry, GPS, 
lidar. Self-driving automobiles seem to cause a revolution in the automotive industry, leading to a revolution in the 
passenger car industry. By the progress in Industry 4.0, products and hardware developed with software can exchange 
smart data to confirm their optimization management of the production line. The swift progress of self-driving vehicle 
technologies will alter the rubrics of Henry Ford's game very soon. Although the costs of these services are currently 
a problem, they will be widely used in a few years with the novel Industry 4.0 solutions. The automotive industry, in 
particular, will be one of the units furthermost affected by this progress. It is believed that autonomous or driverless 
vehicles will also be in the lead for unique social, environmental, and economic alteration soon. The characteristics

DMs' importance is determined. The aggregated decision criteria values by the use of SWAM aggregation operator 
are used to calculate criteria weights. Due to space requirements, only final global dominance and ranking table are 
disclosed. The alternatives are ranked in ascending order. As a result, 𝑨𝑨𝟓𝟓 is revealed as the best alternative. Moreover, 
the ranking order of alternatives is displayed in Table 1.

3.2 Sensitivity Analysis  
In this section, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the impact of the weight changes on the results. The final 
ranking of the decision-making process, which is the final stage of the prioritization of alternatives, depends heavily 
on the weight of the criteria. Therefore, how possible changes in relative weights will affect the final ranking should 
be investigated. Since these weights often depend on the subjective assessment of experts, alternative ranking is of 
paramount importance when there are different criteria weights. For this purpose, scenarios containing relative 
importance of the criteria and reflecting their status in terms of different views should be examined. In this case, 
prioritizing the changes in the results by giving increasing or decreasing weight for each criterion and listing the 
alternatives should be observed. As a result, the sensitivity analysis is made for this purpose helps to provide 
information in order to fix the alternative ranking. Accordingly, the final rankings of the alternatives evaluated for 
five different situations (scenarios) are examined. Based on the data in this table, the performances of the candidates 
have been recalculated for five different cases. When the results are examined, it is observed that the mentioned 
changes in the criteria slightly changed the ranking of some alternatives. However, the results for the first four 
alternatives have remained the same. A summary of these candidate performance values (rankings) for different 
situations is shown in Figure 1.

4. Conclusion 
The main objective of this study is to evaluate autonomy selection in self-driving vehicles problem in a Group Decision 
Making setting by considering a set of evaluation criteria. The evaluation of automation requires an examination of 
diverse qualitative and quantitative factors. MCDM techniques are scientific methods that can evaluate qualitative and 
quantitative factors together. That is why, TODIM, which is one of the distance-based MCDM methods, has been 
used to evaluate the alternatives of self-driving automation layers. In order to select the best suitable level of 
automation, identification of decision criteria needs to be taken into account. An extant review of the literature and 
three DMs are used to do it suitable. The SFS TODIM MCDM method is applied to evaluate all candidate levels by 
the light of the given attributes. The SFS environment is chosen as an objective world to assess and rank the automation 
level for the given problem. The SFS has shown explicit advantages in handling uncertainty over crisp or fuzzy sets 
to depict DMs’ evaluations, allowing for a more representative decision-making. Besides, it is chosen to derive the

significance of the selection. A practical case is also demonstrated to validate the developed method. In the future, 
this research is aimed to focus on studies involving the application of this method to different sectors. Furthermore, in 
future studies, the results of these alternatives can be compared with other fuzzy logic-based MCDM approaches.

Visualizing a Local Food Bank’s Chronic Health Disease 
Population

Abstract 
Food insecurity hinders individuals from the healthy and sustainable life they truly deserve. Unfortunately, food 
insecurity and chronic health diseases affect millions of people across the United States. Food banks are constantly 
fighting the uphill battle against food insecurity to supply adequate, relevant, healthy meals to those who need them. 
Oftentimes hunger relief organizations lack data and software tools that could aid strategic decision-making. A local 
food bank faces this exact problem and is struggling to find clients that face chronic health diseases in their service 
area. This study uses data from the local food bank to develop visualizations that investigate the health considerations 
of the population they serve. The results easily found a specific county with the largest number of health considerations 
and a zip code with the highest number of individuals facing hypertension. Dominant chronic health considerations 
highlight the importance for food banks to diversify their food selections. It is important for the local food bank to 
know what foods are essential within each county and zip code area to provide services that will be valuable to those 
who need them. This study benefits food banks so they can yield better service to the community.  
Keywords 
Food insecurity, chronic health disease, food bank, and visualization. 
1. Introduction
About 89.8% of Americans who are food secure always had access to a dependable and healthy supply of food that 
contributed towards a sustainable lifestyle in 2021 (Coleman-Jensen et at. 2021). On the contrary, food insecurity is 
still a huge problem that many households face. Food insecurity is a condition where a household has limited or 
uncertain access to an adequate food supply (Gundersen and Ziliak 2015).  In 2021, 3.8 percent of the households 
faced exceptionally low food insecurity, and 10.2% were food insecure (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2021). These numbers 
are not significantly different from the previous year.  
A food bank is a non-profit organization that collects and distributes food to the community and partner agencies. 
There are uncertainties in both supply and demand resulting in complex operations. Due to the complicated process 
and the substantial amount of information, organizations are forced to make decisions that may not benefit food 
distributions, inventory control, and coordination with agencies to serve the community. Not only is distributing the 
food difficult but serving relevant food that the community wants and needs. Many organizations spend time focusing 
on the coordination of getting food to homes, but they do not focus on household preferences based on culture and 
chronic health considerations.   
The initiative for food banks to provide healthy food is crucial especially since there is an inordinate amount of health 
disparities in the minority population. Minorities are 1.5 to 2 times more likely to have chronic diseases than Whites, 
which is heavily related to income, race, and ethnicity (Price et al. 2013). For instance, American Indian or Alaska 
Native (14.5%), African American (12.1%), Hispanic or Latino (11.8%), and Asian (9.5%) people are more likely to 
be diagnosed with diabetes than White people (7.4%) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2022). Not to 
mention, diabetes can cause other diseases like high blood pressure, hypertension, high cholesterol, and high 
triglycerides. These diseases could lead to other serious implications like heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney 
failure, and even death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2022). Chronic conditions most often are related 
to obesity, which is extremely serious.

These visualizations can assist the food bank in making better strategic decisions. After reviewing the data, food banks 
can distribute healthy foods to certain counties and zip codes based on each health consideration. On a county level, 
the food bank may want to prioritize Forsyth and Guilford County and the zip code 27105 since there are many people 
who face chronic health diseases in these areas. More precisely, almost 60% of people faced hypertension, which was 
more frequent at the county and zip code levels. Additionally, data suggests that 59.78% of African Americans and 
32.86% of White Americans struggle with chronic health diseases. Therefore, the visualized data can assist the food 
bank to identify the most vulnerable community. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Eating healthy foods and having access to healthy foods should be the same for everyone. Hunger relief organizations 
play a huge part in serving and feeding our communities. People are food insecure, and it is also clear that people 
across the country are facing health diseases. These chronic diseases can be mitigated with access to healthy foods, 
which is why there needs to be a push for healthy access. For these food banks to serve, they need to be equipped with 
the knowledge and easy-to-use tools to help them assist others. 
 
This research was able to provide a solution to the local food bank’s needs. The products of this study, specifically 
the dashboard comprised of data visualizations, can offer several benefits to the local food bank. This organization 
can save money, make data-driven decisions, and become more responsive to the needs of the community.  
First, the food bank can optimize its distribution strategies by identifying the specific counties and zip codes people 
face chronic diseases. The local food bank can ultimately save money since they can focus on areas with higher needs, 
ensuring that the right amounts of food are provided to underserved communities. This targeted approach will 
ultimately reduce waste and efficiently allocate resources which will lead to cost savings for the organization.

Secondly, this study can help the hunger relief organization improve its responsiveness. The data visualizations show 
up-to-date data on hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease rates in their service areas. The food bank can monitor 
trends or changes in health diseases over time. Thus, they can quickly adapt and provide services that address emerging 
needs. For example, if there is an increase in heart disease in a specific county or zip code, the food bank can provide 
more heart disease-friendly food options to support that area.  
 
Lastly, the insights provided by the dashboard allow the organization to make strategic decisions based on accurate 
information. The organization can find patterns and disparities related to chronic health diseases and clients’ 
race/ethnicity. Ultimately, these data-driven decisions can lead to more effective and impactful distribution. The 
dashboard is practical, and anyone can simply understand the data outputs. Additionally, the research findings can be 
shared with other organizations. The local food bank can collaborate with healthcare professionals, partner agencies, 
and government agencies to coordinate efforts to address common health conditions. These partnerships can help the 
food bank amplify its impact on the community and improve the community’s health for good.

Abstract 
In the present research paper, proposals for improvement related to lean manufacturing will be analyzed with the aim 
of standardizing production and increasing productivity in the production area of a spinning company, using 
automation and plant layout tools. Initially, a high variability in production time was identified within the fiber 
preparation and mixing area, which caused instability and decreased productivity in the zone. After a preliminary 
analysis, it was found that increasing the amount of fibers used in the process (e.g. from 2 to 3 fibers) resulted in an 
increase in total production time. Subsequently, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out in the selected company, 
observing the production processes in order to select the most critical stage of the process within the area to implement 
an improvement. Finally, different improvement proposals were compared, and it was determined that the most 
effective and viable ones were automation and a new distribution of the work area. After implementation, an average 
reduction of 31% in production time was achieved, circulation time was reduced, and monthly production in the area 
was stabilized.

1. Introduction
The textile sector has always been one of the largest sectors in Peru, largely due to the abundance of fibers found in 
the country and their high quality. This sector generates around 400,000 direct jobs annually, which accounts for 2.3% 
of the national employment in 2019. The sector was relatively stable in recent years, however, in 2020 it was strongly 
affected by the global pandemic like many other sectors in the country. In 2020, the production of the textile and 
apparel sector fell by 32.1% due to the temporary cessation of activities and the decrease in demand. The sector has 
been gradually recovering throughout the years, but this blow has caused the closure of many companies. 
The research will be carried out in a spinning company, where situational analysis and proposal development will be 
conducted. The company has 20 years of experience in the market and operates in the field of preparation and weaving 
of textile fibers, with its plant and sole headquarters located in Lurin, Lima-Peru. This is a satellite company, part of 
a group of related companies, and focuses entirely on providing short fiber spinning services to the parent company 
responsible for the manufacture and sale of yarns. Since the spinning company was created by the same owners to 
provide services to the other company, it will be considered as the initial part of the production process of the same 
entity. The group has more than 50 years of experience in yarn production and is characterized by its inexhaustible 
ability to combine fibers and create new yarns. In recent years, the company has been directing its production towards 
differentiated yarns based on fiber blends such as Peruvian cotton, alpaca, wool, silk, acrylic, polyester, viscose, and 
other synthetic and artificial fibers. Currently, it supplies its products to prestigious garment manufacturers and 
distributors in more than twenty countries in North, Central, and South America, Europe, and Asia.

On the other hand, it should be mentioned that the process was standardized with a result of 150 kg/h, with a daily 
production of 1200 kg. In this way, the desired limit of 100 kg/h set by management is exceeded, compared to the 
previous average of 99.06 kg/h, an increase of 51.42% in the production of the area has been achieved. 
 
After observing all the results obtained after the implementation of the improvement proposals, it can be evidenced 
that the hypothesis stated: ""the monthly production in the fiber preparation and mixing area will be standardized 
through the use of lean manufacturing tools,"" is true since the process was standardized at 150 kg/h through the 
implementation of new machinery (partial automation) and a new plant layout, thus giving flexibility to the process 
so that it can adapt to different orders. Likewise, production capacity has increased by 51.42%, thus surpassing the 
acceptable standards initially set by management through the reduction of production times and process variability. 
 
6. Conclusion 
As demonstrated by the results obtained, following the implementation of the improvement proposal, a 31% reduction 
in production times was achieved at the fiber preparation and mixing station through the automation of manual 
operation at the ""workstation"" (fiber weighing, initial fiber opener, cake formation, and ensiling spray) and a 
reorganization of the plant with the new machinery. Through this automation, standardization of production in the 
aforementioned station is achieved due to the constant work of the machine (being a programmable device, it does not 
incur fatigue, downtime, or idle time) and in conjunction with the distribution of the plant and the savings of meters 
in the productive path (which can be translated into time), compliance with the regularization and increase in 
production in the fiber preparation and mixing station is achieved. 
 
In this way, it can be affirmed that the problem of the research is solved, giving as true the principal and specific 
hypotheses initially proposed since the process was standardized and the production of the area was increased through 
the application of lean manufacturing (automation and systematic layout), providing flexibility in the production area 
so that the production process can adapt to the different and varied types of orders that presented problems initially 
due to the low flexibility and high dependence on labor (identified root causes), which could be quantitatively justified 
through the indicators presented in the previous chapters.

Abstract 
Artificial intelligence has begun to be applied to various industries such as manufacturing, medical care, and 
transportation, and the distribution industry is one of the fields where artificial intelligence is applied at the forefront. 
In retail, artificial intelligence can be applied in virtually any area where businesses need to make strategic decisions, 
such as store location selection, staff recruitment, sales forecasting, and inventory management. Artificial intelligence 
will also change the shopping environment perceived by consumers. This shift can be seen in the shopping search and 
purchase process, shopping site design, and the rise of artificially intelligent robots serving as skilled salespeople. 
These AI-led changes can be summarized as reading and adapting to customers minds, and are expected to 
fundamentally change the future of the distribution industry. Considering the rapid development of artificial 
intelligence technology, domestic retailers are far behind, so it seems that more attention and investment in the field 
of artificial intelligence will be needed in the future.

1. Introduction
Today, the 4th Industrial Revolution is an era of ""virtual physical systems"" (Cyber-Physical Systems) in which things 
are automatically and intelligently controlled by integrating the real and the virtual, and one of the core new 
technologies is exactly Artificial Intelligence (AI). (Kim 2016) Artificial intelligence has begun to be applied in 
various industrial fields such as manufacturing, medical care, and transportation. For example, in the medical field, 
IBM's artificial intelligence, Watson, has been working with the world's best cancer hospital, the Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York, USA since March 2012, and MD Anderson Arm. Since October of 
the same year, the center has been conducting research aimed at deriving accurate cancer diagnosis and optimal 
treatment methods. Currently, it has been introduced not only in the United States but also in Japan and South Korea, 
where it is being used for treatment and diagnosis of cancer patients. (Website Jang 2016) Artificial intelligence is 
applied in various fields such as industrial robots, autonomous vehicles that recognize roads and traffic conditions, 
and translation that understands human natural language. is one. It is still in its infancy, and artificial intelligence is 
expected to change the landscape of the industry itself and radically change the shopping experience of consumers in 
the distribution industry. The history of artificial intelligence is shown in Figure 1 below. (Website 2021)  In this 
paper, we will look at the development of artificial intelligence and how it will change the distribution industry.

consider when designing a shopping site, such as font size, messages and images, page order, and page layout. Until 
now, companies have chosen sites that maximize sales through A/B testing. (Website Nathan 2013) Since this method 
takes a long time, the design of the selected shopping site is maintained for a certain period of time. Therefore, even 
if users' tastes change, it is difficult to change the design of the site immediately. Sometimes a very small difference 
can make a big difference in sales, and existing testing techniques are not suitable to solve this problem. 
 
However, by applying Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), one of the artificial intelligence technologies, future shopping 
sites can be constantly optimized in a way that even small changes in customer tastes can be immediately reflected. 
In other words, in order to implement an optimal shopping site, not only the past user's selection information but also 
the current user's selections are immediately utilized, so that continuous optimization can be achieved. Just like the 
evolution of organisms according to the principle of survival of the fittest, the optimal site for the most success is 
continuously derived according to the changing circumstances. 
 
These changes in the 4th Industrial Revolution are still in the future, but the recent example of an evolutionary 
algorithm used by Cosabella, an Italian lingerie company, along with Sentient, an artificial intelligence company, 
shows the beginning of it. Cosabella used evolutionary algorithms to test several alternatives for website design in a 
very short period of time, resulting in a 35% increase in sales. (Website 2016) 
 
2.2.2.3 Emergence of artificial intelligence robots as proficient salesmen 
Artificial intelligence robots, which are already used in the manufacturing process or logistics work, are being 
introduced to offline stores, diversifying the shopping experience of customers. Robots are being used by several 
distribution companies, such as BestBuy, a home appliance store in the US, and Lowe's, a home center. 
 
In September 2015, Best Buy introduced a robot called Chole to a store in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York, USA. This 
robot installed in the entertainment corner that sells records and DVDs was developed by Best Buy together with Par 
Systems, a robot solution company. In the entertainment corner where the entire wall is made up of glass shelves, 
Chloe, a robot shaped like a human arm, is installed, and customers can order products they want by manipulating 
nine touch screens installed in front of the glass wall. When an order comes in, the robot Chloe moves between the 
glass shelves to quickly find the product and deliver it to the customer. 
 
In February 2015, Home Center Lowe's also introduced an artificial intelligence robot 'OSHbot' to its Orchard Supply 
Hardware store located in California. This robot serves to find the products customers want in the store and check the 
stock status. Oshbot is equipped with human face recognition technology, so when a customer approaches, it greets 
them first and asks what product the customer is looking for. When a customer searches for a product they need on 
the Oshbot's touchscreen, Oshbot guides the customer to where the product is located. Oshbot can speak various 
languages such as Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese, providing services that are difficult for ordinary employees to 
provide. 
 
Artificial intelligence robots are used not only in these companies, but also in various distribution companies such as 
Japan's Aeon and home appliance store Yamada Electric. Artificial intelligence robots have developed to the point 
where they have the ability to understand the age, gender, and emotions of customers, and Pepper, mentioned earlier, 
is a representative example. Pepper can use facial recognition to determine the age and gender of its customers, and 
when someone touches its eyes and ears, its sensors detect this and then judge the person's mood. For example, if you 
touch yourself gently, you measure 'positive', and if you hit yourself hard, you measure 'negative'. After combining 
the feeling at this time with the experience so far, the endocrine system data is analyzed to judge customer emotions 
such as ‘pleasure’, ‘stability’, ‘anxiety’, and ‘disgust’, and recommend products that match them. (Retail Magazine 
2016). 
 
Artificial intelligence robots can still recognize human emotions only at a simple level, but as artificial intelligence 
technology continues to evolve, the future will come when robots can identify even the most detailed emotions of 
humans and recommend products. 
 
3. Conclusion 
The application of artificial intelligence in the distribution industry is only at the beginning stage, and considering the 
speed of development of artificial intelligence technology, it is expected that the landscape of the industry will 
fundamentally change in the future. In a word, the ongoing changes in the distribution field can be summarized as

‘reading customers’ minds and adapting to them. As the shopping environment has changed from offline to online, 
consumers have been able to overcome the limitations of time and space to a large extent in shopping. Now, thanks to 
cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, the shopping process is moving toward a stage where true 
personalization can be achieved. 
 
Anticipating the future changes that will be led by artificial intelligence, major IT companies in developed countries 
are making large-scale investments in the field of artificial intelligence and making efforts to lead technological 
change, and distribution companies are attempting to apply developed technologies to various fields. 
 
Some distribution companies in Korea are also attempting to introduce these cutting-edge technologies. SK Planet and 
Lotte, which operate 11st Street, announced plans to introduce an automated chatbot service with natural language 
processing capabilities to provide customized services in product search and recommendation. 
 
However, compared to major distribution companies in developed countries, the speed of AI application by domestic 
companies is still lagging behind, and more attention and investment are needed in the future. And in order for artificial 
intelligence to be widely applied in various industries such as the distribution industry, the IT field that develops these 
technologies must develop. Policy support needs to be provided so that an ecosystem can be established in which the 
industry developing technology and the industry applying it can develop together.

Abstract 
The Image Captioning models with the Attention method have developed significantly compared to previous models, 
but it is still unsatisfactory in recognizing images. The early Image Captioning models were built by combining CNN 
as an encoder and RNN as a decoder, making them susceptible to the influence of each CNN and RNN model. In 
particular, the CNN network has shown performance differences over time, which affects the RNN model used as a 
decoder. In this paper, we experiment with various CNN architectures to improve the performance of image captioning 
based on the CNN architecture as a reference. We analyze the performance of Image Captioning based on the 
performance of various CNN architecture models. We compared seven different CNN Architectures, according to 
Batch size, using public benchmarks: MS-COCO datasets. All CNN architectures used in this study are pre-trained 
networks on the ImageNet dataset. In our experimental results, DenseNet (Huang et al. 2017) and InceptionV3 
(Szegedy et al. 2016) got the most satisfactory result among the seven CNN architectures after training 50 epochs on 
GPU.

1. Introduction
Image Captioning task, which automatically generates natural language descriptions of images, is among the most 
useful technologies, such as providing more detailed explanations to the visually impaired and explaining various 
situations that the driver may not fully perceive while driving. However, Image Captioning should be able to 
subjectively express the relationship between objects that appear in an image. This also requires a computer vision 
system that can accurately recognize various images and a high level of natural language processing capability to 
express the descriptions in the natural language we use. 
Image Captioning is one of the most important topics in artificial intelligence fields because it connects two major 
topics: Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) for computer vision and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for natural 
language processing. One intuitive way to improve Image Captioning performance is 1) Use high-performing CNN 
and RNN networks. 2) Use a good combination of CNN and RNN networks. In this paper, we applied various 
advanced CNN architectures that have been developed consistently over time to Image Captioning experiments as the 
1) and analyzed each of their performance.
In this paper, we experiment with seven interesting pre-trained CNN architectures on the ImageNet dataset, including 
DenseNet (Huang et al. 2017)  and InceptionV3 (Szegedy et al. 2016) to improve Image Captioning performance. Our 
experimental results DenseNet and InceptionV3 got the lowest Loss among the seven CNN architectures. 
2. Related Work
In recent Image Captioning studies such as (Vinyals et al. 2015)(Herdade et al. 2019), a specific model structure was 
designed for Image Captioning. The structure of Image Captioning can be divided into two categories: CNN+RNN 
and CNN+Transformer. In this paper, we utilized the CNN+RNN structure used by (Vinyals et al. 2015). In this paper, 
the author was inspired by the existing translation model in the aforementioned article and devised a similar model 
structure. While the existing translation model receives text as input and translates it into another text, the model

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we experimented with seven pre-trained CNN architectures on the ImageNet, to improve the CNN 
encoder for Image Captioning. Among them, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 showed the best results with a loss of about 
15% and a training time of around 160 seconds per epoch in the MS-COCO dataset. Interestingly, the other five CNN 
architectures, which performed similarly well to DenseNet and InceptionV3, exhibited unstable training losses and 
irregular fluctuations depending on the batch size. We argue that this may be due to poor compatibility between certain 
CNN encoders and the LSTM decoder used in our Image Captioning model.

Abstract 
This paper discusses the feasibility and potential risks of artificial emotions. It is an era of worrying about the 
overtaking of artificial intelligence from a cognitive point of view, which is considered to be a human domain, and 
people are now trying to find out human nature with emotion, not reason. Recently, the task of infusing emotions into 
artificial intelligence robots is emerging as a new topic. First, let's take a look at the development of emotional robots 
and their main motivations, and why robots' emotions matter. In order to examine whether a robot possessing true 
emotions is possible, we do not define emotions a priori, but introduce some important roles that emotions play and 
propose criteria for giving emotions to certain objects. Against these criteria, true emotional robots are unlikely to 
become a reality in the near future. However, even before robots possessing emotions appear, unilateral emotional 
communication with robots with a certain degree of autonomy is potentially dangerous, and it is thought that it is good 
to prepare for it.

1. Introduction
While it is essential to predict the social, economic, cultural, and security changes that will result from the widespread 
application of artificial intelligence and to prepare for these changes at the institutional and policy level, the 
philosophical challenge of artificial intelligence is directed toward human existence and its meaning. (Boden 1990) 
(Frankish and Ramsey 2014) Artificial intelligence is an arousing object that triggers human self-reflection. The 
history of development of calculators and automata is not short, but it was not so threatening as to make us reconsider 
the nature of human nature until the concept of artificial intelligence appeared in the middle of the 20th century. 
(Minsky 1986) On the other hand, it is an effort to better understand the identity of human intelligence or rational 
ability. So, the field of research called artificial intelligence has a dual nature. As part of computer science, it is also a 
field that explores and manufactures machines that produce intelligent behavior or the software that drives them, but 
at the same time, it is part of cognitive science that scientifically explores the mind, studying the structure and 
operation of the human mind. Includes computational modeling to characterize According to a well-known textbook 
in the field of artificial intelligence (Russell and Norvig 2015), the goal of artificial intelligence is, on the one hand, 
to implement machine intelligence that resembles human intelligence, and on the other hand, to study a form of 
intelligence that can be incorporated into artifacts. By doing so, it is to understand intelligence in general and human 
intelligence. 
The way people view intelligence is changing. First, after encountering AlphaGo, many people do not bother to ask if 
it is really “artificial intelligence”. People have no qualms about adding “artificial intelligence” as a modifier to not 
only AlphaGo and Watson, but other information technologies. Phrases like “Siri, the artificially intelligent assistant” 
and “a refrigerator with artificial intelligence” are fast becoming commonplace. This is because, in a situation where

This phenomenon of unconsciously endowing social robots with emotions while easily personifying them can be 
called the phenomenon of emotional dequotation. Because in people's explicit belief systems, robots' ""feelings"" are in 
quotation marks, but in actual behavior those quotation marks are easily lost. This allows people to have a one-way 
emotional bond with the robot. Even though the other person doesn't really have emotions, we personify them and 
treat them as if they had emotions, so many problems can arise. 
If you ask people whether robots are conscious, if they are persons or animals, or if they can be viewed as moral 
agents, most will give a negative answer. The dequotation mark phenomenon tells us that people's behavior is deeply 
influenced on an unconscious level. Humans are social animals, and social interactions with others are hardwired into 
our genes. When we encounter a phenomenon that simply cannot be physically explained, we tend to automatically 
infer about the mental state, beliefs, desires, and intentions of the object. In particular, in the case of infants, the range 
of subjects to which such an attitude is applied is wide. 
McCarthy (1995) pointed out the potential dangers of producing human-like robots. Human society is already complex 
enough to introduce robots with emotions. Even so, it is neither possible nor desirable to claim that the research and 
development of emotional robots should be completely stopped. A sweeping moratorium would help solve some of 
the problems mentioned above, but stopping research on social robots while researching other artificial intelligence 
and robotic technologies is not realistic. 
If we can really make robots feel and feel like humans, at least we won't be manipulated by robots in any way other 
than being manipulated by other humans. Of course, that doesn't mean we won't be deceived at all. People cheat and 
deceive each other and take advantage of each other. But if robots had real feelings, we might not be fooled by them 
the way humans fool other humans. However, it is practically difficult to produce truly artificial emotions. 
We are well aware of the fact that Asimov's three laws are difficult to implement in practice (Ko 2011). Avoiding 
such difficulties, consider whether we can prepare a certain device in robots to prevent us from being deceived by 
emotional robots due to the characteristic of one-way emotional communication. 
3. Conclusion
Due to the rich emotions that humans experience, we live a human life. However, artificial emotions or emotional 
robots are not a logical contradiction. It would not be necessary to fundamentally rule out the possibility that artificial 
objects such as robots could one day have not only intelligence but also emotions. If an artifact with intelligence at or 
beyond human intelligence could have some kind of mental state, the discussion of the possibility that it might even 
possess emotions would not be just nonsense. However, in order to determine that an object possesses emotions, 
difficult conditions must be met. Only actors who can act adaptively by evaluating the value of stimuli given to them 
in a complex and sometimes hostile environment for their survival and homeostasis can be said to have the basic 
conditions for possessing emotions. 
In order for artificial intelligence to evolve into a being with real emotions beyond merely recognizing and mimicking 
human emotional expressions, it may have to possess a body like an organism. I'm not sure we want such AI. Before 
discussing true artificial emotions that may occur in the future, it is necessary to anticipate and prepare for potential 
risks that one-sided emotional sympathy with emotional robots may bring.

Abstract 
Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of politics through a digital political revolution. In this context, we look at 
the impact of artificial intelligence on democracy in terms of freedom, equality, and political action. Artificial 
intelligence has a positive aspect of expanding the realm of human freedom through citizen's political participation, 
the spread of digital liberalism, and the improvement of human capabilities. On the other hand, artificial intelligence 
violates individual freedom by depriving human spirit, intuition, free will, and autonomy by replacing human self-
improvement, human authority with algorithms, and labor with robots. Artificial intelligence is more likely to fall into 
the trap of digital dictatorship by falling into dataism as it focuses on procedural democracy rather than substantive 
democracy. Algorithms tune the human mind and emotions to create an Orwellian monitor that continuously observes 
every individual. Algorithms are likely to give control to a small elite, and new forms of authoritarian control will 
emerge. AI governance is based on whether citizens will actively participate in politics to overcome the problems of 
modern representative democracy and restore democracy, or go to digital totalitarianism by a group of data elites. In 
order to achieve a new alternative political system beyond digital dictatorship, civil society must secure the right to 
control data, and human authority must not be replaced by data authority.

1. Introduction
The 4th industrial revolution is expected to bring about a new form of society, and this industrial revolution leads to 
a digital political revolution and shows a drastic paradigm shift in the realm of government and politics. In particular, 
with the development of artificial intelligence, data science and algorithms have begun to materialize in each field of 
policy making and politics. These developments have changed human-centered political activities and decision-
making processes, creating an environment in which artificial intelligence intervenes and contributes to policy and 
politics. 
Artificial intelligence is being applied to various policy areas from tasks such as data collection, classification, 
translation, and preparation of public documents in public and private service areas. It is artificial intelligence that 
rationally makes social and political decisions by integrating information such as national laws, existing policies, news 
and SNS.  
This study aims to explore how democracy will change when the use of artificial intelligence is in full swing. We will 
review previous studies on the concept of artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence governance, and the 
relationship between artificial intelligence and democracy. And by looking at the impact of artificial intelligence on 
democratic freedom, equality, and political activity, will algorithmic democracy, the future political landscape, 
overcome the limitations of representative and deliberative democracy and promote democracy? or will it lead to a

AI governance means the automation of political activities, policy establishment and policy execution, and algorithmic 
democracy in which artificial intelligence leads the political process is manifested. Data politics refers to constructing 
a new politics through personal data accumulation. Data politics occurs with the formation of a system that creates 
new value from personal data by appropriating or exploiting it. In other words, data strategy becomes the most 
important political means in data politics (Kim Sang-min, 2016). 
 
Algorithmic democracy will automatically manage all political activities of politicians and ordinary citizens. All 
records are stored on a central server of the central government or an agreed-upon governance organization, and are 
evaluated by algorithms based on the activities they do (Kim 2016). In artificial intelligence governance, citizens are 
constantly providing information or subjects of data rather than becoming the subject of politics. Under algorithmic 
democracy, autonomy, the normative foundation of democracy, is greatly undermined. As AI decides everything, the 
procedural and functional aspects of democracy are emphasized. 
 
Algorithmic democracy is likely to distort the balance of power in the electoral process. Artificial intelligence will 
wield a significant influence in public discussions and political agendas. When certain groups dominate AI, they have 
more opportunities to influence public debate than those who do not. Artificial intelligence can exert political influence 
from election campaigns to personal emotions through surveillance of voters. Big data algorithms predict the election 
results by identifying each political tendency before voters do. Voters are informed in advance before voting, and fake 
news or various forms of biased election campaigns and election advertisements are used. 
 
Data algorithms do not require political participation such as communication, discussion, and agreement between 
individuals by automating the optimized model through accumulated data. This process can be a threat to the 
democratic process as the deliberation process, which is the core of democracy and gives legitimacy to the acquisition 
of power, disappears. 
 
3. Conclusion 
Artificial intelligence governance can present a bright digital future through data transparency and efficient prediction 
through various information, but the dark digital future caused by algorithmic governance is more prominent. 
Algorithmic democracy plays a greater role as an institutional device for obtaining power through voting than the 
normative aspect of democracy or the practical meaning of democracy. The acquisition of power and the emphasis on 
procedural aspects will accelerate the programmation of politics and make politics automatable. Such automation will 
more easily delegate political issues and social debates to algorithms rather than to human intellects, value judgments, 
and social consultations. With the development of algorithms, the axis of political power will be transferred to artificial 
intelligence from humans centered on citizens. In addition, artificial intelligence will pollute political activities and 
the election environment by illegally collecting data, manipulating public opinion, and influencing elections and 
voting in various ways, destroying trust in public institutions and trust in free and fair elections. 
 
AI governance is the reality of complex systems, the demand for a sustainable society, and the request to overcome 
the crisis of capitalism. It will continue to develop in tandem with citizens' personalized desires. A government that 
controls algorithms can control human minds and emotions, make people love themselves and hate their enemies, and 
citizens cannot resist the regime. If algorithms are concentrated in a small elite class, a new type of authoritative 
governance structure will be formed because the general public cannot escape the elite's influence. 
 
In order to achieve a new alternative political system, there must be a way to strengthen social power, such as civil 
society and community, over data power under human control, without human authority being replaced by data 
authority. As a way to strengthen social power, two aspects, institutional and individual, should be considered. First, 
an artificial intelligence-based algorithmic democracy platform is institutionally established, and by using artificial 
intelligence technology, citizens can make decisions directly or realize ideas for solving social problems in policies. 
Second, a strategy for coexistence between artificial intelligence and human beings is needed to protect human dignity 
by maintaining individual autonomy and free will at the individual level. The biggest problem in artificial intelligence 
governance is to hand over the quantified ego and human decision-making power that self-recognizes through 0 and 
1. To solve this problem, it is to improve the ability and judgment to be able to control the algorithm and interpret the 
output produced by the algorithm. Education and institutionalization that can cultivate the ability to derive appropriate 
implications for the results produced by humans and artificial intelligence must be centered on citizens, and future 
politics will ultimately be driven by data and people.

Abstract 
Recently, artificial intelligence technology that combines artificial intelligence technology of global companies is 
attracting attention. In the past, a lot of effort was put into research centering on realistic graphic processing and natural 
movement processing technology to improve realism, but recently, artificial intelligence technology that thinks like a 
human is attracting attention. Artificial intelligence in games is the part that takes on the role of a player, the role of 
an unregulated player, the role of a team member, etc. instead, like a human, with the ability to learn to think like a 
human and intelligent behavior to act like a human. Artificial intelligence information technology is an important part 
that enables human-like thinking, and continuous research is required in the field of intelligent artificial intelligence 
among game elements, and interest in artificial intelligence is gathering in computer games. Therefore, this study 
seeks to research artificial intelligence technology in computer games.

1. Introduction
The need for a technology related to artificial intelligence was sought, and that technology was to create computers 
that think, or have ""artificial intelligence"" known as AI. Artificial intelligence computers that store a lot of data will 
be able to analyze concrete data and produce more solid and substantive social theories. In addition, human beings 
will be able to pursue a much better life by utilizing robot brains that are applied to industrial sites in place of humans. 
Recently, AI technology has been attracting attention as the confrontation between Alphago and Go professional 
players in a global company has attracted the attention of the world. Past games have made a lot of effort in research 
centered on realistic graphics processing and smooth motion processing technology to improve the experience, and 
the technology transplant of artificial intelligence that thinks like humans is gaining new interest. There is Artificial 
intelligence in the game is to perform the role of the player, the role of the uncoordinated player, the role of the team 
member, etc., like a person. This includes intelligent behavior that thinks and acts like humans. In past games, a lot of 
effort and money was spent to create characters that behaved like humans, but now artificial intelligence information 
technology plays an important role in creating accidents like humans do. It can be said that there is For this purpose, 
continuous research in the field of intelligent artificial intelligence among game elements is necessary, and interest in 
utilizing artificial intelligence in computer games is emerging. Therefore, in this study, we would like to look at ways 
to influence artificial intelligence technology in computer games.

2.1 About the game
Since the 1950s, computer games have rapidly developed into a popular cultural form, and are now one of the most
powerful multimedia cultural forms, competing with existing media such as movies, OTT, television, and records. A

Figure 3 at the architecture above, a creature's desires, opinions, and beliefs influence its behavior. In particular, the 
effect of education was implemented using a decision tree corresponding to Opinions. Black & White used a method 
called Dynamically Building Decision Trees, but it was changed to a more dynamic form by applying the general 
Decision Tree method. First, the Decision Tree method is a structure for implementing a certain logical plan in a game 
more efficiently. It can be processed with hard coding, but as shown in Figure 4, it is made into a structure that can be 
changed from the outside without directly changing the code by making it a more efficient structure.

This Decision Tree is a simple method, but it can be used conveniently depending on the application. 
 
The Sims is a simulation game from EA. It is a game made by Will Write, who is famous for the Sim City series. Real 
life has been put into the game in an interesting way, but each character has needs, so you have to satisfy them to make 
the game play smooth. What is characteristic of Sims is the use of AI techniques based on the character's desire and 
the way each object has information about certain actions. Desire-based AI techniques were also introduced in 
Gamasutra, but as a way to obtain appropriate effects by adjusting the thresholds for internal states, the limitations 
were appropriately adjusted to resemble the behavior of living things and applied. Will Write expressed the way 
objects generate events with the term “smart terrain,” and the metaphor seems appropriate. Objects, which are objects, 
not subjects, generate event information about actions that the subject should perform. It can be said in the same way 
that if a hungry character walks by, he orders you to take it out of the fridge and eat it. It's funny in a way, but I'm 
seeing the effect in a very appropriate way. This game showcases AI using A-Life and Fuzzy-State Machine. In 
particular, in this game, the way each object generates states and actions, as Will Write says, “smart terrain.” In other 
words, it is an event-driven method in which each object generates events for various actions to the character in an 
object-oriented method. The word A-Life is mentioned in Black & White or The Sims. To explain a little, the AI so 
far is from top to bottom, so unplanned actions from below as planned from above cannot occur, but A-Life It is 
expressed in the word from bottom to top, and each detailed simple rule is gathered to represent one big characteristic, 
and it has the characteristic of emergent behavior that is not specified. It can be said that it is a way to imitate more 
natural creatures. 
 
3. Conclusions 
Rather than using only one or two methods to implement artificial intelligence in games, it is common to implement 
several methods in combination depending on the level and genre of the game. In Black & White, the technology of

artificial life was applied, but the reaction to the user's actions was made to appear dynamically according to the desires 
and states of the characters themselves. Also, if the user makes the character repeat some action, the action is followed 
in the same way, and by presenting rewards and punishments, good and bad can be distinguished and educated. Sims, 
which is famous for EA's SimCity series, was developed by Will Write, and by translating everyday real life into 
games, each character has their own desires, and it is necessary to satisfy them to play smoothly. Despite the short 
history of computer-based games, they have developed into various genres, such as first-person shooter games, sports 
games, and various simulation games, in anticipation of many people. The appeal of computer games is that you can 
enjoy the game alone or with a computer-generated virtual opponent. In fact, how to create enemy planes that can 
better avoid missiles launched by gamers' spaceships and how to create an army that can use more diverse tactics are 
major issues in developing the field of artificial intelligence contributed. In the future, more games that embody 
various artificial intelligence theories are expected to appear.

A Statistical Approach to Reduce the Manufacturing 
Process Qualification Cost and Sample Size

Abstract 
Process qualification is a common norm in the manufacturing/ consumer electronics industry. With product lifecycle 
becoming shorter , we  see New product Introductions at a rapid pace today than anytime before. New products means 
setting up more and more new processes ,machines, and production lines. With Product quality becoming the centre 
of attention for most organisations, there has been increasing demand for optimization of statistical process 
qualifications. Generally, to qualify a new manufacturing process, the Quality engineers follow a statistical approach 
by measuring the performance of a specific quality of parts.  However, in some scenarios like in High volume 
manufacturing, we might encounter lots of new processes under multiple product configurations which make statistical 
qualifications a huge cost adder given so many quantities to test plus they also are a cause of manufacturing waste if 
the parts are not intended to be customer shipped. In this paper, we propose a new solution that leverages a 2 step 
testing method mainly based on binomial distribution and the main idea is if there is a process that sees early failures, 
we may be able to identify it with initial samples without the need to undergo complete qualification. Further, we also 
prove through results that we can achieve 18-25% reduction in samples while keeping same statistical confidence.

Abstract 
For many years, the Operations Research (OR) discipline has been primarily concerned with economic aspects. The 
objective of traditional Planning and Scheduling has been mainly considered from a productive viewpoint like 
optimizing time and cost. However, human factors have gained increased attention since the 2000s, propelled by 
growing public concerns about sustainable development on the same grounds as economic and ecological ones. 
Applying conventional optimization models to Planning and Scheduling appears not to seem sufficiently effective, so 
alternative approaches must be employed to obtain insight into the most critical drivers of socially responsible 
operations to apply standard Operations Research (OR) models appropriately. The purpose of this study is to analyze 
and classify how the works dedicated to alternative objective functions by the Operations Research community to 
integrate human and environmental considerations into production and logistical systems have been captured. 
Moreover, several gaps in the literature are addressed, and some recommendations for appropriately integrating human 
and ecological factors in OR problems are given. There were several aspects that could not be analyzed and classified 
due to a lack of or insufficient research material in these areas. This work can be used as a basis for further research 
into non-productive objective functions that could bring about new perspectives in this field.

1. Introduction
The notion of Objective Function in modeling Planning and Scheduling Problems has been studied for a very long 
time. This concept is very critical because it determines whether we can arrive at an optimal solution to a problem or 
not. Before we define what an Objective function is, it is important to look at a little bit of context.  Scheduling deals 
with the gradual distribution of limited resources to jobs. It is a collection of methods for decision-making to maximize 
one or more objectives. These resources could be employees, materials, machines, routes, computer central processing 
units (CPU), and so forth.  
Ronald Graham, Eugene Lawler, Jan Karel Lenstra, and Alexander Rinnooy Kan (Graham et al., 1977, 1-40) 
introduced a convenient notation for classical scheduling problems below, based on three different fileds, respectivle 
named 𝝰𝝰|𝝱𝝱|𝝲𝝲, where 𝛂𝛂 denotes the machine environment, 𝝱𝝱: refers to the process, characteristics, and constraints of 
the problem and 𝝲𝝲: refers to the objective function to minimise. 
This paper will mainly focus on discussing alternative or non-productive objective functions (𝝲𝝲) in Planning and 
Scheduling scenarios across different industries. 
The Objective of a Planning/Scheduling requirement refers to the goal or outcome of an activity towards which efforts 
and resources are directed. A way to maximize (or minimize) these goals and outcomes are described as the objective 
function. For many years, the objective of traditional planning and scheduling has been viewed strictly from a

Abstract 
This study accentuates the significant reasons for the failure of private businesses to avail the government financing 
schemes in the developing world productively. By taking the Pakistani industrial sector as the context, this research 
explores the various impediments that companies encountered, which attenuated their potential to exploit the financial 
opportunities provided by the government effectively. A low tariff financing scheme of up to Rs. 5.0 billion laid by 
Government of Pakistan (GoP), aimed at provision of higher employment coupled with enhanced production to meet 
foreign & local chucks directing increased FX reserves, was exploited by a large industrial group. The initial plan for 
the extension of production plant of caustic soda was outsized chaotically adding inhouse power generation plant, to 
embrace the maximum subsidized funding offered by the GoP. The poor feasibility analysis, evaluation of technical 
resources, mitigation plans and unprofessional handling ended up losing all advantageous money beside losses. This 
study also includes the combined effect of delayed realization of SCM tools and COVID19, joined by an incompetent 
inventory inspection team, resulted losing competitiveness. The study shall be computing time delays, improper 
financial estimates, COVID-affected shipments, and lack in good Bill of Materials (BOM), eventually distressing 
SCM. The expansion cost a year besides 70-75% additional cost than estimated. The parameters shall explicate 
proficiently perceiving the project. The techniques are kept artless to evaluate obtainable data and feasibility to 
conclude. The study anticipates to provide an insight the lacking capacities and suggestive improvement in SCM from 
planning to bottom line.

Abstract 
In the context of sustainable urban planning, identifying an optimal land use location plays a crucial role in effectively 
managing land distribution. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of various factors influencing the choice is 
necessary to determine the most suitable site. This paper aims to identify an appropriate location for a police station 
in Azaz City using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A novel approach is proposed by integrating service area 
analysis and multi-criteria analysis to minimize emergency response time. The evaluation process focuses on travel 
time from the existing police station within the study area. Three critical zones were generated using network analysis, 
each representing coverage within a one-minute travel time. These critical zones were ranked and assigned weights 
based on their proximity to high-crime areas and travel time from other essential facilities. The facilities were 
categorized into three groups, namely education, health, and tourism services. A suitability map was created to 
determine the priority of alternative locations, and the highly suitable area was overlaid with an aerial photograph to 
assess land availability. Finally, facility location-allocation techniques were utilized to select the optimal site for 
establishing a police station. This approach offers valuable insights for governmental bodies and urban planners 
seeking to make informed decisions regarding site selection.

1. Introduction
Selecting the best location for something new is crucial in sustainable urban planning. To assess site suitability, data 
from various sources and complex analyses are integrated (El Baroudy 2016). One common approach is Multi-Criteria 
Decision Analysis (MCDA) (Elsheikh 2016) (Chakraborty 2013), which considers different methods and processes 
for decision-making in fields like mathematics, management, planning, and economics (Guarini 2018). When 
choosing a site for a police station, factors like proximity to other police stations, main roads, and crime-prone areas 
are considered (Hasan Rahmani 2015). Visualizing crime hotspots and existing police stations helps identify suitable 
locations for a new police station (Kim 2012). However, many emergency location selections are made using simple 
analysis, focusing on the geographical distribution of police stations and service area gaps (M. M. Ahmed 2013). The 
ranking is a simple method but lacks a mathematical foundation. To address this, Saaty proposed the pairwise 
comparison method within the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty. 2008). AHP has been used in GIS-based 
emergency site suitability procedures (H. S. Mirzahossein 2020). Buffer analysis in GIS cannot accurately determine 
reachable travel times. Integrating service area analysis and multi-criteria analysis provides a better solution by 
considering a range of perspectives rather than a single approach, increasing the study's certainty.

near public areas (Yang 2019). The facilities located in critical zones were identified and categorized into three classes: 
education, health, and tourism services, as illustrated in (Figure 5). 
 
The ranking method was used to assess each criterion by assigning a preference order as determined by the decision 
maker. The factors were ranked using inverse ranking, where 1 represented the least important and 3 represented the 
most important factor. Areas that were farthest from a particular facility received a low potential rank of 1. The critical 
zones that were reachable within a 10-minute (more than 2000m) timeframe were ranked as the most important with 
a rank value of 3. After reclassifying and ranking all layers, a composite map was generated to identify risk-prone 
areas, which were categorized into three classes (as shown in Figure 5). Class 3, represented by the color blue, was 
identified as the highest-risk area and the most suitable site for locating a new police station. 
 
4. Suggestion to Improve the Service 
Based on the creation of a suitability map to prioritize alternative locations, overlaying aerial photographs to assess 
land availability, and conducting location-allocation analysis, the recommended location for a new police station is 
the northern side of Azaz (as shown in Figure 6). This suggested location should be in close proximity to the main 
road that connects the surrounding highway, ensuring good coverage for the northern side of the city. It is also crucial 
to take into account the anticipated city expansion over the next 10 years when considering the placement of the new 
police station.

5. Conclusion 
The Risk-prone map can serve as a valuable tool for planners, insurers, and emergency services in selecting optimal 
sites for new police stations. The study highlights the role of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in decision-
making and optimal planning, emphasizing the importance of considering travel time and distance from facilities, as 
well as hotspot trends of crime to improve service delivery and increase safety. By integrating service areas in network 
analysis and multi-criteria analysis, the study provides a clear understanding of high-risk zones where minimizing 
response time is crucial. These high-risk zones are identified as suitable areas for candidate locations. Location-
allocation analysis is then applied to choose the best location among the candidate facilities, considering cost and

demand allocation. This approach offers optimal solutions for government or planners in making informed decisions 
for site selection. 
 
For future studies, it is recommended to consider crime information and its spatial distribution as effective factors in 
site selection. The implemented Network Analysis can be extended to cover the entire area around Azaz, including 
suburbs, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the road network and potential site locations for police 
stations.

Abstract 
Turret punch machines have been used to produce parts in sheet metal shops since the 1950s. It is common to place 
multiple parts of different sizes and designs from multiple customers on one sheet blank to manufacture. However, 
this practice poses challenges in accurately calculating the fabrication time and subsequent manufacturing cost of each 
part. This is because turret punch machines only display the total machine run time per entire sheet blank, whereas the 
punching process depends not only on the parts themselves but also on the punching tools used and punching routes 
undertaken. This paper proposes a Machine Learning approach to solve this longstanding punching time distribution 
problem by using the punching tools’ hitting counts, the moving distances of sheet blanks and the number of tool 
changes during production time. 425 sheet blanks of parts with various designs and sizes are processed, and machine 
run times for each sheet blank are recorded from a turret punch simulation program. Five common types of turret 
punching operations (“hit”), such as nibbling, single hit, line shearing and etc., along with transverse and longitudinal 
moving distances of sheet blanks and tool changes are considered in this research. Every part on the sheet blanks is 
broken down into its component geometric entities (e.g. line, arc, hole, etc.). Geometric entities are then grouped by 
the kind of punching hit and/or assigned punching tool itself. Three supervised Machine Learning models, namely 
Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression are used and compared using 10-fold cross-validation 
process each consisting of 383 (90%) sheet blanks for training and the remaining (10%) for validation.  The 
preliminary results indicate that the proposed Machine Learning approach is viable and consistent in determining the 
fabrication time for every part on sheet blanks manufactured by turret punch machines.  The approach can be integrated 
with real-time data collection of the counts of punching hits, parts’ geometry, sheet blank’s motion and machine run 
time on any turret punch machines to determine the fabrication time and subsequent manufacturing cost of each part 
in the Industry 4.0 era.

1. Introduction
Sheet metal parts are frequently manufactured using turret punch machines and laser cutting machines. A common 
practice is to place multiple parts, with different geometries from various customers, on a single sheet blank to enhance 
material utilization. However, this practice makes it challenging to accurately calculate the machine run time and the 
subsequent manufacturing cost of each part on the sheet blanks (Hwang and Yang, 2023). Inaccurate machine run 
time estimation poses challenges in determining operational profit or loss of machine shops and affects the quoting 
ability for customer orders. Currently, the industry relies on subjective estimation or simple calculation (Bargelis and 
Rimasauskas, 2007) based on part geometry to assign each part a machine run time, which lacks accuracy and

5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Simulation software is used to generate the machine run time of sheet blanks and punching operation data of parts on 
sheet blanks. It is preferable to collect the real machine run time from the turret punch machines if possible. On the 
other hand, the punching operation data are readily available in many industrial CAM software. It would be beneficial 
to gain access to machine shop(s) that run turret punch machines and form a joint research project. Some efforts were 
made without success so far. Continuing effort is necessary. 
 
Table 5. Simulated machine run time versus predicted run time of Ridge Regression model 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The velocity-time and acceleration-time relationships for the clamping bars’ motors could be nonlinear when 
fabricating parts on sheet blanks. We may consider introducing higher order term(s), e.g. quadratic term, of the 
transverse and longitudinal moving distances to be the additional features in order to capture the nonlinearity aspect 
of motor behaviors. 
 
The nibbling on arc and nibbling on line are regarded as the same type of operation in this research.  It may be 
worthwhile to treat them as different features and see if the predictability of machine run time improves. 
 
Only commonly used punching operations are considered in this research to predict the machine run time of sheet 
blanks. Judging by the research outcome, it indicates that the proposed Machine Learning method is a viable and 
consistent approach. It is advised to expand and include more punching tools, operations, sequences and commands 
that are executed by turret punch machines. 
 
The 425 training sheet blanks contain randomly placed parts, and each part is generated using prearranged geometric 
shapes but with arbitrary parametric values. It appears that these parameter-driven parts are too coherent and similar, 
which may have caused the “overfitting” result using the data from 425 training sheet blanks. More studies can be 
done to diversify the parameter-driven, auto-generated test parts to enlarge the range and scope of punching tool 
assignments and punching sequence alternatives. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A new approach is proposed to distribute the machine run time of sheet blanks to the parts on sheet blanks for all turret 
punch machines. It adopts the Machine Learning method and incorporates the counts of punching operations, 
transverse and longitudinal moving distances of sheet blanks, tool changes, and machine’s special commands as the 
modeling features. A punching simulation program is developed to provide a non-deterministic simulated machine 
run time for the sheet blanks. It also relates the punching tools, operations, routes and sequences to the parts on sheet 
blanks and retrieves applicable modeling features. 425 training sheet blanks are executed to train the Linear 
Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models. Using the 10-fold cross-validation procedure, the 
training result shows that all three models can achieve 99% accuracy scores. Furthermore, one test sheet blank is 
executed to verify the viability and consistency of the proposed approach. 
 
Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is viable and consistent to provide machine run time and 
subsequent manufacturing cost for parts of various geometries and sizes on sheet blanks.  It can replace the subjective 
estimation or simple calculation currently used in industry, and can be automated with real-time data collection in the 
era of Industry 4.0. The approach can be expanded to incorporate laser cutting machines and develop a more 
comprehensive and versatile model for the laser-turret combination machines.

Abstract 
The production capacity for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) already reaches a few thousand tons per year, reflecting the 
global commercial interest in CNTs. Today, bulk CNT powders are used in a variety of commercial items, including 
rechargeable batteries, automobile components, recreational goods, boat hulls, and water filters. CNTs can now be 
included into thin-film electronics and large-area coatings due to advances in CNT manufacturing, purification, and 
chemical modification. CNT yarns and sheets already exhibit promise performance for applications such as 
supercapacitors, actuators, and lightweight electromagnetic shields, while not yet offering compelling mechanical 
strength or electrical or thermal conductivities for many applications.

Carbon nanotubes, also known as CNTs, are seamless cylinders made up of one or more layers of graphene and can 
have either open or closed ends. They are designated as single-wall or multiwall carbon nanotubes, respectively 
(Shabir et al. 2022). All of the carbons in perfect CNTs are bonded together in a hexagonal lattice, with the exception 
of the carbons at the ends of the CNT. However, defects in mass-produced CNTs introduce pentagons, heptagons, and 
other imperfections in the sidewalls, which generally result in a degradation of the properties that are desired. SWNTs 
normally have diameters ranging from 0.8 to 2 nm, and MWNTs typically have diameters ranging from 5 to 20 nm, 
despite the fact that MWNT diameters can surpass 100 nm. The lengths of CNTs can range from less than 100 nm to 
several centimeters, which allows them to bridge the gap between the molecular and macroscopic scales.  
When only the cross-sectional area of the CNT walls is taken into consideration, the elastic modulus of individual 
MWNTs has been measured to be close to 1 TPa, and their tensile strength has been determined to be 100 GPa (Shabir 
et al,. 2022). Its strength surpasses that of any industrial fiber by more than a factor of ten. MWNTs are primarily 
made of metal and have the ability to transport currents of up to 109 A cm–2 (Shabir et al,. 2023). The orientation of 
the graphene lattice with respect to the tube axis is what is referred to as the chirality. Individual CNT walls can either 
be metallic or semiconducting, depending on which orientation they have. The thermal conductivity of individual 
SWNTs can be as high as 3500 W m1 K1 at ambient temperature, which is higher than the thermal conductivity of 
diamond. This is determined by the wall area of the SWNT.  
The earliest documented observations of hollow carbon nanofibers were made as early as the 1950s, which predates 
the beginning of widespread CNT research in the early 1990s. This study was preceded by the first industrial synthesis 
of what are now known as MWNTs, which occurred in the 1980s. However, the most significant increase in economic 
activity related to CNT has occurred over the course of the last ten years (Ullah H et al ., 2014). Since 2006, the global 
capacity for CNT manufacture has expanded by at least a factor of ten, and the number of journal articles and patents 
relating to CNTs that are issued each year continues to increase as well (Fig. 1). 
The vast majority of the carbon nanotubes produced today are destined for use in bulk composite materials and thin 
films. These applications rely on disorganized CNT structures, which have restricted property sets. Organized CNT 
architectures (fig. S1) such as vertically aligned forests, yarns, and sheets have the potential to scale up the properties

characteristics of CNTs and the length scales of bulk engineering materials is beginning to be bridged by organized 
CNT materials such as forests and threads. But it's important to figure out why CNT yarns and sheets don't have the 
same thermal conductivity and mechanical strength as single CNTs. The opposite extreme would be a breakthrough 
for electrical devices and scanning probe tips if individual CNTs with the desired structure could be placed with 
lithographic precision over vast substrates. 
 
Many businesses are reportedly investing in CNTs for use in a wide variety of products, including transparent 
conductors, thermal interfaces, antiballistic jackets, and wind turbine blades, as reported in the media. To make matters 
more complicated, firms tend to keep technological data secret for a long period after commercialization, making it 
hard to foresee how well a product will do in the market. 
 
Since CNT applications are still in their infancy, the growth in nanotube production and sales is a particularly relevant 
indicator. 
Improved quantitative characterization methods that may be incorporated into production processes, as well as health 
and safety regulations for CNT fabrication and use, are essential for the sector's continued industrial development. 
Standards for characterization and management of MWNTs were released in 2010 by the Chinese government , and 
in 2011 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created a SWNT reference material. Bayer took 
precautions by setting an occupational exposure limit for its CNTs at 0.05 mg m-3 (95). These initiatives stress the 
importance of proceeding cautiously, particularly in industries like CNT fabrication that may release airborne 
particulate matter. 
 
It will be important to establish disposal and/or reuse protocols when more CNT materials enter the consumer market. 
Cross-contamination during recycling can occur , unless CNTs are burned before entering municipal waste streams. 
There has to be more collaboration between businesses, universities, and government to fully understand the 
environmental and social effects of CNTs. 
 
Finally, the meteoric rise of graphene will be complemented by ongoing CNT research and development. 
CNT research has been used to inform rapid developments in graphene synthesis and characterization, including CVD 
methods and Raman spectroscopic techniques. 3D carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene networks for thermal interfaces  
and fatigue-resistant graphene-coated CNT aerogels are two examples of promising materials integrating carbon 
allotropes. CNT research and development will continue to advance the state of the art in nanotechnology and related 
commercial goods in areas as diverse as surface chemistry and industrial production.

Abstract 
The jeepney is the most popular kind of public transportation in the Philippines for its accessibility and affordability. 
Over the years, the features of jeepneys have improved through modernization, yet there are still issues, particularly 
in the workstation design, that need to be addressed to reduce the vulnerability of jeepney drivers to work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders. In this study, the working condition of modern jeepney drivers at ABC Transport Service 
and Multi-Purpose Cooperative was assessed through observations with ten (10) drivers using the Rapid Upper Limb 
Assessment and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (focusing on the major processes involved such as driving, reaching, 
and payment), interviews with twenty (20) drivers using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, and the gathering 
of anthropometric measurements of thirty-seven (37) drivers. Results from RULA and REBA showed that medium 
risk was present, requiring further investigation to implement the necessary changes, while the NMQ results revealed 
that 46.11% of the drivers experienced discomfort in at least one body part, of which 46.99% of them had trouble 
during the last seven days prior to the interview. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis showed no significant 
relationship between the NMQ scores and the RULA and REBA scores of the three major positions involved—driving, 
reaching, and payment. The results of these assessments, as well as the anthropometric measurements of the drivers, 
served as the basis for creating an ergonomic design for the workstation that provides greater comfort and safety.

1. Introduction
Commuters’ preference for affordable and accessible rides makes jeepneys the most popular mode of public 
transportation in the Philippines. It is a modified American automobile from World War II that allows millions of 
passengers to board and depart anywhere. About 270,000 franchised jeepney units are in use nationwide, with 75,000 
of those in Metro Manila alone (Kecorius et al. 2017). Along with the nation's rapid development and economic 
growth, the government has unveiled the ""Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) Modernization Program,"" which intends to 
gradually replace jeepneys, buses, and other PUVs that are at least 15 years old with more environmentally friendly, 
more convenient, safer, and improved features (DOTr 2018).  
Though the design of a modern jeepney has improved overall, there is still much room for improvement to provide 
greater comfort and safety, especially to drivers. Jeepney drivers are susceptible to work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders (WMSDs) due to their job demands; therefore, the layout of their workstations influences how their jobs 
affect their health. The researchers were able to notice such scenarios through the conducted observation of the 
working conditions of modern jeepney drivers at ABC Transport Service and Multi-Purpose Cooperative. 
ABC Transport Service and Multi-Purpose Cooperative is a company that provides public transportation services in 
various towns in Quezon Province. The researchers chose to perform their study at the mentioned company as they 
initially observed that some features of the driver's workstation were not ergonomically acceptable. The researchers

Figure 7 adds a more holistic perspective to the proposed ergonomically designed driver’s workstation. 
 
5. Conclusion  
ABC Transport Service and Multipurpose Cooperative has two types of models for modern jeepneys. The movement 
of the driver slightly varies with the model of the unit the driver is using since the location of some controls differs 
from one model to the other. However, the researchers identified that with both models, reaching some controls is one 
of the problems encountered by the drivers during their work. The analysis found that one of the main reasons why 
the drivers experience work-related musculoskeletal pain and perform unsafe postures such as reaching is due to the 
existing design of the workstation, which is not based on the wide range of anthropometric measurements of the 
drivers. 
 
From the scores of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), the result 
shows that further investigation and changes are needed to be implemented. Meanwhile, the Nordic Musculoskeletal 
Questionnaire results revealed that 46.11% of respondents experienced trouble with at least one body part, while 
46.99% of that number had trouble during the last seven (7) days prior to the interview. The researchers determined 
that there is no significant relationship between the result of the assessment using RULA and REBA and the physical 
discomfort experienced by the drivers using the NMQ when correlated.

Abstract 
The regulatory environment of a Major Defense Acquisition Program changes throughout its life cycle, challenging 
generations of leaders to be custodians of corporate knowledge, and make decisions across an enterprise, sometimes 
without a comprehensive view of factors influencing their programs. Tools such as Digital Twins, Digital Engineering, 
Model-Based Systems Engineering, and Modeling & Simulation have utility, but their value to managers is often 
illusive. This paper explores if program decision making can be digitally transformed by applying principles of 
decision science, theory & methods of systems engineering, and practices from business program management, to 
engineer decisions. This cumulative case study describes the background, purpose, method, and conclusions from four 
projects. A digital twin of a project can be constructed by modeling organization processes, digitalizing documents, 
linking live cross functional data, and connecting decisions to data to process. The resulting system has transparent 
processes, dynamic and relevant data models, and useful decision aids. This repository is an enduring, usable body of 
knowledge, linking decisions to the data required, and the business processes that create it. A program digital twin 
supports decision engineering: it identifies decision points, data required for those decisions, and processes necessary 
to produce the data.

6. Conclusion 
The proper goal of digitalization is to make better decisions using quality data from lean processes. It is easy to see 
digitalization merely as a problem of new applications, or the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into processes, 
or new data models depending upon personal perspective or experience. However, none of those solutions alone will 
have sustained or meaningful impact. New models may be better, but may not result in better decisions if disconnected 
from a unified data model. A web services firm may be able to house petabytes of data for decades, but if it is not 
designed for people to use in conjunction with their digital supply chain, its customer value is limited. Using AI as 
support infrastructure to communicate with customers is common, but without integration with the business process, 
it may not deliver value.  
 
Entities have known they should digitalize, but did not know what or how to implement it. A program digital twin 
supports decision engineering: it identifies decision points, data required for those decisions, and processes necessary 
to produce the data.

Abstract 
With the goal to increase production due to the growing demands in the construction industry, small businesses that 
manufacture hollowblocks utilize semi-automatic machines (to support the molding and compacting process) which 
is more financially feasible than adapting large-scale and fully automatic equipment. However, the process still 
requires intensive manual labor and operators exposed to such tasks experience discomfort often manifesting as muscle 
pain, fatigue, and stress. Understanding the discomfort experienced by these workers in relation to physical and 
cognitive workload factors helps in designing work that maximizes productivity while also promoting occupational 
safety and health. In this study, the researchers used the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire to assess 
worker discomfort, the Fatigue Assessment Scale and cycle time measurement to describe physical workload, and the 
NASA-TLX and physiological measurements associated with stress level (pulse rate and blood oxygen level) to 
describe cognitive workload. Results of the Spearman Rank-Order correlation analysis show that CMDQ scores are 
higher in those workers with higher physical workload measurements [FAS score with rs=0.465 (p=0.06) and cycle 
time with rs=0.486 (p=0.048)]. Meanwhile, when correlated against cognitive workload factors, CMDQ scores are 
found to have a positive relationship with raw NASA-TLX score (rs=0.959; p=0.000) and pulse rate (rs=0.435; 
p=0.081), and a negative relationship with blood oxygen level (rs=-0.65; p=0.005). To mitigate workplace hazards 
and ergonomic risks that were found in the semi-automated hollowblock manufacturing sites, the researchers then 
developed an action plan implementing engineering and administrative controls focusing on modifications on the 
equipment, workplace layout, and operating procedures.

1. Introduction
Production of concrete blocks remains relevant in the construction industry – providing a versatile building material 
which basically consists of a mixture of cement, sand, other fine aggregates (optional), and water (Maunahan and 
Adeba, 2021). Compared to conventional bricks, they are relatively cheaper and allow faster construction. With the 
increasing construction activity, the demand for hollowblocks grows, being preferable than solid concrete blocks, for 
its greater tensile strength, cost, and applicability (the hollowness of the block tends to make walls act as thermal 
insulators) (Chaure et al., 2018). Hollowblock production consists of the following fundamental processes: batching 
and mixing, feeding and de-molding, curing, and stacking – all of which can be done manually with specified tools 
and equipment as can be observed in small production sites. However, increasing hollowblock production through 
manual labor on a daily basis can be very challenging, considering the potential health risks that could affect the 
workers who are continuously exposed to such heavy tasks. Integrating semi-automation in the work environment is 
a potential solution to mitigate the risks while also enhancing productivity and worker performance reliability. 
In workplace ergonomics, safety is an important consideration in creating an environment that can streamline critical 
processes and support the welfare of workers simultaneously. When ergonomic hazards are overlooked and neglected,

6. Conclusion 
Physical and cognitive workload factors were found to have correlation to the experienced musculoskeletal discomfort 
of machine operators in semi-automated hollowblock manufacturing sites – implying the importance of addressing 
these risk factors to achieve holistic improvements that can promote occupational safety and health during labor-
intensive processes. To address the workplace hazards and ergonomic risks associated with the development of MSDs, 
the researchers recommend the implementation and continuous improvement of hazard mitigation plans applying both 
the principles of physical and cognitive ergonomics to ensure sustainability.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 has had an enormous effect on the increasing growth and rise of science and technology. Amidst this 
Smart Factories was one of the biggest components for the development of Industry 4.0. Development of smart 
factories are important because it not only contributes towards a faster production rate but also ensure an optimal output 
production. In order to demonstrate some insights regarding the technology currently in use in the domain “A Smart 
Factory in Industry4.0.” The evaluation about the available evaluations of the literature yields some significant findings 
and sheds some insight on the future of an individual smart factory and the rise of Industry4.0. This study report 
includes literature reviews, discussions of the methodologies and our approach to the findings, as well as the findings 
and analysis of our own investigation. The current activities and research connected to smart factories and Industry 4.0 
are reviewed and analyzed in this article, which also identifies the key traits of such factories with an emphasis on 
sustainability. It also proposes a model on IOT driven smart factories. This research paper also suggests some 
techniques about the energy management on the concept of IOT.

1. Introduction
This concept was introduced for the reduction of human efforts and ease in manufacturing (Professor Kagerman, 2013). 
Later this concept was promoted by governments worldwide. But knowing that What exactly is Industry 4.0? 
Consequently, to address this query Industry 4.0 is essentially a concept that emphasizes minimizing human effort and 
having the best possible output in production. This might be accomplished with the aid of a variety of factors, including 
automation, ICT, robotics, digitization, and many more. Additionally, according to sources, the objective behind 
Industry 4.0 was to make Western European economies more competitive. but then Industry 4.0 was promoted so 
worldwide that its effect has been seen in the macro and micro markets (especially in the MSME sectors). Now, what 
exactly is a Smart Factory? So a smart factory concept was introduced to obtain the optimal output and thus 
manufacturing processes were made smart. This concept was named Smart Manufacturing or Smart Processes.

3. Methodology 
Research methodology: This study used a semi-structured interview as the data collecting method and an inductive 
qualitative strategy to accomplish the research goals stated above. The selected research technique is thoroughly 
justified in this part, along with a description of how it was used. 
 
3.1 Data collection 
This study used an inductive methodology since there was a dearth of theory and literature to perform a deductive 
investigation. It is well known that inductive research methods strive to develop theories based on evidence obtained 
making them ideal for investigations concentrating on novel subjects with limited thesis about the data related to the 
topic. Additionally, this study requires the collection of in-depth human views, reviews, consequences and impressions 
in order to analyze connected experimental activity in detail due to the complex structure of big data difficulties in our 
domain. As a result, this inductive study also included semi-structured interviews as a way of gathering qualitative 
data. The management and personnel of most user organizations might not have enough knowledge of the issue under 
inquiry because they are still in the early stages of integrating big data technologies into their brand-new smart factory 
efforts. Therefore, this study was deliberately conducted from the standpoint of an IS consultancy in the hopes that 
seasoned consultants may provide more in-depth views on both big data and the development of smart factories and 
therefore lead to more significant conclusions. 10 SAP project managers and consultants with at least five years of 
expertise in cutting- edge IT implementation projects (including big data, smart factories, CPS, and/or IoT) were 
consequently interviewed. The goal of conducting interviews with experts in diverse roles was to get a range of 
viewpoints on the difficulties in using big data in the context of smart factories. The purpose of the interview questions 
was to learn more about the consultants' prior expertise and experience with big data implementation in general and in 
the context of smart factories in particular. As a result, the interview was divided into three sections, each of which 
was composed of opening, closing, follow-up, and trigger questions. Understanding the interviewee's present position, 
history, and relevant experience was made easier by the first section. The needs for clients/manufacturing organizations 
to deploy the used or found data values and go through the implementation of smart factories were the subject of the 
interview's second section. Additionally, the interviewees were asked to recollect and describe the difficulties and 
adjustments faced by businesses implementing these solutions. The last part of the questionnaire was gathering the 
interviewee’s graphical representation of data. Each interview lasted 50 to 1.5 hours and took place in the participant's 
office at a prearranged time.  
 
3.2 Data Analysis 
Following the theme analysis technique, the research data was analyzed in five steps. In order to grasp the data obtained 
more thoroughly and look for potential trends, the process of analysis began by studying and becoming familiar with 
the researched data. In the next step of coding, a variety of codes were created in a coding system along with pertinent 
phrases. By mixing and merging various codes, the third phase of study focused on developing themes and subthemes 
of big data implementation issues. Therefore, some themes and subthemes were created from all of the discovered 
codes. The following data shows step wise description of process: 
 
 
Knowing the data: Knowing the data through the process of transcription, reading and researching the 
existing data. 
 
 
Developing the data developing coding scheme: All the codes from the data are organized 
systematically for analysis. 
 
 
Solving out codes and identify the themes: Connecting codes into existing themes, gathering all data for 
the development of existing theme. 
 
 
Analyzing themes and setting up a plan: Ensuring the working of themes in relevance to the coded quotes 
and the entire data set, Concept of map analysis gives  
us some important results. 
 
 
Reporting findings: Overall analysis of the gathered data and codes. Finding the implementation of data 
in the existing themes and drawing out conclusions for the development of the topic area.

4. Conclusions 
One of the most quickly evolving and extensively researched areas in response to the recent Fourth Industrial 
Revolution paradigm change is the smart factory. Understanding broad research trends will be necessary for the 
appropriate integration of interdisciplinary study characteristics and technological growth. In this work, we gathered 
research articles on ""smart factories"" and used LSA to extract the underlying themes. Additionally, using a regression 
technique, we examined the research patterns over time. The research has produced a number of significant findings. 
Results specifically showed that method to gather analyze, and utilize big data in smart factories is not a 
straightforward task and is complicated by many organizational, technological, and human factors. More crucially, 
the results revealed that in the reference in field of a smart factory, a large data barrier may frequently be the root of 
or a side effect of other barriers. These identified barriers may be particularly challenging to manage and address 
since they appear to be entwined and connected to one another. The findings of this study have significant 
ramifications for both scholars and practitioners.

aspects have three articles, social aspects have 1 article, while those which discuss economic aspects and 
environmental aspects have 1 article. 
 
5.3 Product Development Process 
The results of the matrix show that research discussing the planning stages in the garment product development process 
by considering all sustainable aspects is found research (Wang, 2019), (Moon et al., 2014), (Goworek G, 2020), 
(Bostrom et al., 2016), (Gomes et al., 2022), (Wang et al., 2021), (Sarwar. et al., 2021), (Gunasekaran et al., 2012), 
and (Karaosman et al., 2016). The economic aspect is found in research (Stal et al., 2018), (Moon et al., 2015), 
(Jorgensen et al., 2012), (Kuo et al., 2014), (Macchion et al., 2017), (Hanouf et al., 2017), (Shen et al. 2017), (Pedro, 
2019). The environmental aspect is found in research (Gloria et al., 2014), while the social aspect is found in research 
(Koksal et al., 2017). 
 
Based on the scope of the discussion carried out by previous research, the research that researchers will carry out is 
the product development process by considering economic, environmental, and social aspects. The sustainable product 
development process is carried out with an agile concept. The goal is to accelerate the response to consumer demand 
for sustainable products. Thus, the company has a strategy to implement an agile sustainable product development 
process. The product development process uses an agile concept to respond to consumer desires. Companies that have 
many product ideas can fulfill consumer desires. If the company has many product ideas, the response to consumers 
can be a short time to make new products. Companies fulfilling consumer desires by responding quickly can increase 
company profits. Many industries have used the agile concept in developing new products because it can increase 
profits (Zasa et al., 2021). 
 
6. Conclusion  
Scopus data shows that the topic of product development has 128 articles, while the topic of agile product development 
has a total of 19 articles. Thus, this research will discuss the agile product development process. Topic about the 
product development process at the planning stage related to sustainability. The topic discusses economic aspects with 
8 articles, environmental aspects with 1 article and social aspects with 1 article. While research that discusses the 
stages of planning with sustainable aspects that consider economic, environmental, social aspects has 9 articles. The 
research that will be carried out by researchers is the product development process by considering economic, 
environmental and social aspects. The sustainable product development process is carried out with an agile concept. 
The goal is to accelerate the response to consumer demand for sustainable products. Thus, the company has a strategy 
to carry out an agile sustainable product development process. The product development process uses an agile concept 
so that it can respond to consumer desires. Companies that have many product ideas can fulfill consumer desires. If 
the company has a number of product ideas, the response to consumers does not require a long time to make new 
products. Companies fulfilling consumer desires by responding quickly can increase company profits.

Abstract 
The primary objective of this project is to create a family car that fills the gap in the market between station wagons 
and sedans through the technical feature of changing its length. Additionally, the project aims to achieve innovation 
that aligns with future trends. The presented methodology is based on IDeS, on which many design tools are 
implemented, such as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Benchmarking (BM), Top Flop Analysis (TPA), stylistic 
design engineering (SDE), prototyping and planning. A market analysis follows to identify the major competitors and 
their key characteristics considering style and technology. The results are used to design an innovative car. Based on 
the most developed stylistic trends, the vehicle is first sketched and then drawn in the 2D and 3D environments for 
prototyping. This result leads to the possibility of 3D printing the actual model as a maquette using the Fused 
Deposition Modelling (FDM). This final application unveils the possibilities of Industry 4.0 as enrichment for SDE 
and in general rapid prototyping.

1. Introduction
Industrial design is the most important phase in the lifetime of a product. The design stage controls the style of the 
components, the costs, the time of production, and the impact on the market. It is important to gather all the information 
possible from customers and start a new project to develop the right car concept from the beginning. Errors in this 
phase will lead to inefficiencies that will affect the budget. Using IDeS, it is possible to develop an innovative 
industrial product by deconstructing the process into phases concerning style, design, optimization, and production. 
Thanks to this methodology, errors are reduced, and the final product result is both innovative and relatively cheap 
since no changes need to be done after the application of the method. Moreover, the usage of technologies such as 
Additive Manufacturing (AM) show that non-expensive solutions for virtual prototyping can be implemented in the 
IDeS process. It is possible to divide the design process into three macro-phases: Setup, Development, and Production 
(Figure 1).

To fully pursue the fast-prototyping philosophy, the model obtained from 3D printing was painted to give the idea of 
a scale reproduction faithful to a hypothetical real model (Figure 14). 
5. Results and Discussion  
By applying a stylistic development of a futuristic and highly innovative hybrid family car, a preliminary analysis 
was possible by means of Stylistic Design Engineering (SDE) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The 
customer requirements for vehicles in the family car sector were compared to benchmark models in the industry, 
achieving a set of innovative parameters known to be useful for mobility in the near future and in urban and extra-
urban traffic. Fast prototyping applied in this work was used as a physical fit analysis to compare the dimensions of 
the scaled car (1:25). This prototyping solution is necessary to improve the design phase before pre-series 
production, aiding to avoid redesign steps which would produce high costs for the overall project management. This 
study was intended to describe the stylistic development of a hybrid, futuristic and highly innovative family car. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Interpreting this study, the applications of the IDeS method have achieved the following objectives: 
• The analysis of the most convincing stylistic trends and the ability to compare them accordingly to established 
product innovation guidelines.  
• A new stylistic idea for an elegant family car drawn using digital sketching.  
• The solid stylistic model (maquette), produced using the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) to save time and 
resources, accurately reproduce the model for preliminary assessment to confirm the proportions, aesthetic 
guidelines, and other characteristics of the final product. 
As future development it could be useful to create an augmented reality environment to be experienced through a 
virtual reality visor. This should be useful in evaluating ergonomics, view angles and to have an additional idea on 
the car real dimensions other than the one given by the scaled physical maquette.

Abstract 
Online food delivery applications are one of the fastest growing mobile applications sectors. During the pandemic, 
many traditional food delivery services have moved to online platforms, and there are new companies taking 
advantage of this opportunity to engage in online food delivery operations or move to digital platforms. This study 
aim to examine the relationships between variable that influences the usage of online food delivery applications by 
developing a conceptual model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) 
model with customer satisfaction and advocacy as an additional variable in our analysis. Data were collected from 
366 respondents using an online survey and analyzed using PLS-SEM. 9 hypotheses were developed, of which eight 
were accepted, and one were rejected. Our findings can be used to help online food delivery companies to 
understand the factor that might influence the continuance intention of customer to the food delivery app and it will 
have implication for the design and marketing of these services in the Indonesian market.

1. Introduction
Numerous companies have introduced mobile applications as part of their business strategy to tap into the market 
and entice customers. One of the most rapidly expanding sectors in terms of mobile apps is online food delivery 
platforms (Kumar and Shah 2021). The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has led to the widespread 
adoption and reliance on online food delivery applications, proving to be incredibly beneficial. This is especially 
true as the virus continues to spread rapidly across countries worldwide (Pan et al. 2020). Amidst the pandemic, 
numerous traditional food delivery services have transitioned to online platforms. Additionally, several new 
companies have seized the opportunity to participate in online food delivery operations or shift their existing 
operations to digital platforms in response to the ongoing pandemic (Lattani 2020). According to Katadata Insight 
Center (KIC) (2021), the data revealed the percentage of internet users who utilized food delivery applications in 
2020. The findings indicated that Indonesia had the highest percentage, with 74.4 percent of internet users engaging 
with food delivery applications within a span of one year. In the aftermath of the pandemic, as the world gradually 
recovers, there is a resurgence in social and economic activities. Connectivity remains crucial in shaping people's 
lifestyles and the functioning of businesses. With the aid of high-speed and high-performance networks, digital 
services will gain even more significance, becoming deeply integrated into society in the post-pandemic era (GSMA 
2022). Based on the data from Katadata Insight Center (KIC) in 2022, the percentage of consumers with food 
delivery applications on their mobile phones reveals that in Indonesia, 41 percent of consumers possess more than 
two applications, 31 percent have two applications, and 28 percent have just one food delivery application installed 
on their mobile devices. The competition among online food delivery applications is intense, emphasizing the 
importance of understanding customer expectations. The industry is undergoing a significant digital transformation 
on a large scale, and it's crucial to sustain this transformation in the long run. Since online food delivery apps serve 
as a bridge between restaurants, food service companies, and consumers, it is vital for businesses to continue 
utilizing these apps both during and after the pandemic to maintain their presence and cater to evolving consumer 
needs. Several studies have been carried out in the field of online food delivery. However, a literature review 
conducted by Shankar et al. (2022) reveals a gap in publications discussing online food delivery specifically in 
Indonesia. Building upon this context, the aim of this study is to analyze the factors influencing the usage of online 
food delivery applications in Indonesia, utilizing the UTAUT2 model while incorporating additional variables such

Based on the test results, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
 
1. Performance expectancy (PE) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.179, p < 0.05). 
2. Effort expectancy (EE) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.260, p < 0.05). 
3. Social influence (SI) does not have a significant effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = -0.026, p > 0.05). 
4. Facilitating conditions (FC) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.146, p < 0.05). 
5. Hedonic motivation (HM) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.208, p < 0.05). 
6. Price value (PV) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.207, p < 0.05). 
7. Habit (HA) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.116, p < 0.05). 
8. Satisfaction (SA) has a significant positive effect on continuance intention (CI) (Coefficient = 0.585, p < 0.05). 
9. Satisfaction (SA) has a significant positive effect on advocacy (AD) (Coefficient = 0.518, p < 0.05). 
 
Therefore, the hypotheses H3, H2, H1b, H1f, H1a, H1e, H1g, and H1d are accepted, indicating significant 
relationships between the respective variables. However, hypothesis H1c is rejected as the relationship between 
social influence (SI) and satisfaction (SA) is not significant. These findings provide insights into the factors that 
influence customer satisfaction, continuance intention, and advocacy in the context of online food delivery 
applications. 
 
5.2 Graphical Results 
In addition, the majority of respondents in our study were graduates or bachelor degree holders, indicating a certain 
level of education among online food delivery application users. Furthermore, the occupation distribution shows a 
significant number of private employees and students among the respondents. Regarding the usage of specific online 
food delivery applications, Gojek emerged as the most popular choice among respondents, followed by Grab and 
Shopee. This highlights the dominant presence of these platforms in the online food delivery market in Indonesia. 
The data also revealed that the frequency of application usage varies, with a substantial portion of respondents using 
the application multiple times a week. This indicates a frequent and habitual use of online food delivery applications 
among the respondents. In terms of income, a significant portion of respondents reported having an income between 
5 to 10 million rupiah, followed by an income of more than 10 million rupiah. This suggests that online food 
delivery applications cater to a diverse range of income levels. The average expenditure on the applications in a 
month was found to be relatively low, with the majority of respondents spending less than 500 thousand rupiah. This 
indicates that online food delivery applications offer affordability and cost-effectiveness to users. Overall, these 
findings paint a positive picture of the popularity, adoption, and satisfaction with online food delivery applications 
among consumers in Indonesia. The widespread usage and positive experiences reported by respondents emphasize

the significance of these applications in the daily lives of individuals and the potential for continued growth in the 
online food delivery industry. 
 
5.3 Discussion 
Previous studies (Zanetta et al. 2021, Roh and Park 2019, Yeo et al. 2017, Zhao and Bacao 2020) have found that 
performance expectancy (PE) has a significant impact on satisfaction (SA) in online food delivery applications. The 
availability of a variety of restaurants and the ease of choice provided by the app motivate its usage (Ray et al. 
2019). Effort expectancy (EE) also significantly affects satisfaction (SA) according to studies by Ray et al. (2019) 
and Zhao and Bacao (2020). However, social influence (SI) does not significantly impact satisfaction (SA) as 
individuals tend to make food choices independently and are less influenced by recommendations (Ray et al. 2019). 
Facilitating condition (FC), supported by technical and human assistance, is important for customer satisfaction, 
without which users may not have a satisfactory experience (Elvandari et al. 2017, Lu et al. 2008, Morris et al. 
2005). Hedonic motivation (HM), price value (PV), and habit (HA) significantly influence satisfaction (SA) as 
identified in previous studies (Zanetta et al. 2021, Alalwan 2020, Elvandari et al. 2017). Satisfaction (SA) further 
impacts continuance intention (CI) and advocacy (AD) as users who perceive the benefits of the app are more likely 
to support it in the future (Fakfare 2021, Ray et al. 2019, Yeo et al. 2017). 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study presents a model based on UTAUT2 to analyze factors influencing online food delivery app usage, 
including satisfaction and advocacy. The model is tested using PLS-SEM and yields reliable and valid results. 
Factors such as effort expectancy (EE), price value (PV), performance expectancy (PE), hedonic motivation (HM), 
habit (HA), and facilitating condition (FC) significantly impact customer satisfaction (SA). Additionally, customer 
satisfaction (SA) significantly influences continuance intention (CI) and advocacy (AD) for the app. These findings 
offer valuable insights for improving services and enhancing customer satisfaction and app usage in the online food 
delivery industry.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to provide small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a comprehensive guide that 
can be used to implement Lean Manufacturing (LM). Small businesses face challenges when implementing LM, but 
its benefits are also highlighted in the introduction. LM implementation guide and effectiveness assessment are the 
objectives. The literature review assesses LM frameworks, adoption, models, and success. In order to develop the 
research methodology, relevant studies on LM implementation in manufacturing SMEs were reviewed. The results 
discuss models and approaches for adopting LM and also measuring its success.  A lack of standardized models and 
the importance of real case studies are highlighted in the conclusion. Specifically, it calls for further research on LM 
implementation in SMEs in the United States. As well as providing practical guidance for organizations seeking to 
implement LM effectively, this paper contributes to the understanding of LM implementation in SMEs.

1. Introduction
The Lean Manufacturing (LM) philosophy has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its potential to 
improve efficiency, reduce waste, and increase profitability in companies’ supply chain. A supply chain is made up 
of the facilities, functions, and activities involved in producing and delivering products and services from suppliers to 
customers (Soltani et al. 2023).  
After World War II, Toyota's Taiichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda developed LM in response to the country's limited 
resources and need for efficient production. Through standardized work, just-in-time production, and continuous 
improvement, the Toyota Production System eliminated waste and enhanced quality. LM principles have evolved and 
expanded beyond the manufacturing industry (Womack & Jones, 2003) to include healthcare and services. Lean 
implementation, however, is not a simple process. It can affect an organization's resources as well as its employees. 
As a result of implementing Lean, an organization needs to develop a collaborative and cross-functional mindset, 
rather than a traditional siloed approach (AlManei et al., 2017a). 
Many SMEs face challenges when implementing LM, despite its potential benefits. Even though Lean is popular 
among large manufacturing companies, it may not apply equally to small and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs often 
lack resources, expertise, and an understanding of Lean principles. Therefore, while SMEs are eager to adopt Lean 
practices, they may find it difficult to stay competitive in highly competitive markets (Sahoo & Yadav, 2018a; de 
Oliveira & Junior, 2019a). 
In order to guide organizations toward successful implementation of Lean, various roadmaps and frameworks have 
been developed. In most cases, these frameworks involve integrating Lean principles into an organization's strategy, 
culture, and operations. In some frameworks, training and development of employees are also emphasized, as well as 
the involvement of external experts or consultants (AlManei et al., 2017b).

by Company A, a small company. For improving competitiveness in SMEs, predictive simulation analytics of VSM 
are an appropriate analytical tool for implementing LM. Based on the paper's conclusions, the framework of LM 
should be designed for SMEs with predictive simulation analytics of VSM. 
 
Caldera et al. (2019) developed a 3P model for lean and green strategy that presents four steps for SMEs to engage in 
sustainable business practices. The authors conducted case studies with potential SMEs in Queensland and found that 
the model, which includes a 3P matrix, can guide SMEs to use the best tools and processes based on their 
circumstances and aspirations. The four steps include exploring, prioritizing, investing, and monitoring and evaluating. 
The model can be used iteratively, and senior decision makers in the case studies emphasized that it should be inspired 
by the PDCA cycle. The authors conclude that their model provides a useful guide for SMEs to engage in sustainable 
business practices and to address strategic work areas through systematic trialing and integration of tools.

of LM in SMEs. Each model or framework is accompanied by a brief description, implementation phases or steps,

5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, it is clear that SMEs play a critical role in the economy, and effective implementation LM can contribute 
significantly to their growth. Through the review of recent models for implementing LM in SMEs and approaches to 
measure its success, this research has shed light on the potential benefits of this methodology for SMEs. However, a 
gap in research exists in the form of real case studies, which can provide practical insights for SMEs in implementing 
LM. While some case studies have been conducted around the world, most research remains theoretical. Therefore, 
future research should focus on gathering real data and conducting case studies on real companies to help SMEs in 
implementing LM. 
 
There is also a lack of standardized models available to assess the success of LM implementation in SMEs. Many 
studies have relied on survey-based methods to conclude whether LM implementation has been successful or not. To 
better evaluate the impact of LM on SMEs, future research should focus on developing comprehensive models that 
take into account various factors that contribute to operational efficiency and waste reduction. Such models can help 
SMEs to better evaluate their LM implementation, identify areas for improvement, and optimize their processes for 
maximum efficiency. 
 
Furthermore, it is concerning that the research on LM in SMEs in the US is lacking despite SMEs making up 99 
percent of the US manufacturing sector. Most of the research conducted in this area dates back to the 1990s, and the 
few existing studies are insufficient to address the current challenges faced by SMEs. Therefore, more research is 
needed in this area to provide practical insights for SMEs in the US to implement LM effectively.

Aligning Manufacturing Flow Control Techniques with the 
product-process matrix: A review for research

Abstract 
Many Manufacturing Flow Control Techniques (MFCTs) have been proposed, and selecting an appropriate one to 
implement can be challenging. Comparing their performances could also be tricky because, by design, many are not 
likely to perform similarly under different conditions. This work aggregates and maps the MFCTs to a standard 
planning and control artefact to provide guidance on selection and implementation of the techniques. It builds on a 
previously published work. The hermeneutics double loop review procedure with snowballing approach was the 
overarching method, initiated using partial umbrella review. The product-process matrix was used as the basis for 
alignment of the MFCTs to the manufacturing processes. 
MFCTs were summarised into a few groups using the characteristics of the production system, products and demand 
pattern. Mapping the groups to the product-process matrix enhances the selection of appropriate control techniques 
for manufacturing environments. It also helps in anticipating the performance of the techniques under specified 
manufacturing conditions. Leading MFCTs and their notable variations considered to be representative of others were 
selected based on literature. All variants were grouped using characteristics considered important from literature. 
There may be some other ways of creating the groups. 
The only work known to have linked the MFCTs to processes was published in 1989, and there has been many new 
techniques and variants of existing ones since then. This work expands on this foundation to provide a more 
comprehensive mapping, thereby helping researchers and practitioners to achieve a more structured implementation 
of the techniques and compare their performances.

1. Background
Manufacturing Flow Control (MFC), also called production control, is an important function of the production system. 
It is different from priority scheduling, and its main goal is the control of job release based on the shop floor situation 
(Graves et al., 1995). It significantly affects the throughput rate, production lead time and the level of the Work-In 
Process (WIP) inventory in the system. Many MFCTs have been proposed in literature, but some of are more widely 
applied. For instance, Graves et al. discussed Material Requirement Planning (MRP), Kanban, CONstant Work In 
Process (CONWIP), Work Load Control (WLC), Starvation Avoidance, Workload Regulating, BORA (a German 
abbreviation) and Base Stock (BS). Bagni et al (2021) stated that MRP, Kanban, CONWIP, Drum-Buffer-Rope 
(DBR), Periodic Batch Control, WLC, and Pared-cells Overlapping Loops of Cards with Authorisation (POLCA) 
were the classics at the turn of the millennium, while COntrol of BAlance by CArd BAsed NAvigation 
(COBACABANA) and Demand Driven MRP (DDMRP) are the newer but accepted post-millennium techniques. 
MFCTs have different views about how decisions should be made. Such decisions may be system related, like the 
level of centralisation of control, important parameter(s) to monitor (WIP, throughput, etc), or the main system 
objective(s) (cost, service level, etc). Their adaptability also differs under different scenarios involving demand 
behaviour (relatively predictable or variable; dependent or independent; individual or aggregate), and the product 
nature (functional or innovative), amongst others. How each MFC technique (MFCT) makes decisions, considering

From the Foundational Theories to the Prospects of the

Abstract 
A review of the principles and techniques for Manufacturing Flow was made from the earlier Reorder Point (RoP) to 
the Demand Driven Materials Requirement Planning (DDMRP). The hermeneutics double loop review procedure was 
used to progressively analyse and build the body of knowledge, following a chronology of key events and challenges 
leading from ROP to DDMRP. Some key principles of the DDMRP were presented in response to some of these 
challenges, followed by a discussion of opportunities for research that exists in the implementation of DDMRP. 
Findings show that there are opportunities to strengthen the theoretical underpinning of this technique rather than 
depending mainly on the experiential judgment of those implementing it. Also, more efforts need to be invested in 
how to understand the similarities of the different MFC techniques so as to create a more integrated and responsive 
approach, rather than focusing on their differences as seems to be currently done in most research. In addition, making 
inventory decisions independent of extant capacity considerations (and vice versa) is unlikely to produce an optimal 
result, hence, the need for a more integrated approach to the planning and control of the manufacturing system. The 
main limitation to this research is that not all existing MFC have been reviewed, but only those that may be considered 
as foundational to the evolution of the DDMRP logic, hence, the motivation for the selection of the review approach 
as well. This can be expanded in subsequent studies, where more comparative studies can be done.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing Flow Control (MFC) is a difficult decision. Often, process managers have to make trade off in many 
ways because there is no easy solution to the complicated system this problem portends with its numerous interacting 
issues: e.g. ensuring product availability while saving costs; utilising capacity while limiting explosive inventory 
growth; responding quickly to customers while managing long manufacturing lead time; making products to stock or 
commencing manufacturing only when demand is known; and many other related problems. Many techniques have 
been proposed to manage the flow of materials to achieve organisational goals while balancing these multi-faceted 
objectives in magical manner. One of the most recent techniques that is getting popular is the Demand Driven Material 
Requirement Planning (DDMRP). The testament to its acceptance includes the facts that respected organisations like 
the Association of Supply Chain Management (ASCM, formed from many popular organisations like the American 
Production and Inventory Management Society, APICS; Supply Chain Council, SCC; and some others) have 
embraced it, and a number of leading Enterprise Systems vendors (e.g. SAP) are beginning to implement it in their 
offerings. 
Every MFC (e.g. Lean Manufacturing (LM), Theory of Constraints (TOC), Constant Work in Process (CONWIP), 
Paired-Cell Overlapping Loop with Card Authorisation (POLCA), Control of Balance by Card Based Navigation 
(COBACABANA), and even the Re-Order Point principle, RoP, and DDMRP) has some built in philosophies that 
guide its operations, such as the treatment of capacity and stock, financial accounting principles, making to stock or 
to order, planning with forecast or actual demand (or some mix), and many other issues. There have always been 
arguments about which technique works best under different conditions. The question, probably, should rather change 
to how do we exploit the strengths to mitigate the weaknesses of each of these techniques, and how do we build a 
resilient system based on this hybridisation. This literature study seeks to trace the evolution of many MFC techniques,

mechanism for extracting all their relevant quantiles in the form of online functions and their inverses (or even tables) 
would be very valuable to advance the efforts of jointly managing safety stock and reordering of stocks for decoupling 
the various integrated systems based on the DLT. Such efforts may later advance to giving consideration to several 
shock events that may occur within the DLT considerations. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research traces the evolution of the major philosophies of operations management from RoP to DDMRP using 
the hermeneutics approach for literature review. It clarifies that the RoP logic is still very relevant as the reliable model 
for the estimate of Safety Stock and LT demand in all inventory management environments. It discusses organisational 
slacks and their relevance for stability due to demand and process variations, and their interchangeability when 
buffering to support material flow in a production planning environment. It emphasises that research emphasis should 
be on integration of the philosophies rather than differences in performance that seems to be the current focus with 
the superiority being flaunted based on possibly selective performance measures. It, therefore, considers the DDMRP 
as good progress due to its integrated approach and identifies the current gaps in its implementation. It identifies key 
characteristics of the philosophies that may foster their integration and suggests which areas researchers may consider 
to provide theoretical bases for such integration.

Abstract 
The aim of this research assessed the impact of internal business factors and the external operating environment on 
the performance of business organisations. The external and internal resource factors were modelled as higher-order 
factors, and the impact of the moderating effect of the internal business factors on the relationship between external 
factors and the performance of business organizations was analysed. The survey questionnaire was sent to over 380 
companies. 146 responses (38 percent) were received. The data was analysed using Smart PLS 3. The results indicated 
that external resources have a direct and positive impact on the performance of business organisations and that the 
internal organisational resource factors have a positive moderating effect on the relationship between the external 
business environment and the performance of business organisations in South Africa.

1. Introduction
Business organisations are faced with a multitude of challenging factors that include access to finance, access to 
markets, and access to adequate resources to manage and build effective operations that deliver value to their 
customers and stakeholders (Husso & Nybakk, 2010). These factors are due to the environment in which they operate, 
but the impact they have on the performance and continuity of the business may depend on how the business 
organisation may have structured and used its internal resources as production factors (Cho & Mun, 2013). The 
intensification of competition among organisations and the operating environment uncertainties may drive the less 
competitive organisations out of business. Their lack of competitiveness may be due to having limited or inappropriate 
resources, and these businesses may find themselves under strain as they strive to survive economic hardships and 
remain profitable, which results in the likelihood of having to close their businesses (Lussier & Halabi, 2010; Van 
Auken et al., 2009). Porter (1980) states that the competitive advantage from sustainable and superior resources of the 
firm can help to guard against external forces emanating from the market conditions and the pressure from other 
organisations operating in the same market space (Campbell & Park, 2016). Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic 
threatened the lives of many people around the world and businesses suffered a similar fate, where they might have 
had to suspend operations due to economic activities across the globe coming to a halt. Many businesses realised that 
they could not get back into operation when the national economies started opening up again. The Covid pandemic is 
one of those adversities businesses had to endure, and to many organisations, this meant closing permanently due to 
a lack of access to market, unsecure financial support, or total lack of access to (or not having the right) resources to 
keep their businesses sustained and profitable. 
By design, organisations are structured to generate and deliver value to their stakeholders, which includes their 
customers (Hamilton & Dobbs, 2006). The creation of value requires adequate resource availability in various forms 
and compositions. Without (or with limited) resources, businesses may find it difficult to generate and deliver the 
required values, whether in the form of products or services, because resources are both an input for, and driver of,

suggests that further business performance improvement should be done through the implementation of strong 
technological upgrades of the downstream businesses in the industry it operates in. Policy and business industries 
should be aimed at improving and upgrading of the technology infrastructures to enable stronger supplier chain 
networks which should translate into subsequent better performance of individual business organisations within that 
industry; RSI7: “Public-Private Partnership within our related and supporting industries is strong”. This variable 
suggests that for business organisations to improve their performance and become more competitive, there need to be 
intentional but effective Private-Public partnerships in place. This emphasizes the need to have economic and 
development policies that are geared towards fostering economic development through private-public partnerships; 
SC2: “Our organisation’s network connections are diverse”. The social capital constructs outlined above suggest that 
for better performance of business orgnisations, businesses must drive for better diversification of their network 
channels, and form meaningful associations within the industry they operate in which will, in turn, drive better 
influence within the industry to enable higher business performance and gain more power within the supply chain 
network.  
 
5.4 Validation: Importance – Performance Map Analysis 
In efforts to further understand the results of the study, an Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) (Ringle 
& Sarstedt, 2016) was applied. IPMA extends the standard PLS-SEM results reporting path coefficient estimates and 
other parameters by adding a procedure that considers the performance level of latent variables and manifest 
variables in a PLS-SEM analysis (Hair et al., 2016). The application of IPMA provides insights into the importance 
of the variables to the target construct in the study. The results of the IPMA allow for prioritization of the variables 
which is to be improved upon to improve the target construct.  
 
The guidelines provided by Ringle and Sarstedt (2016) were utilized in conducting the analysis. Consequently, the 
latent variable (LV) importance index and constructs’ performance are shown in Tables 8 & 9. In the absence of the 
internal factors as a moderating variable, the IPMA results for the lower-order constructs reveal that social capital 
(SC), factor conditions (FC), and related & supporting industries (RSI) as the three most important variables, 
respectively. See Figure 4. The first-order importance-performance is presented in Table 7. According to the results, 
the IPMA shows some latent variables demonstrating high importance and relatively low performance, such as social 
capital (importance = 0.265, performance = 60.226); factor conditions (importance = 0.199, performance = 48.522); 
and related & supporting industries (importance = 0.135, performance = 57.785). 
 
The presence of the internal factors as a moderating variable in the IPMA analysis for the higher order constructs 
shows complimenting results that indicate that demand condition is the most important construct offering higher 
performance than other lower - (first-) order constructs (Table 8).  
 
The indicators’ importance-performance is presented in Figure 5. The IPMA results indicates some manifest variables 
demonstrating large importance and relatively low performance, such as RSI1: “Technology upgrade of our 
downstream industries is strong” (importance = 0.037, performance = 60.959); RSI2:” R&D investment by our service 
providers in their organisation is extensive” (importance = 0.037, performance = 58.219); RSI4:”Product and service 
development of our downstream industries is strong” (importance = 0.041, performance = 61.815); RSI7: “Public-
Private Partnership within our related and supporting industries is strong” (importance = 0.032, performance = 
51.541); SC2: “Our organisation’s network connections are diverse” (importance = 0.041, performance = 64.897); 
SC5: “Our organisation has great associations with our industry counterparts” (importance = 0.038, performance = 
61.473); and SC7: “Our organisation has strong influence within our industry” (importance = 0.036, performance = 
55.993). Additionally, Figure 5 shows that the importance levels of indicators of external factors are closely 
interrelated, ranging between 0.030 and 0.042 with performance ranges from 51.541 to 75.171. Importance levels of 
indicators of internal factors range between 0.007 and 0.02 with performance ranging from 35.103 to 72.774.  
 
6. Conclusion  
To the best knowledge of the researcher, this is the first empirical study conducted to analyse the moderating effect of 
internal factors on the relationship between the external business environment factors and the performance of business 
organisations in a developing country, where South Africa was taken as a case study, using integrated porter’s diamond 
model and the RB theory factors as designed in the study’s operative model. The findings suggested that external 
factors, such as market demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and social capital, have a direct and 
positive impact on the performance of organisations. In addition, the study indicated that the internal business factors 
of an organisation have a direct effect on how the external factors are leveraged to drive business performance. The

limitation of the research was that the sample was only limited to South African business organisations from various 
industries. The study can be extended to business organisations in other developing countries.

Abstract
  The production of electrical energy can have a series of consequences on the environment, which justifies the urgent and 
mandatory use of renewable energy. Morocco, thanks to its energy strategy, represents a great model for the integration of 
renewable energies to meet the growing energy needs. In our study, we will focus on photovoltaic (PV) systems with 
storage dedicated to the residential sector. This type of energy is characterized by its easy integration, especially for simple 
consumers. The abundance of solar energy in the country is also a very promising factor. In our research, two technical and 
economic parameters are identified to choose the most appropriate configuration for a grid-connected PV system in 
Marrakech.

1. Introduction
Several studies have been conducted by a group of researchers to optimize solar energy systems. A set of parameters should 
be considered from the smallest to the largest and the goal remains always the optimization of this type of system. Solar 
energy attracts the interest of many researchers and manufacturers. To meet the growing energy needs, the use of solar 
energy stays a priority option knowing its advantages in terms of availability, cost and efficiency. The article (Kabir et 
al.,2018) presented the different advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of solar energy technologies. 
Among the factors that can be acted upon to optimize renewable energy systems are the appropriate composition and 
configurations. The configurations can consider as an example the location and the type of photovoltaic panels, the paper 
(Yoomak et al.,2019 ) discussed and presented the performance of a PV system installed in a set of regions in Thailand in 
order to identify the most suitable location, three types of photovoltaic panels were also compared including 
monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film. The results showed for example that the central region has higher solar 
power generation capacity than other regions and that thin-film solar panels are not suitable for solar roof systems. Other 
researchers have focused on the nature of the renewable energy system to identify the appropriate configuration. In the 
article (Okonkwo et al. ,2020), for example, two types of installations were analyzed: a hybrid PV/battery/wind system and 
a grid-connected system in terms of capital cost, replacement cost and operating cost. It was shown that the hybrid system 
is more beneficial in terms of cost and even energy production. 
The optimization of these systems is also based on the technical and economic evaluation. This evaluation depends on each 
type of solar installation with its own constraints and its own parameters and functions, which leads to different results (Li 
et al.,2019) (Merei et al. , 2016 )( Qiu et al. , 2019 ).

Figure 6. Comparison between the technical and economic efficiency of the three configurations 
 
  According to the different results presented, the most efficient configuration is the one that corresponds to the minimum 
of the two mentioned parameters 𝑬𝑬𝒕𝒕  et 𝑬𝑬𝒄𝒄 . The most technically efficient configuration is configuration 3 and the most 
economically efficient is configuration 2. If we consider the technical and economic gain in parallel, the configuration 2 
would be the most appropriate. 
 
4. Conclusion  
In this paper, we have analyzed the response of three possible configurations for a grid-connected photovoltaic installation, 
considering a normal sizing, a sizing with increased storage capacity and a sizing with increased photovoltaic field. 
Technically, the increase in photovoltaic production had a beneficial impact on the system. Economically, more storage is 
needed because the price of the excess in our case is not taken into account. It should also be noticed that the economic 
parameter 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 can change, especially the formula in other countries, especially with the existence of feed-in tariffs. The 
feed-in tariffs and net metering processes are still being developed and improved (Wonsuk et al. ,2019, Zander et al.,2021) 
(Rehman et al., 2020, Le et al. 2022).

Abstract 
Despite the shortage of individuals completing STEM degrees in the United States, the degree alone is not enough. 
Employers seek associates that join teams and immediately add value. Recent graduates unable to express technical 
concepts or ideas adequately amongst their peers will be excluded. After spending more than two years in a virtual 
world during COVID, interpersonal skills are vitally necessary to build and maintain working relationships. Today's 
work environment is highly collaborative. Communication, problem-solving, and networking are no longer soft skills; 
they have become foundational. The term foundational has been intentionally selected to describe this skill set 
indicated by employers as must-haves for future employees. Students that earn STEM degrees but do not develop 
foundational skills often find themselves unemployed despite the numerous unfilled positions in Engineering, 
Cybersecurity, Computer Science, Healthcare Analytics, and Digital Technology. This phenomenon is even more 
pronounced with underrepresented minorities (URM) and First-Generation students. This presentation will share a 
mini-case study of individuals that have developed tremendous technical skills but have been overlooked due to poor 
execution of foundational skills. Building on these experiences, the presenters will share tactical strategies to help 
students prepare to enter the workforce as graduation approaches. Participants will leave with a roadmap for the 
highest probability of success. This paper discusses the critical importance of professional development in STEM

The Inaugural Faculty - Who Starts a New College During a 
Pandemic?

Abstract 
An academic start-up is truly entrepreneurial. The entire landscape of higher education is changing. Most public 
universities are not for profit businesses, but they still require customers and cash flow.   Starting a new college during 
a pandemic requires flexibility, adaptability, and resilience, as well as a willingness to navigate uncertainty and change. 
A regional midwestern university took on this challenge in 2021 and has interesting lessons learned as it flourishes. 
The College of Innovation and Technology was launched with masks still required. Two years later the masks are off, 
and the unit is thriving. The college embraced the polytechnic learning model with heavy emphasis on student 
engagement in STEM. This paper discusses the brave undertaking and its perceived obstacles for success. Social 
distancing and other safety measures in place made it challenging for students to build connections and establish a 
sense of community with their peers and instructors initially. It was important for students to stay informed, stay 
connected with their peers and instructors.  Extensive support, technology, and resources were availed when needed. 
Today corporate partners are supportive and awaiting the first graduates of the newly created majors.

Abstract 
Quality is defined predominantly as one of the companies’ key processes. It’s declined on many structural levels and 
interacts necessarily with other functions in order to achieve the overall performance of the system. The purpose of 
quality management is to maintain a desired level of excellence in production and services in order to satisfy the 
customer. However, the concept of quality as we know it today has not been the same, it has undergone enormous 
changes starting with quality control and focusing today on achieving the global excellence of the company. In this 
context, this paper will describe the evolution of quality control as a key factor in the company and how we can 
transform this concept to global performance by using fuzzy logic as a new approach for reasoning and taking into 
account operator experience and uncertain information to describe a manufacture system and then optimize its 
performance in term of product quality and process reliability. 
Keywords 
Quality control, Total quality management, Fuzzy logic. 
1. Introduction
In a quickly changing economic context, the major challenge for the companies was always to continue improving 
their competitiveness and continuously dominating their market share. Therefore, companies focused more and more 
on the criteria of industrial performance, which is mainly linked to the customer, namely cost, time, quality, and 
service to meet the increased requirements of the end customer. 
In this context, quality has become today a very popular notion in human culture towards products as an important 
goal since the needs of consumers have been integrated into the decision loop. Quality is currently considered as the 
main and strategic function of the company to raise new challenges for the global competitive position. Quality has 
also become an necessary element to ensure that a company's products meet the needs of its customers, regardless of 
their field of activity or size. Therefore, this observation requires permanent improvement of all their processes to 
guarantee the expected performance, reliability and to achieve customer satisfaction, in order to ensure their 
sustainability and their technological monitoring. 
From this point, quality should be considered as a key business process which is integrated with other processes 
such as the production process and the maintenance process. It should not be limited to a particular function or a 
single department of the company.

Statistical process control techniques, especially control charts, are popular tools for tracking and analyzing the 
quality improvement process. Control charts measure against the centerline and upper and lower control limits of a 
process and allow corrective action to be taken based on lean six sigma principles.  
 
However, this may not be very adequate when the quality characteristics include properties requiring the use of 
linguistic variables (for example, very poor, poor, average, good, and very good) rather than simply identifying them 
as conform or non-conform (José et al. 2020).  
 
When humans subjectivity play an important role in defining quality characteristics, traditional control charts cannot 
be applied because they require precise data. By applying fuzzy logic to control charts, flexibility in control limits 
becomes possible, which is not possible in traditional control charts, where control limits are more inflexible. This 
fact gives managers more options and flexibility in the management of production processes, markets and customers 
(Gülbay et al. 2004). 
 
8. Introduction to fuzzy logic applied to quality management 
Humans have the ability to think continuously, they make decisions based on what they see in their environment and 
based on their unique experience. Thus, their thoughts cannot enter into the logic usually used by computer tools, 
namely binary logic. To capture all the inaccuracies inherent in human thought, some scientists such as Professor 
Zadeh have developed a new logic with the help of many mathematical tools : fuzzy logic.  
 
The modeling of a fuzzy system must take into account human logic which is complex and relative to managing a 
imperfect knowledge. This loss of information may be due to inaccuracies or uncertainties during observations or to 
a lack of rigor during modeling or due to a bad approach in the processing of the data. 
 
These imperfections can be from different natures, which there are three main ones : 
• 
Uncertainty : there is doubt about the validity of a knowledge, this can come from a lack of reliability in 
relation to the intermediary or in case of forecasts ; 
• 
Imprecision : this notion refers to the incomplete description of a state of reality by a proposition ; 
• 
Incompleteness : the inability to obtain certain information results in an absence of knowledge. The phrase 
""the majority of companies in this sector achieve margins of around 25%"" illustrates the incompleteness 
problem well, since the company in question is not necessarily part of the majority. 
• 
 
In classical logic, these imperfections in knowledge imply the elimination of data because they couldn’t be added in 
mathematical model which is based on certain data, while fuzzy logic will make it possible to process them and thus 
preserve the information they contain. Even if the goal is to have the simplest representation possible, a balance 
must be struck between keeping imperfect knowledge for their additional information and not over complicating the 
model for better handling.  
 
Modeling systems by using fuzzy logic is a powerful technique for non-linear, uncertain and sophisticated systems 
because normal modeling methods can not be applied to fuzzy data and numbers. Fuzzy models use logical 
connectors to establish qualitative relationships between model’s variables. This structure makes the models clear 
for interpretation and analysis. The fuzzy approach is based on uncertain linguistic expressions rather than 
probabilistic, statistical or numerical perturbation approaches (Abdüsselam et al. 2005). 
 
9. Discussion and Conclusion 
Quality has undergone enormous changes since its appearance from the first civilities. It has moved from the pursuit 
of compliance to the pursuit of excellence in rapidly changing industrial fields. Quality in the company is considered 
as a process that fits into the different structural levels of the company. At each structural level, this process brings 
together a set of quality activities that take place either in the design level of this process or in its operational one. 
These quality activities are supported by the implementation of quality approaches, methodologies and methods 
which, in general, represent means to operate the activities.  
 
However, the past decade has seen significant advancements in connectivity, mobility, analytics, scalability, and 
data. There is even talk of the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0, the industry has digitized its operations 
and, in doing so, transformed its efficiency, the performance of the supply chain and innovation. This revolution 
813","Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

even gave birth to completely new economic models. This is a solid foundation for overhauling quality management 
4.0 is not so much about technology but how it improves culture, collaboration, skills and leadership for improving 
organizational performance and gain operational efficiency excellence.

Abstract 
Today, almost everywhere in the world, gender equality in sport, and in particular in high-level positions of 
responsibility in sport, remains very low despite the promotion by international and national institutions of the 
participation of women in decision-making positions in sport. This article aims at questioning the practices of human 
resources management in the context of Moroccan Sports Organizations. To do so, we attempt in this article to 
highlight the factors that hinder the advancement of women in Moroccan sports organizations. Our article brings a 
certain originality to this research given the limited number of studies in this field. Thus, this work complements 
existing studies on the managerial practices of sports organizations. However, it is limited by the methodology used 
and requires further research in this area. 
Keywords 
Women, Equality, Gender, Sports Organization. 
1. Introduction
Since the first International Conferences of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and 
Sport (MINEPS) in the 1970s and 1980s, officials have emphasized the need to strengthen the presence of women in 
positions of responsibility in sport. (UNESCO, Conférence générale Vingt-cinquième session ,Paris 1989, 
France,1989) 
Despite these initiatives and commitments in terms of gender equality in decision-making positions, women still face 
difficulties in accessing decision-making positions in the national and international sport context. They do not have 
the same opportunities as men to occupy positions of responsibility in the field of sport. 
Indeed, the International Olympic Committees (IOC’s) report on gender equality and inclusion in 2021 confirmed this 
problem. 
In 2020, only three international sports federations had women presidents (Triathlon Federation, Golf Federation and 
Curling Federation), nine out of thirty-three international federations had women Secretaries General, and only eight 
international federations had exceeded the minimum 30% representation of women on their boards.  
At the level of National Olympic Committees (NOCs), the results for 2020 show that women hold 8% of NOC 
President positions and 16% of Secretary General positions. Indeed, of the one hundred one NOCs that provided data 
regarding their board of directors in the 2019 NOC review, only twenty-seven National Olympic Committees exceeded 
the minimum target of 30% female representation on their board of directors. 
Currently, at the national level, of the fifty-three sports federations in Morocco, only four are chaired by women. These 
are the Royal Moroccan Federation of Aerobics, Fitness, Hip Hop and Related Sports, the Royal Moroccan Federation 
of Volleyball, the Royal Moroccan Federation of Sport for All and the Royal Federation of Bridge.  
In 2008, there were only three women presidents out of forty-four federations. It is therefore encouraging to see a 
slight increase in the representation of women in sport in leadership positions in Morocco. 
 However, there is still a long way to go to achieve gender parity in this area .( Etude sur le Sport, le Genre et le 
Développement en Afrique, 2021) 
816","Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Houston, Texas, USA, June 13-16, 2023 
© IEOM Society International 
In addition, the Gender-Organization-System (GOS) approach allows us to better understand the interactions between 
these three factors and their impact on the under-representation of women in management and decision-making 
positions, and to propose concrete actions to promote gender equality in the governance of sports organizations. 
 
5. Actions to address gender stereotypes hindering women's access and representation in 
decision-making positions in sports organizations 
In this section, we present some actions that should be integrated into national and international policies to encourage 
women to choose and access decision-making positions in sports organizations. 
First, we focus on the 2021 IOC report on gender equality and inclusion;  
In the second part, we discuss the report on sports policy in Morocco. 
5.1 International level  
Several international sports organizations have committed themselves to promoting the presence of women in 
decision-making positions. They have developed roadmaps to support and encourage women to take part in the 
decision-making bodies of the international sport movement. 
 
In this section, we will present some recommendations and commitments from the IOC's report on gender equality 
and inclusion 2021. 
 
- By 2024, the IOC is committed to supporting all initiatives aimed at catalyzing a significant representation of women 
in the governance and decision-making bodies of the Olympic movement; 
-The IOC will develop strategies to broaden the scope of talented women candidates for governance positions in 
general, and for Executive Board positions in particular, in order to encourage them to apply; 
-Stakeholders in the Olympic Movement will review their election procedures to identify strategies for gender balance 
in their governance bodies. 
-The various stakeholders of the Olympic Movement will establish reviews of the election procedures with the 
objective of determining strategies for equal access to decision-making positions.    
-The IOC aims to ensure equal access to decision-making positions, whether political, economic or public, and to 
ensure real and effective participation of women, rather than symbolic, in the various functions assigned to them. 
 
5.2 National level  
At the national level, several Moroccan organizations have addressed the issue of gender equality in decision-making 
positions in national sports organizations. In this section, we will present some of the recommendations mentioned in 
the report on sports policy in Morocco, prepared in 2019 by the Moroccan Economic, Social and Environmental 
Council.    
 
- The transformation of the National Sport Strategy into an operational public policy enshrined in a framework law 
taking into account the provisions of the Constitution in terms of integration and respect for equality between men and 
women; 
- The improvement of governance at the level of sports federations, regional leagues and sports associations; 
- Encouraging sports federations to ensure equitable access of women to positions of responsibility within the 
governing body of the sports movement by applying representative quotas; 
- A redefinition of the roles and responsibilities of sport actors to be supported: the obligation of female representation 
for each discipline. 
It can be deduced that if these actions are carried out by 2024, women will be present in the decision-making positions 
of national and international sports organizations. This will add value to these organizations and have an impact on 
their performance. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Finally, more than four decades after the first initiatives in favor of gender equality in sports on the one hand and 
access to decision-making positions in sports organizations on the other, it is regrettable to note that Moroccan women 
have still not reached the same level of equal opportunities as men in the field of sports. 
 
This means that even today, there are factors that prevent Moroccan women from demonstrating their skills and added 
value in the field of sports, and particularly within the decision-making spheres of sports organizations.

In conclusion, our theoretical study aims to provide a comprehensive view of the challenges faced by women in the 
decision-making spheres of sports organizations in Morocco. Based on the GOS theory, we find that women face 
barriers that prevent them from advancing up the hierarchy and reaching decision-making positions in sports. These 
barriers are the result of several factors combined at different levels: individual, organizational, and societal. 
 
However, this study has a limitation regarding the methodology used to study the situation of women in Moroccan 
sports organizations. In order to better understand the barriers to women's access to decision-making positions in these 
organizations, more in-depth field studies are needed for a more complete analysis.

Abstract 
Puerto Rican SMEs (Small-to-Medium Enterprises) represented 80.8% of the total enterprises in 2020, contributing 
to 38.6% of formal jobs.  One main management goal is defining how the business will leverage its regular operation, 
also known as determining its Capital Structure (CS). It has been identified that one of the significant SME causes of 
failure is its financial leverage decisions and having to find a feasible CS composition that fits in with its current chart 
of capabilities and business structure. Thus, this investigation generalizes the CS variables based on a qualitative e-
Delphi approach, concluding which variables are essential to SMEs CS in Puerto Rico. The expected investigation 
outcome is to obtain a list of focus variables that enable academically oriented SME investigators and financial 
decision-makers to optimize their resources and efforts.    
Keywords 
Capital Structure, SMEs, e-Delphi, Financial Leverage. 
1. Introduction
The research route of CS throughout time has experienced different paths, and it has caused the existence of plenty of 
literature that does not exactly agree with each other. Consequently, no single capital structure theory incorporates all 
relevant factors and assumptions (Abeywardhana, 2017). In addition, given that there is no consensus through 
approaches, the results obtained from mathematical models can substantially change when manipulating their 
underlying conditions and assumptions (Ardalan, 2017)—presenting a gap in the literature on a general theory 
encompassing financial and strategic management (Norton, 1991). The results of theoretical and empirical studies on 
CS investigation focus on large corporations, which have created a particular omission in Small-to-Medium-size 
Enterprises (SMEs) research (Jordan et al., 1998) 
1.1 Objectives 
The main objective of the research is to identify and prioritize the determinants of capital structure for small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Puerto Rico. To achieve this, the study uses the e-Delphi technique and economic 
validation to analyze the impact of various variables that affect the decision-making process related to SME capital 
structures. The research begins by conducting a literature review on optimal capital structures to identify the impact 
variables that influence the behavior and environment of decision-making processes for SMEs. Then, an e-Delphi 
analysis is performed on the previously identified variables to determine experts' relevant variables and prioritize the 
decision factors of capital structure for SMEs in Puerto Rico. Through this process, the study aims to provide insights 
that can inform the development of effective capital structure strategies for SMEs in Puerto Rico.

Kendall’s W is the ratio representing the Total Variance 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 in the Maximum Variance 𝑺𝑺𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹 and evaluates the 
agreement between ranking variables. In the second phase of the study, Kendall's W was calculated to be 0.422, as 
shown in previous equations. The same process was repeated for phase 3, resulting in an agreement coefficient of 
0.569. The increase in agreement coefficient by34.8% suggests that the feedback process was successful. According 
to Schmidt (1997), coefficients near 0.1 indicates very weak agreement, around 0.3 weak agreement, near 0.5 moderate 
agreement, and near 0.7 and 0.9 strong and unusually strong agreement, respectively. Therefore, the results represent 
reasonable agreement among experts in both research stages. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
To fully integrate descriptive statistics into the ranking phase analysis there are two main proposed improvements for 
further research. The first one is to perform a dispersion analysis since the ordinal dispersion within rankings must be 
treated differently than nominal data type. For doing so, it is proposed to analyze the index of ordinal variation. The 
second proposed improvement is to analyze the variation range of Kendall’s W coefficient for larger samples and if it 
is a reliable measurement of agreement given the experts sample size.  
  
6. Conclusion 
Until this investigation phase, according to experts' opinions and with a moderate agreement coefficient, the top five 
variables affecting SME Capital Structure decisions are Profitability (de Jong et al., 2008; Titman et al., 1988; ZHAO 
& LI, 2012), Solvency, Credit Rating(Graham & Harvey, 2002), Firm Risk (de Jong et al., 2008; LELAND, 1994; 
ZHAO & LI, 2012), and Liquidity (de Jong et al., 2008; ZHAO & LI, 2012), with more than 86% of experts ranking 
them in their first top half. From the filtered variable list, it was encountered that the first half had 80% quantitative 
variables and 70% were Managerially controllable, 20% were intrinsic to the Firm, and 10% were relative to the 
Market. In addition, 90% were contemplated in the initial literature review, and experts added 10% of the top. 
Remarkably, this investigation is still in progress, and further steps are needed to validate determinants prioritization 
and continue the investigation.

Abstract 
The trend of using cosmetic products in Indonesia is not only exclusively for women but also has expanded for men 
and children. The Indonesian government reported 797 small, medium, and large-scale domestic cosmetic enterprises 
as of 2019, up from 760 businesses the year before. The performance of the cosmetics business increased by 5.59% 
in 2020, and it provided USD 317 million, up 15.2% from the year before, to foreign exchange for export. Given the 
risks and uncertainties involved in the activities, linkages, and interconnections between elements from upstream to 
downstream, supply chain flow in business operations is surely a challenging topic to describe. In order to assure the 
establishment of an effective risk mitigation strategy, this study attempts to conceive a supply chain risk model for the 
Indonesian cosmetics sector. This research used qualitative data in a questionnaire assessment by expert.

Abstract 
This paper proposes an innovative approach to designing effective humanitarian logistics systems based on linguistic 
decision-making. The authors aim to create a detailed roadmap for such systems by carefully considering the key 
needs that must be addressed. To accomplish this, they utilize the House of Quality (HoQ) method of Quality Function 
Deployment (QFD), which establishes clear relationships between the various needs of humanitarian logistics and the 
specific requirements for designing effective systems. The inherently chaotic and complex nature of humanitarian 
logistics presents a significant challenge to effective design. However, the use of linguistic variables, combined with 
fuzzy logic-based techniques, can help to handle the vagueness and ambiguity of the field. The paper suggests using 
the 2-Tuple Linguistic (2-TL) model in combination with QFD technique to create more effective roadmaps that can 
be followed even in the face of uncertainty and unexpected events. This paper contributes to the existing literature by 
proposing a linguistic-based design approach to prioritize the design requirements for humanitarian logistics systems. 
This approach can guide practitioners to generate relevant strategies to address critical design requirements. The paper 
also presents a case study from Türkiye to develop the proposed QFD models for humanitarian logistics design and 
provides further discussions and analysis at the end.

1 Introduction  
Humanitarian logistics is a critical aspect of disaster relief efforts, aimed at delivering aid to those in need in a timely 
and efficient manner (de Camargo Fiorini et al., 2022). For example, during natural disasters like earthquakes or 
hurricanes, humanitarian logistics is crucial for providing food, water, shelter, and medical supplies to affected 
populations. Similarly, during conflict situations, humanitarian logistics is necessary for providing aid to refugees and 
internally displaced persons (European Commission, 2022).  
However, the uncertain and complex nature of humanitarian crises presents significant challenges to the design of 
effective logistics systems. For example, in the aftermath of a natural disaster, road and communication networks may 
be severely disrupted, making it difficult to transport aid to affected areas. Similarly, in conflict situations, insecurity 
and violence may make it dangerous or even impossible for aid workers to reach those in need. In such contexts, it 
can be difficult to establish clear guidelines and protocols for the design of effective logistics systems. In order to 
address these challenges, innovative approaches are required to prioritize the design requirements for humanitarian 
logistics systems (Schiffling et al., 2022). One such approach is based on linguistic decision-making, which involves

Abstract 
The ability of patients to successfully manage their own healthcare can have challenges outside the clinical realm. 
Food insecurity can impact the physical and psychological state of an individual, and many patients feel the need to 
choose between paying for food and paying for medication. Transportation to and from healthcare sites can be 
challenging, as delays or missed encounters for care contributing to negative clinical outcomes. These and other Social 
Determinants of Health (SDoH) have a significant impact on the ability of a clinical best practice to achieve its desired 
outcome at the patient level. This poster strives to educate on how the University of Texas Medical Branch is working 
to make the questions for SDoH a part of standard work to better identify and support those patients in need.

Abstract 
Remember internet boom of 1990s and how its usage changed the way we look at world? Blockchain technology (BT) 
is the Internet of present time. Studies highlighting ways to leverage the benefits of BT are being carried out 
aggressively and it's of keen interest for major industries and industrialists. Every new research in the area indicate 
various benefits of BT related to performance improvements. Therefore, to evaluate the enablers of blockchain 
adoption in smart contracts becomes essential and of great importance. For consumer driven economy like India, 
where implementation and adoption of BT has been sluggish, BT implementation can give strategic advantage to any 
industry, making it relevant to evaluate the feasibility and the importance of blockchain smart contracts in the 
electronic industry, which occupy a large share of the market. There are different enablers for BT adoption in different 
industries, and this study focuses on identifying and establishing the relationships between the enabler in the electronic 
supply chain. Eight enablers were considered after conducting a survey of the literature before applying the 
Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) technique to understand the complex relationships between the identified 
enablers. The result of the detailed analysis, highlighted traceability as the most significant enabler among others for 
BT-related smart contract adoption for the electronic industry. This result is of immense importance for managers in 
identifying and developing policies and strategies related to BT implementation for the firm.

1. Introduction
With the ever-increasing pace of development in technology and trends, the product life cycle is getting shorter every 
passing day. Products facing short-life cycle (SLC), like consumer electronics, fashion goods, seasonal products, etc., 
contribute significantly to trade transactions. To bridge the difference in the demand and supply of short life cycle 
products, flexible policies regarding inventory and order management need to be placed. Under order management 
method, supply chain contract is widely used to balance demand-supply and many studies have highlighted the use of 
various forms of supply chain contract in the literature, some of which include wholesale prices contract, two-part 
tariff contract, revenue sharing contract, buy-back contact, quantity discount contract, quantity flexibility contract, 
and option contracts. 
Recently, blockchain technology (BT) has been creating a buzz (Gupta, 2017) similar to the time when the usage of 
the Internet was popularized. It has been gaining interest from many industry sectors including but not limited to 
financial, food processing, and power and energy markets. Researchers have been studying the use of BT for various 
applications such as supply chain management, transactive industry (both financial and energy), device cybersecurity, 
identity management, etc. (Gourisetti et al., 2020). One of the unique elements of blockchain technology that made it 
such a captivating technology to researchers is its features. Blockchain has a plethora of features, and some of the 
features that have been gaining importance include smart contracts, cryptocurrency, immutable distributed ledger, 
cryptographic hashing, and digital signature. Among the features, one important feature of blockchain technology that 
is of interest is smart contracts. Smart contracts are executable codes that run on top of the blockchain to facilitate an 
agreement between untrusted parties (Nelaturu et al., 2020) Blockchain databases are continuously designed to support 
the development of decentralized applications for application in the development of smart contracts (Adkins et al., 
2020)

5. Conclusion 
Supply chain contracts have been widely adopted by a large number of organisations and industry practitioners to deal 
with the complexities and uncertainties in the supply chain. The degree of flexibility and the required technologies to 
be adopted depends on a number of situations. This paper studies the enablers of blockchain to adopt smart contract 
for the short life cycle products. Eight enablers of blockchain that impacts smart contract adoption in the supply have 
been identified based on literature review and co-occurrence analysis of the corpus extracted from Scopus database. 
Various direct and indirect interrelationships between the enablers are identified using ISM and a hierarchical model 
is developed based on their driving and dependence powers. The MICMAC analysis is used along with ISM for 
classifying the enablers into four categories viz. autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent. A large number of 
enablers are positioned in the independent category as well as dependent category indicating that most of the enablers 
are not highly interlinked with each other. 
 
The results from the ISM can be used to identify which enablers to focus on to help in faster and smoother adoption 
of smart contract for the short life products. The research framework adopted in this study can be extended to other 
industries for future research. Different enablers can also be identified for analysing the feasibility and importance of 
smart contracts in the supply chains. Similar research can also be done using a combination of other MCDM techniques 
to support the findings of this study.

Applications of Federated Learning in Manufacturing: 
Identifying the Challenges and Exploring the Future

Abstract 
In manufacturing settings, data collection and analysis are often a time-consuming, challenging, and costly process. It 
also hinders the use of advanced machine learning and data-driven methods which require a substantial amount of 
offline training data to generate good results. It is particularly challenging for small manufacturers who do not share 
the resources of a large enterprise. Recently, with the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), data can be collected 
in an integrated manner across the factory in real-time, sent to the cloud for advanced analysis, and used to update the 
machine learning model sequentially. Nevertheless, small manufacturers face two obstacles in reaping the benefits of 
IoT: they may be unable to afford or generate enough data to operate a private cloud, and they may be hesitant to share 
their raw data with a public cloud. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging concept of collaborative learning that can 
help small-scale industries address these issues and learn from each other without sacrificing their privacy. It can bring 
together diverse and geographically dispersed manufacturers under the same analytics umbrella to create a win-win 
situation. However, the widespread adoption of FL across multiple manufacturing organizations remains a significant 
challenge. This study aims to review the challenges and future directions of applying federated learning in the 
manufacturing industry, with a specific emphasis on the perspectives of Industry 4.0 and 5.0.

1. Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning technique that enables multiple parties to collaboratively 
train machine learning (ML) models while keeping their data securely stored on their local devices. The concept of 
FL was first introduced in 2016 by Google researchers in a paper titled ""Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep 
Networks from Decentralized Data"" (McMahan et al., 2017). The motivation behind this work was to address the 
growing concern for privacy in machine learning, where data from individual users are often centralized and stored in 
large data centers. This was where FL came into play, offering a new way of training ML models in a decentralized 
manner, where data remains on the user's device, and only the model parameters are transmitted to the aggregator. 
With the rapid increase in the amount of time series data generated by devices, the manufacturing industry is shifting 
towards real-time/online analytics as it offers improved predictive maintenance, better quality control, enhanced 
process optimization, and thus overall increased efficiency. However, this online learning needs a very large dataset 
for the initial training which is often difficult for the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) industry to obtain due 
to its small-scale production. This problem can easily be overcome by collaborating with other entities in the SME 
industry by sharing a decentralized database. However, this cannot protect the individual company data from privacy 
and security threats which is why FL is the perfect candidate for this situation. Although FL promises to address all 
these issues and the manufacturing industry is heading towards smart manufacturing where a noticeable amount of 
increase has been observed in installing IoT devices, implementation of FL is very rare in the manufacturing industry. 
This has inspired us to figure out the challenges behind the implementation of FL in the manufacturing industry. In 
Figure 1, key components of smart manufacturing have been shown to demonstrate the basic FL architecture composed 
of cloud and edge computing. The objective of this study is to explore the challenges associated with implementing

6. Conclusion 
With the growing availability of time-series data, the manufacturing industry is increasingly moving towards real-
time and sequential learning through edge devices and the cloud (Raihan & Ahmed, 2019). However, small-scale 
manufacturers still do not possess the capability of collecting enough data by themselves or analyzing them in the 
cloud for a real-time decision. Although FL offers a potential solution to address this issue without compromising data 
privacy, its implementation remains rare in the manufacturing industry. In this study, we attempted to provide a 
discussion of FL and its potential applications across the diversified manufacturing industry. We also discussed the 
applications FL from the context of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Moreover, the challenges associated with adopting 
FL in the manufacturing industry are extensively reviewed and categorized in this work. Based on the analysis, it can 
be concluded that most of the challenges relate to technical readiness, including software and hardware. Therefore, 
the focus for future research should be on addressing these technical challenges, while simultaneously promoting a 
shift in organizational culture to prepare the industry for the adoption of FL and drive improved outcomes.

Abstract 
This paper presents an improved approach to minimize tool path length in multi-tool drilling operations using a genetic 
algorithm. Hole drilling is prevalent in manufacturing processes, particularly in computer numerical control machines. 
Holes often vary in size, necessitating tool switches during drilling. As the number of holes and tools increases, finding 
the optimal path becomes an NP-hard problem. The proposed approach employs genetic algorithms to optimize the 
tool path for both multi-tool and single-tool drilling. A comparison of the proposed method with existing techniques 
reveals a reduction of up to 17% in total path length, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

1. Introduction
Hole drilling is a crucial step in the manufacturing process of various industries, with printed circuit boards (PCBs) 
being a notable example. Computer numerical control (CNC) machines are often employed to perform highly precise 
drilling operations on a wide range of materials, creating holes with varying diameters for different applications. The 
efficiency of these drilling operations can be significantly improved by optimizing the tool path planning, which 
involves reducing the time spent on routing between holes and switching between tools. 
While there has been extensive research on hole drilling path optimization, much of the existing literature focuses on 
drilling holes of the same diameter, primarily addressing single tool path planning. However, the optimization of 
drilling paths for multiple hole sizes in one workpiece, which involves multi-tool path planning, has received relatively 
less attention. This paper presents an improved approach for minimizing the length of tool paths in multi-tool drilling 
using a genetic algorithm, addressing the challenge of optimizing drilling paths for multiple hole sizes in a single 
workpiece and enhancing the productivity and efficiency of various manufacturing processes, such as PCB production. 
Much of the existing literature on hole drilling focuses on drilling holes of the same diameter. Narooei et al. (2014) 
propose an approach using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to reduce tool path and study the effects of changing 
parameters on the optimal solution. However, this approach is only tested on small drilling operations with a limited 
number of holes. ACO is also adopted in Mehmood et al. (2022) where the authors propose a hybrid shuffled frog-
leaping algorithm (SLFO) and ACO method. Another optimization technique that has been commonly used for hole 
drilling is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). PSO has gained popularity due to its use of swarm intelligence. 
Abdullah et al (2020). compare PSO and ACO for path generation, and show that PSO could be slightly better. 
Artificial Bee Colony is another metaheuristic approach, recently  Dhouib et al (2023) integrate it with another 
heuristic method (Dhouib-Matrix-TSP1) which show improved performance compared to other methods. Besides that,

Our proposed approach shows a significant reduction in terms of total travel distance compared to other metaheuristic 
methods. The compared techniques vary from GA like in Karuppapan et al (2017), PSO like the one used by Zhu & 
Zhang (2008) . Also, a hybrid method is included in the comparison which is IGAS (Integrated Genetic and Simulated 
Annealing) used by Karthikeyan et al (2020). 
 
This paper presents an improved approach using genetic algorithms to optimize tool paths for CNC machines across 
various applications, including PCBs. The proposed approach aims to minimize the tool traveling time in multi-tool 
drilling scenarios, leading to significant reductions in the total travel distance. In comparison to existing single-tool 
heuristic methods, our method demonstrates a reduction of up to 17% in total travel distance (path length).  
 
In the future, the authors intend to enhance this solution to tackle the more challenging problem of multi-tool hole 
drilling with precedence constraints, which introduces additional complexity due to the need to account for specific 
tool sequences and dependencies between drilling operations.

Abstract 
This review integrates semiotics, gender and feminist theory, and behavioral microeconomics in order to examine the 
impact of gendered advertising on consumer and brand behavior. I first examine how advertising, especially done 
through visual mediums, is produced by their social context and can be analyzed as cultural texts. I then explore how 
firms utilize gender norms and ideals in their advertising to build a brand image and establish a consumer base. As a 
part of this discussion, I investigate a specific kind of gendered advertising: sexual advertising, which commodifies 
the female and male bodies to intentionally illicit different consumer responses based on gender. Referring to Jill J. 
Avery’s research in marketing, I scrutinize specific instances of gender contamination and the ways that consumers 
and businesses respond economically to defend stereotypical gender roles.

Abstract 
We have developed a vehicle routing problem (VRP) optimization tool aimed at improving the efficiency of e-waste 
collection and logistics systems. Given the geospatial dispersion of electronic waste (e-waste), an effective reverse 
logistics system is crucial for successful recycling efforts. Our tool combines guided local search and k-opt algorithms 
to optimize travel routes for fleets of heterogeneous vehicles. To ensure accurate calculations, the tool utilizes the 
Open Street Map API, which provides actual road network data for calculating travel distances and time. Furthermore, 
we have incorporated a comprehensive emission model that accurately quantifies vehicular emissions. By doing so, 
we can generate optimized solutions with an average optimality gap of 2.2% compared to known best solutions of 
benchmark VRPs within a time limit of 30 seconds. It also generates an interactive map showing color-coded vehicle 
routes and collecting nodes’ information. The effectiveness of the tool has been tested with real data from our industry 
partner. Out developed VRP optimization tool comes with a graphical user interface that can provide optimized routes 
and quantify—environmental emissions, actual travel distance, and cost within a reasonable amount of time. It has 
been released as an open-source software. The tool can potentially be utilized for minimizing carbon dioxide emissions 
from commercial vehicles to mitigate greenhouse gas impacts.

1. Introduction
The global consumer electronics market is expected to expand by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% 
through 2027 from its estimated value of over $1 trillion in 2020 (Wadhwani and Saha, 2021). As a result, an increase 
in electronic waste (e-waste) generation is expected in the coming years (Forti et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2023). In 
2019, 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste, defined by the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP) as “products 
with a battery or plug”, was generated worldwide (Forti et al., 2020). Collecting and recycling e-waste is an attractive 
alternative to landfilling because it provides (1) environmental relief from the chemical hazards associated with 
untreated e-waste and (2) economic incentives associated with valuable raw material recovery (Forti et al., 2020; 
Nguyen et al., 2022). 
A challenge to developing an e-waste recycling infrastructure is the establishment of a cost-effective collection and 
logistics system (Xu et al., 2021).  There are three primary scenarios for collection and management (Forti et al., 2020) 
884","Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Houston, Texas, USA, June 13-16, 2023

solution. For a small-size problem, the computational time of the solvers to get the results is reasonable. But for a 
medium to large problem size, for example, 20 to hundreds of collection nodes, the solvers are not practical since it 
could take several weeks to months to get the results. It is very common for logistics companies to do their day-to-
day logistics planning for a problem size consisting of hundreds of collection/delivery nodes. From a practical 
standpoint, industries need a good solution within minutes for their daily logistics planning. Our tool uses real road 
network data using OSM and Google API to capture the actual travel distance and time and then optimizes the travel 
route for vehicles with different capacities and configurations within minutes. The tool does not guarantee the global 
optimal solution but is very competitive for practical applications. The tool is released as an open-source software 
under the General Public License and is available at this GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/IdahoLabResearch/CMAT. 
 
4.3 Feedback from Industry Partner 
During the development of this tool, we engaged with our industry partner to better understand the common practices 
and general requirements of the e-waste collection logistics process. Based on their feedback, we included different 
features in our tool like direct data input from Excel files, adding business account numbers and account names in 
addition to the addresses in the interactive map, color coding of different routes, adding clockwise or anti-clockwise 
directions to the individual routes, exporting summary results to external CSV files and so on. The logistics team 
tested our tool for their day-to-day uses. Although they agreed that the tool was easy to use and helpful, their daily 
operation does not require the same level of complexity. However, they were able to apply the tool for their 
quarterly/annual collection events where hundreds of addresses need to be covered and dozens of vehicles and trailers 
are utilized.  
 
4.4 Limitations and Future Works 
There are some limitations of our study. Firstly, our current route planning tool does not take real-time traffic data 
into account when calculating travel time and environmental emissions. The vehicular speed might get severely 
impacted due to traffic congestion and consequently, our tool can potentially underestimate the emissions and travel 
time. As part of future development, live traffic data can be integrated into the tool. Secondly, our tool currently lacks 
the capability to send routing directions directly to drivers' electronic devices such as tablets or phones. This feature 
would enhance convenience and usability for users. Another limitation worth mentioning is that the tool employs US 
units, including pounds, gallons, and miles, which might prove inconvenient for users outside of the United States. To 
make our tool more accessible globally, we aim to integrate equivalent SI units into the system. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The use of electrical and electronic devices is growing day by day and hence increasing the need for recycling. In this 
study, we developed a vehicle routing tool to help e-waste recycling companies establish a cost-effective collection 
and logistics system. The key features of the tool can be summarized below: 
• 
The tool uses real road network data for calculating travel distance and travel time as opposed to other works 
where a straight line or Euclidian distance has been used. This feature makes the tool suitable for practical logistics 
applications. 
• 
While most of the previous works utilized a constant factor for the calculation of emissions, we integrated a 
comprehensive emission model into the tool. The emission model considers vehicle mass, collected e-waste 
weight, road speed, and a wide range of vehicle attributes for accurately estimating emissions. 
• 
The tool can generate results within minutes even for large-scale problems and the quality of the solutions is 
satisfactory. The average optimality gap we found for the well-known benchmark problems is only 2.2%, making 
the tool reliable. 
• 
We tested the tool with real-world data from our partnering e-waste recycling company and included different 
features based on their feedback. 
• 
The tool can calculate transportation costs by considering fuel costs, driver salary, vehicle capital, and operational 
costs. This is useful information for the users.  
• 
One of the key features of this tool is the development of the graphical user interface. Logistics people can use 
the capability of the tool without any need for mathematical or programming knowledge. Previous works lack 
this feature. 
The transportation sector is responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Our developed route 
planning tool can potentially be utilized for minimizing carbon dioxide emissions from commercial vehicles and hence 
mitigating greenhouse gas impacts. Though the tool has been developed primarily focusing on the e-waste recycling

Abstract 
Engineering students face difficulties in accessing the resources required to succeed in their coursework. This study 
explores the impact of expanded resources on students from diverse engineering backgrounds taking the mandatory 
MATE 215 Introduction to Materials Engineering Laboratory course. It examines the effects of online tools and in-
person guidance on student learning and engagement. A survey was designed and disseminated to assess the 
effectiveness of additional resources in improving student understanding. The survey was developed based on the 
author's engineering management knowledge and research on universal design in digital learning environments. It 
employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the effects of centralized resources on student learning. The survey 
included both quantitative and qualitative questions to gauge student experience. The instructor also collected 
observational data on the student’s behavior and engagement during lab sessions. Preliminary findings suggest that 
providing supplementary resources creates a stress-free and inclusive environment that promotes student engagement 
and learning. The data also indicates that students from various engineering backgrounds benefit from having access 
to additional resources, as it enables them to approach the material from different perspectives and encourages 
collaboration and teamwork. The study's results have important implications for engineering education by highlighting 
how diversified resources enhance student learning. The findings can aid in developing new strategies and inventions 
to support student success, particularly for those from underrepresented backgrounds. Overall, the study's 
methodology and results can serve as a model for future research aimed at improving the quality of engineering 
education.

Abstract 
This work presents a model for assessing the usability of websites available on the internet that offer, in real-time, road 
freight to independent carriers. The proposed model considers a qualitative plus quantitative multicriteria approach, 
whose criteria and sub-criteria considered relevant for the evaluation of the usability of freight websites are based on 
the literature of evaluation of websites in general, however, adapted for users characterized as independent carriers. 
The evaluation proposes the ranking of websites according to the specific preferences of a standard user submitted to 
the AHP method (Analytic Hierarchy Process), proposed by Saaty. This method was chosen because it is used in 
numerous multicriteria decision situations, including for evaluating the usability of web pages. The road freight 
websites available in Brazil were analyzed for the desktop version, considering the following dimensions: 
effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. This work concludes with suggestions for improving the architecture of road 
freight transport pages, as well as suggestions for applying the proposed approach to road freight applications available 
for portable mobile telephony equipment. 
Keywords 
Usability, Multicriteria analysis of websites, Online Freight Offer and Analytic Hierarchy Process. 
1. Introduction
Usability is a term often used only to qualify “easy to use things” (Stewart 2012). The definition of usability in Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI) is, however, broader and its importance was recognized by the International Standard 
Organization, when in 1998 it created the ISO 9242-11 standard and adopted by the Associação Brasileira de Normas 
Técnicas (ABNT - Brazilian Association of Norms Techniques) in 2002 (Abreu 2004). According to this standard, 
usability is the “extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specific goals with effectiveness, 
efficiency and satisfaction in a specific context of use” (ABNT 2002). Effectiveness is defined, in this context, as a 
characteristic that evaluates the “accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specific objectives”, while the 
concept of efficiency is related to “resources spent in relation to the accuracy and comprehensiveness with which users 
achieve objectives” and, finally, the concept of satisfaction is defined as the “absence of discomfort and positive 
attitudes towards the use of a product” (ABNT 2002). Figure 1 illustrates the concept and measures of usability 
according to NBR 9241-11. This norm indicates that to measure usability it is necessary: 
1)
to explain the intended objectives with the measurement.
2)
describe the components of the context of use including users, tasks, equipment, and environments; and
3)
define actual or desired values of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction for the intended contexts.
The context can be pre-existing or an intended context. Its level of detail will depend on the scope to be addressed, but 
it must be sufficiently detailed so that those factors that influence usability can be captured with the usability 
measurement model (ABNT 2002). 
Websites offering road freight are the object of study of this work. These websites operate as virtual freight centers 
that publish on their pages, as a certain cargo to be transported is known, as the main characteristics of the available 
freight. These characteristics include cities of origin and destination of the freight, type of cargo, product to be 
transported, weight and/or volume, type of vehicle needed for transportation, and the amount of freight that the owner 
of the cargo is willing to pay for transportation. On the other end, there is, in general, an independent transporter that 
has at least one vehicle for transporting loads by road.

by G) of each criterion and sub-criteria indicates their importance in relation to the major criterion. It is observed that 
the most relevant criterion is “Effectiveness” with 62.5% of influence in establishing the order of preference of 
alternatives. Among the sub-criteria, “Accuracy” contributes 22.1% in the composition of this order of preference, 
therefore being the most important sub-criterion for the user. 
 
 
 
Figure 14. Relative importance of alternatives, sub-criteria, and criteria 
 
The ExpertChoice software used to carry out this study presents a series of options for graphical reports, which allow 
the qualitative assessment of the assertiveness of the pairwise judgments, promoting sensitivity analysis with the 
variation in these judgments and, thus, reassessing them in case of doubt or lack of consistency. Figure 15 shows the 
contribution of each criterion in the final ranking of alternatives. It is observed that for the “Satisfaction” criterion, the 
best-positioned site (FreteBrás) is in the penultimate place. This is mainly due to the lack of links between this site and 
social networks, as shown by the peer-to-peer judgments in Figure 15. The dominance of the “FreteBrás” website is 
mainly dictated by its better use in the “Effectiveness” criterion and, more specifically, in the “Volume” sub-criteria 
“Up-to-dateness” and “Attractiveness”.

6. Conclusion 
The objective of this work was to propose a multi-criteria model for assessing the usability of road freight websites 
freely available on the Internet using the AHP method. The model establishes a set of criteria and relevant sub-criteria 
for the context of the studied problem. These criteria allow the evaluation of these sites using both objective and 
subjective metrics, which are possible to be incorporated into the model because the AHP method can support 
subjective judgments, according to a scale suggested by the developer of the method, which has been widely used in 
recent decades. 
 
Results show the viability of the model in the sense of allowing, in a relatively simple way, to select the best online 
freight intermediary. The flexibility of the Expert Choice software allows you to any user to establish their individual 
preferences for peer-to-peer judgments, thereby inducing custom ranking solutions.

Considering that information technology is continuously subjected to technological advances with new features, 
especially in the evolution of smartphones and applications, the set of criteria and sub-criteria should also be 
continually reassessed so that the proposed multicriteria model incorporates technology evolution.

Abstract 
As many sources exhort managers to “think strategically,” only a few addresses how to make this happen. Where 
strategic analysis tools are explained, this is most frequently done conceptually rather than their actual application in 
strategic planning. Shortened systematic strategic planning (SSP) consists of a pattern of step-wise procedure for 
straight-forward planning, and the fundamentals involved in any strategic planning project. The use of shortened 
SSP is more suitable for the development of strategic plans for small- and medium-size businesses (SMEs). The 
intention here is to provide a new perspective and benefit for the strategic planners by introducing this new 
systematic methodology and demonstrating its implementation on an entrepreneurial and new business called CGA 
Tech. Accordingly, let shortened version of SSP easily understood and universally applied to any small- and 
medium-size businesses. The data that are used in this case are fictitious and only help for this study. Though, the 
given case does not cover all the sections of a typical strategic plan and use all the recommended techniques, it still 
reflects the basics.

1. Introduction
Systematic Strategic Planning is the pattern of procedures by which an organization defines its status, opportunities, 
long-term goals, and the strategies for which to achieve them (Butuner 2015). SSP is based on the principles of 
Planning by Design (PxD) which is generated by (Muther 2011). When each step of a working model is supported 
by the form of output and key document leading to it, we have what is called High Definition PxD Working Model. 
A strategic plan includes the fundamentals, and the basis on which any strategic planning must rest are competitive 
advantages, scenarios and strategies (Butuner 2015). 
The use of shortened SSP version is more suitable for the development of strategic plans for small- and medium-size 
businesses (SMEs). This paper is intended to briefly explain how each step of shortened SSP pattern can be applied 
on a given case.  
The case study presented in here is an entrepreneurial and new business. The data that are used in this case are 
fictitious and only help for this study. Though, the given case does not cover all the sections of a typical strategic 
plan and use all the recommended techniques, it still reflects the basics. 
2. Systematic Pattern of Strategic Planning
Shortened SSP is a six-step methodology intended to identify the three fundamentals. Figure 1 illustrates shortened 
version of SSP (Butuner 2015).

4. Conclusion  
The aim of Systematic Strategic Planning (SSP) is to force a consider the future and therefore provides an 
opportunity to influence the future, or assume a proactive posture, to provide better awareness of needs and 
environment, to help define and focus on the objectives of the organization. SSP—shortened version consists of a 
pattern of six steps for straight forward planning, and the three fundamentals (competitive advantages, scenarios and 
strategies) involved in any strategic planning project. The use of shortened SSP version is more suitable for the 
development of strategic plans for small- and medium-size businesses.  
 
Here, we have provided a new perspective and benefit for the strategic planners by introducing the shortened version 
of SSP and demonstrating its implementation on an entrepreneurial and new business called CGA Tech. This will 
help SSP users to easily understand and apply this new methodology to any small- and medium-size businesses’ 
strategic planning project. Though, the given case did not cover all the sections of a typical strategic plan and use all 
the recommended techniques, it still reflected the basics.

Abstract 
The topic of this paper is team-based work structures: Hierarchical decision-making authority in an organization.  The 
research question is: “how is employee satisfaction, behavior, and performance impacted by a decentralized vs. that 
of centralized structure of an organization?”  Within this research, the goal of the paper will be to explore the positive 
and negative factors of an organization where a top-down approach to decisions and operating procedure are in place 
compared to an organization design where the teams are given latitude to formulate plans and carry out project 
deliverables based on expertise and collaboration.  Decentralized compared to that of a centralized structure of an 
organization is researched and aspects of employee satisfaction and the impact on individual and organizational 
performance are analyzed. 
Keywords 
Decentralized, Centralized, Organization, Employee Satisfaction, Performance 
1. Introduction
The motivation of this research is to better understand and share the differences in employee satisfaction and the 
impact on individual performance in centralized and decentralized formats of an organization.  This is accomplished 
in this paper through an in-depth literature review.  The reason this research is important and needed is for the 
awareness that strategic decisions to centralize, decentralize, or implement a combination thereof can and will impact 
employee satisfaction in the job as well as individual and company performance. 
Employee satisfaction, individual and company performance can be negatively impacted if leadership makes 
strategic decisions about the structure of the organization without understanding the differences of centralized and 
decentralized organizations, and the impacts of these two different organizational structures. 
1.1 Objectives 
The research objective in this study is to seek understanding of how employee satisfaction and performance in 
centralized vs. decentralized organizations differ around the world across several industries. 
2. Literature Review
2.1 Significance between Centralized and Decentralized Organizations
2.1.1 Defining Centralized and Decentralized Organizations
A centralized organization can be defined where the authority to make decisions starts at the top and filters down,
whereas decentralized organizations utilize flexibility for empowered teams with an appropriate level of autonomy
(Sun et al., 2021).  With an objective of accomplishing a positive outcome through talented people who fit a specific
need, it becomes difficult to measure performance while within a centralized governance model (Sun et al., 2021). In
an example described by Sun et al. in a construction project, a wide variety of skillsets were found to be necessary to
carry out the many duties throughout the process. Therefore, a decentralized format of the organization could serve
to increase the chances of employee satisfaction and better performance of time and task completion.

Westinghouse doubled operating profits, developed many new technologies, and recognized employee satisfaction 
improved (Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1995). 
 
3. Conclusion 
On the surface, it seems that decentralization may be the choice for achieving the highest employee satisfaction that 
would influence desired performance.  However, as different needs drive strategy of organizational structure, so does 
the requirement to consider different levels of integrating decentralized forms of business units even at times within a 
centralized governance model (Andrews et al., 2009). 
 
This literature review was aimed at better understanding centralized vs. decentralized organizational models and 
corresponding employee satisfaction, behaviors, and performance in each.  Eight different industries including 
automotive, construction, government public sectors, healthcare, industrial equipment, private firms across an entire 
country, shipping ports, and technology were reviewed and the countries of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, 
Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States were represented on topics 
in this paper. 
 
It has been learned through this study that decentralization does increase autonomy, allow better input to the decision-
making process, and contribute to higher levels of employee satisfaction (Stuart, 1984).  Performance, however, is 
more complex.  As mentioned, it depends on the needs of the company and is closely related to the strategy of carefully 
structuring an effective plan of centralization, decentralization, or a combination thereof (Chen & Eriksson, 2019). 
 
4. Implications and Limitations 
4.1 What are the implications of the findings? 
Although decentralization is found to be an important ingredient in engaging the employee into the decision-making 
process, it is management that must be proactive in coming to an agreement of what the effective strategy in which 
the company will operate.  Maybe the entity operates in a government public sector, healthcare, or industrial equipment 
industry where some centralization is needed, yet creative solutions can be established for maximizing employee and 
stakeholder input at the department level.  Maybe it is a stand-alone manufacturing facility, individual private firm, or 
construction site where leadership has the flexibility to maximize the expertise and innovation of the workforce 
through a highly decentralized governance model.  Lastly, it is learned that a hybrid of centralized combined with 
decentralized business units like that in examples discussed in the paper of a shipping port, or technology company is 
possible. 
 
4.2 What are the limitations of this study? 
Although several industries and countries of economy were explored, it is acknowledged that this paper took a sample 
of what is available across all industries and the global economy.  A deeper study looking at all continents, cultures, 
norms, and performance measurements would paint a more complete picture of how strategy of structuring an 
organization leads to high levels of employee satisfaction and how performance is impacted. 
 
4.3 Can the findings be generalized? 
The findings in the paper are difficult to generalize.  As Frederick Herzberg’s two-factor theory suggests, it would be 
a risk to generalize the factors for what influences employee satisfaction and eventual performance as it relates to 
either centralized or decentralized governance model (Stuart, 1984).  It is therefore important for any leader to 
recognize the needs of the organization, team members, and engage the workforce in ways that are consistent with 
company cultural norms and consistency to succeed within the strategic organizational structure.

Abstract 
A thermodynamic graphical depiction known as an enthalpy-entropy (H-S) diagram depicts changes in a substance's 
enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) while it goes through a physical or chemical transition. The vertical axis shows the 
enthalpy, which is the heat content of the system under constant pressure, and the horizontal axis represents entropy, 
which is a measure of the degree of disorder or unpredictability of a system. Phase changes, chemical reactions, and 
heat transmission are just a few examples of the different thermodynamic processes that may be studied and 
understood using the H-S diagram. The efficiency of energy conversion procedures like power cycles and refrigeration 
cycles may also be ascertained using the diagram. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Energy and its changes are the subject of thermodynamics. In many branches of engineering, chemistry, and physics, 
it is a basic branch of study that is crucial. Thermodynamic characteristics, which can be measured and analyzed using 
a variety of methods, govern how thermodynamic systems behave. The entropy-enthalpy diagram, often known as the 
Mollier diagram, is one of the best resources for examining thermodynamic parameters. Diagrams illustrating the 
thermodynamic characteristics of a material are called entropy-enthalpy diagrams. They are based on the basic 
thermodynamic quantities of entropy and enthalpy, which are shown against one another on a Cartesian coordinate 
system. Specifically in the fields of power production and refrigeration, these diagrams are used to analyze and 
comprehend the behaviour of thermodynamic systems. 
1.1 Objectives 
Gaining a fuller understanding of a system's thermodynamic characteristics and how they relate to chemical processes 
and phase transitions is the goal of research on entropy-enthalpy diagrams. The precise goals of such study might be: 
creating new techniques for creating entropy-enthalpy graphs and enhancing the precision of current techniques. 
employing entropy-enthalpy diagrams to analyze the behaviour of complicated systems, such as mixes and solutions. 
investigating how pressure and other outside influences affect a system's thermodynamic characteristics and how they 
appear on a diagram.

4.H-S diagrams are frequently used in conjunction with other thermodynamic diagrams, including temperature-
entropy (T-S) diagrams and pressure-enthalpy (P-H) diagrams. To ensure consistency and coherence across the 
various thermodynamic diagrams, validation can be carried out by comparing a substance's or process' behaviour on 
the H-S diagram with its behaviour on other thermodynamic diagrams. 
 
5. Comparison with other thermodynamic diagrams: Pressure-enthalpy (P-H) diagrams and temperature-entropy (T-
S) diagrams are two examples of other thermodynamic diagrams that are frequently used with H-S diagrams. A 
thermodynamic diagram's validity can be checked by comparing a substance's or process' behaviour on the H-S 
diagram to that behaviour on other thermodynamic diagrams to guarantee consistency and coherence. 
 
Enthalpy-entropy diagrams must be validated in order to ensure that the plotted data is consistent with accepted 
thermodynamic principles, experimental results, known thermodynamic attributes, and anticipated thermodynamic 
behaviour of substances or processes. H-S diagrams can be certified as useful tools for analyzing and comprehending 
thermodynamic systems by guaranteeing the quality and dependability of the displayed data. 
 
5.5 Applications of Enthalpy-Entropy Diagrams 
Entropy-enthalpy diagrams have a wide range of applications in various fields of thermodynamics. One of the most 
common applications is in the study of phase transitions, such as melting, crystallization, and solid-state 
transformations. These diagrams provide insight into the behavior of the system during these transitions, such as the 
heat required to melt a substance or the temperature at which a phase transition occurs. 
  
Another important application of entropy-enthalpy diagrams is in materials science. These diagrams are used to study 
the behavior of materials during phase transitions, such as the formation of alloys and the transformation of polymers. 
They also provide insight into the thermodynamic stability of materials, which is critical in the design and optimization 
of new materials. 
  
Entropy-enthalpy diagrams are also used in environmental science to study the thermodynamics of pollutant 
adsorption and desorption. These diagrams can help predict the effectiveness of different adsorbent materials in 
removing pollutants from contaminated water or air. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Entropy-enthalpy diagrams are a powerful tool in thermodynamics for understanding the behavior of chemical 
reactions and phase transitions. The construction and interpretation of these diagrams have been extensively studied 
in the literature, and new methods and techniques are constantly being developed. These diagrams have applications 
in various fields, including materials science, environmental science, and chemical engineering. Further research in 
this area is necessary to advance our understanding of thermodynamics and develop new techniques for predicting 
and optimizing the behavior of chemical systems.

Abstract 
A medieval caravanserai called ""Bara Katra"" has been found in ancient Dhaka, Bangladesh. The historic monument 
Bara Katra's momentous cultural identity is a hallmark of Dhaka, still standing today and crying for proper 
conservation attention. It stands for social value, artistic beauty, emotional value, and the architectural history of 
Bangladesh. The history of the old Dhaka, both industrial and architectural, has become better known. In addition to 
the various state efforts, populous stakeholders in Bangladesh have come forward with concern for the preservation 
and restoration of monuments and historic sites. The initiatives have been designed to conserve Bangladesh's ancient 
heritage and culture for future generations. The artifact Bara Katra, which was the most magnificent architecture 
during the Mughal era, is deteriorating and has experienced numerous unintended adjustments over the years. The 
majority of the building's components have been demolished, except its southern wing. As a response, it requires 
special attention to take the necessary actions to preserve its heritage and cultural value for the civilization that values 
its legacy and cares about future concerns. Due to Old Dhaka's extensive ancient narrative, there are many 
opportunities to promote cultural tourism and tourist attractions in this neighborhood. This paper aims to demonstrate 
a conservation management plan technique with potential recommendations for Bara Katra, including necessary 
measures and adaptive reuse. The management policy likewise involves collaboration with the relevant authorities for 
conservation.

1. Introduction
Old Dhaka, commonly referred to as Puran Dhaka, is a district of Dhaka, Bangladesh, with an extensive legacy of 
architecture that spans several millennia and an interesting architectural fusion of Bengali, colonial, and Mughal 
architecture. This ancient city was one of South Asia's largest cities during the Mughal era and was known as 
Jahangirnagar. The city had historically served as a hub for economic activity, trade, and cultural backgrounds, 
drawing in merchants, academics, and artists from all across the region. The city was known for its great palaces, 
masjids, and gardens during the Mughal period; many of them still stand today. Lalbagh's fortress, Ahsan Manzil, and 
the Star Mosque are some of the more famous examples. During the British colonial period, Old Dhaka underwent 
significant changes, with many new buildings constructed in a style that combined European and Bengali elements. 
In areas like Farashganj or Armanitola, for instance, some large old warehouses and factories remain to be seen. 
Several public buildings, such as the Sadarghat River Port, the Armenian Church, and Curzon Hall, were also built by 
the British and are some of the most famous buildings of the period. It stresses the use of traditional materials like 
timber, wood, bamboo, and thatch while being characterized by detailed carving and ornamental designs referred to 
as the Bengali style. Old Dhaka, too, is famous for its winding alleys and colorful markets, which give a distinctive 
character to the district. In the last several years, many of Old Dhaka's buildings have been damaged, but there are 
efforts underway to clean up and protect its historic architecture. Many historical relics were developed during the 
Mughal era in old Dhaka, including Bara Katra, an iconic relic among some of the historical remnants (Shaikh and 
Mowla 2009). It was created by a prosperous businessman by the name of Haji Mohammad Mohsin in the late 18th 
century, and the East India Company initially utilized it as a center for commerce. At one time, the most magnificent

Conclusion  
Bara Katra is the heart of the significant Chawk Bazar of old Dhaka, an area of special cultural value and significance. 
As a reflection of Mughal architecture, this unique building has undoubtedly made a profound contribution to the 
socio-cultural history and heritage of Bangladesh, which has created a strong and glorious image of the past. Currently, 
this historic monument in old Dhaka is trying to survive in the face of rapid development of the city, immoral use and 
negligence. In order to attain sustainable development of this site, an implementing conservation management plan 
(CMP) and a decision must be taken to conserve and manage the artifact, that is holistic approaches to revitalization 
of Bara Katra that consider social, economic and cultural revitalization with physical revitalization together be 
developed. In this context, the authors proposed a comprehensive contextual action plan with management policies 
for the architectural conservation of the historical building with respect to the values of the building with 
documentation and assessment.

Abstract 
Consumer demands for quality, product, pricing, better service, quick delivery, and product availability on the market 
are increasing. To distribute items and services in the correct place, with the right quality, price, and timing, proper 
distribution is required. Distribution, in broad terms, can be defined as a marketing activity that seeks to expedite and 
facilitate the delivery of goods and services from producers to consumers, so that they can be used as needed (type, 
quantity, price, place, and time required), because once the goods are made and ready to be marketed, the next stage 
in the marketing process is to determine the methods and routes that will be used to deliver the goods to the market. A 
method is required to be able to convey items effectively and efficiently while picking the optimum route for shipping 
goods. This study attempts to utilize the Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach in selecting the 
optimum path. So, utilizing the Weighted Product (WP) way, the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) Method, or the 
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), this study attempts to establish the most 
effective way for product distribution. Distance (km), trip time (minutes), quantity of Order (kg), cost (Rp), and amount 
of fuel (liters) are the factors that may be utilized to calculate the distribution route based on the study findings. Based 
on the Weighted Product (WP) approach calculation findings, a value of 177.10 Km is obtained. The Simple Additive 
Weighting (SAW) approach yielded a result of 201.08 Km. The best approach, with a total distance of 175.80 Km, is 
the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The Technique for Order Preference by 
Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique with a fuel cost of IDR 127,174.47 is the best method based on the 
calculation findings. The optimum technique, based on the calculation findings, is the Technique for Order Preference 
by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method.

Abstract 
An autonomous boat with vision ability provides distinct and immeasurable benefit to mankind. This research is to 
further study the development of the autonomous boat for underwater surveillance. The study's primary goal is to 
implement image processing on the autonomous boat. By using a single vision system on a boat, complemented by 
some algorithms and coding, many data can be obtained from the image processing. In this endeavor, the focus will 
be on analyzing the use of single vision cameras in providing data for research on environmental front underwater and 
detecting depth and obstacles for better navigation. The system can disclose solid objects underwater for restoration 
and cleaning purposes in the lake or rivers. Furthermore, it can identify lost object underwater and detect obstacles in 
front. In addition, it can provide depth information of a lake or river providing with correct algorithm and technique. 
The outcome is precise enough to recognize snags or objects above and underneath the water considering the 
diffraction of light required for impeccable vision. In this research, Open CV library is utilized for advanced picture 
processing and shading highlight investigation instead of MATLAB because of the multifaceted nature for ongoing 
procedure. The design structure is for the most part dependent on Pontoon style on the grounds that it is progressively 
steady and solid particularly on the stream wave condition. Through this paper also, all the mechanical structure is 
simulated using the Catia V5 Edition software and the real time coordinate points is also captured using a global 
positioning system receiver. All above, additional sensors and actuators are implemented in this project for further 
improvement of this current design.

1. Introduction
This project continues the innovation and development of autonomous boat for underwater surveillance. The main 
purpose of the last design is to facilitate in measuring the depth of a lake or river for various purposes. Conventional 
methods by using manual labor in measuring water depth are dangerous, not practical, and inefficient. Therefore, the 
previous project improved the general landscape of the field remarkably and fit the purpose of the last study. The 
project development on autonomous boat will be focusing more on image processing development on the boat to 
image of object below and above water and to detect obstacles and the depth of a lake or river. The development of 
the image processing will be focused on using Open CV Library rather than MATLAB due to real time-based process 
(Shakil and Rashid., 2023). A small analysis had been done regarding image processing for underwater surveillance 
in this country. Most of the work that has been done on the images is either on ground or air vehicles. Thus, this

casing of camera should be watertight to prevent from water damaging the camera and circuit. Lastly, the motor 
propeller should be replaced with faster and better motor to facilitate movement of the boat faster.

Abstract 
Due to globalization and the fast upkeep with fashion trends, the number of imported cheap textile products and fast 
fashion products are increasing in developing countries especially in Indonesia. This can suppress the development of 
local industries that are oriented towards green products. Lately, many Indonesian fashion industries are starting to 
apply sustainable concepts and some of them are in the batik sector. Natural dyed batik production process goes 
through several stages, in which overall need a long coloring process and expensive costs. This what makes natural 
dyed batik is relatively more expensive than the synthetic dyed batik as well as other types of fashion. The issue of 
consumers' willingness to pay for environmentally friendly products has begun to be widely discussed in research, 
especially in relation to the existence of eco-friendly fashion industries. This research primarily aims to identify the 
factors that influence consumers to buy environmentally friendly products. The method used is a review of literature 
studies related to the context of eco-friendly textile products. The findings of this study revealed that there are six 
factors that influence consumers' willingness to pay for natural dyed batik products, such as value orientation, 
cognitive knowledge, aesthetics, demographics, attitude towards green products, and green purchase intention.

1. Introduction
The changing dynamics of the fashion industry have forced retailers to manufacture products at low cost while 
remaining flexible in design, quality and speed to market. This strategy is carried out to maintain a profitable position 
in an increasingly demanding market (Bhardwaj & Fairhurst, 2010). With fast production times and the ability to keep 
up with the latest trends, fast fashion has been rapidly developed over decades (Brewer, 2019). Fast fashion focuses 
more on high profits with low production costs. The rise of cheap imported textile products in Indonesia has become 
a threat to small local textile entrepreneurs in Indonesia (Islamiati, 2023). This can be seen from the import value of 
used clothing in 2022 which reached US$272,146 with a volume of 26.22 tons, recorded by Statistics Indonesia. The

behavior. Chan (1999) revealed that cognitive knowledge about environmental issues is a significant predictor 
of environmentally friendly behavior. 
 
2. H2: Consumer attitudes towards environmentally friendly products affect consumer intentions in buying 
environmentally friendly products. 
According to research conducted by Verma (2018) by creating a socio-psychological model that was developed 
by including original variables, and showed that consumer attitudes towards environmentally friendly products 
ranked highest in the results achieved to predict consumer purchase intentions towards green products. Then 
Hung et al (2016) stated that consumer attitudes toward green products were positively related to consumer 
purchase intentions for green products. 
 
3. H3: Green purchase intention influences consumers' willingness to pay more to get environmentally friendly 
products. 
According to research conducted by Chaudhary (2018), purchase intention has a positive effect on willingness 
to pay. Because price plays an important role in making purchasing decisions. Research conducted by Xu, Wang, 
Yu (2019) also shows that purchase intention has a significant effect on willingness to pay. Because price is one 
of the factors that influence consumer behavior and intentions in buying a product, at an appropriate price, 
consumers' availability to pay will be created. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the literature review that has been done, it can be concluded that many studies have proven that demographic, 
cognitive knowledge, and value orientation are significantly related to willingness to pay. However, there are not 
many studies that include aesthetics as a variable, when aesthetics is one of the most important aspects of sustainable 
fashion since it plays a crucial role in attracting consumers. Sustainable fashion or natural dyed batik is frequently 
seen as dull or unappealing compared to the other types of batik, and buyers may be reluctant to buy eco-friendly 
options if they do not feel aesthetically satisfied. If natural dyed batik can offer aesthetically pleasing and trendy 
options, buyers are more likely to switch to sustainable and eco-friendly fashion. Therefore, aesthetic is essential in 
creating natural dyed batik that is both attractive and long-lasting.  
 
From the results and discussion that has been conducted, that there has not been much research discussing natural 
dyed batik products. Then further research is needed to discuss consumers' willingness to pay related to natural dyed 
batik as a form of support for authentic Indonesian sustainable fashion products, with the hypotheses and the research 
model that have been obtained in this study.

Abstract 
Despite the implementation of training during the onboarding process, weekly safety training, and on the job training 
a contractor experienced a disturbing trend in incidents reported during the 2022 work season. To understand the 
details surrounding and attributing to these incidents’ general safety data from the past five years was collected for 
analysis.  An in-depth analysis of the 2022 safety data was also generated from a series of incident reports. These 
reports contain both quantitative and qualitative data. The information provided in this paper covers both the general 
data collected and a detailed analysis of the 2022 reports. Based on the information collected program improvements 
are provided. Improvement to both the safety and the training program is necessary and a marriage of the two will be 
critical moving forward. These improvement suggestions are presented through refined training program proposals, 
technology incorporation examples, and include incentives for safe work. The improvements have not been adopted 
but are in the process of proposal. To ensure a safe completion to the 2023 work season several goals based on the 
information are generated.

1. Introduction
Training with the contractor, specifically safety training starts with the employee onboarding process and continues 
during employment. Annual safety meetings, on the job training, and toolbox talks are examples of the continuous 
training. Specific training is provided by the company in areas such as traffic control, driving, and equipment 
operation. Traffic control training may focus on state or municipality requirements for a safe work zone. Driver 
training revolves around safe driving, pre/post trip inspections, and compliance with federal and state regulations for 
both CDL and non CDL company vehicles and equipment. Equipment operation training is primarily conducted with 
an on-the-job training method, but manufacturer training sessions for specific equipment are also utilized. These 
trainings are documented via the employee’s records. If the training involves official certification such as First 
Aid/CPR the certificate is stored in the employee’s personnel file. Other training specific to the company such as 
equipment operation competencies is recorded in a master sheet and is updated as employees perform on the job duties. 
This paper will examine the safety data from the contractor from the last 5 years. The paper will specifically examine 
how safety and incident data can be utilized to identify trends and determine training priorities. Furthermore, how can 
a trained workforce reduce incidents. Based on the data suggestions for improvement will be discussed examples of 
resources presented. The program improvement data will be generated using quantitative and qualitative statistical 
analysis harvested from incident reports. These reports contain objective information such as dates and times but also 
include individual accounts and recollections of specific incidents. The reports and information will be utilized to 
determine trends and target employees for training. Finally, a realistic set of improvement goals and how to meet these 
goals with proper training will be generated based on the information contained in the report. Safety will be 
accomplished through training.

Data should not be collected and looked at after the fact, it should be utilized as an ongoing continuous improvement 
process that can chart and track improvement or hazards as the construction season continues. Creating a standard 
that pertains to analyzing data on a daily or weekly basis would allow for these improvements to occur. 
5.3 Technology Based Solutions 
To roll out the training and safety plans described in this paper technology must be utilized. Electronic standardized 
job site checklists, standard operating procedure videos, and arial load placement and weight distribution charts are 
just a few examples of how technology could be utilized to improve safety and training. Electronic job site safety 
checklists such as the example discussed would contain all the information included on a paper version of the job 
site checklist. An electronic checklist would allow the evaluator to enter observations electronically in a survey 
fashion. Once the information is input it could be stored in a spread sheet for accurate efficient analysis of both 
safety and training data. For security purposes not all information can be collected and recorded electronically, but 
general job site information such as proper utilization of PPE, SOPs, and traffic control could easily be recorded 
with a date and time stamp. This could save hours of data transfer and streamline the process. 
 
Part of streamlining processes includes the utilization of videos SOPs. Both safety and training procedures can be 
delivered in video form. Utilizing videos for safety and training allows for a dynamic training opportunity. Videos 
can be utilized and accessed by anyone in the company at any time, they allow for direct instruction when a trainer 
is not present, and they break down language barriers and promote diversity and inclusion using graphics and 
subtitles. This reinforces the company’s dedication to being an EOO. Below is an example of a video that focuses on 
how to pair a backup camera. This video can be accessed via QR code and provides a brief yet concise training on 
how to pair the camera system. This video was produced using the Adobe Creative suite which could be purchased 
by company for less than one hundred dollars per month. The ability to create videos that are vital to a common 
process will provide education and efficiency to any standard operating procedure. 
 
Additional opportunities for implementing technology includes electronic weight distribution charts for vehicles. 
Utilizing electronic weight and distribution charts could expedite the loading process, eliminate overweight tickets, 
and create a uniform process for loading vehicles company wide. If this system were implemented an employee 
could simply scan a QR or locate a database via an app on their drivers tablet which would display the load 
information. This information could include tank charts or birds eye views of the deck with object placement. 
Establishing a database to track the load distribution of each vehicle would provide employees the information 
necessary to never overload a vehicle. These databases and charts would establish a level of accountability for the 
driver to conform to legal weight policies. If equipment is transferred to another location, this data base could serve 
as an anchor for consistency pertaining to load placement.

6. Conclusion  
Based on the document above safety and training implementation goals for the 2023 season are necessary. These 
goals must be integrated into one goal: safety through training. Goals focusing on backing up incident reduction and 
goals focused on how to train employees to meet these reduction goals are vital. These goals should be lofty and are 
necessary, but also need to be realistic. Proper training of employees on the implementation and utilization of back 
up cameras and standard operating procedures will reduce the incident rate. A critical evaluation of the proposed

safety incentive program and qualification program will be completed by the mid-way point of the 2023 season with 
implementation forecasts. 
 
It is also important to note that missing information for specific variables such as time worked could obscure the 
efforts to track patterns and identify potential safety risks for employees. Implementing a goal to collect 100% of the 
data related to incidents is a critical to accurately assessing the safety and training program at the conclusion of the 
2023 season.  
 
Finally, to effectively reach all employees a pilot to diversify training will be implemented in 2023. This pilot will 
utilize the QR and electronic form technology described above to streamline a uniform training platform with 
equitable access for all employees. This type of training will ensure the safety of all employees.

Abstract 
Overprocessing in the internal logistics of an automotive assembly plant occurs in the part sorting process identified 
at two sorting levels: The first level involves forklift drivers sorting parts at the skid level. In contrast, the second level 
entailed operators manually sorting box parts by assembly line addresses which supply by electronic car drivers via 
limited electronic cars and fixed routes that are unstable workloads and are inoperative under cycle time. This paper 
provided an approach to redesign internal routes with the Google Operation Research Tools (OR-Tools) to optimize 
route grouping for a balanced workload under cycle time. The simulation technique is applied to evaluate the 
performance of electronic car loaded capacity utilization and working under cycle time. The consequence of the 
calculation is the new route supply, which requires two modifications, i.e., to assign suppliers to allocate the parts 
boxes on the skid at a ratio of 1 skid per 1 new route to eliminate the manual box sorting process and to design the 
layout in transfer areas by new route for using the Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) system that instead of box parts 
sorting worker with lean manufacturing principles. The work finally concludes with a summary and outlook for the 
future.

1. Introduction
Over the past few years, demand for automobiles or rapid innovations in the automotive industry had been burgeoning 
before it was put to a halt by the COVID-19 outbreak (Kaitwade 2021). However, the industry faced critical challenges 
before the pandemic began, significantly affecting the automotive production volume. Jehan (2021) proposed to 
maintain profitability despite seasonal demand changes. Manufacturers must adapt and efficiently manage their 
processes flexibly. The automotive assembly plant always tries to adapt to changing situations by applying a lean 
manufacturing concept. It means producing goods using fewer resources, such as human labor and manufacturing 
space. To reduce waste and improve customer satisfaction. 
Automotive parts management is one of the internal logistics activities in the assembly plant. The case study consists 
of four departments: Production Planning, Part Planning, Part Manufacturing/Suppliers, and Assembly Plant. The 
Production planning department is responsible for creating the monthly production plan for the Part planning 
department. Once the plan is created, the part planning department implements the plan for daily part ordering to 
suppliers who prepare the parts. The automotive parts are then set in boxes and arranged on skids for delivery to the 
assembly plant. The assembly plant receives 4,738-part numbers from 230 suppliers, which is a significant amount to 
manage. Especially internal logistics operations manage parts delivered from suppliers at the receiving dock in the 
assembly plant to the assembly line.  
According to automotive parts that are delivered to the assembly plant by suppliers. Suppliers consider correct 
quantity, good quality, and timely delivery following parts ordering by the part planning department. The assembly 
plant receives mixed box parts on the skids. It means box parts on a skid need to be delivered to multi-lineside. That 
is why the assembly plant needs to have a manual box part-sorting process by assembly line addresses. However, 
internal logistics processes are in the assembly plant from a Lean manufacturing perspective. Overprocessing occurs

5. Conclusion 
This paper presented a four-step implementation approach to eliminate overprocessing in the manual box sorting 
process. It has been identified that there is a need to improve the cooperation between departments, particularly 
between the production planning and the parts planning department. These two departments are responsible for 
managing the automobile parts ordering for the assembly plant, which is directly affected.  
The assembly plant must design a new electronic car route to supply parts to assembly line addresses to address this 
issue. To develop a new route supply per skid sent to the part planning department to coordinate with the supplier to 
arrange box parts on skids as specified by the assembly plant. The proposed approach can eliminate the manual sorting 
process at the part box level. All departments must agree to this requirement together. New internal route data needs 
to be added in part ordering data. It will impact multiple departments, particularly the suppliers, who need to adjust 
their operations. We recommended studying the effect on each department and implementing a pilot phase to lead to 
a smoother transition and better overall outcomes. 
 
The simulation results confirm the feasibility of the new internal route that works under cycle time. Workload balance 
is efficient in routes, mainly when calculating based on volume demands. The electronic car-loaded capacity utilization 
is significant for evaluation. In conclusion, balancing the workload in each route is essential for optimal electronic 
car-loaded capacity utilization.  
We need to understand the current situation before operation improvement. In this case, the study parts condition is 
managed by another department. We consider internal factors regarding the assembly plant in the current situation. 
The assembly plant needs to eliminate a manual box sorting process and change direct supply to lineside if we have a 
precise requirement. We can generate ideas for improvement.

Abstract 
Machine learning has been successfully applied to different fields, including aviation industry. There is a large amount 
of knowledge and data accumulation in the aviation industry which divided into reactive and proactive method in 
Safety Risk Management concept. Nowadays, those groups of data are collected as safety data and are used to 
predictive approach where potential unsafe events and precursors are identified beforehand, and mitigation strategies 
are implemented to prevent incident/accident. This study aims to predict incident/accident events on aircraft in the 
MRO industry based on investigation event data so that mitigation can be carried out to reduce the impact of aircraft 
damage and even prevent more fatal things from occurring. From the prediction model built, it is hoped that the factors 
or variables that can determine the risk index category in an incident/accident event can also be identified. The 
processing data using several algorithms namely SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The accuracy 
results are random forest (94.29%), decision tree (91.43%), naïve bayes (91.43%) and SVM (83%).

1. Introduction
The key to improving performance, identifying latent conditions, and thus avoiding human errors is risk management 
in relation to aviation maintenance. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s requirement for a safety 
management system is SMS which has four components namely safety policy, Safety Risk Management (SRM), safety 
assurance and safety promotion (ICAO, 2018). Along with the development of the aviation industry, of course 
stakeholders (government, manufacturer, airlines, MRO, etc.) are required to always ensure the safety of passengers 
through various kinds of safety programs and safety improvements. It is known that aircraft airworthiness starts from 
safety on the ground. The total elimination of aviation accidents and serious incidents is a desirable goal, but clearly 
unachievable. In recent years, the concept of risk-free systems has evolved into a perspective based on safety 
management, with a view to supporting resource allocation processes in which the balance between production and 
protection is achieved (Insua et al., 2016).  
It is crucial for organizations to recognize and offer the earliest possible warning of potential risks and targeted 
countermeasures through hazard identification, which is a key part of reducing risks, but the ability to do this can be 
easily affected by individuals carrying out risk assessments (Mendes et al., 2022; Goh et al., 2010). Hazard 
identification is a part of safety risk management (SRM), that have two main methodologies i.e., reactive method 
which involves analysis of past outcomes or events through investigations of safety occurrences and proactive method 
which involves collecting safety data of lower consequences events or process performance and analyzing the safety 
information or frequency of occurrences to determine if a hazard could lead to an accident or incident. Besides that, 
safety data analyses that detect adverse trends and predict future safety risks, for example, may also be used to identify 
hazards (ICAO, 2018). Nowadays, to identify potential unsafe events and precursors before they happen, the aviation 
sector has evolved from reactive to proactive and predictive in which mitigation strategies are implemented for 
preventing loss of life (Puranik et al., 2020) and preventing similar errors from reoccurring (Rankin et al., 2000).

The highest accuracy value is 94.29% using random forest. The second is using decision tree with accuracy 91.43%, 
then followed by naïve bayes with value 91.43%. The lowest accuracy value is 83% using SVM. Due to random forest 
having the highest accuracy, it is indicating that random forest has excellent generalization ability and can effectively 
predict the risk index using incident/accident investigation database with small amount of samples (Table 1).

5.2 Proposed Improvements  
Further research on data processing using different or ensemble algorithms is needed to achieve better accuracy for 
risk reduction, because the predictions made in this category of risk index are more accurate based on the results 
obtained. Also, having sufficient safety data may affect the accuracy of safety prediction. In addition, prediction 
modeling cannot only use safety data from investigation results but can use other safety data such as audit results, 
surveillance results, occurrence reports, and others. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, an aviation maintenance safety risk prediction model based on incident/accident investigation event 
database is proposed to build safety risk prediction for improving the learning accuracy of sample safety data. The 
processing data using several algorithms namely SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The highest 
accuracy value is 94.29% using random forest. The second is using decision tree with accuracy 91.43%, then followed 
by naïve bayes with value 91.43%. The lowest accuracy value is 83% using SVM. Due to random forest having the 
highest accuracy, it is indicating that random forest has excellent generalization ability and can effectively predict the 
risk index using incident/accident investigation database with small amount of samples. 
 
Further research on data processing using different or ensemble algorithms is needed to achieve better accuracy for 
risk reduction, because the predictions made in this category of risk index are more accurate based on the results 
obtained. Also, having sufficient safety data may affect the accuracy of safety prediction. In addition, prediction 
modeling cannot only use safety data from investigation results but can use other safety data such as audit results, 
surveillance results, occurrence reports, and others.

Abstract 
Lately, accurate recognition of Process Control Chart Patterns (CCPs) has been considered one of the significant 
tactics for supervising manufacturing processes in order to achieve better control and to improve products quality. In 
addition to the single patterns, a huge work has been done to recognize concurrent ones that are usually due to the 
presence of two or more single patterns.  Feature-based approaches are more efficient in pattern recognition especially 
in the case of concurrent patterns.  Furthermore, a selection of an optimal set of features can significantly reduce the 
diagnostic search process.  In this paper, a new approach based on a combination of Adaptive neuro‑fuzzy inference 
system (ANFIS), Wavelet analysis (WA) and Principal components analysis (PCA) is used to recognize concurrent 
patterns ANFIS has proven to show high accuracy in pattern recognition. WA is used in this paper to improve the 
characteristics of the patterns to facilitate the recognition process by adding frequency features to the original pattern. 
Then, thirteen statistical features are extracted and PCA reduces their number to the most important three.  ANFIS is 
used for training and testing the data based on the three extracted features as inputs and the patterns as target outputs. 
Extensive performance evaluation was carried out under normally and various non-normally distributed data. The 
non-normality of the inputs is based on two Gamma and Beta distributions. Results indicate that the proposed approach 
performs with high accuracy even in the case of non-normally distributed patterns.

1. Introduction
Statistical process control charts play an essential role in monitoring and controlling the quality of a manufacturing 
process. The process is considered to be out of control if a point falls outside of the control limits, or if a sequence of 
points exhibits an unusual pattern. It’s known that a specific unnatural pattern on a statistical control chart can usually 
be caused by a specific set of transferable causes (Western Electric 1956). Analysis and diagnosis of unnatural patterns 
is an essential aspect of statistical process control charting. Realization and recognition of unnatural patterns can be 
used essentially to narrow the possible causes that should be investigated and, therefore, reduce the diagnostic time 
(H. Cheng and Cheng 2009). The reduced variation in the process represents an essential role in the success of 
operations in a globally competitive market. Control charts also known as Shewhart control charts were first proposed 
by Walter Andrew Shewhart in 1931 (Shewhart 1931). Since then these charts have been broadly used to monitor and 
control manufacturing processes. Once an out-of-control state has been identified, steps can be taken to determine root 
causes of variation then the necessary corrective action. Deming (Deming 1982) showed that it is not valuable to 
determine the causes of the variations when the process exhibits common variations. On the other hand, when the 
process displays uncommon variations, it is beneficial to detect and try to eliminate them. Yet, Shewhart charts lack 
the ability to provide information about the trend of the process over time or to detect small shifts in the process mean 
or standard deviation. Statistical process control chart, on the other hand, is able to determine unnatural patterns and 
trends regardless of the magnitude of the shift in the process mean or standard deviation. These unnatural patterns are 
the illustration of the long term behavior of the manufacturing processes alerting of needed actions to be taken to bring 
the process back to its normal state.

that classifier accuracy increases with the number of decomposition levels of the wavelet transform, the higher is the 
level the lowest are the number of wavelet coefficients and so is the classifier confusion. Figure 5 is a parallel 
coordinates plot where features are laid out horizontally and each pattern is represented by the median and quartiles 
(25% and 75% points). It shows the importance of the four features including the wavelet energy in classifying some 
of the patterns. The energy value is calculated based on level 4 wavelet decomposition.

A comparison between non-wavelet based classifiers and classifier 2 shows a significant improvement of the proposed 
method that varies between 3% and 57% improvement as clearly shown in Table 2. It also shows that accuracy rates

5. Conclusion 
Due to the importance of statistical process control charts and their essential role in monitoring and controlling the 
quality of a manufacturing process, it is necessary to develop better methods to recognize accurately abnormalities 
and irregular patterns in the process. In this research we focused mainly on concurrent patterns due to the difficulty in 
detecting them by many approaches. This difficulty lies in non-stationarity behavior of these patterns which increases 
the difficulties of detection. In that respect we proposed to use Haar wavelet transform and use signal frequency 
characteristics with some selected statistical and shape features along with wavelet coefficients energy as input to the 
ANFIS classifier. In this approach, statistical and shape features of the input data were selected using PCA and their 
robustness was tested for different random distributions.  
 
Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that this classifier provides better results with concurrent CCPs. The 
combination of statistical, shape and frequency features with wavelet energy assures high accuracy and consistency 
in detecting concurrent patterns over different random distributions. The use of PCA to reduce the number of features 
not only reduced ANFIS complexity, it also improved accuracy of the classifier.  
In future work, we will verify the performance of this approach with real manufacturing processes. In addition, further 
work will take place to evaluate the effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy approach to statistical control chart pattern 
recognition for concurrent patterns containing more than one unnatural pattern, such as stratification and increasing 
trend.

Abstract 
All industries have embraced three dimensions printing, which is shown to offer several advantages. This article 
examines the use of 3D printing in the construction industry. Concrete is the primary component when using 3D 
printing in a building; reinforcements are either seldom employed or not used at all. Although having many 
advantages, this building approach has some drawbacks. The substance utilized to make the printable paste 
combination is currently being researched because this is a novel technology. To meet the needs of 3D printing, 
material use, and mixing proportions have considerably different qualities from those of conventional building 
methods. As a fundamental need, three-dimensional printed concrete(3DPC) demands that an object be printed, 
buildable, resilient, and consistent. Knowing that 3D printing seldom uses reinforcement to increase strength, 
durability, or stability is crucial. This article offers a concise overview of all the applications, difficulties, and prospects 
for 3DPC. The article starts out with defining 3D printing before going on to discuss its prerequisites and challenges. 
It also examines the fundamentals of 3D printing in concrete, including its background, uses, and advantages. In this 
article, printing techniques and materials are thoroughly examined, and a material that is optimum for sustainability 
is suggested.

1. Introduction
The development of 3D printing in construction as a manufacturing technique has made it possible to manufacture 
complex structures and architectural ideas rapidly and precisely. Although the concept of additive manufacturing (AM) 
and 3D printing(3DP) has existed since the 1980s, it wasn't popular until the early 2000s that academics and builders 
began to take the technology seriously  (Venkata Siva Rama Prasad 2022). In the field of construction, 3D printing 
has advanced quickly during the last ten years. Prior to 2014, 3DP was still in its infancy, and only a small number of 
significant demonstration projects were built using the technology. Most often, 3D concrete printing was used for 
landscape architecture, street decor, and other non-load-bearing maintenance buildings. The revolutionary progress of 
printing projects is as anticipated as the distinctive attributes of 3D concrete printing, even if several excellent 
engineering projects have been released since 2016  (Kazadi et al. 2022). 
3D printing has a wide range of possible uses, from minuscule medical devices to massive infrastructural projects. It 
has already been used to create homes, bridges, and buildings, and it has a lot of potential for the future of design and 
construction  (Pessoa et al. 2021). Computational modeling is widely used to assess the effect of process parameters 
to manufacture 3D printed items with high dimensional precision, consistent microstructure in terms of grain size, 
shape, and composition, and desirable material characteristics and mechanical qualities tailored to specific 
applications  (Khan et al. 2020). The adoption of functional architecture and pre-assembly, the design and manufacture 
of pieces with complicated geometries, increased productivity, lower labor demand, sustainability and greater energy 
efficiency, and reduced construction and demolition waste generation are some of the most notable benefits of 3D 
printing  (Robayo-Salazar et al. 2023). 
A 3D design model can be created by stacking 2D printed planes using a technique called three-dimensional printing 
(3DP), which operates on a similar premise as 2D printing  (Zhang et al. 2019). The development of concrete printing

and 160 g of fine aggregates, 0.39 ratio of water/cement. Additionally, 0.625 mL of a retarder and 1 mL of an 
accelerator were added to the mixture. 
 
7. Conclusion 
• 
An interesting new process called 3D printing in concrete is now the focus of a lot of investigation. Despite the 
advances made in the lab, the number of successfully completed large-scale efforts is still quite low. One of the 
main issues with this technology is the lack of standardization in terms of material combinations, equipment, and 
essential features. 
• 
For successful 3D printing of concrete, the mixture should satisfy physical, rheological, and mechanical 
properties. These properties can be satisfied by making the mixture extrudable, buildable, flowable, open time, 
optimum strength, and strong adhesion. 
• 
The choice of material, material strength, and interlayer bonding all affect the way 3D printed concrete conducts 
heat. The increased air concentration in foaming agent material mixes results in better heat resistance. The printed 
wall or structure, however, fails the thermal test because of the gaps in the layers if the interlayer connection is 
weak. 
• 
Creating the ideal mixture for 3D printing is a huge challenge that depends on taking into consideration a number 
of factors, including strength, rheology, and thermal properties. If this technology is used to its maximum capacity, 
it might drastically reduce risks and costs associated with the construction industry while speeding up projects. 
• 
Researchers undertook several tests to create a combination distinct from conventional concrete compositions. 
Researchers introduced or eliminated components like retarders, superplasticizers, additives, etc. depending on 
the desired qualities. Many researchers have also looked at creating 3D printing mixtures utilizing building debris. 
Despite studying several mixes, it is challenging to identify the one perfect composition. Every mixture fits the 
conditions of the experiment and fails for others. Therefore, standardization is essential to knowing the optimum 
needed features and materials.

Abstract 
Modern integrated circuits (ICs) focused on lowering the size of semiconductor devices are quicker and more efficient 
thanks to the implementation of Moore's law at the nanoscale level. The successful scaling of silicon field-effect 
transistors in terms of power, performance, and cost has primarily driven the exponential growth of microelectronics 
over the last six decades. Nevertheless, this process is nearing its physical limitations as the critical dimensions of 
cutting-edge silicon devices approach the 5 nm zone. One of the main stumbling blocks to enhancing the device's 
performance is that MOSFETs have reliability concerns at the nanoscale. Reliability issues with silicon based 
MOSFET technology are a significant cause for worry in the nanoscale area. Thus, the integrated circuit manufacturing 
sector assumes that silicon devices would be unable to meet the needs of nanoscale technology to future perspective 
and demand. The miniaturization of MOS nanoscale semiconductor devices allows for more functionality and 
integration density per unit area without sacrificing performance. Due to their distinct geometrical and electrical 
features, carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been proposed as a viable alternative to silicon in the primary function of next-
generation logic switches. This article first reviews the latest progress toward addressing the manufacturability issues 
for scaled carbon-nanotube transistors, from the material level up to the level of device integration and reliability 
concern. Then it compares these advantages to silicon from a technological development perspective. Lastly, potential 
future uses of nanotube transistors in the industry be proposed.

CRISPR Solution to Cure Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Shrinidhi Kulkarni 
International Academy East 
Abstract 
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells 
are produced. In leukemia, there is an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which are produced in the bone 
marrow and accumulate in the blood, disrupting normal blood function. The abnormal white blood cells, called 
leukemic cells, are unable to perform their usual function of fighting infections and protecting the body from diseases, 
and instead, they crowd out healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, leading to anemia, infections, and 
bleeding. 
There are several types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). ALL and AML affect immature white 
blood cells that have not fully developed, while CLL and CML affect mature white blood cells that have developed 
more fully. ALL is more common in children, while AML is more common in adults. 
Leukemia can be acute or chronic, depending on how quickly the disease develops and progresses. In acute leukemia, 
the abnormal white blood cells multiply rapidly, and the disease progresses quickly, sometimes over a matter of weeks 
or months. Acute leukemia requires immediate treatment because the uncontrolled growth of leukemic cells can 
quickly lead to life-threatening complications. In chronic leukemia, the disease develops slowly, sometimes over many 
years, and the abnormal white blood cells accumulate gradually. Chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms for a 
long time, and it may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test. 
Acute leukemia is identified by the rapid proliferation of immature, abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow 
and blood. In contrast, chronic leukemia is identified by the accumulation of mature, abnormal white blood cells in 
the blood and bone marrow. 
The exact cause of leukemia is unknown, but several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. These 
factors include exposure to radiation, certain chemicals, and viruses such as the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-
1) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Genetic factors may also play a role in the development of leukemia, as some
types of the disease are more common in families.
The symptoms of leukemia can vary depending on the type of leukemia and the stage of the disease. Common 
symptoms include fatigue, weakness, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and frequent infections. Other symptoms may 
include bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, and easy bruising or bleeding. 
Diagnosis of leukemia usually involves a physical examination, blood tests, and a bone marrow biopsy. In a bone 
marrow biopsy, a small sample of bone marrow is removed and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells. 
Additional tests, such as imaging studies, may also be performed to determine the extent of the disease. 
Treatment for leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the age and overall health of 
the patient. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, or targeted 
therapy. Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells, while radiation therapy uses high-energy 
radiation to destroy cancer cells. Stem cell transplantation involves replacing damaged bone marrow with healthy stem 
cells from a donor. Targeted therapy involves the use of drugs that target specific proteins or genes that are involved 
in the growth and spread of cancer cells. 
Acute leukemia is generally more difficult to treat than chronic leukemia, and the prognosis for advanced stages of 
the disease is generally poorer. However, advances in the treatment of leukemia have led to improved survival rates 
in recent years. In conclusion, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized 
by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal white blood cells, which interfere with the normal functioning of the immune 
system. The exact cause of leukemia is unknown, but several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. 
Treatment for leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the age and overall health of 
the patient. While leukemia can be a serious and life-threatening disease, advances in treatment have led to improved 
1060","survival rates in recent years. Early detection and prompt treatment are important for improving outcomes in patients 
with leukemia. Your chance of getting leukemia is strongly related to your age. Around 1.9 million people get cancer 
each year and roughly 680,000 people die of cancer each year. What can cause cancer? There are several factors that 
can contribute to the development of leukemia, including exposure to chemicals, radiation, and viruses. 
Here’s how each one can increase the chance of getting cancer. 
Exposure to certain chemicals can cause cancer because they alter the cell's DNA. Any chemical that raises the chance 
of getting cancer is called a Carcinogen. DNA is made up of four base pairs: Adenine (C5H5N5), Thymine 
(C5H6N2O2), Cytosine (C4H5N3O), and Guanine (C5H5N5O). These base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds 
that allow them to hold together the sugar and phosphates. One of the ways that carcinogens alter your DNA is through 
Carcinogin Adducts. Carcinogen adduction is when a carcinogen, such as benzene (C6H6), forms a covalent bond 
with the oxygen or nitrogen parts of DNA during cell division. During cell division, the cell cuts the DNA in half. 
This is when the benzene (C6H6) will form a covalent bond with one of the four base pairs and can generate H2O2 
which can lead to apoptosis or AML. Benzene is found in plastics, synthetic fibers, rubber, and other materials. It is 
also found in gasoline, cigarette smoke, and some cleaning products.  
What is CRISPR? 
CRISPR Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that 
has transformed the field of genetic engineering. It was discovered in the late 1980s in the immune systems of bacteria 
that were fighting off viruses such as bacteriophages. Bacteriophages inject their DNA into the bacteria to hijack the 
bacteria so that the bacteriophage can make more of itself. But scientists discovered that the bacteria’s immune system 
could edit the phage’s  
DNA and render it useless. 
The CRISPR system consists of two main components: the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA (gRNA). The Cas9 enzyme 
acts like a pair of molecular scissors, cutting the DNA at a specific location within the genome. The gRNA serves as 
a sort of GPS, directing the Cas9 enzyme to the precise location within the DNA that needs to be edited. 
The way CRISPR works is that the guide RNA is designed to recognize a specific sequence of DNA within the 
genome. Once it binds to that sequence, the Cas9 enzyme is activated and cuts the DNA at that specific location. This 
creates a double-stranded break in the DNA, which triggers the cell's natural repair mechanisms to fix the break. 
Depending on the type of repair mechanism used, the cell can either repair the DNA with an error-prone process called 
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or it can repair the DNA using a more precise process called homology-directed 
repair (HDR). Using CRISPR, scientists can introduce specific changes into the genome of an organism, such as 
deleting or adding genes, changing the expression of genes, or correcting genetic mutations that cause disease. This 
technology has the potential to revolutionize medicine by allowing researchers to create targeted therapies for a variety 
of genetic disorders. 
Despite its many potential benefits, CRISPR is not without its risks and ethical concerns. There is the possibility of 
off-target effects, where the Cas9 enzyme cuts DNA at unintended locations, potentially causing unintended 
consequences. In conclusion, CRISPR is a powerful gene-editing technology that has the potential to revolutionize 
medicine, agriculture, and many other fields. Its ability to precisely and efficiently edit the genome has opened up new 
possibilities for targeted therapies and genetic engineering. However, its use also raises important ethical and safety 
concerns that must be carefully considered and addressed. 
Solution. 
In CRISPR gene editing, a CRISPR solution refers to the combination of the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA (gRNA) 
that is used to target a specific sequence of DNA for editing. The CRISPR solution is delivered into cells, where it can 
introduce changes to the genome, such as deleting or adding genes, altering the expression of genes, or correcting 
genetic mutations that cause disease. The CRISPR solution is typically created by combining the Cas9 enzyme with 
a custom-designed guide RNA that is complementary to the DNA sequence to be targeted. The guide RNA is designed 
using computational tools to ensure specificity and avoid off-target effects.  One of the challenges in developing a 
CRISPR solution is ensuring that the guide RNA is specific enough to target the desired DNA sequence without 
binding to other, unintended sequences in the genome. To address this challenge, researchers use computational tools 
to predict potential off-target sites and experimental methods to assess the specificity of the CRISPR system. 
Validation 
So, what is the proof that any of this works? Well, several things determine whether a gRNA sequence would be

Abstract 
Green Economy deals with human welfare and its care for the preservation of the environment and ecosystem of life 
in term of economic development but every coin have two side, economic development also affected negatively i.e. 
depletion of natural resources due to over exploitation, pollution of air , water and land. Green economy refers an 
economy to promote growth and development, conserve natural capital, mend well-being of human and poverty 
alleviation and bring down inequality. Concept of Green economy arise when economy work along the sustainability 
goals. The core of green economy have low carbon growth, resource efficiency and social inclusive through green 
business and energy management to implement sustainability. Islam consider human being as superintendent of earth 
to whom Quran guided, earth is vital defended component for sustain future. In Islamic approaches to sustainable 
green life involves living in peace and harmony. This paper aligns triple bottom line rules of sustainable development 
i.e. profit, people and planets to attain the green economy with fundamental rule of Islam in order to protect the
environment and to enhance growth and development. This paper has an attempt to bring in light, how Green banking
take along financial stability and economic growth, poverty alleviation and environmental protection that contribute
to improves the environment as means of cost and energy savings, preservation of natural resources and the need to
respect all living things.  Objective of study: To analyses the fundamental rules of Islam in relation to profit, people
and planets to attain green economy. To find out relationship between financial stability, economic growth, poverty
alleviation, environmental protection and green economy.

1. Introduction
In the present scenario of degradation, Green economy is a main concern to accomplish because it is a significant 
instrument to prosper the sustainable development. Green economy reveals clean and energy efficient economy. 
UNDP define Green Economy, “One that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly 
reducing environmental risk and ecological scarcities.”  Green economy means low carbon and pollution, resources 
efficient and enhance energy and social inclusive and prevent biodiversity and ecosystem loss. Thus, Presently Green 
economy gives more emphasis to utilization of renewable energy for the electricity generation rather than Coal. 
Application of renewable energy can bring a potential climate change mitigation, energy saving and the ability to 
make better pollution free environment by taking energy from wind, water, or the sun.  Green Economy deals with 
human welfare and its care for the preservation of the environment and ecosystem of life in term of economic 
development. Green economy refers an economy to promote growth and development, conserve natural capital, mend 
well-being of human and poverty alleviation and bring down inequality. Concept of Green economy arise when 
economy work along the sustainability goals. 
Islam consider human being as superintendent of earth to whom Quran guided, earth is vital defended component for 
sustain future. In Islamic approaches to sustainable green life involves living in peace and harmony. Islam and green 
economy are unified that could be prove with great concern given by Quran preach that the existence of God not only 
for human, but also for universe and for all of His creation i.e. people, animals and plants etc. Islam has define Universe 
is the main source of human life energy with following three philosophical idea: 
1.
Activities related to saving Universe is consider a part of obedience to God.
2.
God’s command to preserve universe

6. Conclusion 
In nutshell we can conclude that when it comes to improving the environment through cost and energy savings, the 
preservation of natural resources, and the need to respect all living things, green banking combines financial stability, 
economic growth, poverty reduction, and environmental protection. Out of which Islamic banking, which is one of 
the major ingredients, includes green banking, can actively contribute to sustainable development in emerging 
economies. Islamic banking is becoming more popular, which benefits sustainable development and environmental 
conservation. Unplanned city growth, deforestation, hill tract excavating, natural disasters, and deregulation are all 
contributing to daily social structural changes that are becoming increasingly noticeable. These elements have been 
placing greater demands on a nation's ecosystem, which has seriously hampered sustainable growth. In order for the 
environment to stay in a sustainable state and for civilization to be safe from environmental dangers, banks should be 
severe about their borrowers' adherence to environmental protection standards. 
Islamic banks favor green banking as a conformity to ""Shari'ah."" Green banking has a stronger relationship to Islam 
since it upholds the principles of green banking, including social responsibility, cleanliness, reducing resource waste, 
and upholding ethics (Masukujjaman, 2016). Islamic banks are closely adhering to the principles of green banking. 
The state of green banking found that it is prerequisite for Islamic banking. It is clear that the primary barriers to green 
banking practices are ignorance, a lack of understanding, green risk, etc. 
Some specific recommendations for Islamic banking. It should practice green banking both internally and externally 
to safeguard the environment for sustainable growth. Few actions are essential have been taken by stakeholders: First, 
the scheduled and Islamic banks should be offer comprehensive green banking services to their clients in order to 
promote sustainable development. Through seminars, symposiums, and training programmes, Islamic banks should 
raise awareness of green banking among their employees and clients. Third, the Islamic Bank should set up short 
courses, diploma programmes, and training programmes on green banking to educate officials of scheduled banks on 
the subject. 
According to the analysis' conclusions, there are several prospects for further study as it is an important field. 
Parameter of to ascertain the connection between green economy, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and 
financial stability. Islamic Bank and Sustainable Development are burning parameters although there is still very little 
research on Islamic banks and the green economy.

Recent trends include the application of the Fundamental Law of Islam to the Green Economy considering that there 
is a lot of research that has been done. But this can be a chance for future study to produce the most recent 
research.

Abstract 
 This research paper focuses on the fact that despite learning so many Management theories from USA, Japan and 
other developed countries we in India continue to face problems in running our institutions and organisations. The 
problems manifest through gherao, lockouts, labour agitations, pen down strikes, go slow movements and finally sick 
industries knocking doors of BIFR. Why can’t the Indian goods compete in the global markets? We often find the 
Managers blame their own team members: they are laggards, irresponsible and disobedient. Is it really true or we are 
following outdated theories and ideas in Managing people? Behavioural psychology is an integral element of 
management science. While we teach American and Japanese methods at our Business schools and universities what 
is it that we have done to evolve the Indian method or system? The author is of the opinion that understanding the 
Indian behaviour and ethos will help us to come out with an approach and right kind of Management style to create 
harmony and industrial peace. Through this research paper  the author has tried to establish relevance of Indian 
Management recognising the influence of cultural approach. Besides, the author could articulate and recognise the 
varied and diverse thoughts and thinkers on Indian Management. The article revolve around evidences where Indian 
Management concepts really works and  has been shaping the world for thousands of years. 
Keywords 
Indian Management, ethos, spirituality, managerial effectiveness, models, systems. 
1. Introduction
 If there can be American style in Management, Japanese style, British style then why should not be there an Indian 
Style of Management? Or to be more specific: is there any Indian Style of Management?  Today it is increasingly 
recognised that managerial and leadership styles, to be more effective, need to be ingrained with Indian cultural ethos. 
Culture is totality, a fabric woven with attitudes, beliefs, mores, attitudes and habits. Our Indian epics be it Upanishads, 
shastras and the Bhagwat Gita has been a bonanza and repository of many such priceless ingredients of culture. They 
have been the essence of our glorious traditions and often stressed by Adi Sankara in the ninth century , literary works 
like Thirukural , by Gokhale, Tilak, Aurobindo, Vivekananda,  Radhakrishnan and Mahatma Gandhi in modern India 
and also includes western scholars such as Max Muller,  Mathew Arnold and Romain Rolland.  
2. Literature Review
While reviewing the literature, the author has observed that over the  years there has been lot of curiosity and questions 
to know the details about tenets of  Indian management, Indian spirituality (IS) and Indian ways of management. It is 
pertinent to mention that works done on Indian Management  by Cappelli, Harbir, Jitendra and Michael (2010) has 
created lot of interest at the global level. Another powerful insight is resonated through the  work of Philip Goldberg’s 
(2010) book, American Veda: From Emerson and Beatles to Yoga & Meditation—How Indian Spirituality Changed 
the West. The detailed work done by him documents the impact of Indian management on developed nations where 
he emphasised to a great extent about USA. Besides, the work done on new models by Nankervis, Cooke and 
Chatterjee (2012), (New Models of HRM in China & India), generates a discussion on some of the Indian models of 
human resource management (HRM) that is deeply rooted in Indian culture and practices. Undoubtedly, all these are 
indicative of the evolution of internationalisation of Indian thoughts resonated through Indian Management. 
The very theme of this research paper is to justify the legacy of the existence of Indian management and its unexplored 
potential that is  yet to be fully recognised at the international level. The search has been to see how Indian ethos 
depicted in our shastras and Vedanta can help in shaping value based managers and corporate captains , offering their 
best for the good of society with precision of the Indian worldview of “oneness” in contrast to worldview of “ 
separateness” and finally to present the bouquet of universal values and ideals to give the modern day corporate 
executives and managers a flavour of Indian wisdom that acts as a springboard for leadership and managerial

To justify the relevance of Indian Management Swami Someswarananda, the then President of Vivekananda centre 
for Indian Management, Indore along with his team initiated a battery of  experiments in different Private and public 
sector enterprises. As and when he approached different public and private sector companies , doors were opened and 
he was allowed to conduct experiments. Through their studies and results of experiments Swami Someswarananda 
and team could convince that a new approach is needed in industries and organisations to come out with desirable 
results. The team could discover Indianness; the Indian way to excellence, higher productivity, growth, customer’s 
satisfaction that can always be treated as the Indian version of management and Kaizen.  Furthermore, studies and 
experiments were conducted with many company workers both in public and private sector undertakings. And in 
places like Pune, Trivendrum, Delhi, Baroda and Chennai the responses were very encouraging. It would be prudent 
to share here some of the salient features of these findings. It was found that at the workers level there was lack of 
self-confidence and self-respect. There was dearth of self-respect and autonomy. There was not much contributions 
of unions in this respect. An interesting finding came to light that in public sector, to give importance to concern for 
workers, the customer centric issues were neglected. While the powerful union members created stubbornness and 
arrogance, they could not inculcate self-respect .Equally important to point out that autonomy was never practised as 
it is the leaders, not workers, who have a voice in management.  The Vedanta gospel of “Aham Brahmasmi” (I am 
full of immense potential) played a pivotal role in their studies and experiments. When Swami Someswarananda and 
team spoke to the workers they thought of themselves as ordinary human beings – a smelter, a fitter, a driver, a crane 
operator etc. It was equally disheartening to note that their supervisors and bosses do not want them to have any brain 
or heart. After all, the workers are supposed to follow orders only. When the team was made to realise that each and 
every one of them had infinite potential it worked miracles. The purpose was to develop in them self-respect and they 
should start seeing themselves as dignified human beings. It is indeed unfortunate that in the present system an extra 
ordinary human being is made ordinary. A sweeper is always a sweeper and a watchman remain a watchman 
throughout life. The discussions, role playing and exercises led to impactful results. The target group became aware 
of hidden potential that they have and yet to tapped. Swami Someswarananda and team in one such experiment, after 
the first workshop could achieve fantastic results produced by the workers. Next month, while conducting the second 
workshop, the trainees expressed their gratitude to the trainer. When Swami Someswarananda praised them for 
achieving their results , the workers commented “ Sir hamne sab kuch  banaya yah baat to sahi hai, lekin aapne hamko 
aadmi banaya.”. This indeed speaks what self-respect and autonomy means. The team came to the conclusion that 
workers are intelligent enough to monitor a project or a job . However the question is how could Swami 
Someswarananda and team achieved it ? They tried to discover the salient features of vedantic principles starting from  
“Aham Brahmasmi” Thereafter they could churn out more ideas from Gita and karma yoga and put these all in a 
system. (Swami Someswarananda, 1998). 
 
One of the areas of Management better known as Job enrichment is another debatable concept while Herzberg has 
already propounded it with Herzberg’s hygiene factor and is accepted by the corporations. Can I always get a job of 
my liking? Shall I have to depend always on external stimuli to get myself motivated from time to time? While 
Transactional Analysis has its own justifications do i always require positive strokes? If I have to depend on positive 
strokes, it will make me psychologically dependent. This is where Vedanta comes in and talks about “mind 
enrichment”. The million dollar question is “can I make any job whatever I do, interesting? And that is karma yoga. 
Let us agree this is what a homemaker practices unknowingly. 
 
Another area that draws our attention is the modern day corporate training programmes. Majority of the training 
initiatives revolve around preparing a performance oriented employee and manager. The focus is to churn out skilled 
managers and executives who would be the future ready and market ready leaders. The issue is that in all these 
Management Development Programs the participants are considered as Managers and Executives only. The facilitator 
rarely understands that the participant is also a parent, a friend, a relative and above all a citizen. If a training program 
is to be unified, systematic, comprehensive and integrated then there is a need for all these aspects to be integrated 
.Else it will remain one sided. From the teachings of Vedanta we have come to know about the concept of ‘advaita’ 
that suggests us to see the person in totality.  
 
Emotional Intelligence of late has gained lot of popularity. The theme is to give importance not only to the intellect 
but also to the emotions, values, beliefs and actions. The roots of the same can be traced through Vedanta that suggests 
the path of jnana, bhakti and karma. To be successful one need to coordinate the intellect (jnana), emotions (bhakti) 
and action( karma). From Indian Management perspectives in training programs one must involve the participants in 
discussions ( this help them to grow intellectually and be creative) , next step is to adopt techniques of meditation to 
translate the intellectual concept into the feeling level and to remove the mental blocks. Finally, the action steps. Thus

Indian society has a great and glorious background and it had a global impact. Today , however, India is not in the 
forefront. It is, therefore, necessary to retrospect and delve what was it that made India a great civilization and then 
using the tenets, principles and approaches for our managerial and leadership practices.  As we explore through the 
shastras, we find that they have clearly understood the human behaviour and interactions and have dealt with all the 
complicated problems of life with very consummate skills and consideration. The intellectual modern scientists and 
thinkers are now realising that they were perhaps dealing with things, which are only peripheral and they have not yet 
been able to go deep into the crux, core and essential. A compartmentalised approach to any problem is bound to lead 
to incomplete theories.  Thus it is only a holistic view and approach which can give us a satisfactory solution and out 
of that will come joy and happiness, not in competition and tension but in the spirit of cooperation and equanimity.

Abstract 
Wind energy plays a crucial component in the contest to fulfill environmental control objectives. Wind energy, on the 
other hand, will only be able to fulfill its essential importance if the wind turbines work efficiently. The paper aims to 
analyze the application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in wind speed.  In this paper, three network parameter 
optimization algorithms, AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam, are implemented and compared in the context of wind speed 
forecasting. This paper employs wind speed data obtained from the Jeddah Al Jazeera database in Saudi Arabia. Mean 
absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R-squared are the four metrics 
used to assess performance. The experiment results show that the Adam algorithm outperforms the other optimization 
algorithms regarding forecasting accuracy and training time. Therefore, researchers can use this study to help them 
choose optimization algorithms for wind energy forecasting.

1. Introduction
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and evolve without being 
explicitly programmed (Han & Pei, 2011). Neural Network (NN) is an AI technique capable of instructing computers 
to analyse information similarly to the human brain by imitates the workings of the human brain using interconnected 
neurons in a layered structure called deep learning. ANNs are comprised of three layers, containing an input layer, 
one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each ANN consists of several neurons that are interconnected to one 
another in various layers of the networks, these neurons are known as nodes and has an associated weight and 
threshold. The output Z for layer i can be calculated by using Equation 1. 
𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖= 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖−1𝑥𝑥+ 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 
Equation 1: ANN output formula 
Where 𝑊𝑊 and 𝑏𝑏 are the weight and bias. 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the several algorithms of deep learning distinguished by its ability to 
internal memory, it can be used for applications like speech recognition, time series forecasting, and language 
translation since they are built to store information from previous inputs, enabling the use of context and dependencies 
between time steps. Gated Recurrent Unit Network is a type of RNN that use gating mechanisms to selectively update 
the hidden state at each time step using gating methods, effectively modelling sequential data. They have shown 
successful at a number of natural languages processing tasks, including language modelling, machine translation, and 
speech recognition. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the applications used in Recurrent Neural Networks 
(RNN). In LSTM, sequential data are used to overcome long-term dependency to achieve an excellent learning process 
(LSTM. Accessed. 1 November 2022).  It has exceptional performance on a wide range of problems, such as avoiding 
the long-term reliance problem. A cell, an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate make up a typical LSTM unit. 
The three gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell.

4. Conclusion  
The machine learning concept, as well as artificial intelligence principles, are discussed in this report. The above 
concept was implemented using Python from Google Colab. The average wind speed database for Jeddah Al Jazeera 
has been characterized and analyzed using Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam optimizers over 100, 500, and 1000 epochs 
with training percentages of 70%, 80%, and 90%. 
Based on the results, hypotheses of a relationship between the number of epochs and training percentage and MSE, 
MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared have been generated and demonstrated to be declined by evaluating the present database 
and adjusting it to do sensitivity analysis. The combination of Adam optimizer through 100 epochs with 90% training 
has proved to be the best analyzer in this sample. However, it is recommended to test this database on a more 
significant percentage of training to improve the results.

Abstract 
Internal auditing is a fundamental process for quality assurance and compliance of processes within a company. For 
this reason, it is very important that companies can adequately plan its execution. One of the most important aspects 
to consider for effective planning is the calculation of the estimated time it takes to execute the audits. This project 
proposes the use of machine learning to develop a model that can predict the effort time (referred to as Actual Effort) 
that is required to carry out a certain number of audits in a period of two weeks (referred to as Sprint) in an information 
technology services company. In the early stages of the project, it was intended to develop an algorithm that predicts 
the Actual Effort for a single audit, but due to inefficient results, the approach of predicting the Actual Effort per 
Sprint was preferred. Many types of models were implemented along the project and various evaluation metrics, such 
as coefficient of determination (R²), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), and others, were evaluated. 
The best results were obtained by an ETR model where an R² of 96% and a SMAPE of 8.47% were obtained. 
Keywords 
Audit Planning, Effort, Prediction Model, Machine Learning and Regression. 
1. Introduction
According to Auren México (2021), an audit is “the process of reviewing and verifying the operation of a company, 
either comprehensively or in a specific aspect, which is carried out with a precise and detailed methodology to identify 
incidents, eventualities, diagnoses, panoramas and points of opportunity”. Today, the importance of internal auditing 
in companies is more significant than ever because quality in all aspects of the company (also known as Total Quality 
Management) is now a necessity to maintain competitiveness in a market. Internal auditing is precisely responsible 
for making this a reality and verifying that the proper functioning of a company's internal processes are being met 
(Grimaldo, 2014). Additionally, among the many benefits of applying internal auditing, a company can improve risk 
management and its business operation (Sampattikorn et al. 2012). 
Proper planning and organization in the execution of internal audits are necessary for their best use and effectiveness. 
Audit effectiveness contributes to proper procedure realization and operations of the company and, therefore, 
contributes to the whole organization’s effectiveness (Dittenhofer 2016).
In this context, the following paper evaluates the current internal audit planning system of an information technology 
services company. Currently, the company has a very limited capacity on the part of internal auditors, therefore, 
internal audits need to be adequately planned. If a planned audit is not carried out, the repercussions could include 
financial penalties by the client, since in certain projects the number of audits to be carried out is contractually agreed. 
Likewise, it can generate dissatisfaction on the part of the client in the presence of errors and non-compliance with 
internal company policies. 
Unfortunately, the current method used for planning the audits to be carried out by estimating the hours of effort 
available is deficient and imprecise. Based on a comparison between planned and actual hours for conducting audits 
in various 2022 sprints, on average, there is a 25% margin of error. The margin of error that exists in the hours of 
effort directly affects the performance and results of the auditing team in terms of the number of audits that are planned 
and those that are actually carried out and, as a consequence, the previously mentioned repercussions take place.

As can be seen in Table 5, the model forecasts are effectively close to the actual data (Effort column). The largest 
differences (between real and predicted) in the test show values around 40 hours, which is a bit high; while the lowest 
values show values around 12 hours, which is in an acceptable range. Most of the differences show negative numbers, 
meaning that the model, apparently, tends to forecast fewer hours than the real values. Regarding margins of error, 
the highest values are around 20% (in two Sprints), while the lowest are around 6% (in two Sprints). On average, there 
is a difference of 23 hours less than the real value, which is equivalent to an average margin of error of 13.51%, which, 
although it shows a value greater than that obtained in the evaluation of the model (SMAPE and MAAPE), is excellent 
since the margin of error remains within the established objective (maximum of 15% margin of error). With these 
results, the effectiveness of the forecasts that the model is capable of obtaining is strengthened. 
 
5.4 Deployment  
The second part of the deployment consists of developing an App. The software was coded in Python, using the 
Streamlit function as the main framework and other libraries such as Plotly for interactive graphics, Pandas and 
Sklearn for data analytics. The application design was incorporated with a minimalistic and intuitive architecture and 
the testing was carried out to ensure the application's functionality in all scenarios. Design and functionality tests were 
conducted locally on different devices to verify the tool's adaptability and performance. After successful testing, the 
tool was deployed on an official server from the company, enabling access for any auditor with the necessary 
permissions. Post-deployment, detailed documentation was created for the tool's code. The aim was to provide future 
effectiveness with an understanding of the program and to ensure the tool's continuous usability. Figure 3 shows a 
screenshot of the App developed. As can be seen, the users will be able to predict the Actual Effort easily and fast. 
The App not only shows the forecasts and their confidence limits, but also a picture of the Audit Effort dynamics. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Audit Effort´s Planning Tool. 
 
Figure 3 showcases the web application’s design. On the left side of the page, you can find the sidebar, which includes 
all input parameters for the model: our independent variables. At the end of the sidebar lies a “Forecasting” button, 
which when pressed reveals two boxes, one containing the model´s result, and the other containing a time series graph. 
The graph uses our Sprint variable as horizontal axis and our Actual Effort variable as the vertical axis. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Throughout this project, different models were run to forecast the hours of effort required for audit planning in a sprint. 
As part of the recapitalization of the actions carried out, there were several versions of databases, from V1 to V6. 
1101","Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Houston, Texas, USA, June 12-15, 2023

Techniques such as Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, kNN and Multiple Linear Regression 
were implemented for each of the databases. As the modeling stage progressed, more advanced techniques were used, 
such as the use of ANN, the use of the functions Lazy Regressor and Auto ML, as well as Gradient Boosting Regressor, 
XGBoost Regressor, Extra Tree Regressor, Linear and Kernel PCA, among others. Finally, relevant changes were 
applied to the V6 database, which consisted of grouping the database. These groupings were made based on the sprint 
number, semester, and year. This helped reduce the high volatility of the data from previous versions.  
 
After evaluating the metrics, it was observed that the Random Forest Model (Extra Trees Regressor) performed better, 
with lower error values in the SMAPE, MAAPE and RMSE. The Extra Trees Regressor model with its default 
parameters achieved the following results: an R2 test of 96.0%, a MAAPE of 8.19%, a SMAPE of 8.4%, a MAPE of 
8.27%, and an RMSE test of 4,795 hours.  
 
In view of this and the proposed objectives, the use of this model was recommended for the automated forecasting 
tool that was developed using Streamlit in order to contribute to the planning of internal audits. This tool constitutes 
an improvement in the process because in a matter of minutes, even seconds, a forecast can be made with high 
accuracy. The company’s actual process for forecasting the hours of effort required to carry out the audits during a 
sprint is done in a very ""artisanal"" way in Excel where the information is entered manually, and simple formulas are 
used; this resulted in a time consuming and tedious process. The deliverables are the best model implemented with its 
metrics and characteristics, the automated forecasting tool already published in the local company network, as well as 
the documentation on how to use the tool following the company guidelines. It is important to highlight that the results, 
metrics, and conclusions of this study are specific to version 6 of the database.  
 
The only downside to this forecast tool is that the V6 database contains very little data. As an improvement 
opportunity, it is desirable that, in the future, the model could be retrained with more and fresh data. This will help 
identify any pattern or behavior that the model didn’t catch with the current data.

Abstract 
Kaizen is a broad concept of management philosophy which integrates production and quality management 
methodologies to achieve organizational excellence, success and competiveness. It is implemented by many 
organizations including manufacturing, service and commerce industries. However, there is no exploratory study 
investigated its application and effect with the context of Ethiopian manufacturing industries. So, exploration of 
Kaizen practices is significant for the improvement of policies and strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is 
initially to explore the practices and effect of Kaizen, then developing a framework, and finally, identifying drivers 
(social and technical factors) experienced and barriers faced with the context of manufacturing industries of 
Ethiopia. Conducting extensive literature review and adopting methodologies, reviewing reports and developing 
SWOT analysis table, exploring practices, developing framework, identifying drivers and barriers using charts, 
diagrams and graphs; proposing way forward and implications from the study are the research approaches used in 
the study. The findings of the study demonstrate companies are implementing Kaizen following structured 
framework. The implementation enables to organize working places and achieved quantitative and qualitative 
results. Hence, the implementation consequences in saving and gaining a total of 158777469.7 ETH Birr and 
44431.92 M² free spaces. Moreover, the mediocre achieved improvements of net profits, sales volume, productivity, 
delivery time, production volume, defect rate and customer satisfaction is 26.33, 33.02, 22.90, 33.98, 69.65, 49.29 
and 67.92% respectively. Since, there is no previous study exploring Kaizen practices, therefore, this is the very first 
research provides valuable insights for company managers, practitioners, academicians and government.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing industries face various challenges coming out of global competition and rapid manufacturing 
technology changes. These industries have to meet their customers’ expectations, stay in market and compete 
globally. So as to achieve these goals, manufacturing companies need to practice the superlative management 
philosophies (Suárez-Barraza and Miguel-Davila 2020), for example, kaizen is a comprehensive concept of 
management philosophy which integrates production and quality management methodologies (for example, LM, 
TQM, SCM, IM and LSS practices) for identifying, eliminating and preventing wastes to achieve organizational 
excellence (Imai 1986; Bhuiyan and Baghel 2005; Singh and Singh 2009; Berhe 2022; Berhe et al. 2023).   
In the circumstance of Ethiopia, it is now more than a decade since kaizen was officially introduced, adopted and 
disseminated as a management philosophy by the Kaizen Excellence Center (KEC) (formerly known as Ethiopia 
Kaizen Institute), and the support of JICA-Ethiopia (Otsuka et al. 2018). In Ethiopia more than 800 organizations 
from manufacturing, service providers and institutions have implemented Kaizen philosophy (MIDI strategic plan 
2022). Accordingly, some are benefited from the implementation by securing quantitative (monetary and non-
monetary results) and qualitative results, even though, many are still facing challenges in sustaining Kaizen practices 
and maintaining substantial improvements, and even significant numbers of organizations are out of the 
implementation (Berhe et al. 2023).

procedure to determine it as a company’s framework, which is consistent with the modern view of Berhe et al. 
(2023); Berhe (2022); Sisay et al. (2021); Dametew et al. (2020); Tilahun et al. (2020);; Kumar (2019); Todorovic et 
al. (2019); Lina and Ullah (2019); Hailu et al. (2018a); Tesfaye and Kitaw (2017); Getachew et al. (2017); Khanna 
et al. (2017a, 2017b); Amrutkar and Kamalja (2017), signifying that practice of Kaizen can effect competitiveness in 
relation to operational, innovational, and business (financial and marketing) results. 
8. Limitations and directions for future research
The limitations of the present study provide directions for future research as follows. Owing to the unavailability of 
annual and technical report from manufacturing companies, only thirty two companies (the majority-chemical) are 
targeted by the study. Even, the quality of the report received from the selected companies is poor, and some key 
competitiveness indicators were not well recorded. Albeit, there are more than 100 manufacturing companies 
implemented Kaizen till this study conducted. Therefore, researchers for future study can focus on the topic to find 
best findings to contribute to academics, practitioners and government including Kaizen Excellence Center for the 
purpose of implementation of Kaizen on other manufacturing industries, service providers and educational 
institutions. In addition, researchers in the future could apply the framework to explore the practice of Kaizen 
philosophy could enhance sustainable competitiveness.

Abstract 
Steel plate fault detection is a vital material science problem and getting popular in mechanical engineering because 
of less cost and time. This study investigated a bio-inspired hybrid intelligence model that integrated an enhanced 
firefly algorithm (FA) with a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm and decomposition to improve 
its predictive accuracy in classifying steel plate faults detection. The goal is to investigate the multiclass classification 
problem and propose an efficient method. The proposed model integrates the FA, metaheuristic intelligence, 
decomposition approaches, the one-against-one, and the LSSVM. This investigation uses a multi-class case in civil 
engineering - steel plate faults detection - to verify the model’s effectiveness. In the steel industry, creating different 
defective products can impose a high cost for steel product manufacturers and result in failure risk for mechanical 
engineers. Moreover, an effective method to determine fault types will reduce maintenance costs and unexpected 
waste and improve the product's quality level. Thus, classifying the diagnosis of faults in steel plates plays a critical 
role in industrial production. Based on the provided data, the analytical results confirm that the proposed model has 
91.085% predictive accuracy. To verify the applicability and efficiency of the proposed model, its predictive 
performance was compared to other multi-classification models and prior studies concerning the accuracy, precision, 
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The proposed model exhibited 
higher predictive accuracy than the experimental and other single multi-class models. Therefore, the proposed bio-
inspired hybrid model can be a promising tool in solving classification problems for the steel industry and mechanical 
engineering.

Abstract 
Manufacturing businesses that use complex production systems face major challenges in establishing an efficient 
procedure to maximize throughput. Such businesses would need a significant number of workers and process 
improvement resources to sustain expansion and offer high-quality products to their consumers. This can only be 
accomplished by implementing a chain of value-added activities built with the help of lean-based techniques capable 
of producing highly efficient processes. To that purpose, this research was done, and lean manufacturing-based value-
added procedures were established on the shop floor. The study concentrated on conventional truck body 
manufacturing company called Delta-Waseca that have been dealing with concerns including low production rates, 
lengthy lead times, problems with material flow, nonlinear layout, delayed client deliveries, and poor quality. A 
methodology was developed that involved applying process improvement techniques to workstations with low 
efficiency. Utilizing a variety of methods, including time analysis, motion analysis, standard working procedures 
(SWP), value stream analysis, 5S, value layout, and bottleneck analysis, the research and implementation were carried 
out in key bottleneck regions. Production rates, quality, and customer service have all significantly improved because 
of the value-added process deployment. With the new procedure in place, the production rate grew to three trucks per 
day from the previous average of two trucks per day.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
Despite improvements in modern technology and marketing tactics, most businesses in the manufacturing industry 
fall short of client expectations. Long lead times and delayed deliveries are frequent problems in small manufacturing 
companies, which find it difficult to compete on both a global and a national scale. One of the main factors behind 
this is the lack of development in creating a culture of continuous improvement within the organization (Dahlgaard, 
2006). This indicates that employees may lack proper lean thinking training or the management may not be 
comfortable with change as only a tiny fraction of businesses are able to maintain lean process improvement and 
promote a lean workplace culture. 
The primary goal of lean improvement is to identify and transform non-value-added operations into value-added 
activities. The lean process examines the whole plant's functioning, from raw materials to customer delivery. A 
comprehensive approach was utilized in this research paper to better understand the process from upstream suppliers 
to downstream customers. 
The research is conducted in Delta-Waseca, a medium-sized automobile (OEM) firm located in south-central 
Minnesota. The firm specializes in manufacturing truck trailer bodies ranging in length from 18 to 30 feet. 
Unfortunately, Delta-Waseca has been facing lengthy delivery periods, and the quality of their items has significantly 
declined. Customers are unsatisfied therefore, and specific workstations in the facility are taking longer to complete 
tasks. Delta-Waseca's supply chain is chaotic, and its interactions with suppliers are not efficient. They also have very 
few inbound material inspection processes in place, which adds to the confusion. After evaluating the problems at 
Delta-Waseca, lean approaches like time and motion analysis were studied to see whether they could be used to 
enhance the currently inefficient operations. A set of research questions was established to analyze the results and 
conclusions to assess the effectiveness of these strategies.

5. Conclusion 
The study results were implemented on the production floor using lean thinking. Production floor workers played an 
important role by conducting kaizen events and extracting tribal knowledge, which helped the team identify 
bottlenecks in the process. As a result, processing time for sides, roof, and floors was reduced, meeting conditions to 
increase plant efficiency.

As the product is related to the automotive industry, each process improvement was conducted in compliance with 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal 
Motor Safety Administration, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. All design and 
process changes were subject to a standard verification process, and changes were recorded in engineering change 
notices prior to approval. Implementing process changes with lean thinking has helped the organization significantly, 
and the entire team's participation from the managerial level to the floor labor level has made the changes much easier. 
Small projects were targeted initially, and major process changes were carried out once the projects were successful 
and team members were more confident. 
To sustain the lean culture, daily meetings are conducted to discuss the production process and scheduling for 20 to 
30 minutes with the leads and workers. These meetings have led to leadership development for some floor workers 
who have started to lead projects in the absence of a supervisor or floor manager. All employees constantly strive to 
reduce lead time and increase product quality by bringing more change on the floor. Delta Waseca invests heavily in 
the lean process implementation along with the integration of new technologies to build superior quality products in 
the trucking industry.

1. Introduction
Geometric modeling and fluid flow simulation are important aspects of internal combustion engine (IC) design and 
optimization. Geometric modeling involves creating a digital representation of the engine's internal components, such 
as the cylinders, pistons, and valves, using Solidworks software. This allows for accurate visualization and analysis 
of the engine's geometry. 
Fluid flow simulation, on the other hand, involves using Ansys  software to simulate the flow of fluids, such as air and 
fuel, through the engine's internal components. This allows for the prediction of important parameters such as fuel 
consumption, power output, and emissions. 
In this review paper, we will explore the latest research in the field of geometric modeling and fluid flow simulation 
of IC engines. We will discuss the different techniques used for geometric modeling and how they can impact the 
accuracy of fluid flow simulations. We will also examine the various approaches to simulating fluid flow in IC engines, 
including the use of different turbulence models and boundary conditions. 
Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges involved in accurately modeling and simulating IC engines, such as the 
complex geometry and the presence of multiple phases (such as liquid fuel and gaseous air). Finally, we will highlight 
the potential future research directions in this field and their potential impact on IC engine design and optimization.

3.Conclusion 
In conclusion, geometric modeling and fluid flow simulation of IC engines have become increasingly important in the 
design and optimization of IC engine . Advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have allowed for accurate 
predictions of flow phenomena in engines, leading to improved performance, emissions, and efficiency. The use of 
CFD has also reduced the need for expensive and time-consuming experimental testing. The studies reviewed in this 
paper demonstrate the diverse range of applications of geometric modeling and fluid flow simulation in IC engine 
design, including optimization of intake and exhaust systems, fuel injection systems, and combustion processes. 
However, while CFD has the potential to provide valuable insights into engine performance, it should be noted that 
accurate simulation results are dependent on proper modeling and simulation techniques. Further research is necessary 
to improve the accuracy of CFD simulations and to develop more sophisticated models that take into account complex 
phenomena such as turbulence, combustion, and emissions. Overall, geometric modeling and fluid flow simulation 
have emerged as powerful tools for IC engine design and optimization, with significant potential for future 
advancements in the field.

Abstract 
The movement of products, commodities, and information from manufacturers to consumers is part of the supply 
chain, which is a dynamic and complicated process. Recent technological developments, notably in the area of 
machine learning (ML), have created new possibilities for raising supply chain productivity. It is possible for devices 
to study from information and generate predictions or judgements using machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial 
intelligence (AI), without having to be explicitly programmed. Demand forecasting, inventory management, 
transportation planning, and supply chain risk management are just a few of the supply chain-related tasks that may 
be handled by ML algorithms. In addition, ML can be used to optimize transportation routes and schedules, which can 
help reduce transportation costs and improve delivery times. Overall, by enabling businesses to make better decisions, 
streamline their operations, and lower risks, ML has the possibility of significantly improving the efficiency of the 
supply chain.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management may be completely transformed by machine learning (ML), a fast-expanding subject. ML 
is able to evaluate vast volumes of data, make predictions and conclusions that were previously impractical, and do 
statistical analysis using sophisticated algorithms. As a result, the supply chain may become significantly more 
productive, which includes greater predicting and demand planning, quicker and even more accurate decision-making, 
and more supply chain visibility. 
There are several key ML applications that can be used to enhance supply chain productivity, including: 
1.
Predictive analytics: By analysing historical data, ML algorithms can make predictions about future trends
and patterns. This can be used to optimize supply chain operations, such as demand forecasting and inventory
management.
2.
Optimization: ML can be used to optimize complex supply chain processes, such as logistics and distribution,
by identifying the most efficient routes and schedules.
3.
Intelligent automation: ML can be used to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as data entry
and analysis, which can lead to significant productivity gains.
4.
Robotics: ML can be used to develop intelligent robotic systems that can automate tasks such as warehouse
management and material handling.
Overall, by boosting productivity, cutting expenses, and enhancing response to market changes, the implementation 
of ML in supply chain management may provide businesses a competitive edge. It will be more crucial than ever for 
businesses to use ML to remain ahead of the curve as technology develops.

Abstract 
Quality inspection is a very important aspect of manufacturing industries. It satisfies some important objectives of 
manufacturing industries such as decreasing human labour, during subjective judgment destruction of human error, 
increasing overall profit of the industry and improved quality of the workpiece. To overcome the constraints of 
conventional inspection system which were very time consuming and lengthy and cost effective; quality inspection 
using image based sensor is the system for getting maximum product quality in such lesser time. In this paper we 
focus on quality inspection using image sensor. we will be focusing  on how image based sensor inspection is a very 
efficient solution for conventional non-efficient inspection systems. The results will offer an overview different 
approaches of visual inspection using image based sensor, its perks and constraints and specific applications in 
manufacturing industry. 
 Keywords

1. Introduction
In manufacturing industries; inspection of the machined part is a procedure of measuring, To determine whether a 
machined parts features correspond to the design give by client company, one can examine surface flaws, conduct 
testing, or use optical gauging. This is crucial since it entails avoiding the possibility of providing customers with 
subpar goods.  Conventionally, inspection of machined parts was done by a human comparing it with blue prints or 
design given by customer and if it they matched, the workpiece is accepted. which was considered for a big amount 
of scrap from redundant product. As production turn out to be  sophisticated and effective, to conclude; clearly result 
could never exactly match the sketch(design given by customer)  because there would always be some variation 
based on the level of  security. Tolerance restrictions became increasingly common and computer vision system are 
replacing human inspectors as a solution to this problem Because of greater rivalry. As a result, concepts like mass 
production, automation, total quality management, and lean manufacturing were developed. Furthermore, there has 
been a recent surge in the adoption of the industry 4.0 paradigm, which is fuelled by the digital transformation of the 
manufacturing sector. However, these advancements can also result in increased potential for human error as it 
becomes more challenging for human operators to keep pace with inspection tasks.. Even tiny workplaces may 
afford to adopt such technology to improve their present systems and products for quality control and inspection. 
Operators now have more time to focus on tasks that call for higher levels of creativity, such complex process 
improvement and complex problem-solving.

to inspect defects was the subject of one research that deserves special mention. Due to the software's ability to 
rectify picture problems without the requirement for a reference image, this ground-breaking idea may be applied in 
Industry 4.0. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Clearly, during the past ten years, quality control has seen significant advancement. As a result of the fact that 
machine can only be as intelligent as the human who designed them, a large body of study on the fourth industrial 
revolution came to the conclusion that human inspector should be replaced with visual inspector. High levels of 
weariness are brought on by repetitive tasks, particularly those that demand a great deal of attention to detail. This 
results in a faster decline in a human operator's cognitive abilities (Lughofer et al, 2009). 
 
The emphasis of industry 4.0 is on automated system that simplify an operator's job and increase its dependability. It 
is evident that the research community is making a concentrated effort to develop fully AI methods for product 
inspection (Huang et al. 2015). Although automation is a goal in this area, there is still room for significant 
advancement. Industry 4.0 and automation are intertwined, but there is a narrow line between them that needs to be 
handled with greater caution. 
 
It is obvious that industry 4.0 has fostered the development of automated processes based on the aforementioned 
data, which show that the majority of study designs used human operators. Consequently, there has been an increase 
in the application of visual inspection systems to modify image-based inspection and control (Shen et al, 2012, 
Manish et al. 2018, Manzano et al. 2020). 
 
To wrap up the discussion, I would like to mention that to maintain product quality and lower manufacturing costs, 
the visual inspection system utilising image sensor has become a crucial instrument in the manufacturing sector. The 
system can function at fast rates and is capable of detecting flaws like cracks, scratches, and dents that are not 
visible to the human eye, making it an effective quality control method. The system has become even more 
dependable and efficient as a result of improvements in image sensor technology, Which have increased accuracy, 
resolution, and speed. There are still issues to be resolved, such as image analysis algorithms and system integration 
with other manufacturing processes, despite the technology's many advantages. Generally speaking, the visual 
inspection system incorporating image sensors is a significant and promising technology that can greatly enhance 
the manufacturing process.

Abstract 
Ballasting and De-ballasting of water are the key operations in working of a floating dry dock in order to dock and 
undock a water vessel in the yard. These operations involve pumping of sea water from sea chests to their respective 
ballast tanks through pumps. Since these ballast tanks are present throughout the dock the filling time for each tank 
is different. Due to this reason filling of tanks with same water flow rate is not practical and hence all the tanks are 
filled with different pipes and all the pipes are fitted with individual water valves. These water valves are set as per 
the required water flow rate for different water ballast tank as per the time taken for the water to reach and fill the 
respective water ballast tank. This valve setting operation can be enhanced better if Automatic Process Control 
valves are implemented for the same. Process controlled valves are valves which partially open and close as per the 
flow of water required according to the amount of water filled in respective ballast tank. A process-controlled valve 
is used with the help of a PLC system which is used to command the valve to control the flow of the water in ballast 
tank as per the required flow rate.

1. Introduction
The upkeep and operation of floating dry docks are increasingly dependent on Automatic Process Control Valves 
(PCVs). A massive structure called a floating dry dock is used to perform the required underground maintenance of 
ships and other vessels. On a floating dry dock, the capacity to control valves can significantly enhance productivity, 
safety, and efficiency. Within the dry dock system, PCVs are utilized to regulate the flow of fluids like water or 
hydraulic fluids. This includes controlling how the dock's pumps, valves, and ballast tanks move. Because PCVs can 
be controlled from a control room or other remote location, personnel don't have to physically go into potentially 
dangerous areas.  
These Process Control Valves use actuators in order to control the water flow as the actuator opens and closes the 
valve according to the command given by the control room in the form of an electric signal. Basic actuators turn 
valves either into fully open or fully closed but the modern actuators which we get today allows the valves to hold in 
intermediate position as well. There are firms which manufacture such modern actuators which are used in marine 
industries. Rotork has developed the new ROMpak range of electric actuators for the marine industry. Talking about 
the positional adjustments, There is also Rotork Folomatic positional control, current position transmitter, integral 
data logger, non-intrusive configuration with a Bluetooth wireless interface and digital bus network connectivity 
(Actuators for marine valves, 2009)   
Safety Hazards are one of the major concerns in marine industries, some of the safety hazards happened till now are 
mentioned below:

Ease Of Operation 
Since these are manually operated it 
is difficult to operate them as 
presence in confined space is 
required to open or close the valves. 
There is an ease of operations in 
these type of valves as these have 
actuators and positioners which 
opens and closes the valves and 
presence of human in confined 
spaces 
is 
not 
required 
while 
operation. 
 
Looking at the above points, marine industries consist of equal risk in both the valves when it comes to corrosion 
and rusting. Apart from that, considering the durability and reliability in the heavy and rough marine industry based 
uses we can come to a result that Automatic Valves are better than the conventionally used manual valves. 
 
 
6. Conclusion And Future Research 
In this study, we analyzed the usage of manual valves and automatic control valves in floating dry dock. We 
compared both the above-mentioned valves on the basis of: 
 
1) Numerical Efficiency: Looking at the numerical formula for calculating the efficiency of valve, there is a scope 
of human error which may lead to higher pressure drop which decreases the efficiency of manual valves. Whereas, 
automatic valves have no such scope of error. 
2) Leakage: Cv value i.e., Valve coefficient depends very much on the amount of water passed through the valve 
per minute. Any leakage in the valve would hence affect the Cv value which eventually decreases the overall 
efficiency of the valve. Manual Valves have greater chances of leakage than automatic valves as there are greater 
chances of error in closing of valve. 
3) Durability: There are equal chances of corrosion in both the valves. Though, the chances of deterioration due to 
wear and tear decreases in the case of automatic valves. 
4) Ease of Operation: Automatic valves are easier to use and are more user friendly whereas manuals are not easy 
to use as there is a requirement of human presence in confined spaces. 
 
Hence, we can conclude the analysis by coming to the point that using automatic control valves would be more 
effective in floating dry docks. 
 
There is a great scope of future research in the field of process control valve in marine field. Following points may 
be considered for further research in the mentioned field: 
 
1) Maintenance: Since maintenance is one of the major tasks in marine vessels, research should be conducted 
further to ease the maintenance part.  
Suggestion: Since floating dry docks have more than fifty valves, a system should be made where it indicates the 
valve number and position in case of any breakdown or issue to save time and energy of locating the valve with 
issue. 
 
2) Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence is being adapted widely and to keep the marine technology in line 
with the advanced technology. 
Suggestion: Since there is a requirement of a person in the control room, merging the system with Artificial 
Intelligence to monitor and control the actuators in positioners in order to open or close the valve could save a lot of 
money and increase productivity.

Abstract 
Extrusion is very challenging process for maintaining the desired product quality for the manufacturers. To get required 
quality of the pvc pipes, we have to identify, control and regular monitoring of quality parameters. Some of the 
important parameters on which product quality depends are working conditions, temperatures, pressure, die surface 
and material used. The defects in the product quality affects the cost of the production and product life cycle. Till date, 
manufacturer faces problems in the extrusion process which impacts on the product quality. The purpose of this review 
paper is to analyze the defects in the pvc pipes during extrusion process, its impact on the product quality and to 
suggest the remedies for better quality of the pvc pipes.

1. Introduction
Due to its strength and resilience to damage from extreme weather conditions, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a versatile 
material that is frequently employed in the building industry. One essential piece of equipment utilized in the 
production of PVC products is the PVC extrusion machine. The material is heated and melted in a machine, then 
forced through a die to take on the required shape during the extrusion process.   
To meet the rising demand for PVC products, the PVC extrusion machine has experienced a number of technological 
developments in recent years. These developments have made it feasible to create PVC goods more precisely, more 
effectively, and with higher quality. The PVC extrusion machine is made up of a hopper, barrel, screw, and die, among 
other parts. The PVC material is supplied into the machine through the hopper. After that, the material is heated and 
melted inside the heated barrel using a variety of heating devices. The melted PVC material is pushed by the screw 
into the barrel and into the die, where it assumes the required shape.   
The need for effective, dependable, and cutting-edge PVC extrusion equipment is increasing along with the demand 
for PVC products. To meet these needs and maintain their competitiveness in the market, manufacturers are constantly 
innovating and enhancing their PVC extrusion machines (Figure 1).

parameters for the PVC extrusion line with the assistance of Industry Mentor and his team. These parameters include  
the extruder die temperature (180 0C), extruder pressure (80bar), barrel temperature ranges from 155-200(0C) between 
zones, and feed rate (45rpm) (Narasimha & Rejikumar, 2013).   
 
6. Conclusions   
Every manufacturing company needs to get rid of the things that might lead to production issues. Product flaws could 
result in significant and immaterial losses for the business. There are numerous ways to address the causes of faults 
that result from people, equipment, materials, and techniques. In order to lessen the impact of fatigue on other 
employees, these flaws can be fixed by hiring fresh personnel. Regular maintenance can also lessen the likelihood of 
faults. The government has set requirements for the raw materials to be used, and it is advised that high-quality 
materials be used. Extrusion is a high-volume processing technique in which plastic material is heated until it melts, 
then forced through a die to take on the required shape. The barrel contains a cylindrical spinning screw that pushes 
plastic material made of molten metal through a die. Takeoff speed, transition temperature, and metering zone are 
important factors that determine the quality of the products.   
 
Based on the study and analysis of the numerous papers on the fault and the observation of the researchers' opinions 
in the papers, it should be necessary to reduce its causes for the best extrusion product. According to observation, these 
quality issues (Causes) result in improper operational parameter setting. By application of above remedies, we can 
remove the flaw of chatter marks on pvc pipes and get optimum product quality during the extrusion process (Rao, 
2019)

Abstract 
In manufacturing systems, real-time is a cost feature. Theoretically, the more time a product takes in system, the more 
value will be added; therefore, production units need to feasibly utilize manufacturing resources in terms of optimal 
system utilization. For typical manufacturing systems, loading and unloading processes need to operate synchronously 
with the other system processes. In this applied research work, simulation model for the loading and unloading has 
been developed for a local manufacturing company to optimize the time and capacity utilization of the system. Real-
world data from the system has been collected and used for the modeling. This paper’ research approach has been 
based on developing simulation model for the current loading and unloading processes, and then; after the validation, 
analyzing the compatibility of the entire system in terms of loading and unloading processes with the manufacturing 
system capacity. Rockwall software platforms ARENA, Input Analyzer, and Output Analyzer have been used for 
simulation and analysis. The results show the powerful of the simulation to model this critical process, minimum time 
and maximum production units are possible optimizing the loading and unloading processes with the manufacturing 
system. 
1. Introduction
Loading process of a manufacturing system is when the system takes required jobs to work in terms of no process is 
in starvation state will be recognize and unloading process when the system sinks completed jobs in terms of no 
process is in blocked state. Loading and unloading processes are leading the total performance of systems, and key of 
the improvement analysis. Simulation approach has been applied to variety of industrial systems and projects as a tool 
of improvement for the operational capacity and the net profit projects. Many authors used ARENA with other 
simulation platforms to investigate the effect of conveyor breakdowns on the performance of enterprise operational 
processes including loading and unloading processes such as fabric handling, delivery, and transportation (Al-Saleh 
2011). Graphical representation tools and animation associated with many software platforms provide options to 
manage involvements of decision-making process (Azadeh, et al., 2013).  Deshpande et al. (2007) used ARENA to 
model truckload terminal operations and analyze alternative dock assignment scenarios. Greasley (2003) used 
simulation model approach in the manufacturing sector to provide an accurate estimation for system processes 
utilization. In this research work, a valid simulation model for the loading and unloading processes has been developed 
using ARENA to find effective number of resources and operation time for the processes. The simulation model used 
to analyze different scenarios for a local company system’s loading-unloading to improve the current system. 
2. Simulation Modeling
Figure (1) shows an overview of simulation methodology that has been applied to develop the model of the real-world 
system. In this illustration figure, system processes are demonstrated as a warehouse of parts arriving, assembling, 
storing complete products, and other management processes. Four main phases have been followed to develop the 
model in addition to experimentation phase for the analysis.

Results analysis of unloading process also shows that as number of vehicles get in are 110 whereas only 41 vehicles 
in the system can respond to the entire unloading load which means significant error involved in making feasible 
decision. This negatively affects the profit and demand responsiveness. However, after increasing the resource, the 
system can reach maximum unloading process in terms of the number of the vehicles. With increasing the resource 
number of vehicles in to 109 can finish the entire unloading process which improves the whole performance. The 
result obviously shows that this improvement saves cost from unloading process without consuming many resources 
that can be utilized for other production requirement. Figure (3) shows the comparison between the real-world data of 
unloading process and improved scenario using Rockwall’ OutputAnalyzer. It obviously states that adding the vehicles 
in 110 and 109 can complete the unloading which will save cost in unloading process without utilizing more capacity 
can be allocated to other resources and meet production requirement on time.

Abstract 
Back Support 2 in 1 product design is done to help relieve back pain and also improve one's posture. One of the 
diseases of the back that can occur is LBP (Low Back Pain). Lumbar back support is often used in low back pain 
pain and is also a common intervention effort in the industry to prevent back injuries. This product is equipped with 
an innovative TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) tool. TENS therapy has been shown to reduce 
various types of pain within 15-30 minutes. TENS is able to activate nerves of large and small diameter which will 
send various sensory information to the central nerve. The purpose of this research is as a method used in making 2

From the calculation of the area of the gap between group I and alternative 3, it can be concluded that the area of the 
gap in group I (0.4289) is smaller than the area of the gap in alternative 3 (1.3236) so that the selected product is the 
product of group I. From the gantt chart it can be seen that the greatest weight is found in W10, which is the 
additional function of product innovation. While the smallest weight is W5, namely product material design.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the discussion above, several conclusions can be drawn in the manufacture of Back Support 
2 in 1 products have inputs in the form of a workforce of 2 people, have scissors, needles and glue equipment, have 
the main material of cotton cloth and dye, in the black box prepared tools and materials and made back support 
patterns and hollowed out the back, then sew the electrical devices or TENS with Back Support. Back Support has a 
main function and additional functions, the main function is in the form of an enforcement tool, while the additional 
function is in the form of electrical therapy. On the needsetter, the 2 in 1 back support is made of comfortable and 
quality materials and ergonomics, which has the characteristics of a black product, made of cotton cloth, weighs 500 
g, has a waist circumference size and height of 75-85 cm, 160-175 cm, has a shoulder and waist model and is elastic. 
And on the gantt chart the selected product is group I product or Back Support 2 in 1. And it can be seen that the 
greatest weight is on W10, which is the additional function of product innovation. While the smallest weight is W5, 
which is the product material design.

Abstract 
Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, predicted that the number of transistors would quadruple every two years. As 
a result, device scaling had to happen. Scientists and researchers quickly learned that silicon MOSFETs had a scaling 
issue with technology. Carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFET) are now replacing silicon metal oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) as an alternative. However, whereas we have access to precise 
circuit-level equations for MOSFETs, all we have for carbon nanotubes are model equations. In this research, we seek 
to model the behavior of the SWCNT-FET under varying conditions of diameter and gate insulator thickness. This 
would allow for more accurate performance predictions from the device, paving the way for more complicated 
CNTFET based circuit designs. Variations in mobile charges, drain currents, and gate insulator thickness are among 
the variables investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the size of CNT diameter has direct influence on drain 
current which could be potential replacement of silicon technology for digital applications.

1. Introduction
The concept of mounting many electronic devices on a single substrate emerged in the late 1950s. Over the last six 
decades, we have gone from making basic circuits with only a few components to making microprocessors with 10 
million devices and memory that can hold more than a billion transistors (Shakil and Ullah., 2022). Computer and 
communication technology have revolutionized every facet of contemporary life because of Moore's law, which states 
that the number of transistors in general-purpose microprocessors will roughly double every two years (Amin et al., 
2019; Ullah et al., 2017). This rule was first proposed in the 1960s. Moore's law predicts that as transistor sizes 
continue to decrease exponentially, the cost, speed, and energy consumption of modern computers and other 
information processing equipment will also continue to decrease (Shabir and Ullah., 2022). The advancements made 
thus far are remarkable; today's smartphones' central processing units (CPUs) are more than 100,000 times more 
powerful than the Apollo computer that landed a man on the moon 50 years ago while using less than ten times as 
much electricity. By allowing computers to feasibly handle huge amounts of data with tolerable throughput and cost, 
the most recent advances under Moore's law paved the basis for today's achievements in machine learning and 
blockchains (Debnath et al., 2023).  
For instance, higher-precision and cognitive learning and inference tasks, whether on the cloud or at the edge, 
necessitate faster and more energy-efficient computers to train and execute increasingly complex deep-neural network 
models (composed of hundreds of thousands of nodes and thousands of millions of parameters) (Shabir et al., 2022). 
Since the difficulty of mining blockchains rises exponentially with the number of nodes in the network, commercial 
blockchain applications need hardware with a much greater hash rate. To enhance mobility and the user experience, 
virtual- and augmented-reality applications need greater computer power with much reduced battery consumption on 
mobile devices (Shakil and Rashid., 2023). Some of these issues can be addressed by software and architectural 
enhancements, but it would be preferable if transistor technologies could provide a reduced footprint and greater 
performance on the device level (an approach termed more Moore) (Shakil and Ullah., 2023). 
The semiconductor industry's development has slowed over the last decade, indicating that Moore's law, which is 
based on the scaling of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), is reaching its physical

Figure 11. Mobile charge vs Gate voltage 
Figure 12. Mobile charge vs Drain voltage 
Figure 13. Transconductance vs Gate voltage 
4.2.2 Mobile Charges VS Gate Voltage 
Bringing the gate insulator down in thickness increases the mobile charges, as seen in Figure 11. Because of this, both 
the drain current and the maximum allowable current have gone up. 
4.2.3 Mobile Charges VS Drain Voltage 
Our calculations for mobile charges against drain voltage at a gate voltage of 1V and four different insulator 
thicknesses for the gate are shown in Figure 12. Changes in mobile charges are highly noticeable for gate insulator 
thicknesses as little as 0.05nm. The mobile charges begin to level out regarding the drain voltages as the gate insulator 
thickness grows. As a result, the relationship between the nanotube's diameter and the thickness of its gate insulator 
is counterclockwise. 
4.2.4 Transconductance VS Gate Voltage 
Figure 13 depicts the gm/Id ratio as a graph. The gate insulator thickness of a CNTFET must be low for it to produce 
a significant transconductance. If the transconductance is high, the gain at the Id output current will also be high. The 
findings demonstrate an increasing gm/Id ratio due to an increasing gate oxide capacitance when the gate insulator 
thickness is decreased.  
5.
Conclusion
The carbon nanotube FET's behavior has therefore been characterized by a range of input values. The graph of the 
mobile charge vs the gate voltage reveals that the current carrying capacity of a nanotube decreases as its diameter 
decreases, whereas the current carrying capacity of a nanotube with a thinner gate insulator increases. Both the 
nanotube's diameter and the thickness of the gate insulator have an impact on the relationship between the drain voltage 
and the drain current. In the future, it may be possible to determine the device's gain by analyzing other metrics, such 
as quantum capacitances and transconductances.

Abstract 
Lombok Island is one of the islands which is prepared by the Indonesian Government to become a major tourist 
attraction after Bali Island. Coupled with the existence of a new destination in Mandalika, which has an international 
class circuit that is used for major international racing MotoGP and WSBK events. However, the basis of this research 
is the mobile network service users anomaly in Lombok Island. It was found that the number of users based on BPS 
data for Lombok Island is still at an average of 63% of the total population of Lombok Island. This is a unique 
phenomenon, because the average user is far below of Bali Island which has reached at 94%, even the national average 
which is already at 91%. In this research, there are variables of price, network quality, service quality, and corporate 
image as independent variables which serve as a measure for user growth as dependent variable in Lombok Island. 
The objective of this research is to know how the preposition of independent and dependent variables are, and also to 
know how the effects of each variable relation are. This research used quantitative method with 100 respondents as 
users and operator representatives, fitting the limitation of operator employees number on unit level in Lombok Island. 
Then from 100 respondents, divided based on the Lombok Island mobile network service operators market share. The 
research indicated a positive and significant effect to each of independent variables to user growth in Lombok Island 
mobile network service industry. 
Keywords 
User Growth, Price, Network Quality, Service Quality, Corporate Image 
1. Introduction
In Indonesia, mobile network service plays important role as internet access and the users always growing year by 
year. The internet users in Indonesia prefer using mobile network service because of its simplicity due to being able 
to access the internet using smartphone in their hands. In fact, the mobile network service operators on competing 
grabbing users to obtain more revenues, not only maintaining existing users but also new potency users. On other side, 
the cheapest with the most stable mobile network service will be the first choice for the users. 
Talking about users, this research focuses on Lombok Island that still has low mobile network service users compared 
to Bali Island that has the same demographic and history as tourist attraction island. Lombok Island mobile network 
service users are about 63% and under national average users are about 91%, moreover so far from Bali Island with 
mobile network service users about 94% on 2021. It would be as an issue, Lombok Island projected will be as one of 
prestige international race organizers for next 10 years for MotoGP and WSBK Event that will be held in Pertamina 
Mandalika International Street Circuit. 
In detail to mobile network service operators, there are 4 operators in Lombok Island, the most dominating is XL 
Axiata, with the runner up is Telkomsel, and the new entrant IOH (Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison) with Smartfren. XL

in Lombok Island. In other side, in this research found that service quality have a lowest value and it should be the 
room of improvement to improve user growth of mobile networks service industry in Lombok Island, especially in 
after-sales service. 
 
2. 
Based on analysis, price, network quality, service quality, corporate image have a positive and significant 
effect on user growth. In detail, corporate image is the most significant positive effect on user growth for mobile 
network service industry in Lombok Island with t-Statisctic value 3,303. It indicates that corporate image is the most 
contributor of user growth for mobile network service industry in Lombok Island compared to other variables. The 
operators should focus and improve the corporate image rather than price and network quality to improve user growth 
in mobile network service industry in Lombok Island. 
 
Suggestion 
 
There are several limitations and lacking in this research, so the suggestion for next research for additional 
and improvement with the following description: 
1. 
In future research, the research added other variables about product quality to measure how effective products 
accepted by the users and service accuracy to measure how long outage of the service on a period. 
2. 
Expanding the research object with same case as Lombok Island. Based on Badan Pusat Statistik (2021), the 
area with mobile network service user growth under national average in Papua and Nusa Tenggara Timur province in 
Indonesia 
3. 
For mobile network service operators in Lombok, based on data analysis, mobile network service users still 
at 63% of Lombok Island population, it means still there are market potency about 37% for market improvement and 
increasing revenue.

Abstract 
Flooding disaster happens almost annually in Pakistan. With no real solution to this incident, loss of human lives and 
wealth are inevitable. Heavy rainfall is an important aspect which contributes to flooding. Monitoring rainfall remains 
an integral part of flood defense system. One of the most leading method to predict flood is by developing a forecast 
model of rainfall-runoff. Rainfall and river flow relation are very much subjective with various affecting factors. 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is preferred to model hydro system because of its accountability of nonlinear 
dynamics of water flow.  A case study is done on a flood-prone river basin in Jhelum river, in Kashmir. Rainfall data 
of 5 hydrologic stations and river level are used as the input. The performance of the learning algorithms involved 
were evaluated with a coefficient of determination (R) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The network configuration of 
the ANN which best fit each algorithm is determined.   The results achieved showed the promising advantage of LM 
as compared to BR and PSO.

1. Introduction
Flooding is a natural disaster which has been occurring annually. It is a universal problem throughout the whole world. 
Flooding which comes from rivers, seas, and threaten the lives of millions, especially during extreme climate The 
disaster, such as other natural catastrophe could only be mitigated rather than it being thoroughly solved. Runoff 
prediction is one of the vital elements in pre-flooding. It is a key resource for flood defines in coastal areas. Runoff 
level is highly affected by precipitation and landscape factors which includes topography, soil Figure 1: Kashmir (left) 
and rainfall stations throughout rivers (right) (Graff. et al 2013).

From the analysis done, the best number of neuron in hidden layer and type of model order are obtained. Thus 
ANNs with best configuration for each learning algorithm are put into test for 12-hour rainfall-runoff forecast 
model. ANNs trained by LM produce best rainfall-runoff model prediction in Sungai Pahang, Pekan. It achieve best 
MSE and R value for 3 out of 5 rainfall stations available namely RF 3430097, RF 3533102 and RF 3534103. The 
early stopping method is implied to avoid overfitting. Trainlm are able to achieve good convergence rate with lower 
number of iterations (Shabir, et al., 2023).  
ANNs trained by BR accomplished decent MSE and R value. For RF 3532101 and RF 3431099, it had recorded best 
performance result. Unfortunately, there is a tendency of overfitting. BR requires longer time for to converge, thus 
early stopping are not put into effect. Hence, iteration reached to higher number. This may have been the cause of 
overfitting to take place. In terms of time taken for simulation, trainbr are second to trainlm (Graff. et al 2013). 
PSO learning algorithm produced lowest results in terms of performance. Though it achieved higher MSE and R 
value, it could be seen that performance is stable and achieve convergence faster. Trainpso consumes the longest 
time for simulation when compare to LM and BR. 
In general, ANN trained with LM are best suited for rainfall-runoff model in Sungai Pahang in Pekan. It gives 
optimum performance, with the least time taken and the number of iteration is kept at a reasonable amount. LM 
algorithm demonstrated stable error in validation, training and testing phase graph plot. With early stopping method 
implemented, the problem of overfitting is avoided 
 
7. Conclusions 
The best configurations for each learning algorithms are attained. The configurations vary from one algorithm to 
another with no absolute number of neurons in hidden layer or delay (model order) which is dominant for all 
networks. This further proved the necessity of constructing a rainfall-runoff forecast model which is exclusive for a 
particular basin or river.12-hour forecast for rainfall-runoff prediction model in KASHMIR is developed. The results 
are satisfactory with prediction models producing low errors.  The rainfall data and runoff data corresponds one 
another as the training generates good coefficient of correlation. Comparisons are made between ANNs with LM, 
BR and PSO as the learning algorithm. The algorithm which best suit to model Kashmir is determined. The 
performances of the networks are observed and the characteristics of each training algorithm, its advantages and 
disadvantages are analyzed and discussed. 
The main objective of this paper is to investigate, develop, and compare between rainfall-runoff models for the case 
study in Jehlum River, in Pakistan Kashmir. It could be concluded that the objective has been successfully achieved. 
ANNs model have been develop with three different learning algorithm applied on the simulations. The 
configuration which best suited each learning algorithm are determined for it to produce optimum prediction model. 
The performances of the networks are acquired, analyse and finally comparison are made. The best learning 
algorithm with custom network configuration is obtained. This  presents the conclusion drawn from the study and 
recommendations made for further study. These are the recommendations which can further improve future studies 
on rainfall-runoff prediction model. Hydrological studies are wide in scope and there are many rooms for 
improvement. Below are some suggestions on which particular field of work that could be explored. 
A statistic study on how to estimate or interpolate incomplete information on rain intensity and river basin would be 
essential. There are gaps within the data given for rainfall and runoff. This may occurred because of rain gauge 
failure, measurement error or data acquisition deficiency. As missing values are discarded from the model, a portion 
of the data set is lost.

Abstract 
There is the potential for human error in the supply chain which can cause losses and affect the halal status of a 
product. Halal products must be maintained from upstream to downstream and the chance of human error must be 
minimized. In the context of halal products in Indonesia, there is a stipulation, criteria, and procedures for 
processing halal products from upstream to downstream that have been arranged in halal certification. However, 
there is a problem in the current system where no system can be 100% guaranteed because of the dependence on 
business actors. The purpose is to ensure the provisions in halal certification are carried out properly by business

Based on the table above, the result of calculating the probability using the HEART method it is found that the 
biggest errors are in the process of receiving raw materials from suppliers, storing raw materials, washing fish, and 
examining when drying so as not to be exposed to dirt. Improvement strategies for each of these job descriptions can 
be adapted to the results of the SHERPA method.

Conclusions 
The conclusions obtained from the results of this study are: 
1. 
The results of identifying human errors in the supply chain of kemplang crackers using the adoption of the 
SCOR model produce 26 types of errors, where in the plan process there are 3 types of errors, in the source process 
there are 4 types of errors, in make there are 16 types of errors, in deliver there are 2 error and on return there are 2 
errors. 
2. 
Based on the results of research using the SHERPA method, it is found that the highest probability of error 
with a critical level is found in the process of ordering raw materials, receiving raw materials, storing raw materials, 
washing fish, drying products, checking when drying so that they are not exposed to dirt, checking order notes and 
payment transactions. 
3. 
Based on the results of research using the HEART method, the highest Human Error Probability (HEP) was 
obtained in the process of receiving raw materials from suppliers, storing raw materials, washing fish and checking 
when drying them so they are not exposed to dirt with a value of 5.03.

A Review on Inspection Cost Minimization by Optimal 
Number Inspectors in Apparel Manufacturing

Abstract 
The apparel manufacturing organization is striving to minimize manufacturing costs, including inspection costs. The 
main goal of this paper is to reduce inspection costs by utilizing a minimum number of inspectors. In this paper, a 
mathematical model has been developed which will emphasize the determination of the inspection cost. The inspection 
cost is related to the standard minute value and the cost per minute. Furthermore, this study has been focused on the 
resolution of the capacity and skill level of the inspectors. Moreover, a linear program has been developed which can 
provide the number of inspectors required based on cost and the number of pieces needed to be inspected. The data 
has been collected from three types of factories: large, medium-sized and low-scale manufacturing units. It has been 
seen that at least 30%–35% of inspectors are higher than standard. The reason behind that is a lack of awareness and 
knowledge by the quality manager regarding inspection capacity, skill, and inspection target for the inspector. Large 
scale companies take an additional 25% of inspectors to stay relaxed. Medium-sized factories used 30% more 
inspectors to cover the inspection.

Abstract 
In this paper, a new energy generated semi-active suspension system based on Magneto-rheological (MR) damper has 
been designed with the investigation of its power generation capability. The mathematical model for the suggested 
energy generated MR damper has developed and a 3D model of energy generated MR damper has developed in EMS, 
where it is analyzed broadly by finite element method.  The objectives of the simulation were to minimize the 
interaction issue between the damper and energy generator parts and confirm its power generation ability. The induced 
magnetic flux density, magnetic field intensity, applied current density, temperature gradient of this damper clearly 
validated this damper’s power generation.

1. Introduction
MR fluid-based dampers so hopeful for semi-active or adaptive control system which’s filled with kind of smart 
materials like Magneto rheological (MR) fluids (Lai et al 2002). MR fluid is made by mixing fine particles of carbonyl 
iron with low viscosity oil. It functions at three different mode such as shear mode, squeeze mode and valve mode. In 
the presence of an external magnetic or electric field MR fluids offer quick, reversible, and harmonic exchange to 
semi-solid state from free-flowing state in a few milliseconds and able to form chain-like fibrous structure . It has 
some striking benefits such as exhibiting a much lower sedimentation rate than conventional fluids, and a large 
operational temperature range . Moreover, it glances an improvement in apparent yield stress , quick response, and 
low power consumption . MR dampers is vast for both low- and high-speed (Shakil et al 2023). It’s  mainly used in 
automobiles, civil construction such as buildings, bridge’s structure (Shabir et al 2022), reducing floor vibrations 
(Shabir et al 2022), heavy motor damping (Lai et al 2002), helicopter lag dampers(Shabir et al 2022), railway vehicles 
(Shabir et al 2022) and more (Shabir et al 2023). MR damper consists of a piston rod, a piston head, hydraulic and 
pneumatic reservoirs. These hydraulic and pneumatic reservoirs are separated by a floating piston or diaphragm 
(Shakil et al 2022).  The piston head is attached by piston rod, and it contains magnetic circuit (coil on bobbin 
concentric to a tubular flux return). When the piston rod assembly moves inside the MR damper, the fluid flows by a 
circular gap in the piston head and creates a magnetic field in the gap and raises the yield stress of the MR fluid in the 
circular gap when current supplied to the coil in the piston head. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the 
conventional semi-active suspension system. MR damper’s vibration and shock create mechanical energy which can 
be used as a power sources and huge amount of this mechanical energy is lost during everyday usage of an automobile 
under road irregularities. By that the wasted energy vibration is attached with highway roughness, car speed, 
suspension rigid and damping coefficient and one report says that the total power dissipation of four dampers of 
traveler vehicle reached 200 W when going on a haggard highway at more or less 13.4  (Shabir et al 2022). External

From Figure 12 it’s obvious that the current is produced inside the outer coil of the model which is represented by the 
higher value of the applied current density of the starting and the end of the above graph value of applied current 
density is almost zero between the two opposite walls of the outer coil. So, overall results its observed that the 
permanent magnet in the outer body generates magnetic flux. When it is moving along with piston rod these fluxes 
are cut by outer body coils. As cut by changing flux energy induced in these coils which works as a power supply to 
the inner coil. These supplying currents from the outer coil to the inner coil depend upon the relative motion between 
the permanent magnet and outer coil. It can be concluded from this advanced finite element analysis that the proposed 
model is successfully working as self-powered and energy saving MR damper. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Advancement in MR damper technology is one of the challenging researches in the vibration control area. In this study 
a mono tube MR damper model is developed which has power generation competence. Here solid works EMS based 
finite element analysis is accomplished for characterizing and validating the model’s accuracy of power generation. 
In this damper model permanent magnets and coils are used as power generators that utilize wasted vibration energy 
from the environment. In this energy generated damper’s EMS analysis MR fluid gap width, outside air gap width, 
gap length, permanent magnet length, permanent magnet thickness, non-magnetic material thickness, piston head, coil 
housing thickness, diameter of the piston head, the number of coil turns, different materials used in overall model are 
selected as design parameters for model’s accuracy. From EMS electromagnetic analysis magnetic flux density, 
magnetic field intensity, temperature, the applied current density has been examined to characterize the power 
generation feature and all the results are clearly validating that quality. The magnetic isolation between the two 
separated fields has been observed clearly from those results. So, it can be concluded that the developed mono tube 
MR damper model works effectively as an energy generated device.

Abstract 
Effective warehouse location selection is a critical component of disaster management, as it can significantly impact 
the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response efforts. This paper proposes an integrated approach based on 
linguistic decision making (LDM) for assessing and prioritizing key criteria for warehouse location selection in 
disaster management. Specifically, the 2-Tuple linguistic (2-TL) model is used to represent decision-maker's 
subjective opinions, and then an integrated methodology combining 2-TL-DEMATEL and 2-TL-TOPSIS (Technique 
for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is employed for the analysis of the criteria and the selection of 
the optimal warehouse location. This approach allows decision-makers to effectively deal with subjective linguistic 
information and to handle uncertainty and imprecision in the decision-making process. The proposed methodology 
combines DEMATEL for causal relation analysis and TOPSIS for multi-criteria decision-making to identify and select 
the optimal warehouse location. Moreover, the paper provides a case study conducted in the Türkiye area to 
demonstrate the practical application of the proposed methodology. The results of the study provide an importance 
ranking of the key location selection criteria and reveal the causal relationships between them. The paper concludes 
that the proposed methodology can provide a structured and systematic approach for warehouse location selection in 
disaster management, and it can help decision-makers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response 
efforts.

1. Introduction
Disaster management is a critical aspect of ensuring the safety and security of communities and minimizing the impact 
of natural and anthropogenic disasters (Lillywhite et al., 2022). Effective disaster management requires a 
comprehensive strategy that includes various stages, from prevention and preparedness to response and recovery. One 
critical component of disaster management is warehouse location selection for the storage and distribution of relief 
goods and supplies. 
The selection of an appropriate warehouse location is crucial for effective disaster management. The location of a 
warehouse can significantly impact the response time, accessibility, and effectiveness of relief efforts (Geng et al., 
2021). Disaster logistics and supply chain management play a critical role in ensuring the efficient and effective 
delivery of relief supplies to affected areas. The warehouse location is a key factor in determining the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the logistics and supply chain management for disaster relief operations.

Abstract 
This study presents a heuristic approach to resolve an actual scheduling problem, for an exam at the King Fahd 
University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. To assess the timeliness, we use a new objective function. In 
order to prevent students from taking successive tests on the same day, the goal function prioritizes timeslots above 
days when assigning exams to timeslots. Additionally, the goal is to space out tests over the course of the testing 
session. This heuristic may be applied to other real-world challenges. Results of computation are presented. All 
institutes of higher education deal with the scheduling of final exams on a regular, and difficult basis. The ability to 
create the timetable as early in the semester as feasible while maintaining the maximum flexibility is ideal for all 
parties concerned. Students like to be able to plan their trip towards the end of the semester ahead of time to benefit 
from deals on tickets, etc. (In this essay, the term ”semester” shall be used to refer to the academic year. While the 
systems employed by different institutions—such as quarter, summer, trimester, etc.—vary, all are conceptually tied 
to the idea of a semester.) Additionally, faculty like to plan as early as feasible for both the test period and any 
intersession breaks between periods of teaching. Finally, administrators like to complete the procedure as quickly as 
feasible. The best time to make the final exam schedule available is during registration but doing so necessitates 
knowing which courses will have final exams at that time. Even if it could be conceivable at some universities. The 
choice to provide a final exam in any specific course is based on a variety of variables. The first is that instructors are 
not compelled to provide final examinations, and some courses are presented in a way that does not need them. Instead 
of a final test, some courses substitute a term paper, project, or seminar format for the class. It is up to the departments 
and teachers to manage this. Finally, not all classes that were initially planned to meet during pre- registration period 
do so in any given semester, and not all teachers are known until the semester has started. This is particularly true for 
the fall semester because pre-registration happens in the late spring when fall hiring choices are still being made. In 
this paper, we discuss how we approached and overcame the scheduling issue for Semester (221), Year 2022, at King 
Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). The datasets, which comprise 598 courses, 10242 students, 30 
periods, and 10 exam days, have been preprocessed based on the given data. The package comprises of a collection 
of heuristic techniques created to address the different stages of the issue. The pre-intervention scenario is presented 
first, followed by the system’s aims, the solution method, and the reasons behind the solutions selected to address the 
issue. The programming strategy and report generation are described in the end. 
In the past schedules, the registrar service at KFUPM focuses on making a schedule that has no conflict and that no 
student has three exams in the same day, with out considering an objective, the registrar only focuses on satisfying the 
con- strains. This method will be fine regarding having no conflicts for any student, but it doesn’t take into account 
creating a schedule to enhance students performance and increasing the distance between exams. The problem we are 
trying to solve is not only establishing a schedule without conflicts for any student, but also we are looking to create 
a better schedule for the students that has suitable distribution for the courses to enhance students performance in their 
exams and making it easier to study. This will be done by making a well-established formulation in terms of objective 
function and function. In the objective function, we will aim to minimize conditions where the student have three or 
four exams in two consecutive days, and where the student have two exams in a raw, and where the student have two 
exams in three consecutive slots. To explain the slots, the aim is to establish the schedule in ten days and each day has 
three slots morning, afternoon, evening. As a result, we will have thirty slots in total. 
Using the steps provided before we divide the students into groups, solve the sub problems taking into consideration 
the common courses between them, and combine the solutions for all groups to come up with the final exam schedule 
for all courses. the main difference between the solution we got and the original final exams schedule is the number

Abstract 
As a country of acute power crisis, Bangladesh is now looking forward to developing its renewable energy sources. 
In this work, we survey the current art of the solar energy technologies being used presently and future utilization in 
Bangladesh. This paper emphasizes that a reliable, affordable, and secure supply of energy is important for socio-
economic development. Solar energy may help a lot in achieving sufficiency in electricity especially in rural areas. It 
is known from different sources that only 75% population have access to electricity in Bangladesh and nearly 75% of 
the population is rural and only about 30% of the rural households have access to grid electricity. The rural areas are 
not often feasible for conventional grid-based electrification due to high investment and running costs. The 
Infrastructure Development Company Ltd recently states that the number of solar home systems (SHSs) in Bangladesh 
(April 2016) is 3.9 million. As a result, more than 25 million people are benefitted from solar electricity.

1. Introduction
Electricity is the most important resource for the foundation of economic growth of a country and constitutes one of 
the vital infrastructural inputs in socio-economic development. The world faces a surge in demand for electricity that 
is driven by such powerful forces as population growth, extensive urbanization, industrialization, and the rise in the 
standard of living. In 1901, a private generator was erected in the house of the then Nawab of Dhaka, marking the 
beginning of the widespread use of electricity in the area. On December 7, 1901, Mr. Bolton, a British national, flipped 
the switch that began supplying Ahsan Monjil with electricity. In the 1930s, DEVCO, a subsidiary of Octavian Steel 
Company, initiated a privately owned electricity distribution system by establishing the Dhanmondi power plant for 
commercial electricity distribution.  
In 1972, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was created to boost the power sector. A different approach 
and a new model were considered for undertaking a comprehensive scheme. Thus, the Government created Rural 
Electrification Board (REB) in October 1977. Later in 1991 Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) was created 
basically to operate and develop distribution system in and around Dhaka (Halder et al., 2015). Bangladesh populates 
more than 160 million people in a land mass of 147,570 sq km. In 1971, just 3% of Bangladesh’s population had 
access to electricity. Today, only 75% of the population has access to electricity with a per capita consumption of

12.   Conclusion 
Rural electrification through Solar home System is becoming more popular, day by day in Bangladesh particularly for 
remote, inaccessible areas. But the intensified competition challenges make the customers satisfaction an essential 
prerequisite for the achieving a sustainable competitive advantage and, hence, the Solar Home Systems industry’s 
overall success. As in today’s competitive environment service marketers put great effort on developing customer 
satisfaction to maintain competitive edge research can be undertaken for outlining of what needs to be done to improve 
the service of the Solar Home Systems in Bangladesh. For that purpose, the researcher tried to judge its customer 
satisfaction with this research. The findings suggest that the service provided by Solar Home Systems has far-reaching 
effects on the economic, social, and demographic conditions of rural Bangladeshi society. It has significant and 
sustained impact on household and commercial activities. And by watching TV people are now keeping informed 
about the latest state of sports, culture, and political developments. Most of the respondents are found just satisfied 
with the Solar Home System in Bangladesh. They are found dissatisfied with some service quality variables like 
convenient use of the system, longevity of the SHS, sustainability of the SHS, availability of loan from the system 
providers, maintenance cost of the system, warranty support of the SHS, credibility of the providers, friendly behavior 
of the personnel, the leaflet, catalogue etc. provided with the system and availability of the parts of the system in the 
local market. So, the service providers should take proper care of these variables to improve the overall service quality 
of SHS service in Bangladesh.  
 
The service providers should offer a good quality system at a reasonable price with adequate capacity and longevity 
to meet up the requirements of the customers. Moreover, they should maintain a better after sale service at reasonable 
cost for the customers for convenient use of the systems and arrange training on technical and better service delivery 
to their personnel.  After accounting for the study's limitations, its conclusions may be extrapolated. This research 
focuses on people who have installed solar panels in their homes in the Rajshahi Division. To our knowledge, this is 
the first research to focus on the customer's point of view. Improvements to the quality of the Solar Home System 
service in our nation are possible if further studies verify, reinforce, and corroborate the results of this investigation 
while also providing different strategic direction.

Abstract 
Since reverse engineering (RE) leads to a tremendous impact on product quality, customer satisfaction, and the level 
of customer loyalty and retention, increased attention is given to the supply chain process. In this paper, a framework 
for RE is built for an electronics manufacturing company using PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Technique) 
while considering financial and political limitations. Prior to this effort, RE efforts at the organization were being 
conducted on a case-by-case basis.  By implementing this framework, the organization can better plan, optimize, and 
document RE activities.  The status and features of this new RE framework will be presented and future improvement 
recommendations will be given.

1. Introduction
During the last decades, more awareness has been shown in terms of sustainability in supply chain management and 
operations, national and international regulations, and social communities all around the world are arguing to push 
businesses to consider the environmental impact and sustain resources while designing their products and operations 
(Metta and Badurdeen. 2013). 
Sustainability has three main discourses; environmental, social, and business. Environmental sustainability can be 
defined as the capacity to preserve natural resources and uphold ecological balance in our planet’s natural environment 
for the benefit of present and future generations. While social sustainability is defined as determining and managing 
the good and bad effects of business on people. And finally, business sustainability refers to the ability of a company 
to endure through time, in terms of profitability, productivity, and financial performance as well as in terms of 
managing the environmental and social assets that make up its capital, in another term how business can stay in 
business (Giovannoni and Fabietti. 2013). 
A review report by (Springett. 2003) which aimed to identify the development of business sustainability shows that 
one of the topics that needs to be addressed and investigated using real case implantation is the return marterial 
authorization (RMA). 
The expectations of customers, businesses, and buyers do not always go as planned, despite the greatest efforts and 
quality control measures. And in such situations, the item will be sent back through the supply chain. Companies often 
do this to maximize asset recovery, optimize supply chain efficiency, reduce costs and improve customer experience 
and maintain the good name of their business so they will be sustained in the market (Chai et al. 2010). 
When a product is returned, reverse logistics, also known as the return process, must be followed. Typically, the initial 
step is to get RMA.  However, the RMA may consider several post-sale services. These could involve warranty

5. Conclusion and Future Work 
The study was conducted on a real case in a semiconductor manufacturer in the United States of America. Historically, 
return merchandised process was not implemented consistently and there was no standardized documentation for it. 
The research team worked on documenting the process and building a consolidated flow chart for it. This comes as a 
result of multiple meetings with various teams. The customer service, warehouse, production, and upper management 
were all included in the meetings.  PERT was applied over the build process flow chart and the expected time for 
RMA is 73.53 hours.  The critical activities were found to be A, B, D, E, F, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, and V. Although 
the average activity durations used in PERT calculations provide for an overall mean time for project completion (in 
this case a mean completion time of 73.53 for this RMA process), it would also be useful as an ongoing effort to 
determine, for example, a 95% confidence interval on that path by incorporating the different activities’ variations. 
 
The critical path for the RMA process was clarified. Later, studies can be done on the critical activities to find the 
possible crash time for each step and its cost. So, if a crash output overweighs its cost, that activity will be crashed. 
By this, the expected RMA time can be decreased. 
 
After being implementing the proposed RMA successfully for five observations, the company, which the research was 
conducted in, shown huge interest in our research and ask for our corporation to implement it for a long term.

Abstract 
Telkomsel is currently working to enhance the basis of the digital business by pursuing digital transformation. Given 
the intense competitiveness in the digital telecommunications industry, this is a crucial task. MyTelkomsel Apps, a 
self-service digital channel, was introduced by Telkomsel on March 25, 2016, as evidence of the company's digital 
transformation. MyTelkomsel Apps streamlines the purchasing of credit, data packages, kartuHalo bill payments, and 
exchange point self-service for Telkomsel customers. However, there is still a low conversion rate in the MyTelkomsel 
Apps between active users (users of the app) and package users (purchasers of the product). There are active customers 
who previously actively purchased products but do not currently do so on MyTelkomsel Apps, or what is known as 
MyTelkomsel Lapser, which is one of the causes of the poor conversion rate. Therefore, the issue at hand today is 
how to reactivate MyTelkomsel Lapser so they can renew their product to MyTelkomsel Apps. In order for Telkomsel 
to offer tailored treatment to recover lapsed transactions in MyTelkomsel Apps, the goal of this research is to give 
Telkomsel knowledge into the precise profile of MyTelkomsel Apps lapsers. 2.206.636 clients are lapsers as of March 
2023. The decision tree algorithm is used to predict lapsers who are in the high prospect group to become non lapsers 
and The K-Means Cluster algorithm is used to create lapser segments from 2.206.636 lapsers based on relevant 
variables that have been determined, and in one data set with a period of March 2023. There are 70 variables made up 
of 1 geographic variable, 8 psychographic variables, and 61 behavioral variables. 1.914.232 lapsers are collected from 
the data cleansing procedure, which may then be processed to separate them into 20% testing data and 80% training 
data. With a model accuracy of 97.25%, it is predicted that 45,116 (2.35%) consumers will make purchases at 
MyTelkomsel and 1.869.116 (97.64%) customers will stay lapser after the variables are discovered and the lapser data 
is processed using the decision tree method. The top 5 significant variables from the model are the number of data 
package purchases made through the MKIOS channel, the UMB channel, acquisition-type purchases, physical voucher 
purchases, and transaction-type purchases of data packages. Furthermore, using the K-Means Cluster technique, 
45.116 consumers are divided into clusters based on the top 5 important variables. The silhouette index for these 
45.116 high-prospect clients is divided into 3 clusters, with n_cluster = 3 having the biggest value (0.78), compared 
to the other n_cluster. Low Data User (94.89%), Medium Data through UMB Channel (4.14%), and Physical Voucher 
User with Medium ARPU (0.97%) are the 3 clusters that were formed. 
Telkomsel can perform behavioral targeting for the three clusters based on the prediction model & clustering results 
to give tailored product gimmicks.

- 
Cluster-3: Medium Physical Voucher User With an average consumption of Rp 40,729, the greatest average 
physical voucher usage among the other clusters. Seven times each month, this cluster performs data package 
transactions. According to estimates, cluster-3 consumers frequently travel or live far from Telkomsel outlets, making 
it more common for them to purchase significant quantities of physical vouchers at those places and then use them 
elsewhere.

Behavioral Targeting 
Based on the outcomes of the prediction model and clustering model, Telkomsel can do behavioral targeting in order 
to deliver more tailored forecasts. An illustration of a gimmick for each cluster in accordance with its profile is given 
below (Figure 10):

The Low Data User Cluster, which has the largest voice transaction compared to the other clusters with an 
average monthly speech transaction of 12 times and an average payload of 11 GB. Customers in this cluster will have 
the option of purchasing a Monthly Data Package for Rp 89,000 that includes a total main quota of 29 GB, as well as 
an additional 29 GB of Apps Quota, 39 GB of Youtube Quota, and a 30-minute call bonus that is only available 
through MyTelkosmel Apps. Customers are anticipated to be drawn to this offer since it provides a greater data limit 
at a price that is often not that different from the average history of customers' monthly fees. 
- 
With an average package use of Rp 150,000, an average payload of 21 GB, and an average digital revenue 
of Rp 9,000, Cluster Medium Data User via UMB Channel has the highest average digital revenue when compared to 
the other clusters. This cluster will receive a Monthly Data Package offer for Rp 153,000 with a total main allowance 
of 53 GB, additional 53 GB for apps and 61 GB for Youtube, as well as a bonus of a Free Disney Subscription and 25 
GB for videos, both of which are, of course, exclusively available on MyTelkomsel Apps. Customers are anticipated 
to be drawn in by the value of this promotion to MyTelkomsel Apps purchases. A digital quota is assigned to this 
cluster customer. 
- 
Physical Voucher User Medium Arpu cluster with an average payload of 14 GB, average data package usage 
of Rp 127,000, and an average digital revenue of Rp 7,000. This cluster will receive a Monthly Data Package for Rp 
133,000 with a total main quota of 45 GB, an extra 45 GB Apps Quota, 61 GB Youtube Quota, as well as a bonus of 
Free Disney Subscription and 25 GB Video Quota that is, of course, only available at MyTelkomsel Apps. This 
promotion is meant to entice customers to buy things from MyTelkomsel Apps. 
5. Conclusion 
Decision Tree addresses the issue of predicting a target variable that may be binary or binomial (such as 1 or 0, yes or 
no) using predictors or attributes, which may be numeric. By applying it to all populations of lapser MyTelkomsel 
Apps by 2.206.636 customers. There were identified 45.116 customers as highly likelihood to purchase package in 
MyTelkomsel Apps and 4.14% of them came from Medium Data Users through UMB Channel segment with average 
data revenue per user reached IDR 150.000. Top 5 significant variables that affected customers to purchase package 
in MyTelokmsel Apps are data recharge amount thru UMB and MKIOS Channel, recharge of acquisition pack type 
and physical voucher type and number of broadband package transaction. Researcher creates design of behavioral 
targeting based on result from predictive modeling & customer segmentation to offer product based on customer 
behavior.

Abstract 
This discourse elaborates the business from both perspectives vis-à-vis management and engineering. To be precise, 
the balances between business management and business engineering are deemed indispensable factors in this paper. 
Subsequently, this paper elaborates business management (BM) and business engineering (BE) in term and description 
of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cybersecurity, and Additive Manufacturing. The distinctive aspect in this paper focuses 
on the Asian’s business management and business engineering, with the consideration that most of Industrialized 
Asian countries have contributed to the world economic growth. To some extent, there has been economic power shift 
from Europe and North American into Asia region. This economic power influences the BM and BE of IoT, 
Cybersecurity and Additive Manufacturing. IoT, Cybersecurity, and Additive Manufacturing constitutes trilogy of 
discussion in this paper within BM and BE. To begin with, IoT is highly demanded in which its theoretical and 
empirical aspects are ubiquitous, connecting wide arrays of objects to the internet through embedded technologies 
within global ecosystems. Subsequently, Cybersecurity throughout the digital transformation era, has been evolving 
in wide array of shapes that leave any BM and BE activities in corporate perspective in highly vulnerable position. 
Ultimately, Additive Manufacturing harnesses and intertwines prior IoT and Cybersecurity in ensuring the 
sustainability of BM and BE activities in corporate perspectives. The research methodology in this paper constitutes 
at least the approach of quantitative approach, and if it is deemed indispensable, the qualitative approach is conducted. 
Ultimately, the objective of this paper is intertwining the ultimate objective of ensuring sustainable competitive 
advantages in performing and running corporate business within trilogy of business engineering which are 
engineering, information technology and business itself.

Abstract 
Defense management science has been evolving from its original form of the defense mechanism. To some extent, 
defense management science, in brief form of defense mechanisms of military, police and civilian, has been 
developing from time to time. The development refers to the transformation from the full involvement of humans, into 
the less involvement of humans, as it was replaced by technology. This paper focuses on the mentioned technology 
within the scope of artificial intelligence and autonomous robots. Despite the wide range of defense mechanisms 
within military, police and civilian; this paper elaborates the major parts of defense mechanism, known as defense 
management science in military perspective. To be precise, the defense management science in this paper furthermore 
explores the benefit of drones through their artificial intelligence in winning the battles and ultimately its war. The 
purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the wide variety of combinations of defense management science using both 
artificial intelligence and autonomous robots to win battles and ultimately war. The research methodology in this paper 
emphasizes the quantitative approaches. Yet, it opens to the options on using qualitative method as well.

End to End Quality Control in Consumer Electronics

Abstract 
End-to-end quality control is the process of ensuring that a product meets all quality standards throughout its entire 
lifecycle, from design and manufacturing to delivery and customer use. It is important for every industry that 
manufactures tangible products used by customers on a day-to-day basis. For consumer electronics it is equally 
important because it helps to ensure that products are safe, reliable, and meet customer expectations for daily use of 
tangible products. End-to-end quality control can help to identify and fix defects early in the product development 
process, which can save time and money. It can also help to prevent customer returns and improve customer 
satisfaction.It includes both incoming inspection of materials and components, and in-process and final inspection of 
finished products. 
Incoming quality control 
Incoming inspection (often referred to as Incoming Quality control or IQC) ensures that all materials and components 
meet the required specifications. This is done by sampling and testing materials and components to verify that they 
meet the required properties. There are various methods to pick samples for testing including:  
●
Statistical sampling
●
Random sampling
●
First-off sampling
●
Batch sampling
●
Acceptance sampling
Upstream out-going quality control 
IQC down-stream is as important as performing outgoing inspection (often referred to as Outgoing Quality control or 
OQC) at a previous node. OQC checks typically happen at a larger sampling rate compared to the downstream 
incoming checks. Typical OQC checks include nondestructive inspections like dimensional, cosmetic and functional 
checks based on drawing specifications, and destructive inspections and Reliability. 
Performing 100% inspection at both IQC and OQC is not feasible in most cases. Sampling is widely used in businesses 
owing to benefits obtained when facing detrimental aspects of 100% inspection like: 
●
Destructive inspection where a quantity of product is destroyed during testing and a business wants
to limit this
●
Costs associated with 100% inspection are not economica
In process Quality control 
In-process inspection (often referred to as In process Quality control or IPQC) ensures that products are being 
manufactured correctly throughout the production process. This is done by inspecting products at various sub-
assembly stages of production. This ensures that an issue with the manufacturing process is caught earlier in the cycle 
to help save costs with finding defects further down in the supply chain. 
Final inspection ensures that finished products meet all quality standards before they are shipped to customers. This 
is done by inspecting products for defects and verifying that they meet all specifications. This includes Cosmetic, 
Functional, Dimensional checks as well as Reliability checks 
There are a number of different methods that can be used for End-to-end quality control, including: 
●
Design reviews
●
Process audits
●
Product testing and Reliability testing
●
Customer feedback
Statistics 
Statistical Control is really important when it comes to analyzing data from each of these inspection nodes. There 
are multiple data visualization methods to visualize, analyze and act on data obtained from inspections including (but 
not all inclusive) - box plots, histograms, pareto, scatter plot, correlation and regression analysis plots.

Abstract 
This study aims to discuss the barriers of Agile Project Management, considering the increase of utilization of 
Agile Methods worldwide specially because it has helped companies get better productivity and reduce their 
wastes. And, because agility (adaptability to need) has become an advantage for companies into a highly 
competitive business world. According to Erhun et al. (2021) agility describes a company’s ability to respond to 
short-term changes in market demand or supply quickly and handle external disruptions smoothly. The analysis 
of the literature has been conducted using the Web of Science and Scopus databases as well as the VOS 
viewer software for a deeper analysis of 26 articles selected. It is important to remember the Agile manifesto 
was born and developed oriented to the world of software, seeking to generate tangible value to the customer at 
the expense of the vast documentation less experimental and due its good results, these methods have also been 
integrated into other sectors. On the other hand, Agile Methods often face some barriers to its implementation 
particularly from someone who has been taught on Traditional ways of Project Management. Considering so the 
advantages of Agile and the existence of barriers to implementing, this paper intend to list the main barriers to the 
Agile trough a systematic literature review.

1. Introduction
Project management experiences volatility and uncertainty potentially never seen in the global context. Customers 
increasingly aware and demanding, business opportunities appear and disappear quickly, economic instability in 
various parts of the globalized world affecting the Supply Chain in a forceful way. Added to this is the 
multidimensional competitiveness that products face competing and with other products from different segments. 
In this unstable scenario it becomes a survival factor for companies that they develop agility as a mechanism of 
responsiveness and adaptability to customer needs. According to Erhun et al. (2021), agility describes a company's 
ability to respond to short-term changes in market demand or supply quickly and handle external disruptions 
seamlessly. Influenced by this volatility, companies began to adopt more frequently the Agile form of project 
management. 
Agile methods had their origin in the development environment of computer programs after findings of several 
failures in projects in terms of cost and time. Scholars gathered and described the so-called Agile Manifesto 
containing twelve principles, listed here after: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and 
continuous delivery of valuable software; welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile 
processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage; deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.; business people and developers 
must work together daily throughout the project; build projects around motivated individuals; give them the 
environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done; the most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation; working software is the 
primary measure of progress; agile processes promote sustainable development; the sponsors, developers, and 
users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely; continuous attention to technical excellence and

5. Conclusion 
The systematic literature review returned 26 articles selected for further analysis and these ones exposed the 
barriers to adequate implementation of agile methods. Although Agile Project Management has been increasingly 
adopted to get better results for the companies it often faces barriers to its implementation and development 
particularly for people who do not know exactly how it works. The lack of top management support and 
commitment is one of the top barriers that Agile implementation faces sometimes because the Top management 
are stuck in the old ways of management. Having no support from highly hierarchical levels of the company it 
becomes even tough to get the investments on competencies to use and perform Agile properly. 
Finally, it is important to investigate ways to overcome those main barriers cited in this article, which in turn it is 
a suggestion for future research into the field. 
 
5.1 Practical implications 
The practical implications are that the main barriers exposed in this article can help other researchers have a 
compilation view about “what are the main barriers to Agile Project Management”. Additionally, Agile Teams 
can serve themselves of this study preventing them about which barriers they will face during the Agile 
implementation. 
 
5.2 Theoretical implications 
 
The implications to the theoretical aspect are important knowing no systematic literature review has been found 
through the research done into the databases selected. Besides that, regarding the theoretical implications, this 
article brings a novel contribution, showing the main barriers to Agile Project Management implementation for 
Management area.

Abstract 
Production planning and scheduling are generally treated sequentially. Based on a critical review of the application of 
simulation techniques to Production Planning and Control (PPC) problems between 2002 and 2014, the literature was 
systematically narrowed from about 2,250 to 131. The five problems considered in PPC are facility resource planning, 
capacity planning, work planning , process planning and production scheduling. The development of expert systems 
in scheduling poses many problems and many different approaches have been tried in prototyping systems. One of 
the manufacturing companies that produce polycarbonate lenses applies a make to order system. Based on the 
production scheduling that has been applied, the order completion target has not been met for 30 days. Based on the 
problem in production scheduling, analyzing by production scheduling and line balancing for polycarbonate lens 
production. So it can meet the target completion of orders that have been set.

1. Introduction
Production planning and scheduling are generally carried out sequentially. Production planning is the basis for 
manufacturing companies, to determine the type and quantity of products to be produced to meet demand 
(VenKateswaran 2004). Scheduling is an important application in expert systems, in development it still creates many 
problems and many different approaches (Maccarthy and Jou 1995). In manufacturing companies, the part that 
regulates production planning and scheduling is Production Planning Control (PPC). In February 2022, a 
polycarbonate lens manufacturing company received 32,308 customer orders with a variety of product types of 299 
products in 39,10 days of the 30-day completion target. The part that regulates production scheduling in the company 
is the PPC section. Based on a critical review of the application of simulation techniques to PPC problems between 
2002 and 2014, a systematically narrowed literature was filtered from about 2250 to 131. Five applications (Facility 
resource planning, capacity planning, job planning, process planning and production scheduling) were considered 
issues. production planning (Jeon and Kim 2016). Researchers take one problem from production planning, namely 
production scheduling to analyze production scheduling in fulfilling customer orders with a target of 30 days from the 
time the order is received. 
2. Literature Review
Based on previous research on production scheduling problems, the background is delays in delivery (Nur Amalia and 
Sofyan 2022), products with faster processes are delayed due to First Come First Serve (FCFS) rules (Sulaksmi, Kesy 
Garside, and Hadziqah 2014), complicated product manufacturing processes (Sodikin and Mashuri 2012) and 
sufficient production capacity but cannot meet customer demands on time (Annisya and Saifudin 2020). From 
previous research references production scheduling is very influential on timeliness to meet customer demand. The 
researcher tries to identify the method used by previous researchers consisting of the Earliest Due Date (EDD), and 
First Come First Serve. However, the condition of the problem is that the manufacturing company where the researcher 
is based has data order criteria with the same due date and there is only 1 order from 1 customer, so the First Come 
First Serve and Earliest Due Date systems cannot apply. Data that can be processed from February 2022 orders is 
based on the fastest processing time and the longest processing time, so researchers will use another queuing system 
method that focuses on processing time by comparing the Short Processing Time and Long Processing Time from the

Queue System 
From the calculation of the previous takt time, the order completion time has been obtained for 29.82 days. 
Furthermore, to make a production schedule after determining the resources used, a queuing system is used to see how 
much the average delay is in processing orders and the utilization value of the schedule. The calculation results show 
that the SPT method has a greater utilization value than the LPT method with a value of 1.27%. So that the SPT 
method will be chosen for production scheduling (Table 7).

6. Conclusion 
Based on research results in analyzing polycarbonate lens production scheduling using the line balancing method (takt 
time), to fulfill an order of 32,308 pcs with a start of production of 56,680 pcs requires the addition of molding 
machines to 2 machines. So that customer orders will be fulfilled for 29.82 days from the target of 30 days. By using 
the queuing system method, the short processing time method is more efficient to use in the scheduling, because it has

Abstract 
The primary source of energy in the United States is fossil fuels and it creates damaging consequences to our 
environment. It pollutes the environment, and it will continue to create negative issues for future generations to come, 
but renewable energy sources like solar would greatly reduce the production of carbon emissions, so solar has been 
on the rise in recent years. This study is important because with non-greenhouse emissions increasing it causes the 
temperature to rise dramatically. Humans have increased the number of emissions which resulted in climate change

Abstract 
As solar energy has been growing over the years, the energy markets have been gradually moving toward using a 
decentralized market. Renewable energy is slowly becoming unpopular because of the hidden fees being charged to 
people who have installed PV systems. The energy that is being generated does not match what is consumed. The 
significance to this study starts with people becoming more involved with solar energy if there are incentives worth 
having PV systems installed. Also, looking for ways to store the surplus of energy not being consumed. There are

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether using screencasts and snapshots in an instructional workflow for 
new learners will lower the time required for them to create a data report. Our team examined the current workflow 
that a regional organization uses to teach new employees and redesigned it to include screencasts and snapshots, which 
allow the user to see what exactly needs to be done on a screen just like theirs. After the team created a version of the 
workflow, they assembled a control group and an experimental group, each of seven people. The control group used 
the original workflow to complete a data report, while the experimental group used the new workflow. For each 
individual workflow was timed and found the mean time of each group. On average, the experimental group was able 
to complete their data report about 2.66 minutes (8.5%) earlier than the control group, and the difference in times was 
statistically significant. The study team was also offered the opportunity to design a new office layout for that office 
space. The goal was to provide the organization with a design that allowed for synchronous work. The team researched 
various types of facility layouts and decided to base the design on a process layout. Ergonomics and other various 
standards were considered while redesigning the office layout. Through the proposed design, the study team was able 
to create a more collaborative space, which would allow employees to communicate more easily and efficiently.

1. Introduction
This study is part of a yearlong capstone project conducted at a regional company headquartered in Natchitoches, 
Louisiana. The company specializes in aerial photography using metric cameras that work in tandem with high-
precision GPS/INS to create imagery with ultra-high resolution and extremely accurate geographical data. Using its 
multitude of cameras and GPS systems, many services are offered to clients including 3D modeling, leak detection, 
LIDAR scanning, wildlife counts, underwater mapping, and disaster response. Their pilots are based nationwide, 
giving them the ability to launch immediately and be onsite as quickly as possible. To help the clients better understand 
the imagery and data, reports are created that include the portions of imagery or modeling that the client has requested 
along with any pertinent data regarding the images. This can include certain elevations, diameters, and estimated 
volumes.  
The company had created a written protocol for its employees to take the imagery, dissect the data from it using certain 
software, and create reports for the clients. However, these workflows could be confusing and riddled with industry 
language, which made them tough to understand and follow for someone unfamiliar with the pertinent software. 
Therefore, the number of people who could create these reports was limited to the employees that were well-versed 
in the software and industry lingo, forcing them to take time to churn out these reports and ignore other duties. By 
forcing these employees to do so, the company was losing money and misusing time that could be put towards the 
next client or objective. Workflow systems are designed to automate the implementation of processes within a

monitor, as well as the adjustability and lumbar support of the chair (ANSI/HFES 100-2007, 2007). Adhering to this 
standard can help prevent musculoskeletal disorders and other health problems associated with prolonged sitting and 
computer use. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also requires employers to make reasonable 
accommodations for employees with disabilities, which may include providing ergonomic equipment or adjusting 
workstations to meet the employees’ needs (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2022). By doing so, 
employers can ensure that employees with disabilities can perform their job duties safely and comfortably, reducing 
the risk of injury or strain. Adhering to ergonomic standards is critical in promoting the health and safety of employees 
in the workplace. By implementing ergonomic guidelines and regulations, employers can create a work environment 
that promotes good posture and comfort while reducing the risk of injury or strain. This, in turn, can lead to improved 
productivity, job satisfaction, and overall employee well-being. 
 
The research group also proposed the office layout redesign shown in Figure 2. This layout creates a functional and 
efficient workspace for 12 employees who will be doing computer work in a single 100 ft. x 50 ft. room. The open 
workspace promotes collaboration, while the space between workstations provides privacy when needed. Mobile 
whiteboards or screens can be used to create temporary partitions for additional privacy or to divide the space for 
different projects or teams. A separate office for more privacy is also included, as well as a conference room so that 
employees can meet. The layout was based on a process layout because it’s a layout type that arranges workstations 
and equipment based on the process flow. This layout groups together similar tasks and equipment, which can help 
increase productivity and efficiency. Additionally, it’s flexible, making it an ideal choice for businesses that require 
frequent adjustments. Workers can move easily from one station to another, which can help reduce wasted time and 
unnecessary movement. The process layout can also facilitate communication and collaboration among workers, 
leading to better teamwork and improved job satisfaction. Finally, this process layout is cost-effective as it does not 
require extensive construction or remodeling of the office space. It can help optimize workflow and reduce operational 
costs. Overall, the process layout can be an excellent option for businesses looking for a flexible, productive, 
communicative, and cost-effective office layout type.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the workflow study, it can be concluded that using Screenpresso for creating workflow will 
significantly shorten (8.5%) the time required to complete a data report for new learners. Thus, if this time saving is 
scaled on a yearly basis for the whole company the trend of time savings will translate to hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. The idea of an improved visual walkthrough enhances both the quality of the client reports as well as 
productivity within the company. Using Screenpresso to create visual walkthroughs for the workflow document shows 
the employee exactly how the image should look and where the data should be placed. This creates and displays a 
standardized example of how each snapshot should look, leaving nothing to interpretation. Doing so also gives 
employees the ability to hand off reports to each other, when necessary, which can be crucial when one person may 
not be able to complete their work. Another employee could simply pick up where they left off, and the client would 
never notice the difference because of the standardized look of each snapshot. On the other hand, the redesign of the 
current office layout into a process layout gives the company the ability to have their employees work congruently on

a task, eliminating the need for them to wait on each other when needing a certain computer or area. The proposed 
layout redesign would group computers with similar software but will also give each computer enough space so that 
each one can be used by an employee at the same time. The proposed design solves the company’s issue of multiple 
computers being taken up by a single employee. We were also able to create a more collaborative space, which would 
allow employees to communicate more easily and more efficiently.

Abstract 
Electronic waste is a type of organic waste whose growth is very fast, about three times faster than other waste. The 
volume of e-waste generated worldwide in 2019 was around 54 million metric tons and is expected to continue to 
increase until by 2030, annual worldwide e-waste production will increase by around 30 percent or around 75 million 
metric tons. Specific regulations in e-waste management are important factors in preventing and reducing e-waste. 
Indonesia is an example of a country that does not yet have specific regulations for electronic waste management. 
Currently, Indonesia is the largest e-waste producing country in Asia with an e-waste value of 1.3 million metric tons. 
This research is one of the efforts to provide recommendations for strategies to reduce the amount of electronic waste 
in Indonesia. Strategies are collected based on literature and validated by experts for the suitability of strategy 
implementation in Indonesia. A total of 20 recommendations for the reverse logistics strategy for e-waste processing 
infrastructure were successfully validated and then arranged based on a structural hierarchical strategy. This study 
uses the help of the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method to develop a strategy in the form of a hierarchical 
structure. Matrice d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee aun Classement (MICMAC) analysis to determine the 
classification of strategies based on driving forces and dependencies between strategies. The resulting structural model 
is used as a strategic map for implementing a strategy to reduce the amount of e-waste in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Over the course of many years, it has become widely recognized on a global scale that human lifestyles have caused 
irreversible harm to the environment. Consequently, it has become imperative to adopt a systematic and sustainable 
approach towards our consumption habits. The desire for a higher standard of living among the world's population has 
led to the introduction of numerous aids and equipment that greatly simplify our busy lives. As a result, Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (EEE) has gained immense popularity and is now considered an essential component of 
everyday life. In fact, the production of such equipment has become one of the fastest growing manufacturing activities 
worldwide. The growing dependence on these diverse EEEs, catering to a wide range of needs and available in various 
sizes, has resulted in the development of innovative products with desired features. However, these products often 
have limited lifespans, leading to the rapid disposal of outdated and obsolete items. Unfortunately, the production, 
consumption, and disposal of EEEs generally lack consideration for eco-friendly practices, creating sustainability 
challenges. This situation has worsened the generation of a new environmental threat known as ""E-Waste,"" which 
poses additional difficulties due to inadequate management. While the generation of E-Waste is inevitable, it could be 
less problematic if recycling avenues were widely accessible across the globe.

6. Conclusion 
Research on reverse logistics has been increasing over the years, especially in the case of electronic waste, with many 
practitioners being interested in the reverse logistics concept which has many benefits for environmental balance as 
well as effective waste management, cost, carbon impact and health or safety. The implementation of reverse logistics 
for e-waste processing infrastructure in Indonesia is a long-term step that will change the entire infrastructure from 
the process of collection, recycling to redistribution and the main goal is to be able to reduce e-waste in Indonesia. 
Therefore, a strategy of various is needed to reach that goal. In this study there are 3 sections consisting of 20 validated 
strategies which can be seen in the Figure 1. This research requires the help of all stakeholders so that it can run well 
and in a structured manner. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Validated Strategies 
 
Admittedly, this research has some limitations. There is still little research on electronic waste in Indonesia and the 
implementation of reverse logistics has not been widely used in various industries. This of course can make the results 
of this study not fully related. In fact, we have presented experts from small companies to multinational companies, 
non-governmental organizations and academics. Subsequently. These limitations represent viable avenues for future 
research on this topic. Future work might try to expand the expertise. Also, this study suggests using ISM and 
MICMAC to be able to prove the relationship between existing elements. This method can be developed to formulate 
policy strategies, especially for waste management. This will determine the level of hierarchy between strategies based 
on analysis using the level of driving power and dependency power of each variable.

Abstract 
The development of renewable energy has provided Indonesia with an opportunity to tap into its solar energy potential, 
which amounts to a staggering 207 GW. This opportunity is further driven by the increasing demand for electricity, 
the aging and inefficient fossil fuel power plants, the declining costs of solar panel installations, and the ease of their 
deployment. However, customers often encounter challenges in selecting the appropriate solar panels. These 
challenges stem from various factors, including the lack of easily accessible product information, the multitude of 
alternatives with diverse parameters in solar panel selection, and the absence of brand-specific recommendations for 
implementing solar panel types. Consequently, customers face difficulties in making informed decisions, potentially 
hindering the acceleration and optimization of solar panel expansion plans while also increasing the risk of investment 
errors. Solar panels come in various types based on their brands, and each brand possesses distinct advantages and 
disadvantages, making it difficult to determine the most optimal choice for implementation. Therefore, a selection 
process is necessary to identify the most suitable solar panel type based on brand, utilizing the Multi-Criteria Decision 
Making (MCDM) method known as Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS. This method will evaluate nine alternative monocrystalline 
solar panel types, each with a power rating of 540 watts peak, sourced from different brands. The evaluation will be 
based on validated criteria established through expert assessments. By implementing this method, customers will be

1. Introduction
In the realm of renewable energy adoption, Indonesia holds substantial potential. Geographically, Indonesia is situated 
within the ""Sunshine Belt,"" spanning between 35 degrees North and 35 degrees South, allowing for abundant solar 
irradiation throughout the year. The daily average solar irradiation potential received by Indonesia is approximately 
4.8 kWh/m² (Global Solar Atlas 2018). 
Additionally, Indonesia has taken part in global efforts to combat climate change, as evidenced by its commitment 
under the Paris Agreement of 2015. The nation pledged to independently reduce carbon emissions by 29% and up to 
41% with international assistance by 2030 (United Nations Climate Change 2022). In line with the ratification of the 
Paris Agreement through Law No. 16 of 2016, Indonesia has committed to transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable 
energy sources. The target is to achieve a renewable energy mix of 23% by 2025 (Presiden Republik Indonesia 2016). 
In 2017, the energy sector accounted for 49% of greenhouse gas emissions (including mining, oil and gas, 
transportation, and power generation). Specifically, power generation and transportation contributed to 34% of the

6. Conclusion 
In selecting the type of solar panel based on the brand, which is carried out using Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS, the subjectivity 
obtained from the decision maker is reduced, ensuring ambiguity and various inaccuracies when evaluating are 
eliminated. This method succeeded in providing the most optimal solar panel product recommendations by 
considering the main criteria that are often used when selecting solar panels, namely electrical, mechanical, economic, 
environmental, and customer satisfaction criteria. Based on the data processing carried out on the assessment of 
experts, it appears that the electrical criteria have the most weight, followed sequentially by economic, customer 
satisfaction, mechanical, and environmental criteria. However, when viewed from the global weight value of each 
sub-criteria, the 5 sub-criteria that have the highest weight sequentially are the sub-criteria cost per watt, price, 
reliability, dimension, and weight. Based on the weight values obtained, we can get the most optimal solar panel 
product overall, which is alternative A. Meanwhile, the least recommended solar panel product overall is alternative 
H.

Abstract 
The palm oil industry in Indonesia is one of the largest producers of palm oil in the world, and is an important 
contributor to the Indonesian economy. However, the industry is facing increasing pressure from environmental and 
social concerns, such as deforestation, land degradation, and human rights violations. A circular economy offers a 
potential solution to these issues, as it promotes the efficient use of resources and the reduction of waste. Therefore, 
this research was conducted to identify the drivers and barriers to the implementation of a circular economy in the 
palm oil industry in Indonesia. This paper examines the drivers and barriers using CVI and modified kappa method 
by interviewing a few experts. To achieve this, 32 drivers and 38 barriers were asked to the experts and the results 
showed that 27 drivers and 3 barriers were valid. The results of the study showed that the most important drivers were 
the reduction of costs, regulations and government policies, and social pressure. The most important barrier identified 
was the lack of understanding of the circular economy, lack of economic benefits, and financial constraints. The results 
of this study provide valuable insights into the factors that need to be addressed to successfully implement a circular 
economy in the palm oil industry in Indonesia. The findings of this study can be used to inform policymakers and 
stakeholders of the key drivers and barriers that need to be addressed in order to successfully implement a circular 
economy in Indonesia’s palm oil industry.

1. Introduction
Palm oil is a versatile commodity that has been widely utilized in various industries worldwide. Palm oil production 
has increased rapidly in the last 50 years. Based on data from the “Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations” (Roser, 2021) in 1970, world palm oil production only reached 2 million tons. The data also shows world 
palm oil production in 2019 was 35 times higher, reaching 74.58 million tons per year. The rapid rise in palm oil 
follows a broader increase in demand for vegetable oils. Among the various types of vegetable oil, oil palm is a very 
productive crop, because it produces 35% of the world's oil, but uses < 9% of agricultural land devoted to oil 
production.  
Palm oil is used in various industries such as food and beverages, cosmetics, personal care products, and household 
cleaning products. In the food industry, palm oil is widely utilized due to its unique characteristics, such as its high 
melting point, long shelf life, and neutral taste. Palm oil is used in the production of snacks, baked goods, and frying 
oils, as it can withstand high temperatures and provides the desired texture and flavor to these products. Furthermore, 
the demand for palm oil in the cosmetics industry has also grown significantly. Palm oil derivatives such as glycerine, 
stearic acid, and tocopherol are used in the production of skincare and personal care products. The properties of palm 
oil derivatives make them useful in moisturizing, emulsifying, and stabilizing cosmetic products, while also providing 
an extended shelf life. 
Indonesia and Malaysia are the dominant players in the global palm oil market, with only a small amount of palm oil 
being produced in other countries. Indonesia is the largest producer of palm oil globally, accounting for 58% of total 
global production. Malaysia is the second-largest producer with a market share of 26%, followed by Thailand with 
4%, and other countries contributing 12%. Over the past decade, Indonesia has observed an annual increase in palm 
oil production, with an average growth rate of 6.16%. In comparison to the 2012 production levels, palm oil production

Abstract 
This project analyzed a proposed installation of a loading dock to increase the efficiency of the unloading facility of 
a building materials distributor while ensuring the employees’ safety. The facility deals with the unloading and 
organization of doors from the suppliers. This two-man operation begins with unloading the doors onto a rack that is 
lifted in the air by a forklift operator. After unloading the doors, they are carried into a shed, and the rack is placed 
where there is free space. If there is none, the doors are unloaded from the rack and placed in a row against the wall. 
The installation of a loading dock is proposed on the east wall of the shed. With the installation of the loading dock, 
the supplier will be allowed to back into the loading dock at ground level and provide a safer and more efficient 
method of unloading doors while keeping them organized afterward. To justify the construction of the loading dock, 
a time study was conducted over 10 weeks to determine the average standard time it takes to unload one door. Simio 
software was then used to create what-if scenarios that showed the loading dock would cut unloading time almost in 
half. By comparing the observed times to simulated times and researching injury costs, the Payback Period, Internal 
Rate of Return, Benefit-Cost Ratio, and Net Present Value of the loading dock were determined to justify the 
construction from an economical perspective.

1. Introduction
The project was conducted at a distribution company that supplies building materials including lumber, siding, doors, 
and windows to customers varying from professional contractors to weekend warriors. The company expanded 
significantly in the last eight years since its opening, providing its services to a growing number of customers. As it is 
growing, several issues are emerging within this facility. The problem can be divided into three parts: part one 
concerns the safety of employees who are loading and unloading the doors, the second part is concerning the time 
spent unloading the doors from the incoming trucks, and the third part is the arrangement of the incoming doors in the 
storage facility. The doors are shipped in a semi-truck with an enclosed trailer. This truck will not fit inside the shed 
designated for the doors, so a 4x8 foot door rack is lifted to the trailer by a forklift to unload them. This poses a safety

are fractures, which accounted for 29% of injuries in 2020. The average settlement for a fracture is $59,253 [Reichard, 
2023]. One goal for the loading dock is for it to pay itself off within 30 years. About 0.7 injuries occur for every 
10,000 workers. There are on average 50 employees in this organization. By dividing 50 by 10,000 and then 
multiplying by 0.7, the team discovered that .0035 probable injuries. The team then multiplied this by the average 
settlement amount for a fracture and gets the estimated injury cost $207.38/year. This value is added to the $3,044 
found earlier to get a yearly savings rate of $3,251.38. The initial investment of the dock is $15,638.66 (as per the 
quote from the construction contractor). After analysis, the Pay Back Period (PBP) is found to be between 6 years 
with a 7% interest rate, as seen in Table 5.  
 
In addition, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is found to be 15.97%, which is greater than the average interest rate of 
7%. The Net Present Value (NPV) for this 30-yearlong project is found to be $24,707.85 [refer to Table 5], and the 
Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) is calculated as, 
PV of Benefit Expected from the Project
PV of the Cost of the Project
=
$40,346.51
$15,638.66 = 2.56, which is greater than 
1. All of these economic analyses indicate that the installation of a loading dock at the facility will eventually bring 
financial benefits in the long run. 
 
6. Conclusion 
For this project, the team analyzed the system for unloading doors from the supplier. It is clear from touring the yard 
that the unloading system is a hazard to the safety and has proven to be inefficient in production and organization. The 
team conducted a time study for 10 weeks that analyzed the unloading times, and the number of doors received each 
week. The number of doors and time each week varied, but the team broke down the data even further to the average 
time it takes to unload one door. This data concluded that the unloading system was very inefficient and can be 
improved. The group proposed the installation of a loading dock to increase the efficiency in terms of productive time 
of the unloading facility while ensuring employees’ safety. A simulation model was created that predicted the loading 
dock would indeed be more efficient. Lastly, the Payback Period, Benefit-Cost Ratio, Net Present Value, and Internal 
Rate of Return for the loading dock were estimated which justifies the economic aspect of the investment for a new 
loading dock. The improvement of safety that the loading dock would bring plus the simulation predicting its increased 
efficiency justifies its construction.  
 
A loading dock would have a tremendous impact on the facility. Safety would be the first benefit of installing a loading 
dock. In the current procedure for unloading the doors, safety is a big issue when it comes to this weekly task. Installing 
a loading dock would increase the safety of the employees. Instead of unloading the doors into a rack, the employee 
would now be able to come straight off the truck into the shed. This would keep the employee from wearing a harness 
and the doors being unloaded from the truck in a much safer manner. 
 
Another benefit of installing a loading dock would be more time to organize. Currently, as the doors are unloaded 
from the truck and into the rack, the rack is either placed in a random location in the shed or the doors are unloaded 
onto a previous stack of doors. Many of the doors are either spread out from their order or buried from the doors that 
are being received. Installing a loading dock would allow the employees to find a designated spot for the incoming 
doors and additional space for the racks to be placed in an organized manner. This would save stagers a great amount 
of time looking for the doors when gathering a delivery. Organizing the doors would allow stagers to find and gather 
the doors into a rack in a timely manner to be sent on delivery. The third benefit of installing a loading dock would be 
allowing another stager to use a forklift. As of now, one forklift is used to unload the doors. This causes one stager to 
give up his use of a forklift. This results in a delay in gathering loads. It is a stager’s job at the facility to gather the 
materials for deliveries for the next day. Without a forklift, a stager cannot gather materials which could result in a 
delay in deliveries. Installing this dock would allow the stagers to continue gathering materials, while also allowing 
one employee to unload the doors.

Abstract 
Industry customers have increasingly demanded requirements related to cultural transformation. To meet this demand, 
according to the authors of the area of strategic operations management, it would not be necessary a tool to be applied 
by the industry, but a change in the mindset of those who work there. Among the necessary skills, within the context 
of industry 4.0 work, and mentioned in several articles, soft-skills stand out. Skills such as problem solving, flexibility 
and ideation are indicated as keys to an effective implementation. This article aims to bring the result of a case study 
for the implementation of a cultural adjustment program in an intralogistics automation company in the southern 
region of Brazil. This program seeks to improve all the company's departments, but with a focus on operations, thus 
also improving the company' s competitiveness in its area of operation. for this case study, questions were elaborated 
for alignment and verification of which best practices to be adopted in a team for the effective implementation of the 
cultural transformation program. Questions to be answered by collaborators, supervisors, managers and directors. The 
intention of this study is to elaborate a cultural transformation implementation plan with a period of up to 3 years. 
With this study, some conclusions will be found, such as people and key competencies for the implementation of 
cultural transformation, which will be directly associated with an improvement in the performance of operations.

Abstract 
Pesisir Selatan District is located on the coast, with a coastline of 218 kilometers. The topography consists of plains, 
mountains and hills. The expansion of agricultural areas in Pesisir Selatan District has an important meaning given 
the limited land for agricultural cultivation in the area. The water level will fluctuate due to the influence of the 
season and rainfall, where during the rainy season the soil is flooded and during the dry season it will recede, so that 
plant commodities to be developed must pay attention to their adaptability to groundwater depth. This research aims 
to support government programs in reclamation of agricultural land in an effort to maximize the function of lebak 
swamplands. Primary data includes groundwater and water in canals, temperature, soil physical properties, and 
rainfall. The analysis used is an analysis of the relationship between rainfall, temperature, soil physical properties, 
and the water level in the canal to fluctuations in the groundwater level. The results of the analysis show that 
temperature, rainfall, soil conductivity, and the rise and fall of the water level in the canal have an effect on the rise 
and fall of the groundwater level.  Dynamic model in water management can be used as a guideline for the use of 
lebak swamp land during the Covid-19 pandemic. The potential for utilizing lebak swamp land as an alternative for 
future land through the concept of optimizing land resources is carried out with an integrated farming system that is 
environmentally friendly.

1. Introduction
Wetlands in Indonesia have an important role where the prospect of expanding irrigated land will lead to natural 
wetlands, especially swamplands, both tidal swamps and lowland swamps (Adimihardja, 2017). Swamp is a natural 
pool of water that occurs continuously or seasonally due to blockage of natural drainage and has special physical, 
chemical and biological properties (Nursyamsi, 2014). Swamps in Indonesia are mostly located in Sumatra, 
Kalimantan and Papua. Lebak swamp land is an alternative land that can be used for agriculture. The use of lebak 
swamp land is a strategy, given the narrowing of agricultural land due to the conversion of paddy fields and the 
increasing demand for food and other agricultural products due to the growing population (Balitbangtan, 2014). 
Swamp Lebak is an inland swamp whose topography is relatively concave and water cannot flow out (Alihamsyah, 
2014). This land experiences inundation every year for at least three months with a minimum inundation height of 
50 cm (Masganti, et.al.,2013). During the rainy season the ground is flooded and recedes during the dry season. 
Therefore, lebak swamps are depression areas where the main source of water comes from rainfall and tides during 
the dry season (Subagjo, 2006). According to Government Regulation Number 73 of 2013 concerning Swamps, in 
Article 5 paragraph 2 what is meant by lebak swamps are swamps that are located far from the coast and are 
inundated due to overflowing river water or rainwater that stagnates periodically or continuously. 
Pesisir Selatan District is located on the coast, with a coastline of 218 kilometers. Its topography consists of 
plateaus, mountains, and hills. The majority of swamps in Pesisir Selatan district are idle lands because almost all of 
them are overgrown with swamp grass and shrubs. The expansion of agricultural areas in lebak swamps in West 
Sumatra has a very important meaning given the limited land for agricultural cultivation in this area. Most of these 
swamps are formed on the Pesisir Selatan of West Sumatra with physiographic conditions consisting of allivual

it is necessary to make guidelines or guidelines regarding the operation of floodgates in tertiary canals. Further 
research on water control building system engineering in tertiary canals can improve the models and techniques 
that have been developed in this study. 
It is necessary to reaffirm the potential and opportunities for utilizing lebak swamp land as an alternative land for 
the future. It is necessary to build public awareness of the importance of developing lebak swamplands in a 
sustainable manner. Optimization of land resources is carried out with an appropriate, innovative, integrated and 
sustainable system with the concept of an environmentally friendly integrated farming system. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The expansion of agricultural areas in Pesisir Selatan District has an important meaning given the limited land for 
agricultural cultivation in the area. The alternative to lebak swamp land is a solution for future agricultural land in 
Pesisir Selatan District. The temperature at the study site ranges from 260C – 350C, with a maximum rainfall of 258 
mm/day. The soil in the research location is a type of clay which means it is very good for agricultural land. Rainfall 
and temperature affect fluctuations in the groundwater table. Groundwater level fluctuations are affected by 
hydraulic conductivity and water level fluctuations in canals. The relationship between the rise in the water level in 
the canals and the rise in the groundwater level is linear, where if the water level in the canals rises, the groundwater 
level will also rise and vice versa. The modeling simulation results show that the model can predict well the depth of 
the groundwater table at the study site with an average value of the coefficient of determination of 87.8%, and 
groundwater level control can be done by adjusting the water level in the tertiary channel. 
 
 The approach taken in the development of lebak swamp land refers to land typologies, where each land 
typology requires different management methods. Dynamic water flow management is the key to the successful use 
of lebak swamp land for agriculture during the Covid-19 period. The potential and opportunities for utilizing lebak 
swamp land need to be developed as an alternative for future agricultural land. Optimization of lebak swamp land 
resources is carried out with an innovative, integrated, agribusiness and sustainable system through the concept of 
an environmentally friendly integrated farming system.

Abstract 
The rapid growth of solar energy installations worldwide calls for innovative solutions to optimize the operations and 
maintenance (O&M) activities in solar energy farms, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the economic outlook of 
solar power. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring the merit of emerging technologies such as 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) in driving smart O&M decisions for solar 
photovoltaic (PV) systems. Towards this goal, this paper presents a UAV-enabled, AI-powered framework to 
automate solar energy asset monitoring and fault detection. First, an experimental testbed has been set up at the Energy 
Lab at Rutgers University – New Brunswick, wherein a UAV is flown over an operational PV system to collect real-
time, high-resolution aerial images of the solar panels under various operational and weather conditions. Then, a deep-
learning (DL)-based framework is proposed to extract relevant features from the processed UAV images, which are 
then combined with exogenous weather parameters, in order to make a decision on the health status of the solar panel 
under inspection. Our extensive experiments on two prevalent fault modes, namely snow accumulation and shading, 
suggest that our proposed approach can effectively identify the occurrence of such defects in solar panels, with up to 
95.6% accuracy, while maintaining a sensible balance between false and missed alarms. Our framework serves as a 
testament to the merit of combining UAV-enabled data acquisition with emerging AI technologies in order to automate 
and optimize O&M activities and asset management in solar farms.

1. Introduction
The growing demand for clean energy has led to an increased adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems worldwide. 
By the end of 2022, the global installed cumulative capacity of solar PV systems has reached 1,185 GW, of which 
240 GW have been commissioned in 2022 alone—an increase of 37% relative to 2021 (International Energy Agency, 
2023). With such rapid expansion in scale and sophistication, there is an imminent need for effective solutions and 
technologies that can lower the operations and maintenance (O&M) costs in solar energy farms, and ultimately 
enhance the economic outlook of solar power.     
To achieve this vision, there has been a growing interest in exploring the merit of emerging technologies such as 
robotics, automation, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in optimizing O&M operations. Equipped with advanced 
imaging capabilities, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), colloquially known as drones, can provide a cost-effective 
solution to the inspection and monitoring of solar PV installations. Drones offer unparalleled advantages for 
conducting aerial inspections, allowing for remote, rapid, and detailed assessments of solar PV systems. By leveraging 
UAVs, solar asset operators can reduce inspection time, improve their fault diagnostic analyses, and significantly 
reduce the required resources and costs associated with manual inspections. A recent BloombergNEF report suggests 
that UAVs can cut down solar project inspection costs to as low as $302/MW/year, compared to $1,590/MW/year for 
traditional or manual inspection (Bullard, 2018).  
In parallel, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have recently demonstrated remarkable potential in 
several environmental applications, including but not limited to the renewable energy sector (Rolnick et al., 2022). 
According to a recent report, AI/ML technologies are expected to contribute towards lowering global greenhouse gas 
emissions by as much as 4% by 2030, which is roughly equivalent to 2.4 Gigatons of CO2 emissions (Herweijer et al., 
2020). Examples of emerging applications where AI/ML can have an outsized impact in the renewable energy sector

fault occurrences in solar PV systems. Tested on a large number of testing samples, our proposed deep-learning-based 
approach, has been shown to effectively pinpoint prevalent fault modes in solar modules, while maintaining a sensible 
balance between false and missed alarms. Our proposed framework serves as an exemplar of the successful integration 
of emerging technologies such as UAVs and AI in offering a promising avenue for optimizing O&M activities in solar 
energy farms, thereby contributing to the wider adoption of solar power as a clean energy source.  
This work opens the door for several interesting questions and potential extensions. As a case in point, it would be 
worth it to consider both visual and thermal imaging modes for the UAV. Thermal images can provide richer 
information, especially in regard to localizing snow- and overheating-related defects. In terms of methodology, we 
would like to explore (and potentially hybridize) various image-based ML approaches, including those based on graph-
theoretic methods (Ezzat et al., 2021) or more advanced DL architectures (Xie et al, 2017). Finally, extending the 
proposed approach to include a larger number of fault modes such as cracks, dust, snail trails, hot spots, among others, 
is currently under investigation by the research team.

Abstract 
For the creation of intricate metal parts, additive manufacturing, notably laser powder fusion bed (LPFB) technology 
processed 17%Cr-4%Ni Precipitation Hardened (P.H) steel. The samples were printed in three directions (horizontal 
(0o), vertical (90o) and inclined (45o) in the build platform using DMLS system (EOS M 290) machine. 17%Cr-
4%NiP.H steel samples were given heat treatment for 900°C @ 1 Hour, 925°C @ 4 Hours, 1025°C @ 1 Hour, has 
attracted a lot of interest recently. Many industries employ stainless steel because of its high mechanical and corrosion 
resistant qualities. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge on the wear behaviour of stainless steel produced 
employing LPFB, especially following heat-treatment procedures. The purpose of this study is to ascertain how heat 
treatment affects the LPFB-printed stainless steels wear characteristics. Commercial LPFB equipment was used to 
produce the stainless-steel specimens, which were then put through several heat-treatment processes. The ideal 
qualities of the printed stainless steel were ensured by carefully choosing the heat-treatment parameters, including 
temperature and time. Using a pin-on-disk tribometer, the wear behaviour of the heat-treated stainless-steel specimens 
was assessed. Under varied orientation of specimens(pin) situations, the tribological parameters, including coefficient 
of friction and wear rate, were measured. The wear processes and surface texture of the worn surfaces were further 
studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). According to preliminary findings, heat treatment has a substantial 
impact on the wear behaviour of stainless steel printed using LPFB. It was found that 1025°C @ 1 Hour settings 
enhanced the printed stainless steels wear resistance, resulting in a lower friction coefficient and wear rate. According 
to SEM examination, heat-treated specimens had a more refined microstructure and better surface integrity, which 
helped to improve wear performance. 
This study sheds important light on how heat treatment affects the LPFB-printed stainless steel's wear characteristics. 
The findings help to improve the post-processing methods used in the additive manufacture of stainless-steel 
components in order to increase their resistance to wear and lengthen their useful lives in demanding applications. The 
sectors involved in additive manufacturing and other fields can benefit from the information gleaned from this study.

Introduction:
Additive manufacturing, often known as 3D printing, has transformed the manufacturing business by allowing for the 
precise creation of complicated shapes. One of the most extensively utilised additive manufacturing methods, laser 
powder fusion bed (LPFB), is capable of generating metallic components with outstanding mechanical 
qualities(Mellor et al., 2014; Yan & Gu, 1996). With its improved corrosion resistance and mechanical properties,

to vertical orientations. The inclined orientation often shows intermediate wear behavior. However, the effect of heat-
treatment on wear behavior may vary depending on the orientation. 
Overall, heat-treatment at 900°C @ 1 hour and 925°C @ 4 hours has shown promising results in terms of improving 
wear resistance, reducing the coefficient of friction, and enhancing surface roughness of the stainless steel printed 
using LPFB. However, the effects of heat-treatment can depend on various factors, including the specific heat-
treatment parameters, the composition of the stainless steel, and the intended application. 
In closing, the findings of this study indicate that as-built samples show more wear loss, and hence cannot be used 
directly in application without post processing.Wang, T et.al. 2015.

Abstract 
In 2011, the German government introduced ""Industry 4.0"" as part of its high-tech strategy to maintain the 
competitiveness of the country's manufacturing sector and meet new challenges. This fourth industrial revolution relies 
on the Internet of Things (IoT), new technological advancements, real-time data transmission between products, 
customers, and manufacturing facilities, and the blending of virtual and physical worlds. End-to-end engineering and 
the integration of information and communication technologies are considered fundamental concepts and significant 
advancements in Industry 4.0. While the business sector plays a vital role in economic growth, the introduction of new 
technology and increased product and production complexity impact industrial companies and their workers. Critics 
of Industry 4.0 emphasize its technocratic focus on digitalization and new technology, despite its potential to increase 
economic values, competitiveness, productivity, and revenue growth. The integration of Industry 4.0 impacts all 
corporate operations, from purchasing and production to customer management, leading to significant changes in 
processes, communication, and relationships. Industry 4.0 introduces uncertainties, hazards, feedback cycles, and 
dynamics that pose challenges to modern production and logistics systems, supply chains, and Industry 4.0 networks. 
This study critically examines current applications and classifications of Industry 4.0 and proposes potential directions 
for future research. It suggests that interdisciplinary supply chain optimization methodologies must continue evolving, 
and collaboration between supply chain specialists and control engineers could enhance the realism of dynamic 
planning and modeling and the efficiency of supply chains, Industry 4.0 networks, and production and logistics 
systems. Lastly, this study examines developments in digital supply chain management and the trend toward the 
intellectualization of Industry 4.0.

1. Introduction
Researchers and practitioners are driven to develop strategies and supply chain capabilities that address the challenges 
and contribute to achieving sustainable development goals, driven by the increasing concern for sustainability. It is 
essential to establish a comprehensive model that facilitates understanding the interrelationships between supply chain 
practices, Industry 4.0 technology, and supply chain performance metrics. Consequently, this study examines the 
impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on supply chain management strategies and supply chain performance indicators. 
Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized for data analysis. This study makes several contributions. Firstly, 
the findings demonstrate that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technology is influenced by supply chain management 
techniques. Secondly, the results indicate significant improvements in supply chain performance metrics due to 
Industry 4.0 technologies. Moreover, Industry 4.0 technology mediates the relationship between supply chain 
management techniques and supply chain performance measurements. The outcomes also offer valuable insights into 
the underlying principles for the successful adoption and effective utilization of Industry 4.0 technologies. The ecology 
of supply chains (SCs) is recognized as the foundation for societal, economic, and environmental development. It 
relies heavily on the interactions and feedback among the various entities within SCs, as well as society, the economy, 
and nature (Ivanov et al., 2021a; Ivanov et al., 2021b). 
Industry 4.0 emphasizes the integration of cutting-edge technologies into business and supply chain activities, 
resulting in a more resilient supply chain, particularly in terms of disruptions. Among the most challenging disruptions

Management, Houston, Texas, USA, June 13-16, 2023 
 
 
 
Further research can expand on this framework by examining the application of Industry 4.0 tools in different sectors 
and geographical areas. The study acknowledges that only a few Industry 4.0 tools were explored, and future research 
could investigate the broader utilization of technologies such as additive manufacturing, augmented reality, and 
autonomous robots at various supply chain levels. Industry 4.0 is a new phenomenon that requires coordination and 
connectivity across organizational boundaries, providing opportunities to investigate relationship dynamics within this 
larger phenomenon. It is also crucial to examine the technological capabilities and cooperation history of partnering 
companies. By considering these factors and conducting further research, a deeper understanding of Industry 4.0 and 
its implications for supply chains can be achieved, leading to more effective and innovative implementations in the 
future.

Abstract 
The construction industry plays a pivotal role in the development of the country but does this does not mean the 
construction industry is immune to challenges. This paper examines the challenges facing the performance of South 
African construction industry. Furthermore, this paper seeks to disclose the most fundamental challenge that affect 
the progress, performance and growth of the construction industry. There are a few challenges that influence the 
performance of the South African construction industry. The study focused on assessing the challenges based available 
literature and on user perspective in order to improve the performance of the construction industry.  
A survey will be undertaken based on previous literature among construction professionals. The research will enhance 
the body of knowledge about a way forward in producing an effective performance within the construction industry.

1. Introduction
The construction industry is vital to the South African economy and an important component to growth in the economy 
(CIDB, 2012; Stats SA, 2010; Windapo and Cattell, 2013). The is no doubt about this as Dlamini (2012) subscribe by 
saying this is evident in the production of much necessary infrastructure for economic growth and 
development, construction productivity, and citizen well-being. Ofori (2007) and the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization, according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization UNIDO (2009), 
the construction industry is an important field of the economy that produces building and civil engineering structures 
and establishes the degree to which investment efforts in a resource-rich country translate into investment outcomes. 
Construction contributes drastically to the national economy, creates jobs (particularly for the least skilled members 
of society), aids in the development and transfer of technology, provides numerous business opportunities and directly 
contributes to the improvement of the quality of life of its customers (Windapo and Cattell, 2013). The relevance of 
the construction industry in any country ’s economic growth, its capacity to offer employment and consume materials 
(both raw and finished), and its relevance as a potential determinant have made it acceptable to study the challenges 
it faces and propose solutions for its viability (Cattell, 2010). 
The South African construction industry, like many other construction industries in other developing countries, is 
challenged by many systemic problems (Rwelamila, 2020).  According to Ofori (2007), the list of challenges 
confronting the construction industry in developing countries is well known include unstable and insecure 
employment, as well as financial instability. According to Windapo and Cattell (2013), even though some of the 
1439","Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

building materials. In a study by Dithebe et al., (2018) the outcomes, together with the literature reviewed, place a 
strong focus on the significance and influence of building material costs on the performance of the construction 
industry. According to Raftery et al., (1998), global participation and engagements with international corporations 
could significantly improve the performance of the South African construction industry; the findings are directly in 
consensus that global integration is vital in the construction industry.  
In study by Dithebe et al., (2018) the finding were in accord with findings of Van wyk (2004) that the South African 
government's failure to properly finance construction projects has an impact on the construction industry's 
performance. This includes the government (client) failure to compensate contractors for work done, which has an 
influence on the development of small and arising construction companies. 
On public sector the survey by Windapo and Cattell (2013) were not found to be coherent with Milford's (2010) 
observations, which posit that contractors should have viewed public-sector capacity, in terms of financial capital, as 
a significant challenge to contractor performance in the construction industry. According to Milford, this challenge 
may be to blame for the malfunction of many construction companies. As Robertson (2010) have said contractors may 
not see this lack of public-sector capacity as a challenge since most companies have never obtained contracts from the 
state. 
6. Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to investigating challenges facing the performance of South African construction 
industry. The reviewed literature revealed that increase in the cost of building materials, mismatch between available 
skills and required skills, high interest rates and availability of infrastructure. Based on the research findings, in order 
to determine a method of dealing with the challenges facing the performance of South African construction industry, 
the CIDB should support the construction industry by making sure that every imported material can also be produced 
locally to eliminate importing cost and other factors that influence the prices. 
One of the problems that the construction has is the preference of experienced skilled labors over the employment of 
skilled labor. In improving the situation of shortage of skilled labors, it is important that the construction industry 
should consider employing unexperienced skilled labors under the supervision of experienced skilled labor in order 
to train the unexperienced skilled laborers. Lastly more research is required on the mitigation of interest rate so that 
most people can afford.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution brings a diversity of changes in the globe including the education sector and the 
industries. Education sector is ready to implement new technologies, although the technology efficiency and the 
changes that comes with the fourth industrial revolution are not well documented in this sector. There is a debate that 
lecturers and students believe that technology advancement has the power to solve many problems related with the 
societal change in attitude and delivery of education. With that being-said, there is a need for higher education to adapt 
to the new technologies in order for them to fast track the benefits that comes with the 4IR. This paper employ an 
extensive literature reviews to drive the need for South African higher education institutions to harness 4IR in order 
to enhance existing educational infrastructure. Firstly, the aim of this study is to identify the challenges facing HEIs 
to 4IR adoption and to investigate the fourth industrial revolution game changers for higher education institutions in 
South Africa

1. Introduction
According to Manyika (2017), industry 4.0 plays a huge role in changing business models in education sector and 
industries. The purpose of industry 4.0 is to create a better future for higher education institutions and other sectors. 
According to Maigida, Saba & Namkere (2013), the world at large has no control over additional skills that comes 
with fourth industrial revolution. Instead, people expect better transformation arising with the fourth industrial 
revolution: fewer problems among designers and market places, the active part played by Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
accumulation of different technics, improved excellence of our lives (robotic) and combined lifespan (Internet). 4IR 
will need the world to produce innovative employees, an informative employee, and future industry leaders’ need to 
adapt to new expertise sets towards conveying the benefits of 4IR. They must be critical thinkers, communicative and 
deliver ambitious leadership (Gray, 2016). Alex Gray (2016) believed that “Change won’t wait for us: business 
leaders, educators and governments all need to be proactive in up-skilling and retraining people so that everyone in 
higher education institutions can benefit from the Fourth Industrial Revolution”. HEIs need to adapt to 4IR, since 
there is limited implementation of 4IR in HEIs, training is noticeably low, and its effectiveness is not well recognized 
in the education sector (Tymon (2013) and Wang (2008). Tymon (2013), and Wang (2008), went on to say that, the 
initial point on understanding the roles and relevance of 4IR in accelerating education and learning practices is to have 
enough knowledge of diverse constituents of 4IR. Tymon (2013), further stated even though there is a diversity of 
technologies that can be used in facilitating teaching and learning but the education sector, is lagging behind when it 
comes to accepting technology for teaching and learning. Some of the reasons given as problems in the acceptance of 
new technology in the education sector are the issues of high costs and the lack of training.

portraying poverty as well as unemployment. Additionally, Heaven (2017), further stated that students might become 
more passionate about helping others work out sympathetic visualization over seeing and putting themselves in the 
shoes of vulnerable others. 
 
4.1.4 Emerging technology breakthroughs 
Schwab (2016), demonstrated that industry 4.0, commonly depicted as 4IR, the conception has knowingly changed 
the numerous ways universities in South Africa look and intends to discourse their institutional practices, particularly, 
education and learning meetings. Furthermore, Schwab’s (2016) pointed out that a “new technology” revolution that 
would convert the way humans interrelate in the globe today is stimulated by “emerging technology breakthroughs, 
covering wide-ranging fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) robotics, the internet of things (IoT) autonomous 
vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum computing”.  
 
5. Conclusions  
A review of the literature indicates that higher education institutions in South Africa is being transformed from the 
traditional monodisciplinary trajectory which entails narrowing the perspective and focus of one as they go further 
with their studies towards a multidisciplinary approach because of the advances in technology brought by the 4IR. 
This study reviewed a literature on challenges facing HEIs adopting 4IR such as minimal integration of technology in 
classrooms, the important of upskilling the knowledge of 4IR on lecturers and students, the important of training and 
development programs within the HEIs etc. The study further reviewed literature on how the 4IR would change the 
HEIs for better if implemented effectively, the solution was developing technology breakthroughs, bringing education 
concept to life, reasonable implementation of e-learning, sharing of resourcing and collaborative learning etc. In order 
for students to achieve excellent academic results, the universities must take into consideration the implementation of 
4IR technologies.

Abstract 
The adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution in education has greatly enhanced the achievement and retention of 
information. Although there have been greatest challenges in the implementation of Fourth Industrial Revolution 
within universities in emerging countries in this days and ages, hence it is necessary for higher education institutions 
in developing countries to adopt 4IR for amending inadequate educational infrastructure within the universities. This 
purpose of this article is to determine the barriers hindering the effective implementation of industry 4.0 in higher education 
institutions amongst developing. The findings of the study suggest that not only does the education sector in emerging 
countries face a number of challenges in adopting 4IR but also the need for government to invest in development of 
infrastructure to help enhance the education system. The data used in this research were derived from both primary and 
secondary sources. The secondary data was collected through a detailed review of extant literature. In contrast, the 
primary data was collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to Gauteng province students currently 
registered within the universities. Two hundred and two (202) questionnaires were received from the two hundred and 
fifty (250) sent out, representing an 81% response rate. In ensuring the reliability of the research questionnaire, 
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient reliability was conducted on the scaled research questions. Findings from the research 
were analysed using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Research findings were revealed as 
per related categories. For the barriers hindering the effective implementation of industry 4.0, findings revealed the 
following categories: lack of proportion in teaching & technology, inadequate funding of universities, poor network 
connectivity in some areas & basic understanding of the usage of mobile devices, lack of communication between 
stakeholders within the university, poor political interference of SRC, poor information & communication technology 
application approach, inadequate information & communication technology expertise and practice and not enough 
staff to operate the systems in universities. Since it has been identified beyond reasonable doubt that HEIs are 
encompassed with challenges centered on inadequacy in educational infrastructure and, arguably, skilled personnel, 
4IR is therefore required.

4.3 Interpretation of Results  
In the findings, the categories of educational infrastructure and its challenged in adopting 4IR for their activities in 
Gauteng higher education institutions. The respondents indicate that staff members & students are both not 
technologically perceptive detailing with 1.263 standard deviation in category-2, 4IR infrastructure not amended with 
1.266 standard deviation has the greatest challenge. In category-3, the stakeholders of the university tend to ignore 
information & communication technologies developing resilient secondary materials markets with 1.279 standard 
deviation has the greatest impact. In categogy-4, Students are overcrowded in classrooms with 1.391 standard 
deviation has the greatest challenge of the implementation of 4IR within higher education institutions. In category-5 
Poor information & communication technology application approach with 1.249 standard deviation. In category-6, 
not enough staff to operate the systems in universities 1.168 standard deviation. in category-7, High costs of 
information & communication technology services with 1.198 standard deviation.  In category-8, Poor network 
connectivity in some areas & basic understanding of usage of mobile devices with 1.116 standard deviation. In 
category-9, Absence of community responsiveness & involvement with 1.191 standard deviation. In category-10, 
Inadequate information & communication technology expertise and practice with 1.209 standard deviation. In 
category-11, Limited university resources with 1.427 standard deviation has the greatest challenge in the adoption of 
4IR in developing countries. In category-12, Inadequate funding of universities with 1.159 standard deviation. In 
category-13, Lack of proportion in teaching & technology with 1.128 standard deviation. In category-14, Lack of 
communication between stakeholders within the university with 1.126 standard deviation and in category-15, Poor 
political interference of SRC with1.237 standard deviations. The indicator-1 is considered the indicator having the 
greatest impact in the adoption of 4IR. Therefore, such challenge is considered the greatest hindrance for higher 
education institutions in the adoption of 4IR for their activities. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The 4IR is the latest industrial revolution, with an increased focus on ICT, technological advancement, innovation, 
and creativity. An overview of the 4IR were identiﬁed in this article, namely big data, AI, robotics, ICT, 3D printing, 
and quantum computing. A number of challenges were identiﬁed which affect the implementation of 4IR within higher 
education institutions such as staff members & students not technologically savvy, 4IR infrastructure not amended, 
students are overcrowded in classrooms, Lack of communication between stakeholders within the university, lack of 
proportion in teaching & technology, High costs of information & communication technology services, Limited 
university resources etc. The 4IR offers, among others, a greater opportunity for participation in the digital economy 
and collaborative partnership.

Abstract 
Contemporary cities have taken up efforts to decarbonize urban mobility which has led to a growth in electric 
vehicles and investment in new renewable energy opportunities. The current transport sector contributes to 
greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. This has led to a growth in studies to develop a 
reservoir of knowledge on sustainable mobility to address this challenge. The global shift towards electric vehicles 
has provided greater energy efficiency as part of the global climate change mitigation strategies, however, electric 
vehicles are not widely adopted in developing countries due to factors such as insufficient charging stations. 
Globally this shift to electric vehicles and the spatial distribution of  charging stations has been informed by the 
private sector. This has led to city authorities to be reactive to the implementation of electric vehicle and its charging 
infrastructure. There is hence a need to assess the readiness of spatial planning to facilitate the transition towards 
electric vehicles and its infrastructure. Given this emerging trend in urban mobility transition, there have been lack 
of proactive policy initiatives to inform the adoption of electric vehicles. Using a qualitative research approach this 
study unpacks the adoption of electric vehicles from urban spatial planning perspective. Fifteen participants from 
the city of Tshwane were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. The participants were selected 
using snowball sampling and purposive sampling. Content analysis was used to develop themes. Findings of the 
study reveal areas where the charging infrastructure is placed, as these can be found in public spaces such as 
shopping malls and office parks in the city of Tshwane. The implications of the study are creation of a reservoir on 
knowledge to inform plans for developing countries such as South Africa to integrate spatial distribution of 
charging stations with sustainable mobility initiatives. Future studies should develop a framework to inform the 
broader aspects of spatial planning in relation to innovative sustainable transport systems.

Introduction
Contemporary cities have taken up efforts to decarbonize urban mobility which has led to a growth in electric vehicles 
and investment in new renewable energy opportunities. Scholars have articulated that emerging challenges in cities 
result from an increase in urbanization (Bayram and Bayhan, 2020). In developing countries these challenges provide 
an opportunity for cities to invest in new smart technologies to inform the transition towards sustainable urban growth 
and sustainable urban mobility (Banister, 2011). The role of technology in urban mobility is concerned with the aspects 
of sustainable and integrated smart urban mobility systems (Lyons, 2018). The global shift towards electric vehicles 
is progressing and centered around the concept of sustainable smart  urban mobility system (Faira et al. 2014). Electric 
vehicles include hybrid electric vehicles, plug in electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles (Nealer and 
Hendrickson, 2015).

Abstract 
Health Plan Price Transparency rules that became effective January 1, 2022 require most group health plan insurers 
to disclose reimbursement rates negotiated between insurers and providers. Using a small subset of this massive new 
data source, we characterize patterns of variation in rates negotiated between a large health insurance company and 
healthcare providers for office visits in Florida. Rates vary with location, specialty, and practice size and, importantly, 
with complex interactions among these factors. Rates are higher for larger providers, consistent with larger providers 
having more market power. Patterns of differences in rates across plans offered by the insurer with respect to 
moderating factors such as per capita income differ between larger and smaller providers, consistent with larger 
providers using their market power to engage in various forms of price discrimination. Considerable variation in rates 
remains after accounting for these factors in a highly parameterized model, some of which may be due to uncontrolled 
variation in provider quality. Our exploratory findings demonstrate the potential for this massive new dataset to 
facilitate a deeper understanding of the workings of healthcare markets, improving the knowledge base for policies 
aimed at controlling costs or improving quality or access. 
Keywords 
Healthcare spending, negotiated rates, market mechanisms, price transparency and health equity. 
1. Introduction
The challenge of delivering quality healthcare at an affordable price is an ongoing problem in the United States and 
has been for decades. The United States spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as comparable OECD 
(Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, and much of this is driven by higher prices 
paid by commercial health insurers (Cooper, 2019). The high and rising cost of commercial health care has led to 
premiums and deductibles for employer-sponsored coverage growing faster than wages and inflation. Commercial 
insurance pays higher prices than Medicare pays for comparable services and that gap is growing (CMS, 2019). 
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and based on studies published between 2010 and 2020, on 
average commercial insurers paid 129 percent of Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) prices for physician services. 
Solutions to problems that are not fully understood have little chance of success. The body of research that has been 
produced regarding details of the economic mechanism at work in determining how much commercial insurers pay 
providers for specific sorts of procedures is limited because this information has traditionally been considered trade 
secret. Such detailed data, on a large scale, is required to understand how healthcare markets function and how large 
any inefficiencies are that contribute to rising costs. Indeed, until we understand the market mechanisms, we can’t 
really define the problems at all. 
A massive new dataset that is just becoming available promises to allow new light to be shed in this area. Congress, 
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and 
several states have implemented laws and regulations related to price transparency and surprise billing in healthcare. 
The Hospital Price Transparency rule (45 C.F.R. Part 180) which became effective in December of 2020, after the 
resolution of litigation, requires all U.S. hospitals “to establish, update, and make public a list of the hospital's 
standard charges for items and services provided by the hospital.” (45 C.F.R. § 180.10). Where one parent company 
operates multiple hospitals that have disparate pricing, ""[e]ach hospital location operating under a single hospital 
license (or approval) ... must separately make public the standard charges applicable to that location."" (45 C.F.R. §

6. Conclusion 
We utilized a limited extract of data from a rich and massive newly available dataset on rates negotiated between 
insurers and medical practices to explore patterns or variation in rates across counties, specialties, practice sizes, and 
different plans representing different insured groups and provider networks. We find larger practice sizes are 
associated with higher rates, at least for the insurer examined herein. Moreover, we find that both specialty and 
location moderate differences in rates associated with variation in practice size across plans. We also find that even 
after controlling for county, specialty, practice size, and plan, tremendous variation in rates around the conditional 
expectation remains. 
 
There are many avenues for future work. We plan to pursue several of them in the future. First, we plan to expand 
the analysis to include more insurers and more states. Second, with the addition of extensive data from other insurers 
and other states, we should be able to conduct both analyses to confirm the patterns we found in this study and to 
further explore patterns of rate variations in response to other factors. Third, we plan to collect data on patient 
ratings of providers, provider outcomes, location specific measures of provider wages by specialty, and other such 
information in order to explain more of the variation in rates. 
 
Fourth, additional work is needed to differentiate between different plausible explanations of the patterns found in 
this exploratory analysis. For example, are rates higher for larger practices because they are able to offer higher 
quality due to the scope and scale of their operations, and thus face higher demand, or because they have more 
bargaining power? Or, similarly, do differences between the ways rates in larger and smaller practices adjust with 
differences in per capita incomes across counties and across plans arise from using market power to engage in price 
discrimination to extract more value from patients, or from differences in demand across locations due in part to 
income? 
 
The ability to exploit this new data source to provide rich characterizations of pricing patterns is promising. 
Moreover, this data may facilitate distinguishing between differing underlying causes of those patterns more 
rigorously, and with more generalizability, than has been possible in the past. Thus, continued analysis of this new 
dataset promises to greatly improve our understanding of healthcare markets and thereby our ability to design 
policies to control costs or improve outcomes, quality, and access.

Abstract 
This research explores the utilization of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in 
empirical archival research. PLS-SEM is a variant of SEM that has gained attention as an under-utilized method, 
particularly in the context of big data and secondary data analysis. The study highlights key considerations and 
implications when employing PLS-SEM in archival research. It emphasizes the importance of justifying the 
choice of PLS-SEM based on data characteristics and research goals, particularly when dealing with non-normal 
data distributions and limited theoretical foundations. The article provides practical guidance on model 
specification, data preparation, estimation, model evaluation, and reporting in PLS-SEM analysis. Additionally, 
the paper discusses the significance of reporting model fit indices, variable selection, and sample size estimation. 
The conclusion highlights the strengths and future research directions of PLS-SEM in archival research, including 
methodological advancements, integration with other statistical techniques, comparative studies, application in 
diverse fields, and the establishment of reporting guidelines. Overall, this research aims to enhance the 
understanding and application of PLS-SEM in the analysis of archival data, facilitating its wider adoption and 
contributing to empirical knowledge in various domains.

Introduction  
The emergence and concurrent exponential growth in the processing of secondary or archival research (used 
interchangeably) and big data have propelled the demand for techniques related to logging, advanced processing, 
and analysis of data records of the types (Angeli, Howard, Ma, Yang & Kirschner, 2017; Buczak & Guven, 2017; 
Ogiela, Ogiela & Ko, 2020; Xu, Jiang, Wang, Yuan & Ren, 2017). For example, over the past two decades, 
Lyytinen (2009) has emphasised the significance of data in developing information systems theory. Similarly, 
Ioannidis (2005) highlighted the prevalence of false research findings. While there have been two types of 
responses thus far, Rigdon (2016) emphasises the importance of selecting an appropriate modelling technique as 
an analytical method. 
Firstly, influenced by the exponential rise, various types of research studies have evolved. For instance, Xu et al. 
(2017) cautioned against the potential pitfalls of big data and its mining. Another example is Ogiela et al. (2020), 
who focused on intelligent data management in cloud computing. Meanwhile, in the domain of computer-assisted 
education, Angeli et al. (2017) questioned the extent to which data mining in educational technology classroom 
research could significantly contribute. Additionally, Buczak and Guven (2017) highlighted, in a survey on data 
mining and machine learning, the need for accurate communication survey methods. 
Secondly, despite the increasing use of PLS-SEM, there has been limited exploration, particularly in 
understanding and mining secondary or archival data (Antonakis, Bendahan, Jacquart & Lalive, 2010; Chang, 
Franke & Lee, 2016; Hair, Risher, Sarstedt & Ringle, 2019; Rigdon, 2016; Hampton, 2015). PLS-SEM is 
gradually gaining popularity in modelling structural relationships, particularly latent constructs and their observed 
variables. However, several factors have hindered its significant impact on big data, data mining, or secondary 
data. There are several reasons (Chang et al., 2016; Hair et al., 2015). For instance, although PLS-SEM has 
traditionally been used to establish causal-predictive relationships, the technique heavily relies on criteria to assess 
the explanatory power of the path model. What makes it more rigorous is the comprehensive examination of 
several quality criteria required by the technique. Some of the quality criteria that need better understanding 
include, but are not limited to, model fit, PLSpredict, cross-validated predictive ability test (CVPAT), and model 
selection criteria.

Overall, the practical implications emphasize the usefulness of PLS-SEM in addressing the challenges associated 
with underdeveloped theoretical foundations, limited sample sizes, and analyzing archival data. By leveraging the 
flexibility and robustness of PLS-SEM, researchers can gain valuable insights from their data and advance 
empirical knowledge in their respective fields. 
 
Conclusion and future research  
In conclusion, PLS-SEM offers a valuable methodological approach for conducting empirical research with 
archival data. It provides researchers with a flexible and robust technique to explore causal relationships, even in 
situations with limited theoretical foundations and small sample sizes. PLS-SEM's ability to handle non-normal 
data distributions and missing data further enhances its applicability in analyzing archival datasets. By following 
best practices in model specification, data preparation, and reporting, researchers can ensure the validity and 
reliability of their findings. 
However, there are several avenues for future research in using PLS-SEM in archival research: 
Methodological advancements: Further methodological developments can focus on refining the PLS-SEM 
technique for analyzing archival data. This could include addressing specific challenges associated with handling 
large and complex datasets, developing techniques for handling missing data more effectively, and improving 
model validation procedures. 
1. Integration of PLS-SEM with other statistical techniques: Exploring the integration of PLS-SEM with 
other statistical techniques can enhance the analysis of archival data. This may involve combining PLS-
SEM with advanced multivariate techniques or integrating it with machine learning approaches to gain 
deeper insights from complex datasets. 
2. Comparative studies: Comparative studies that compare the results obtained from PLS-SEM with other 
statistical techniques commonly used in archival research can provide insights into the strengths and 
limitations of PLS-SEM. This can help researchers determine the most appropriate analytical approach 
for their specific research questions and data characteristics. 
By addressing these future research directions, researchers can further enhance the application of PLS-SEM in 
archival research, broaden its scope of application, and contribute to the advancement of empirical knowledge in 
various disciplines.

Abstract 
Natural draft and forced draft chimneys are used in many industries to remove dust and dirt, hot gases, and air from 
the process side to the atmosphere. Among them, the natural draft chimney is operated because of temperature 
difference between process side and ambient which is known as buoyancy force or stack effect. The process of flow 
is continuous if the buoyancy or stack effect is present. Solar chimney is a natural draft chimney that is used to generate 
electricity from solar energy; therefore, solar chimney is also known as solar updraft system. It is an economical and 
environmentally friendly system to generate electricity. It is also used as ventilation for houses or passive cooling for 
space. There are numerous works that have been found which discuss the enhancement of solar chimney power plant 
efficiency. The work also includes the applications of solar chimney and feasibility study of hybrid systems. The 
researchers used experimental and simulation models for the study of solar chimney performance and its structural 
design. The performance of the solar chimney model is measured experimentally and theoretically at the presence and 
absence of cold inflow. It is found that cold inflow may reduce performance of the solar chimney by about 30 to 40%.

Abstract 
The health care system in Egypt is witnessing a complete reform with the aim of streamlining its supply chain to better 
serve the public. One of the challenging issues in the health care supply chain in Egypt is the demographic transition 
which shifted the age distribution in favor of an aging population. The percentage of adults over 60 in Egypt is 
increasing faster than that of any other age group. This consequently resulted in higher medical service demand in 
public hospitals. It was found that the absence of specialized pharmacies for the elderly patients in hospitals known 
as ‘geriatrics’ pharmacies, resulted in prescription errors and drug interactions. Therefore, this study aims to 
investigate the current status of the general pharmacies in public hospitals in Beni Swif governorate in Egypt, and 
exploring the opinions of pharmacists, doctors and patients in establishing specialized geriatrics pharmacies in public

1. Introduction
In the year 2016, Egypt launched its ‘Egypt vision 2030’ for development which adopted the sustainable development 
concept as a general framework to improve the quality of life of the present and future generations. Egypt vision 2030 
includes ten main pillars whereas the 6th pillar focuses on health. The vision for the ‘health’ pillar as stated in Egypt 
Vision 2030: “All Egyptians enjoy a healthy, safe, and secure life through an integrated, accessible, high quality, and 
universal healthcare system capable of improving health conditions through early intervention, and preventive 
coverage….this will lead to prosperity, welfare, happiness, as well as social and economic development, which will 
qualify Egypt to become a leader in the field of healthcare services and research in the Arab world and Africa”. 
Different successful health reform programs were executed in Egypt over the past few years which positively impacted 
the social and economic development and resulted in longer life expectancy and higher productivity (The center for 
global health and development 2023). Currently, Egypt’s population is 108,900,792 persons with an average annual 
growth rate of 1.5% (CAPMAS 2023). The percentage of adults over 60 in Egypt is increasing faster than that of any 
other age group. According to the latest statistics, the 65+ population is around 4,875,305 persons representing 5% of 
the total Egyptian population (CAPMAS 2023). This consequently resulted in higher medical service demand in public 
hospitals which suffer from limited resources. It was found that the absence of specialized pharmacies for the elderly 
patients in hospitals known as ‘geriatrics’ pharmacies, resulted in prescription errors and drug interactions, which 
affects the patient’s health and deplete the already limited resources. Therefore, this research attempts to investigate 
the role of geriatrics pharmacies in the health care supply chain and the impact it might have on the involved 
stakeholders.  
1.1 Objectives 
This research paper attempts to fulfill three main objectives: (1) to emphasize the role and importance of geriatrics 
pharmacies in Egypt’s healthcare supply chain (2) to investigate the stakeholders’ perspectives on establishing 
geriatrics pharmacies i.e. doctors, pharmacists and patients (3) to provide recommendations for establishing geriatrics 
pharmacies in public hospitals in Egypt.

As it is shown from Table 4, most responses indicate the need for establishing geriatrics pharmacies. The pharmacists 
agreed that the establishment of such pharmacies will add value to the hospitals and logistically support the process 
of service provision. Such pharmacies will achieve the logistics goals of providing the right drugs in the right quantities 
and conditions at the right time to geriatric patients. Achieving such goals will significantly reduce the occurrence of 
geriatric related problems that doctors have experienced in Table 3.  
 
The third questionnaire investigated the elderly patients’ opinions on the performance of current pharmacies in public 
hospitals and their views on establishing specialized geriatric pharmacies. Table 5 presents the findings of the elderly 
patients’ responses.

As it is shown in Table 5, most responses show that the presence of specialized geriatric pharmacies would allow for 
better follow-ups and consultations and improve the service provided to elderly patients. The specialized geriatric 
pharmacies would improve efficiency in terms of inventory management as patients will receive the right medications 
in the right quantities thus reducing waste that might result from prescribing conflicting medication.    
 
6. Conclusion  
This research investigated the status of the general pharmacies in public hospitals in Beni Swif governorate in Egypt 
as pharmacies being a significant link in the healthcare supply chain. Through exploring the perspectives of 
pharmacists, doctors and patients to establish specialized geriatrics pharmacies in public hospitals, the results showed 
309","Proceedings of the 8th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

that establishing such pharmacies would ensure the provision of a better medical service for the elderly and reduce 
prescription errors and drug interactions. This consequently would contribute to reducing waste and inventory costs 
in the health care supply chain. It can be concluded from this research that providing pharmacy services to geriatric 
patients requires a specialized approach in the health care supply chain that takes into consideration their unique needs 
and challenges. For instance, personalized care to geriatric patients is needed to understand their individual needs and 
medication regimens. This include providing medication counseling and education, monitoring for potential drug 
interactions and side effects, and developing medication management plans that are tailored to each patient's specific 
needs. Also, in terms of logistics, accessibility is very important. Geriatric pharmacies should ensure that their facilities 
are accessible to geriatric patients, including those with mobility issues or visual impairments. This can include 
installing wheelchair ramps, providing large-print labels and medication instructions, and offering home delivery 
services for patients who are unable to leave their homes. Moreover, pharmacies should prioritize effective 
communication with geriatric patients by providing clear and concise medication instructions, answering questions in 
a patient-friendly manner, and using plain language to explain potential side effects and drug interactions. 
Additionally, pharmacies should ensure that their staff members are trained to communicate effectively with geriatric 
patients, who may have hearing or cognitive impairments.

Abstract 
Pediatric intensive care units are prone to a variety of errors and risks. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a 
risk assessment and management method that evaluates the safety of patient care processes. The current study aims to 
identify and assess common medical errors in the pediatric intensive care unit (PCICU) at a cardiac pediatric centre 
in Egypt and identify the highest risk probability number (RPN), its root causes as well as recommended solutions. 
This descriptive analytic applied research was conducted from September 2022 to January 2023 in the PCICU of a 
cardiac pediatric centre in Upper Egypt to identify and assess medical errors and their effects qualitatively and 
quantitatively using FMEA through direct observations of the PCICU processes, brainstorming and interviews. For 
data collection, the FMEA standard worksheet was used to a purposive sample of 10 experts whose years of experience 
are more than 5 years. In this study, 3 key processes were selected: laboratory test, drug administration and infection 
control which included 13 activities. The research revealed 20 potential failure modes, their impacts were detected 
and recorded in the final worksheet of FMEA. According to the calculated RPNs, 8 potential failure modes with RPN 
> 65 were determined as high-risk failures. As a result, it is suggested that senior PCICU staff, doctors and senior
managers establish and promote a safety culture by forming multidisciplinary patient safety teams at the organizational 
and unit levels.

1. Introduction
It is no surprise that safety and risk management are among the most critical issues in health care. Safety is defined as 
freedom from risk and risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors 
affect risk. Awareness of these factors and a willingness to manage controllable risk by modifying health care workers 
behavior is essential to any safety and risk management goals. Risk is the “probability or threat of damage, injury, 
liability or loss, or any other negative occurrence that is caused by external or internal vulnerabilities, and that may be 
avoided by preemptive action” (Kavaler and Speigel 2018). Note that risk can be avoided by proactive measures 
and herein lies the important message that all stakeholders need to understand. Behavior modification can increase 
safety. This is due to the fact that safety and risk have an inverse relationship, when one increases, the other decreases. 
To increase safety, risk must be decreased (Röhsig et al. 2020).  
Risk management and the improvement of its process reliability are the issues which have become more important in 
production and operations management (Serino 2015). Risk assessment is an important tool in risk management to 
reduce project risks and achieve sustainable development (Kavaler and Speigel 2018). At present, the risk assessment 
is considered in planning and policymaking in most of the world countries. There are several techniques for identifying 
hazards and assessing risks. One of the most important of these techniques is failure modes and effects analysis (Serino 
2015). Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a practical tool to evaluate risks, discover failures in a proactive 
manner and propose corrective actions to reduce or eliminate potential risks (Bojic, 2019). Despite the use of this tool 
in many hospitals and health authorities, there are some hospitals in Egypt that still do not use this tool. In addition, 
there is a scarcity in empirical research that focuses on risk management and assessment in the Egyptian healthcare 
sector. Therefore, this research attempts to fill this gap by using the FMEA tool at cardiac pediatric center in Egypt.

had RPN score (100) whereas the root cause of failures was due to the lack of training to personnel and lack of standard 
facilities and equipment for performing procedures (Equipment).  
 
The results of the FMEA on the three previously presented processes demonstrated that despite the low detectability 
of errors, the RPNs were high, indicating that the physicians and nurses working in the studied PCICU were familiar 
with the potential errors and failure modes and could determine their causes quickly. Some methods such as FMEA, 
which are a preventive approach and are based on teamwork, can lead to the increase in the employees’ attention to 
the professional potential weaknesses and attempts to overcome them. The results of the present study indicate that 
taking timely decisions and performing appropriate procedures in the organizational levels are some solutions for 
reducing potential errors. The findings show the ability of FMEA to identify, evaluate, and analyze the errors in the 
sensitive and complex units such as PCICU. Therefore, it can be suggested that the senior managers and administrators 
who are key persons in the hospitals should create and promote a safety culture. It can be done by forming 
multidisciplinary teams of patient safety at organizational and unit levels. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, FMEA is a valuable tool for identifying potential failures and their effects, as well as developing and 
implementing effective risk mitigation strategies in healthcare organizations. FMEA can be used to evaluate and 
improve various healthcare processes, including patient safety, medication management, and infection control. By 
using FMEA, healthcare organizations can proactively identify risks and implement interventions to prevent negative 
outcomes, thereby improving patient safety and overall healthcare quality. However, healthcare organizations should 
be aware of the limitations of FMEA and ensure that it is used appropriately. FMEA is not a one-time fix but should 
be considered as part of a continuous quality improvement process. It is also important to involve all relevant 
stakeholders, including healthcare providers, patients, and families, in the FMEA process to ensure that all 
perspectives are considered. Overall, FMEA is a valuable tool in healthcare quality improvement and should be used 
as part of a comprehensive approach to patient safety and quality improvement.

Abstract 
Insulin is seen as an essential medication in high demand in the pharmaceutical industry. Optimizing the supply chain 
for insulin cannot be overstated to ensure patients have access to the medication they need and that the provider or 
supplier's costs can be managed efficiently. In order to ensure that patients have access to lifesaving medicines in a 
timely manner, the insulin supply chain (ISC) can be improved to become more efficient and effective. A semi-
structured interview method was used in this study to analyze the issue of enhancing the effectiveness of the ISC and 
reducing the presence of counterfeit drugs by interviewing seven participants from the pharmaceutical sector in Doha, 
Qatar. As a result of this study, four themes were identified. These were: 1) limitations in transporting insulin, 2) 
methods for ensuring the effectiveness of the supply chain, 3) the importance of adopting advanced traceability 
methods to ensure that insulin is transported efficiently, and 4) RFID as a way to ensure that insulin is transported 
safely and appropriately throughout the supply chain. Participants in the study indicated that radio frequency 
identification (RFID) in the cold chain for insulin increased its efficiency by increasing its effectiveness.

Abstract 
Anti-counterfeiting technologies have evolved over the past few years to combat and prevent counterfeiting incidents 
in the pharmaceutical and food sectors. It is worth noting that numerous studies have used different technologies to 
combat food and drug counterfeiting. The current systematic review evaluated these technologies' use, effectiveness, 
and how they could be used to eliminate food and drug counterfeiting. Several online databases were searched and 
retrieved for articles related to anti-counterfeiting technology for drugs and food and published literature from (2010 
to 2022). A thorough examination of the selected publications was done to extract useful information, including study 
design, the application of those technologies to combat counterfeiting of drugs and food, how those technologies are 
implemented, their effectiveness in fighting counterfeiting, evaluation outcomes, the country of study, the name of the 
author(s), as well as the publication year. In the study, 29 publications were selected and evaluated, with 22 (75.86%) 
dealing with anti-counterfeiting technologies related to drugs, 4 (13.79%) pertaining to anti-counterfeiting 
technologies related to food, while three (10.34%) dealt with both anti-counterfeiting technologies related to drugs 
and food. Blockchain technologies have mainly been used in the fight against counterfeiting, with the majority in 
China 8 (27.58%), and the highest number of reported studies was reported in 2021 (n=6; 20.68%), followed by 2016 
and 2012 (n=5; 17.24%). Several technologies have been used to detect food and drug counterfeiting in single studies, 
including serialization, SMS verification, RFID, and GSM. The conclusion has been reached that technological 
interventions have proven highly effective at combating drugs and food counterfeiting to a large degree. However, 
technological interventions against the counterfeiting of food were considerably lower than those against the 
counterfeiting of drugs. Thus, it is necessary to perform studies on highly effective technologies in order to uncover 
ways of preventing counterfeit foods, such as blockchain, QR codes, mobile authentication services, internet of things 
(IoT), laser, web-based, and 3D technologies. To help combat anti-counterfeiting through technologies, awareness, 
and knowledge about anti-counterfeiting technologies should be spread amongst the general public.

Abstract 
Diabetes type 1 patients require insulin, a life-saving and essential medication, to maintain their blood sugar levels 
below dangerous levels, which allows them to live everyday life. There are significant issues with insulin supply and 
affordability in the industry, and as a result, patients and their families face an enormous burden. The high prices of 
insulin and the lack of availability have led many people to turn to other options for purchasing insulin, such as online 
pharmacies, which may or may not be legitimate due to their high prices and lack of availability. While diabetics need 
safe insulin in their legitimate Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC), few researchers have considered implementing 
strategies to maximize patient safety when buying insulin in the legitimate Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC). This 
is why the current research is intended to bridge this gap and provide cohesive information on improving insulin safety 
through the process of overcoming this challenge. This study employs a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) 
model that combines Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) metrics, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and 
Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to develop a model that can prioritize and 
select the best criteria for maximizing insulin safety and achieving the study objective. There has been a comparison 
of two scenarios involving the insulin supply chain that has been carried out. As a result of this research, the integration 
of a traceability technology to the insulin supply chain, specifically blockchain (T42), in scenario 2 resulted in the best 
results for the supply chain for maximizing and ensuring the safety of insulin, as compared to scenario 1, where the 
final score was almost 71%. The research provided a valuable tool for assessing the safety of other critical goods that 
customers value in strategic and complex decision-making processes, enabling customers to make more informed 
decisions. Researchers, professionals, and decision-makers can benefit from the results of this research when they can 
use a rigorous scientific decision-support system to make informed decisions.

Abstract 
Over the past decade, supply chains and logistics operations have been increasingly targeted by public health measures 
concerning food quality and drug safety. This study systematically reviewed the existing literature to identify gaps in 
the study of food quality and drug safety, proposed solutions to these issues, and potential future research directions. 
A content analysis was employed in this study. The objectives of the review were to (1) Identify the factors that affect 
food quality and possible solutions to improve results, (2) Identify how to mitigate drug safety threats by implementing 
appropriate measures; and (3) Establish integrated supply chains for food and drugs by implementing modern 
technologies, which are followed by one another to ensure a multilayered cross-verification cascade and resource 
management at different phases to guarantee public health quality, safety, and sustainability. An analysis of the most 
recent trends and technologies used for ensuring food quality and drug safety has been conducted in this review. Two 
hundred-five articles were selected for study from 298 articles identified using appropriate keywords. Based on the 
available literature, all analyses and conclusions were made. This paper identifies research directions in public health 
and supply chain management.

Abstract 
In ESM service delivery, the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) process ensures that you identify, 
baseline, and maintain selected components of a complete IT service, system, or product as Configuration Items, and 
you control changes to them by requiring formal approvals. The demand for this level of accountability for 
managing IT infrastructure has steadily increased as dependency on CMDB as a single source of truth across all 
industries. 
With the advent of cloud computing, the traditional methods of configuration management Database (CMDB) 
implementations are no longer scalable as more IT servers are migrated to the cloud to meet the present demand. 
Community Colleges now must implement cloud-based Enterprise Service Management (ESM) solutions for their 
configuration management process implementation projects that also align with the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) 
framework. In this paper, we have taken a closer look at various cloud-based ESM solutions vendors and study 
cloud-based ESM adoption challenges and utilization of CMDB within New Jersey community colleges.  
We establish a theoretical background of cloud-based ESM solutions cybersecurity threats. We include a 
comprehensive analysis of the various security protocols like SAML authentication that various ESM vendors 
develop to counter Cybersecurity threats for cloud-based ESM implementation. We also provide develop a 
CMDB Selection Matrix Model (CSMM) that will be a useful model to mitigate Cybersecurity threats by 
ensuring the reviewed ESM system has strong protocols and encryption to protect against Cybersecurity threats 
in cloud ESM implementations. The main aim of this paper is to provide a tested model for configuration 
management implementation to ensure CM is impactful in reducing IT Service outages despite the increasing 
Cybersecurity threats.

Introduction
As late as 2019, with more than a decade of attempted Configuration Management Database (CMDB) 
implementations, we still have over 50% failure rates and very low implementations success rates. A 2014 article by 
Len Guddemi published on Forbes magazine titled “Why 85% Of Companies Fail at Creating Configuration 
Management Database (CMDB)” illustrates three reasons why the configuration management implementations 
failed including choice of tool, a tool’s security profile, and regular testing of a tool. In this paper, we will validate 
why configuration management implementation should be impactful to any organization in reducing IT Service 
outages despite the increasing Cybersecurity threats.

Conclusions 
From the literature review, there is a significant number of organizations that have struggled to implement suitable 
ESM software with sound configuration management module in this era of cloud computing. This research focused 
on developing a CMDB Selection Matrix Model that community colleges can use to help select a suitable cloud-based 
ESM system to be used for IT service delivery. 
 
The proposed process for ESM solution developed, reviewed, and analyzed entailed utilizing industry standard 
research from Forrester and Gartner as a starting point to short list ESM providers that were further be ranked based 
on our proposed CSMM model.  
 
With the many providers in the market and the Cyber security threats, utilizing a CSMM model as a starting point will 
provide several organizations with a tested solution to be able to make an informed decision. This would solve some 
of the challenges that face CMDB implementations, making the proposed solution very beneficial.

Abstract 
The intertwine between work demand (WD) and job autonomy (JA) as antecedent factors has long been subject to 
discussion with each new finding provides insights in balancing employee performance and well-being, especially in 
the short term. However, research on employee sustainable performance (ESuPer) with WD and JA as influencing 
factors has yet properly researched both quantitatively and qualitatively. Digital leadership (DL) on the other hand has 
becoming household jargon in the era of Industry 4.0 indicating the trend of leadership has already shifted into the 
facilitation of a more data-driven, flexible time, people-oriented, collaborative, and technology-savvy working 
environment. However, the moderation of DL within WD and JA towards ESuPer has not been addressed sufficiently. 
The goal of this paper is to propose theoretical foundation for the nexus of WD, JA, ESuPer, and DL, thus presenting 
a complete review of the references on the interdependence association of WD, JA, ESuPer, and DL. This paper 
provides insights for researchers as well for managers on what variables need to be considered when it comes to 
approximately similar interdependence.

1. Introduction
Generally, the interplay of WD and JA plays a significant role in job involvement (Lambert et al., 2022). Previous 
finding indicates such interplay also affect employee well-being, in which JA act as a core aspect stimulates personal 
growth and allows employee to achieve work goals regardless of the level of WDs (Simbula et al., 2012). However, 
there are trivial proportion of variance of job engagement in longitudinal analysis, which at some point excessive WD 
will trigger stress overload and eventually decrease overall performance (Bosmans, et al., 2019). ESuPer on the other 
side of the equation is a relatively new area in human factor field of research, latest empirical research on ESuPer is 
no older than 2017 which derived from Organisational Citizenship Behaviour theory (Jiang et al., 2017). ESuPer 
almost always correlated with team management and traditional leadership (Cizmaș et al., 2020; Sapta et al., 2021; Ji 
et al., 2021; W Dey et al., 2022), but no literature has ever mentioned its correlation with the new wave of leadership 
trend; digital leadership (DL).  
Recently, growing attention has been focused on DL as the catalyst of employee performance, moreover sustainably 
which is the basis of competitive and comparative advantage in digital economy (Malik and Raziq, 2022). DL receives 
great attention mostly in practitioner field (Buhse, 2014; Jenewein et al., 2016), there are only a handful companies 
reporting details about methods and strategies summarised under the hype of DL application (El Sawy, 2016). 
Furthermore, contrary to companies’ high interest in adopting DL in practice, DL seems to be a rarely discussed 
phenomenon in mainstream leadership research. To add more hassle to the empirical challenge, digital leadership 
unlike traditional leadership are built according to environment of the organisations’ are into (Morgan and 
Papadonikolaki, 2022), and when built appropriately, DL will facilitate innovation performance (Benitez et al., 2022), 
governance (Seaman, 2021), agility and transformation (Stepnov, 2021), self-organisation (Gierlich-Joas et al., 2020),

Abstract 
This research aims to apply Lean Manufacturing and TOC to increase productivity in a company in the hermetic 
windows sector. According to the diagnosis made by VSM, the company has a low productivity of 64.47%, identified 
in the cleaning and assembly processes. To solve the problem of low productivity, the 5 phases of TOC (Theory of 
constraints) are applied, implementing Lean Manufacturing tools within these phases, which increase productivity and 
reduce waste and time. We implement these tools to order and organize the operations area, minimizing processing 
times; on the other hand, the implementation of Standard Work is simulated to reduce process times by eliminating 
times that do not add value. For the simulation and validation of the proposed solution, the software Arena Version 
22 was used, increasing and obtaining productivity of 85%. 
Keywords 
Manufacturing,  Lean Manufacturing, TOC, Productivity. 
1. Introduction
Currently, having high levels of productivity is essential to be competitive.  Companies with high levels of productivity 
obtain more profit due to optimizing their processes and resource management.  Within the Lean philosophy, we 
consider waste to be downtime, unfulfilled orders, and raw material waste; because they generate costs (Mor et al., 
2019) (PAREDES-RODRIGUEZ, A. M., 2017). For the company, an increase in its productivity would increase its 
revenue and allow it to fulfill its orders, satisfying its customers. On the other hand, having a productivity deficit 
generates severe risks and consequences for the company.  From economic losses, delays and errors in production, 
failure to meet objectives, or the flight of their talent to other companies. 
The search for added value in the window market is becoming increasingly common. This added value would be 
acoustic insulation, thermal insulation, and energy saving. That is why, by 2025, we project the market for airtight 
windows to grow by 4.8%, increasing from USD 12.8 billion to USD 16.2 billion (NASDAQ OMX's News Release 
Distribution Channel, 2018). 
Using Lean tools in an aluminum window company, productivity increased by 23.12% (Villasana Martinez, M. M. et 
al., 2017). In addition, in a glass products packaging company, implementing lean tools eliminated overtime in the 
processes. As a result, in the following months, the expense was reduced to USD 161,088, USD 572,196, and USD 
0.00 (PAREDES-RODRIGUEZ, A. M., 2017).   
The research aims to apply the lean manufacturing methodology to increase productivity in the manufacturing process 
of airtight windows.  According to the successful results of the authors mentioned above, we will implement the 5S 
Standard Work tools following the TOC phases.  Furthermore, we used quality tools to determine the causes of the 
problem. The motivation is to generate a contribution in knowledge based on the results obtained. 
We will divide the investigation into five parts. The first chapter will be the introduction which will include the 
importance of research, analysis of the problem, and background. The second chapter will be the study's contribution 
explaining this investigation's proposal. In the third chapter, we will show the research results, followed by the fourth 
chapter, which will discuss the results. Finally, the fifth chapter of the research will be the investigation's conclusions. 
1.1 Objectives 
The main objectives of the study were to increase the productivity at the company; prove the efficiency of the 
engineering tools in the study and give the enterprise a process that can be used at any time.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, as we stated our main objective at the beginning of the investigation when implementing Lean 
manufacturing, using tools such as 5S and Standard Work, following the steps of the TOC methodology, we reduced 
times by 7,785 minutes per frame. Consequently, it was possible to increase the productivity of the process by 11.17%. 
Considering our secondary objectives, efficiency and effectiveness had to be optimized to increase productivity. Thus, 
by applying both tools, efficiency remained constant at 90%, and effectiveness increased by 12.52% 
Furthermore, by implementing the 5S tool, it was possible to reduce the search times for materials and tools in the 
plant by 34.24%. By applying both tools together, it will be possible to reduce the total cycle time by 19.61%.

Innovation: An Integrated Systems Approach

Abstract 
Operations work best when addressed from a systems perspective. Innovation is pervasive and ubiquitous globally 
these days. Unfortunately, the advertised potentials don’t always rise to the level of expectations because of 
organizational and operational impediments. This is particularly essential when unification is desired across 
boundaries of commerce, partnerships, and cooperation. In this regard, a system is a collection of interrelated elements 
whose collective output, together and in unison, is higher than the mere sum of the individual outputs. For a Systems 
approach to be practical, profitable, realizable, and sustainable, systematic frameworks must be instituted, subject to 
real-world constraints. In as much as everyone is clamoring for innovation, it is imperative that effective approaches 
be utilized to harness quantitative and qualitative methodologies. In this presentation, the DEJI (Design, Evaluation, 
Justification, and Integration) Systems Model will be used as the basis for mitigating organizational and operational 
impediments to innovation. Design, in this context, generically covers several objectives, including planning, 
conceptualization, organizing, brainstorming, negotiation, and so on. The systems approach of Design leads to a 
structured requirement to conduct a formal Evaluation, followed by a rigorous Justification, followed by, above all, 
Integration. Programs often fail due to a lack of sustainable integration of efforts. The DEJI Systems Model forces 
a structured and rewarding approach to what could, otherwise, become disjointed efforts. With the structured 
methodology of this presentation, a practical decision framework can be developed. The DEJI Systems Model was 
originally developed for product development purposes, but it has been successfully applied in business, industry, 
academia, and government examples. Viewing the accomplishments of any organization pursuit as “products,” it is 
envisioned that the template of DEJI could be effectively applied by any organization in business, industry, academia, 
government, or the military. Embedded within the DEJI Systems Model is the Triple-C approach of Communication, 
Cooperation, and Coordination. Literature references are plentiful for both techniques of DEJI Systems Model and 
Triple-C Model. This presentation will provide guidelines on how to apply both, together or separately, in 
organizational settings.
