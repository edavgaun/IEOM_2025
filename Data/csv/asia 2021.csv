Abstract 
 
Major studies on cell production have placed an emphasis on technical factors such as machine order/layout, 
family part grouping, work-flow sequence, etc. However, it is still insufficient to investigate how human 
factors affect the productivity of production cells. Although many companies have introduced cell 
production systems and realized that productivity of cells varies greatly with workers, there is no effective 
measure to access workers’ aptitude toward to assembly tasks in production cells. In order to assess the 
impact of workers’ aptitude on productivity, we have made a series of experimental studies and clarified 
that there are about 6% of workers who have very low aptitude and can be considered not suitable to 
assembly tasks in cell production. Meanwhile, intending to find the worker’s aptitude closely relating to 
her/his productivity, we designed a laboratory experiment, and administered 11 paper-and-pencil tests of 
the Japanese General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) to the workers to measure their seven work-related 
aptitudes. After examining the partial correlations between the workers’ GATB scores and their 
productivity, we have clarified that the GATB scores can’t directly measure a worker’s aptitude towards 
the assembly tasks in production cells, but we could apply principal component analysis to obtain a 
component score that correlates significantly with the workers’ productivity in cell production. However, 
this component score still can't be used to measure workers’ aptitude perfectly, in particular it can’t be used 
to identify the workers with very low aptitude. 
This paper intends to propose an effective classification model to identify the workers with very low 
aptitude based on workers’ GATB scores. We pay special attention to make several new contributions to 
cell production research through the following examinations: 
 (1) Based on workers’ GATB scores, we apply linear discriminant analysis and decision tree to construct 
several classification models and demonstrate that these models can’t identify the workers with very 
low aptitude with acceptable accurate. 
(2) As the number of workers with very low aptitude is much less than the workers else, we treat this 
identifying problem as a classification problem on class imbalanced datasets. We apply random forest 
method to construct a classification model and examine its effectiveness, as well as the best choice of 
the parameters. 
(3) We investigate the relationship between the detailed aptitude scores or standard aptitude scores of 
GATB and the workers’ classification, and clarify the aptitude scores that have a heaver impact on the 
classification.

Abstract  
 
The development of computer applications has influenced the needs of modern society. Various facilities can be 
used from the applications that are available. The use of computer applications has grown rapidly both in the form of 
web online and online android. The ease of application has been widely used by the community, government and 
private institutions. Applications have also been used in the transportation sector in realizing a smart city. The 
problem that is often faced by the community is the need for easy and inexpensive parking applications. This study 
aims to determine the need for applications that can be used by the community easily. The use of applications can 
also facilitate continuous parking management as well as cost efficiency. The method is carried out by conducting 
interviews with the community. It is hoped that the study can produce an effective parking management application 
to support a smart city and its residents.

Abstract 
 
Almost all of statistical models and machine learning models are to be built based on a known dataset 
(learning dataset) that was collected from past or other regions/domains. The precondition for applying 
these models to new instances is that the data of the new instances are comparable to the learning dataset. 
The comparability between the new instances and the learning dataset has also a strong impact on the 
performance of statistical models and machine learning models. There are mainly three types of 
comparability: comparability over region (geographical comparability), comparability over other domains 
and comparability over time. Comparability over time refers to the extent to which statistics are comparable 
or reconcilable over time. In particular, some social or economic indexes are affected clearly by changes 
over time of economic or social phenomena, comparability over time is an important aspect to improve the 
quality of various models in the social and economic fields. As major studies have put the emphasis on 
analysis methods or algorithms, there are lacks of researches dealing with comparability over time.  
This study intends to address the issue of comparability over time, our emphasis is put on (1) proposing a 
method to assess the comparability over time among datasets collected in different periods; (2) clarifying 
the impact of comparability over time on statistical models through examining how the performance of 
statistical models changes when the extent of comparability between the learning dataset and fitting datasets 
is different. As an example of statistical models, we consider the credit rating problem of Japanese regional 
banks. We collect financial indicators of Japanese regional banks in 2012 (R2012), 2015 (R2015) and 2017 
(R2017) respectively, conduct the following examinations and make several new contributions to data 
analytics research: 
(1) There are no researches published to assess comparability over time, this study is to demonstrate that 
the number of variables with significantly different means or/and variances can provide a measure to 
assess to which extent that the two datasets are comparable.  
(2) We apply linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method to construct two credit rating models based on 
the R2012 (Model A) and R2015 (Model B) respectively, and then use these two models to obtain the 
credit rating for each bank in R2017. Through comparing the forecasting results of model A and model 
B, and examining the extent of the comparability among these three datasets, we can clarify the impact 
of comparability over time on the performance of credit rating models. 
(3) As a data preprocessing tool, data normalization has been applied widely in various fields. The main 
goal of data normalization is to guarantee the quality of the data, scale the data in the same range of 
values for each feature in order to minimize bias for one feature to another. In this study, we propose a

Abstract 
 
This STEM paper will study the Time Series data file Raleigh Temps.jmp in the JMP sample Library, which contains 
maximum monthly temperatures measured in degrees Fahrenheit from 1980 to 1990. The objective of this paper is to 
forecast the Raleigh Temperature for 1990 to 2010. Among the four STEM components, the Science studied is 
Climatology or the study of the Earth’s Weather patterns; Technology is used to predict the Raleigh Max Monthly 
Temperature for the next twenty years; Engineering focuses on comparing Different Statistical Models on the Time 
Series Data, and mathematical tools like Statistics are applied. Most traditional and modern Data mining platforms 
can visualize the data distribution, Normal Quantile, Normal Mixture, Outliers very well, detect process capability 
and process stability, build Multiple Regression Model and identify month as the main factor, detect Clusters or 
Principal Components through Eigen Analysis, and use Neural Network or Partition Trees to build the Transfer 
Function Profiler. The major findings among these non-Time Series Platforms are that there is month to month cyclic 
behavior within each year but no year-to-year trend pattern is detected. However, there are several limitations among 
these non-time series platforms. It cannot decompose the seasonal component (cyclic month-month) from the trend 
component (year to year), cannot determine the relative strength of the “seasonal” and “trend” components, cannot 
determine the optimal smoothing setting if the curve is highly modulated, and cannot forecast or predict future points. 
JMP Time Series and Forecast platform were further used on the same time series data file. The Time Series 
decomposition statistics were utilized to separate the seasonal component from the trend component, and the 
smoothing technique cleaned the Forecasting Error. Seasonal lag was detected and confirmed by the Autocorrelation 
Function (ACF) plot and Variogram plot. The Time Series Forecast Platform can help predict Raleigh Temperature 
for 1990 to 2010 based on the 1980 to 1990 data. Authors are also continuing this Time Series STEM project on the 
following areas – Decomposition and Smoothing Statistics, Non-Seasonal and Seasonal ARIMA Models, and 
Forecasting and Prediction Interval Statistics. Time Series Analysis is not just popularly used in Finance Forecasting 
but also powerful for predicting any future uncertainty from the Time Series data.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Climatology 
Climate science investigates the structure and dynamics of earth’s climate system. It seeks to understand how global, 
regional and local climates are maintained as well as the processes by which they change over time Arnold (2011), 
Bindoff (2013). Climatology employs observations and theory from a variety of domains, including meteorology, 
oceanography, physics, chemistry and more. These resources also inform the development of computer models of the 
climate system, which are a mainstay of climate research today. Climatologists seek to understand three main aspects 
of climate. The first aspect is the weather patterns that govern normal conditions in different regions throughout the

7","quantify the seasonal and trend components. Use the smoothing technique to smooth out the noise to enhance the 
signal of “Seasonal” and “Trend” components. Time series has also used the more adv. smoothing techniques such as 
“moving average”, “exponential smoothing” and “state space smoothing” Hyndman (2008) to estimate the error term 
for forecasting purpose. These smoothing techniques would not be addressed here (future work). In Fig.18, JMP Time 
Series Forecast platform has shown the forecasting of the Raleigh Temperature for 1990-2010. The yearly mean is 
almost the same since no long term trend component detected in time series analysis. Seasonal lag=12 has been 
assigned in Forecasting analysis. The forecasting analysis has duplicated the seasonal pattern. The Model summary 
has provided the goodness of fit criteria like Likelihood, AIC, BIC Burnham (2004 & 2011). The 95% prediction 
interval was wider for the time period far away from the last point in Dec. 1990. This is understood that it was more 
uncertain to predict any future points far away from today like Stock market. One thing noticed is that the prediction 
interval is not symmetric (wider in the higher temperature range). Authors have no right answer for this observation. 
This paper used the maximum temperature to report the raw data. There may be some intrinsic reason why upper 
prediction interval has observed spikes and wider range than the lower prediction interval. Also, the upper prediction 
interval may be , meaningless since the interval upper limit is beyond 120F most years after 1990. Instead of following 
up this abnormal upper prediction interval observation, authors may suggest finding more powerful Time Series Model 
like Seasonal ARIMA.

5 Conclusions  
The STEM approach is adopted on analyzing the Time Series data file regarding the Raleigh Temperature records 
from 1980 to 1990. Neither Traditional Engineering and Statistics platforms nor Modern Data Mining platforms could 
not decompose the Time Series Components. Time Series Analysis can decompose the Seasonal and Trend 
Components, smooth out the Error Component for enhancing Forecasting capability, and help predict Raleigh 
Temperature for 1990 to 2010 based on the 1980 to 1990 data. 
 
Future Work 
Authors are continuing current Raleigh Temperature project to learn more about Advanced Time Series Techniques 
such as Decomposition and Smoothing Statistics, Non-Seasonal and Seasonal ARIMA Models, Forecasting and 
Prediction Interval Statistics, and more.

Abstract 
 
This STEM paper will study the Time Series Antarctic Glacier Mass from April 2002 to March 2021. The objective 
of this paper is to forecast the Antarctic Glacier Mass level for 2021 to 2041. Among the four STEM components, the 
science studied is the geoscience of glaciers, technology included is the GRACE-FO satellites to collect Glacier Ice 
Sheet Mass data, Engineering focuses on the COVID-19 impact on the Glacier melting rate, and mathematical models 
like Time Series Decomposition and Smoothing were implemented. Several Time Series Decomposition methods 
such as the detrended, season-adjusted, and differencing were utilized to detect the strength of time series “Trend” 
and “Seasonal” components. 12-month seasonal pattern and long-term year to year trend were significantly observed. 
Although the Glacier meting rate sped up recently before 2020, the COVID-19 situation has slowed down the rate of 
glacier melting in 2020 in both Antarctic and Greenland. Smoothing models were also utilized to smooth out the 
random noise component to enhance the forecasting model. Several smoothing models were compared using their 
forecasting capability regarding both the trend and seasonal components.  The prediction interval for forecasting 
Glacier Mass for 2021 to 2041 would become too wide to predict the future Glacier melting rate for more than 5 years 
in advance. This STEM Time Series Analysis methodology can be commonly applied to any Time Series data in 
several fields such as Climatology, Geoscience, Finance, Economics, Production Quality, Real Estate.

1. Introduction 
This project will study the Antarctic Glacier Mass data from 2002-2021 March. The objective is to use the Time Series 
platform to examine the time series Glacier data to predict the Glacier crisis for the next twenty years (2021-2041). 
 
1.1 Scientific Research Literature and Technology: GRACE-FO 
The global climate has been spiraling out of control due to the Global Warming effect (Arnold 2011). The Gravity 
Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission is a partnership between NASA and the German 
Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). GRACE-FO aims to test a new technology designed to dramatically improve 
the already remarkable precision of its measurement system. GRACE-FO is a successor to the original GRACE 
mission, which orbited Earth from 2002-2017. Global surface mass anomalies are observed by the GRACE-FO 
satellites. Over land, red colors indicate below-average terrestrial water amounts, while blue colors show above-
average water amounts (including ice, snow, soil moisture and groundwater). Over oceans, red colors indicate below-
average ocean pressure, while blue colors show above-average pressure. Ocean pressure changes are related to large-
scale ocean current variations, as well as overall sea level changes from ocean mass changes.

20","The forecasting analysis has duplicated the seasonal pattern. The linear trend was significant in Holt smoothing 
method. In general, Seasonal smoothing method has observed a better goodness of fit as shown on most criteria on 
the model summary. The only concern of the Seasonal smoothing is “Invertible”. This paper won’t address this 
“invertibility” subject. Authors may address this “invertibility” in the Time Series ARIMA model since “Invertibility” 
is very critical to the “MA- Moving Average” component on smoothing out the error terms for Forecasting.   
 
 
 
Figure 12. Compare Holt Linear Vs. Seasonal smoothing methods 
 
After compared the goodness fit of two Exponential Smoothing methods, the Forecasting capability would be further 
compared in Fig.13. The left plot is for the Holt’s Linear method and the right plot is for the Seasonal method. The 
Linear method has observed the linear trend component in the Forecasting with much wider prediction interval. The 
Seasonal method has observed the seasonal component in the Forecasting with narrower prediction interval. There are 
two challenges observed here: (1) is any Time Series Model can forecast the future points based on both the Trend 
Component and the Seasonal Component, (2) it would be a concern if the prediction interval is too wide at longer 
horizontal time from today. To address these two concerns, more powerful Time Series Forecast methods may be 
necessary. Authors would share the ARIMA and State Space smoothing methods in next publication.

5 Conclusions  
The STEM approach is adopted on analyzing the Time Series Glacier Mass data file from 2002-2021. Earth science 
and geoscience regarding the glacier melting crisis were learned, and the impact of COVID-19 on the rate of melting 
was also studied. The Time Series Analysis can decompose the Seasonal and Trend Components and smooth out the 
Error Component for enhancing the Forecasting capability for 2021 to 2041.

Abstract 
Starting with a brief review of the history of manufacturing system, we explore possibilities of the factories 
of tomorrow with advanced robotics. We discuss the challenges in design, validate, and commission 
robotics for a non-deterministic working environment that is necessary to achieve the level of flexibility in 
the future manufacturing industry. As Siemens Digital Industries Software has been providing software 
with cutting edge technologies to the manufacturing industry and robotics users for decades, we therefore 
lay out a potential evolution roadmap of the manufacturing system with robotics in four phases: entrants, 
veterans, pioneers and visionaries, with most companies today in the first two phases. Entrants widely adopt 
available fixed automation robotics or similar technology and most of their operations are performed 
manually using shopfloor teach in or offline programming tools. Veterans begin adding some higher-level 
features such as virtual commissioning in addition to what is available in the entrant phase. Pioneers of their 
industries begin to automate and accelerate their production design and deployment with more advanced 
technologies such as smart sensors and artificial intelligence. Visionaries in their field are those that 
implement advanced robotics trying to reach the goal of flexibility in the production processes and 
manufacturing systems. We then show examples in each phase of the evolution roadmap to indicate how 
the industry can advanced in technology and innovation, orchestrated by the digital twin of production. 
Partnerships and ecosystem comprised of industry world, entrepreneurship, and research institutions are 
extremely important to form the driving force of the journey towards the factory of the future.

Abstract 
 
In today’s global trend of intelligent manufacturing, intuitive and efficient industrial robot control system is essential 
to facilitate high-quality automation and intelligent transformation in industry. In order to solve the control 
difficulties of industrial robots such as complex application environment and high technology integration, virtual 
reality (VR) technology is widely used because the application is not limited by environment and is characterized of 
convenient interaction. However, the current applications of virtual reality technology on industrial robots are not 
able to realize the real-time control of the robot since the Virtual Reality technology is only used during the motion 
set compiling process, which also increases the difficulty of the interaction between workers and the system. 
Therefore, this paper aims at proposing a real-time control system of industrial robots based on Virtual Reality 
technology to achieve efficient human-robot collaboration. The modelling process uses SolidWorks, 3dsMax and 
Unity3D engine. Then, the operating mechanism of the system is introduced. A practical case is performed and the 
result shows that the system has obtained the real-time control objective, which can guide the human-robot 
collaboration process in different scenarios of industrial robots.

Figure 8. Correspondence and connection between cyber system and physical system 
 
The robot controller is connected with the host computer through the PC local control port, and the relevant 
control data is edited in the robot control software and synchronized to the robot controller. After synchronization, 
the interface between the controller and the host computer is switched to RS232 serial communication, and the 
control mode is switched to remote control in the robot control software. 
After editing the control data, connect the VR suit to the host computer and start the Unity3D engine. The VR 
helmet is driven by SteamVR and the main camera in virtual scene is associated with the VR helmet. After 
selecting the appropriate space to set up the positioner, the virtual model is functional under the condition that the 
helmet, positioner and handle are online. 
After the cyber system has been started, the user put on the VR helmet within the projection range of the 
positioner to operate the virtual robot and realize the real-time control of the physical robot by dragging the gripper 
of the robot with VR handle. 
5. Conclusion 
This paper introduces a real-time control system for industrial robot based on virtual reality technology, 
including the modeling process, operation principle and practical application process of the system. SolidWorks, 
3dsmax and Unity3D engine are employed in the modelling process of the cyber system. The control strategy of 
the system is featured by the mapping of the coordinate system and setting of the control points with bounds.

Abstract 
In Tunisia, knowledge of how road traffic accidents vary geographically by different locations provides indices to 
understand their determinants. In addition, some locations on road network are characterized by a high 
concentration of accidents more than others. Focusing on how hot spot mapping can predict spatial patterns of 
accidents and how different mapping approaches compare will help to better inform their application in practice, 
our methodologies consist of two main steps.  The first consist on the identification and ranking of accidents hot 
spots based on dangerosity index using a spatial autocorrelation approach (Local Moran index Vs Local Getis-Ord 
index) to investigate the high density of accident in the region of sousse, Tunisia and to compare our results with 
the public authority’s results. Then once a hotspot is identified, the analysis of the problems and prospective 
treatments will be proposed. This will involve the development of planning rules of road environment, identify 
shortcomings in the regulation and make recommendations to identify solutions for the elimination of hotspot and 
better management of the road environment. We hope that the information and details mentioned in this paper 
could help the public decision-maker in terms of road safety.

Abstract 
 
Under the trend of intelligent manufacturing and flexible manufacturing, human-machine 
collaboration has been the mainstream in production. Therefore, as a key factor affecting the efficiency of 
human-machine collaboration, it is very important to identify and analyze human actions in production line. 
However, cameras are often unable to get close to the operators considering the complex environment of 
industrial sites, while the identification accuracy reduces greatly because multi-person wearing the same 
uniform in industrial sites at the same time. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic multi-person 
detection and pose estimation method based on object detection and pose estimation framework, which not 
only effectively distinguishes the identity information of the multiple operators, but also provides accurate 
body joint features for identifying the actions of multiple target operators.

1. Introduction 
With the concept of Industry 4.0 put forward, the manufacturing industry is gradually transforming from mass 
production to personalized and customized production. The production process becomes more complex due to the 
requirement of customization, which poses a great challenge to the flexibility and intelligence of the production 
process. Compared with automation equipment such as robots, human beings have stronger flexibility and 
adaptability. Therefore, human still play an irreplaceable role of core productivity which determines the production 
efficiency and quality as well as flexibility (Wang et al. 2019). In the context of intelligent manufacturing, the detection 
and identification of human is of great importance. The emergence and development of action recognition and pose 
estimation technology provides an effective method to solve this problem. Human action recognition technology 
monitors and analyzes actions in real time to find the existing problems, thus eliminating time waste, improving quality 
and efficiency. 
In the era of Industry 4.0, large factories have embraced intelligent manufacturing one after another. At present, 
surveillance cameras in manufacturing factories with a certain scale can produce TB-level effective video data every 
day (Bonci et al. 2016), and most of these videos are only used to monitor workers' production, and the rich action 
information contained in them has not been fully utilized. With the application of mass customization production, 
various production lines often need to be reorganized according to personalized needs. However, workers are limited 
by knowledge and ability, and it is difficult to adapt to this changeable production mode, which often leads to the 
omission of key inspection procedures, the wrong use of assembly tools and substandard assembly operations. Action

41","As can be seen from the key point diagram, since Neck and MidHip connect all joints and are the core nodes, 
Neck and MidHip are regarded as the main key points. In a video clip, the detection threshold of two key points, Neck 
and MidHip, was set to 0.9. Considering occlusion, if one of the key points above exists, the location of the person 
with this identity in the video can be determined. 
By combining the advantages of YOLO and OpenPose frameworks, we propose to carry out parallel processing 
of video streams with two frames, and finally obtain high-precision identification effect by summarizing information 
flows as is shown in Figure 6. Through testing the OpenPose framework, the recognition frame of video stream is 
8.2FPS. Finally, the image is divided into eight regions, and movement pattern of the target between regions is 
compared with the templates to identify the person on sites.

5. Conclusions and future work 
By integrating both frameworks of YOLOv3 and OpenPose, desirable detection and identification outcomes of 
people on complex industrial sites are achieved. This method has obvious significance for analyzing worker's action 
and improving production efficiency. However, this method is faced with the problems of huge computation and 
requirement of high performance hardware. 
In the future, we will further integrate the advantages of the two identification methods and use data 
enhancement methods to further improve their application capability on industrial sites. At the same time, the model 
size is to be reduced to carry out more efficient detection and identification for human targets.

Abstract  
 
Virtual assembly technology has been widely used in the fields of mechanical equipment and industrial 
simulations. However, the current virtual assembly is mainly centered on function and technology, without 
considering human interaction experience. Aiming at the realization, analysis and display of virtual 
assembly of large and complex mechanical structure, a complete set of technical solutions is introduced. 
3D model establishment and assembly animation simulation are carried out based on UG and Tecnomatix 
platforms; Through VR technology, a human-computer interaction mode for structure-oriented virtual 
assembly process is built, which enables users to simulate the operations of assembly objects; Shutter 3D 
technology is used to output the experience picture of a single user in VR through a high-definition 3D 
projector, which can satisfy the immersive experience of multiple users in the 3D virtual assembly process 
at the same time. This technical route has a positive significance for simulating the assembly process of 
large complex mechanical structures more truly, verifying and improving the assembly scheme, and 
realizing the human-computer interaction oriented to the assembly process.

Abstract 
 
In the context of Industry 4.0, the level of workshop production automation has been greatly improved. Flexible 
flow workshops that produce multiple varieties and small batches of products have rich resources and complex 
processing procedures, where are featured by many constraints for the production scheduling and varying practical 
procedure of the production. Traditional production scheduling research is mostly based on mathematical methods by 
simplifying the production model to a mathematical model and using algorithms to find the optimal solution. This 
method is not accurate enough to model the realistic production process in the workshop, which leads to inadequate 
guidance for actual production. This paper proposes an optimization production scheduling method based on 
simulation model and establishes a systematic simulation-based flow shop scheduling framework. It uses a database 
as a bridge to external optimization algorithms and internal simulation models, and realizes intelligent production 
scheduling and simulation through real-time interaction. This research is able to accurately reflect the processing logic 
of the actual flow shop, and the result of scheduling shows that the proposed method has more practical significance 
for guiding the actual production process.

3.1 Systematization of scheduling methods 
According to the definition issued by the International Council on Systems Engineering in 2019: An engineered 
system is a system designed or adjusted to interact with the expected operating environment to achieve one or more 
expected purposes. The focus of current application research is establishing a systematic model that combining the 
actual production application. And it will integrate the scheduling rules, optimization algorithms and simulation 
models. Therefore, this method intends to realize the systematic integration of simulation models and optimization 
algorithms that reflect the scheduling rules.  
This paper builds the interconnection bridge between the model and the algorithm by the establishment of MySQL 
database and systematically integrates the two independent parts. The genetic algorithm is written by Python 
statements to read and write the database. The algorithm also writes the optimization results of each generation to the 
database in real time. The model's monitoring module decodes its optimization results after the database is updated 
and completes real-time simulation. This way realizes the real-time interaction between the model and the algorithm; 
and it designs the systematic integration of the two parts and achieves the automation of scheduling optimization. The 
specific approach is shown in Figure 7. 
 
 
Figure 7. Systematization of scheduling  
 
3.2 The ability for expressing the production of reality 
The simulation-based optimization scheduling method described in this article can not only realize the analysis of 
the historical data of the production site to realize the rescheduling, but also complete the decision-making of future 
scheduling under the guidance of the production data. It achieves the greatest degree of restoration of the actual 
production through the integration of the model and the optimization algorithm. It has a strong practicality and a better 
practical guiding significance for the actual production than the mathematical planning model.  
4. Conclusion 
The proposed method is applied to re-schedule the monthly production of the flexible flow production workshop -
Workshop A. The production time after scheduling has been shortened by comparing with the historical production 
time. The optimization effect directed actual production of the factory is significant. This proposed method based on 
simulation model realizes production scheduling and systematically integrates the algorithm and the model through 
database connection. It realizes the implementation simulation and interaction of scheduling strategy based on 
traditional SBO method.

Abstract—In today's rapid industrial development, the application of industrial robots is becoming 
increasingly extensive, where the industrial robot needs diversified designs to adapt to rich application 
scenarios and different utilization conditions. How to design products quickly and reasonable according to 
the market demand has become an urgent problem in the development of industrial robots. The traditional 
design method of robots is mainly in accordance with experience, or functional analysis and module 
division of industrial robots which needs a lot of time cost and resources. In order to improve the design 
efficiency of industrial robots, this paper proposes a design method based on association rules through 
knowledge mining in which the robot structural feature parameters are accumulated and utilized. In this 
process, the K-means clustering method is used to discretize the data through the Euclidean metric between 
the feature parameters, and then the association relationships are mined by using the Apriori. Finally the 
association rules are summarized according to the physical meaning of the structural usefeature parameters. 
The method proposed in this paper provides a scientific basis for the rapid design of robots and improves 
the rationality of robot design.

The same method is used to discretize and rename data such as payload, accuracy, quality, protection level and height. 
Follow the above steps in sequence to get the data code shown in Table 2.

After the data discretization process, the application of the Apriori is implemented by using Pycharm, and the 
Excel data is run after importing. The frequent 1 item set, frequent 2 item set, frequent 3 item set and frequent 4 item 
set are obtained respectively with a support degree of 0.1. Then get the relationship between the robot structural feature 
parameters. Take the relationship between A, B, D and E as an example, as shown in Table 3 below.

Analyze the running results and take one of the rules as an example. 
From the data discretization naming, it can be seen that: B2—payload is (340,900); D3—accuracy range is 
(0.04,0.08]. Then the operation result of Article I shows that when the payload is at (340,900], its accuracy range at 
(0.04, 0.08], and the confidence of this conclusion is about 0.65986. 
Aiming at the final data to be substituted, arithmetic mining is carried out through Apriori. A series of association 
rules are obtained, and the rules are classified into ten categories shown in Table 4.

This paper collected and sorted out the robot structural feature parameters by understanding of the robot design 
process with modeling. According to the discretization preprocessing of K-means and the association relationship 
mining of the Apriori, ten types of rules were obtained that guide the process of the robot design. In the following 
research, we hope that the application and other structural feature parameters of the robot can be mined to obtain the 
corresponding association relationships.

Abstract 
 
The manipulator grasping system based on the local visual system is only be applicable to the static and already 
existing in the visual training model parts and can’t accurately identify and grasp new or motional parts. In this paper, 
a part grasping system for manipulator in cloud environment is designed. By using the excellent storage performance 
and efficient computing capacity of cloud, the types of parts that can be grabbed by manipulator are enriched, the 
calculation speed of part data is improved, and the dynamic grabbing is realized. Under the structure of cloud-edge-
terminal, using the part type, running speed, height, spatial position and angle information stored in the cloud, 
combined with the robot running speed and Rodriguez formula, the manipulator TCP position and pose of the part 
grabbing point is calculated. The capture strategy of parts is generated in the cloud. By the network connection between 
the upper computer and the manipulator, the control command generated online is transmitted to the manipulator to 
complete the dynamic grasping spare parts. At the same time, the status data of the manipulator is obtained and 
analyzed during the grasping process. The method proposed in this paper improves the adaptability of the part grabbing 
system, and provides a technical basis for motional part grabbing in the cloud environment.

Abstract 
Sorting task is one of the main activities in manufacturing. Traditional industrial sorting technology 
is laborious, time-consuming and inefficient, and it is difficult to meet the needs of automated long-term 
operations. Therefore, this paper designed a vision-based workpiece recognition system for intelligent 
manufacturing, which applied deep learning methods to realize the recognition and localization of 
workpieces to drive the robotic arm to sort multiple types of workpieces. In this paper, the transfer 
learning method was used to train the enhanced data to recognize new images. Filtering methods such as 
Gaussian, Bilateral, and morphological transformation methods such as expansion, erosion, and opening 
operations was applied to achieve image denoising and distortion elimination. Finally, through the 
feature matrix calculated by processed image data, the information such as the centroid position and the 
deflection angle can be obtained, which lay the foundation for accurate localization and rapid sorting of 
workpieces.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, China's technological level has advanced by leaps and bounds, and the development 
trend of intelligence and automation in the manufacturing industry is very rapid. A highly intelligent and 
automated manufacturing plant can greatly improve efficiency, reduce the proportion of manual labor, 
and bring great economic benefits [1].  
In traditional industrial and logistics sorting systems, most of them adopt a manual work-oriented 
model, which is costly and time-consuming. It is difficult to meet the long-term and high-intensity work 
requirements of the industrial production, which greatly restricts the industry production efficiency. 
Nowadays, more and more researchers combine machine vision with industrial sorting robots to provide 
""eyes"" for industrial sorting robots, allowing the robots to autonomously recognize the types and poses 
of workpieces, and can handle complex workpiece positions, which shows the robot has a higher level 
of intelligence. Therefore, this article will design a kind of automatic parts recognition and positioning 
system based on the background of industrial sorting robots.

Figure 5. shows the calibration diagram. In the calculation process, the corner points of the 
checkerboard are selected for calibration. Each checkerboard calibration drawing can obtain a rotation 
vector rvec and translation vector tvec. The rotation vector and translation vector of each checkerboard 
itself refer to the checkerboard angle. The point is the transformation of the origin coordinate system 
relative to the world coordinate system. 
Furthermore, when obtaining the internal parameter matrix, we take multiple photos of different 
angles for calibration. Under the combined action of these calibration pictures, the internal parameter 
matrix can be obtained.Then through the rotation vector and translation vector of each picture itself, you 
can transform to the world coordinate system and get the real coordinates.

Use MySQL related sentences to realize the function of uploading workpiece type and location 
information in real time, which is convenient for the robotic arm to grasp.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper has completed the design of the parts visual recognition system for intelligent 
manufacturing, completed the recognition, classification and positioning of the parts, explored the 
relevant theories of convolutional neural networks in the field of deep learning, and explored the relevant 
image processing methods and related methods based on OpenCV Algorithm, explored the method of 
camera calibration and related coordinate system conversion. The main work content is as follows: 
1) Under the tensorflow machine learning framework, the keras deep learning library is used, and 
the VGG16 convolutional neural network model is selected to achieve accurate recognition of the 
workpiece, and the accuracy rate can reach 99%. 
2) Using OpenCV-based image processing methods, Gaussian filtering and morphological 
conversion methods are used to denoise the image, edge detection methods are used to extract part 
contour information, centroid position and rotation angle are calculated through feature moments, and 
the contour extraction success rate of parts can reach 99%, and the accuracy of pose acquisition can reach 
99%. 
3) Complete the coordinate transformation from the pixel coordinate system to the world coordinate 
system, establish the difference capture strategy relative to the reference point, and realize the sorting of 
multiple types of parts by the driving robot arm. The overall effect is good. 
On the basis of realizing the basic functions, there are several optimization points to the system: 
1) Optimized the lighting conditions based on the industrial production environment to improve the 
anti-light interference of the program; 
2) Using contour recognition and image segmentation technology, based on the single-output 
weight model of the VGG16, multi-target detection and real-time tracking are realized, which has a good 
effect and can meet the real-time capture function of the robot.  
The content completed in this article is highly adaptable to industrial sorting scenarios, and can be 
used for assembly line sorting parts and AGV sorting parts, which can improve the efficiency of industrial 
sorting to a certain extent and increase economic benefits. What’s more, the relative reference point 
calibration scheme provides another feasible scheme for the realization of the general precision grasping 
scheme. 
In addition, this system still has certain improvements: 
1) Because the camera is black-and-white camera, the gray-scale processing process is omitted. But 
the black-and-white image training model is generally robust, and the situation of misrecognition is 
serious, so color cameras can be considered as a substitute for identification. 
2) The stability of the relative reference point calibration scheme is a little weak. The hand-eye 
calibration method , which means that the origin of the world coordinate system can be established in

Abstract  
 
In learning the second language, motivation is always regarded as one of the vital elements. Motivation drives 
human to determine how to react to certain situation and to behave. This present quantitative study adapted 
Dornyei’s L2 Motivation Self System (L2MMS) to determine the type of motivation among selected school students 
in Seremban, to study the different types of motivation based on gender and to analyse the correlation between all 
types of motivation and students’ achievement in English Language achievement among 30 students selected 
randomly from schools in Seremban district. The study found that the L2 Learning Experience is the type of 
motivation among the students followed by Ideal L2 Self and Ought-to L2 Self. The study also revealed that both 
male and female students scored the highest level of Ideal L2 Self motivation, a moderate level of ought-to self 
motivation and the lowest level of L2 learning experience type of motivation respectively. It was also found that 
there was a positive correlation between the Ideal L2 Self type of motivation and students’ achievement in the 
English Language. However, there was no correlation between the L2 learning experience and ought-to self types of 
motivation and students’ achievement.

1. Introduction  
The education system in Malaysia is divided into preschool education, primary education (which lasts for 
six years from 7 to 12 years old), secondary education (which lasts for five years from 13 to 17 years old), and 
tertiary education. In Seremban, for the secondary education system, there are six types of schools, which are 
national secondary schools (37), fully residential schools (5), national religious secondary schools (3), vocational 
college (1), technic school (1) and government-assisted religious schools (1). Majority of the schools in Seremban 
are national secondary schools. To enrol in this type of school, students must finish their primary education. There 
are also five fully residential schools here. A fully residential school was created to provide a planned, controlled, 
and conducive school environment to develop the potential of excellent students towards producing quality human 
capital. It also plays an important role in developing the best talent in the country and democratizing quality 
education to all levels of Malaysian society. This type of school aims to generate talent that matches global 
challenges. Another type of school is the national religious school. This type of school is committed to educate 
students with Islamic personalities, supply knowledge that meets worldly and afterlife demands, develop the 
potential of students in terms of interest, creativity, personality, and leadership. Students who graduate from this 
school get the opportunity to further their studies in various fields of knowledge in and outside the country. The next 
type of school is a vocational school. Vocational schools provide opportunities for students who are achieving well 
or moderately in academics and are interested in vocational (job-related) learning. The content of the vocational 
field has balanced theoretical and practical components. The objective of this stream is to help produce semi-
professionals (technicians or technical assistants) in engineering and non-engineering fields. Technical school, on 
the other hand, is dedicated to students who excel in academics at the PT3 level. The objective of the technical field 
is to help produce professionals in engineering and non-engineering fields (agriculture and trade). Upon graduating 
from technical schools, students have the opportunity to further their studies to a higher level at university, 
polytechnic, or community college. They can also further their studies at technical matriculation college, general

A  Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed to assess the type of motivation and students' 
achievement in the English language. For the Ideal L2 Self type of motivation and the students' achievement, there 
was a positive correlation between the two variables where r=0.376, n=30, p=0.41. There was no correlation 
between the ought-to self type of motivation and the students' achievement where r=0.22, n=30, p=0.908. For the 
last type of motivation, which is learning experience, there was no correlation too where r=0.000, n=30, p=1.000. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This pilot test aimed to investigate the correlation between motivation and students' achievement in the English 
language using the PT3 public examination among the form four students from selected schools in Seremban. In 
conclusion, the findings of the present study lend empirical support for the correlation between motivation and 
students’ achievement. This supports the motivation theory by Gardner (1959) and L2 Motivation Self-System by 
Dörnyei (2005) that motivation “plays a vital role in stimulating learners’ interest towards the target language thus 
improve the proficiency in the target language” (Nguyen, 2018). 
The findings depicted three important points; the L2 learning experience motivated the participants the 
most, there was no significant difference between male and female respondents pertaining the type of motivation 
and there was a correlation between the Ideal L2 Self type of motivation and students’ English Language 
achievement. 
 
More comprehensive investigations based on this study can be done for future research. This study can be 
extended by including social economic factors as factors that influence learners’ academic achievement. Other 
subjects, other than English language can be examined too. It would also be interesting to know other age groups’ 
type of motivation based on gender.  
This study could be a reference for teachers in Seremban in boosting their students’ motivation in English 
language learning.

Abstract  
 
There is an increasing awareness of the importance and cost of the thermal comfort of buildings’ occupants.  For those 
who live in a hot climate, demand for cooling systems is rising. Researches showed that during the hot seasons in the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE), the increased usage of cooling systems results in increased use of energy consumption 
up to 70%-79% excessive amount of normal energy consumption. Because of such high-energy demands, there is an 
apparent expansion of the consequential economic impact countrywide. It has thus become essential to study the 
economic impact of air conditioning systems in the UAE. This research applies life cycle cost analyses on air 
conditioning systems under four major factors: (1) outside climate, (2) building type from the respect of elevation 
difference, (3) type of air conditioning systems, and (4) the distinctions among different brands of air conditioning 
systems. A mixed method research approach was considered that includes field observations, interviews with experts, 
document review, and mathematical/numerical data generation. Statistical analysis was applied together with the 
Analytical Hierarchy Processes (AHP) techniques. Results included developing decision-making for selecting the 
most suitable air conditioning system regarding the total cost of the lifecycle span determined against the listed four 
assessment factors. Results also showed that humid coastal areas are more demanding in terms of air-conditioning 
energy consumption compared to an internal dry area.

1. Introduction 
Various regions worldwide have different climates with undesirable living conditions, particularly when considering 
indoor air quality. One of the most effective ways to improve indoor air quality is by utilizing various air conditioning 
systems. However, these systems consume huge amounts of energy, especially in extreme climate conditions of too 
high or low temperatures, such as arid (desert) regions. With the current climate changes, air conditioning systems are 
becoming an essential part of our daily life (Krarti & Dubey, 2018; Mathur et al., 2018), and therefore various air 
conditioning systems have been developed to serve various purposes.         
Nowadays, air conditioning units have become ""must-have"" devices, an essential part of most types of properties such 
as residential building, commercial building and shopping centers. Therefore, there were many innovations in air

Conclusions 
 
The current work studied the influence of multiple variations of indoor air conditioning systems in regards to climate 
– as indicated by geographical location, type of buildings in terms of height, type of cooling cycles based on air or 
water type of cooling agent, in addition to the variation in design concepts for different manufacturers. Data was 
collected in sequential steps through documents review, field observations, and expert informants’ interviews. The 
research is intended to fill the current literature gap in regards to best selection of in-door air-conditioning systems 
given the stated varying parameters.  
 
From the statistical tests and their interpretation, it could be concluded that three of the studied factors have a 
significant effect on the total price of the life cycle cost of air conditioning systems per power consumed; which are:  
1) type of buildings in terms of height, 2) type of cooling cycles based on air or water type of cooling agent, and 3)  
the variation in design concepts for different manufacturers.  
In the other hand, influence of climate – as indicated by geographical location, on energy consumption and thus on 
operational cost, have no significant effect on the total price of the life cycle cost of air conditioning systems per power 
consumed.

110","Similarly, the AHP tool  -  a decision making support means – was applied to rank the importance of the four previously 
mentioned factors and their sub-factors in the air conditioning industry of residential buildings. It is concluded that 
humid coastal areas are more demanding in terms of air-conditioning energy consumption compared to an internal 
arid dry area, but it’s found that  coastal regions are preferable over arid regions.     
A good recommendation for future work would be to continue the study the highlited  four factors but in regards to  
the environmental aspect. This can help to understand which of these factors have a significant impact on the 
environment represented by the carbon footprint of each configuration.

Abstract  
The Oil and Gas industry is currently undergoing major changes in technology, and as a result of the increasing demand for energy, it is 
still a major source of risk, and therefore risk assessment of this type of industry is crucial to ensure the safety of people, equipment and 
the environment protection. This assessment contributes to better management by reducing these risks and implementing an adequate 
prevention and protection strategy to achieve the objectives of the HSE (health, safety and environment) management system. 
This study consists of a quantitative assessment of the risks associated with an LPG storage and distribution station, by proposing a risk 
assessment approach that allows the analysis of the various accidental sequences that may occur following an accidental release of LPG 
and the modelling of their consequences. We would like to specify that the initiating event is a complete and instantaneous rupture of the 
line, and thus a loss of containment of an important quantity of liquefied gas. Smaller, medium and large leaks are also studied. It was 
found that the main failure modes for the lines are: external leakage, plugging and deformation or corrosion (without leakage or plugging). 
The main causes of these failures are mechanical failures (typically due to a combination of overload) and inadequate design and 
corrosion. It should be noted that external aggression and human error are also possible causes of these failures.  
According to the analysis carried out by the event tree, the hazardous phenomena are an Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion 
(UVCE)/flash fire, pool fire, jet fire and dispersion of the toxic cloud to the atmosphere/pollution. The scenario of dispersion of the toxic 
cloud to the atmosphere was not the subject of our study. As a result of this application and for small leaks, the phenomenon of Pool fire, 
UVCE / Flash fire and Jet fire are considered Tolerable due to their low frequency of occurrence despite having high frequencies of 
occurrences > Ft = E -5/ year (ALARP principle). The phenomenon of vaporization of the butane pool can also be tolerated in the case of 
a medium or large leak due to their weak effects, on the other hand this phenomenon is considered unacceptable in the event of slick 
ignition. In the case of medium and large leaks, UVCE / Flash fire and Jet fire phenomena are considered unacceptable due to their height 
consequences (effects), despite their low frequency of occurrence (1.28 E-5 and 3.2 E -5 / year respectively for medium leaks and 1.092 
E-5 and 1.82 E -5/year respectively for large leaks). The results of the identified high-risk scenarios were modelled using the ALOHA 
simulator, and subsequently, we identified the areas exposed to different accidental effects such as: thermal, toxic and overpressure 
effects… This modelling was also used to develop or update the response structure and emergency plans.

Abstract  
 
Reports show that the Japanese language achievement among Malay students at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia 
(UTHM) is less impressive. This problem is due to the less attention given to the psychological factors, purpose, 
background, and the need to learn the Japanese language. Thus, this study aims to identify the relationship between 
motivation and students’ achievement based on the approach of The L2 Motivational Self System (L2MSS) and 
appropriate learning materials based on the analysis of learning needs. This quantitative study involved 73 samples of 
level 1 Japanese language students. The results of the survey found that the students were influenced by curriculum 
factors, teachers, peers, and teaching materials. The students also have a high imagination towards the native speakers. 
Besides, based on the analysis of learning needs, it was found that the theme of communication that focuses on 
conversations with native speakers and travel activities is the dominant factor chosen by the students. Based on this 
feedback, a proposed syllabus has been introduced to meet the needs of students learning the Japanese language at 
UTHM.  
 
 
Keywords 
Motivation, L2MMS, Learning needs analysis.   
 
 
1. Introduction  
Globally, the Japanese language has been given attention and learned by many people. According to Heida and 
Maserah (2014), the language is developing in 133 countries, especially in the East Asia (Korea and China) as well as 
in the South East Asia. Based on The Japan Foundation report (2017), there are approximately 3.6 million learners of 
this language in the world. Besides, there are 176 centres (private and public) for languages which offer a Japanese 
language course. The uniqueness of the Japanese language can be identified in various forms: characters, sentence 
structure, grammar, and vocabulary. According to Habibah (2010), it can be observed that from a structural point of 
view, there are significant differences between English and Japanese. Arabic, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese are 
classified as non-orthographic languages.  Each of them has its uniqueness, however, it is difficult for the students to 
master it without understanding the strategy and recognizing the actual needs of learning the languages. Hence, the 
needs analysis for the language is essential and should be carried out by observing the aspects to be learned and what 
should be learned. In fact, according to Brindley (1989), the learning processes such as motivation, attitude, concern, 
sensitivity, personality, goals, and learning style are influenced by emotions and ways of thinking. Syllabus and 
specific language skills are required in achieving the optimal learning outcomes for a particular language teaching 
group. Thus, the relationship between needs analysis and language learning for specific purposes is inseparable 
(Ṭu`aymah, 1989). 
 
The Japanese language has been offered at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) in 2001 when the 
undergraduates were required to register for a foreign language course as a compulsory elective subject (UTHM, 
2019). The Japanese language course is offered at level 1 by the Centre for Language Studies which carries a load of 
2 credits. This course is conducted based on the main reference which is Minna No Nihongo. In Malaysia, The Japan 
Foundation has the role of controlling and researching the content of reference materials by following the JF Standard

6. Conclusion  
This study shows that in general, students have motivation in learning the Japanese language introduced by Universiti 
Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). The results of the analysis also explain that students have a high tendency 
towards motivational factors for the L2 Learning Experience dimension where students are influenced by situations 
that are specific to curriculum factors, teachers, peers, and teaching materials. Furthermore, although the relationship 
between student achievement and motivational factors is moderate, it further targets the dimensions of The Ideal L2 
Self as students' imagination as native speakers. Researchers believe that a comprehensive analysis of Japanese 
language learning needs has been translated into a new approach in the preparation of teaching and learning materials. 
Besides, it can generate teachers' thinking to create teaching goals, curriculum, syllabus, preparation of appropriate 
teaching plans while adopting the best teaching methodology. Indirectly, the effectiveness of the teaching and learning 
process can be achieved in a more conducive environment. Table 7 show a propose syllabus for Japanese Language 
course at UTHM based on the needs analysis.

Abstract  
 
This study aimed to examine the influence of return on assetand earning per share on stock price. The object of this 
study is property and real estate companies listed or listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and the number 
of samples obtained by 30 companies to pass through purposive sampling phase in accordance with the criteria 
required for the study. This research is categorized into types of descriptive and verification method. Data used in this 
study belong to the type of secondary data such as annual reports and financial statements of the company since 2014 
until 2019 which can be obtained from the website www.idx.co.id. The method of analysis of this research using panel 
data regression analysis to obtain a comprehensive picture of the relationship between the variables with other 
variables. These results indicate that the return of assets, return on equity, net profit margin and earning per share 
simultaneously significant affect on stock price. Results of this study idntifies a partial return on assets, return on 
equity and net profit margin did not significantly influence the share price and earnings per share significantly to stock 
prices to the property and rael estate listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) of in 2010 through 2014.

123","Based on table 3, it can be seen that the coefficient constant value, so that it can be formed in the panel data 
regression equation with the Common Effect model as follows: 
P = 247.7298 + 693.0958ROA + 7.608745EPS 
of 247.7298 which means that if  ROA and EPS are zero, then the dependent variable of the Property & 
Real Estate company's stock price will be worth 247.7298 units.. 
The ROA coefficient (X2) is 698.0958, which means that if there is a change in ROA by 1 unit (assuming 
other variables are constant), the Property & Real Estate company's stock price level will increase by 
698.0958 units. However, partially, the ROA coefficient does not have a significant effect on stock prices. 
The EPS coefficient (X4) is 7.608745 which means that if there is a change in the EPS increase of 1 unit 
(assuming other variables are constant), then the Property & Real Estate company's stock price level will 
increase by 7.608745 units. 
 
 
4.2 Discussion of Research Results  
 
Based on the test results of this study in table 3, it can be seen that Return on Assets has a prob 
value. (p-value) 0.7998 > 0.05; in accordance with the provisions of decision making, then H0 is accepted 
which means Return on Assets (ROA) as an independent variable partially has no effect on stock prices as 
the dependent variable. The results of this study indicate that companies with good or increasing ROA 
conditions do not have the potential to attract investors. These results are supported by most of the changes 
in ROA in this sample which are not symmetrical with changes in stock prices. In the sample of PT Ciputra 
Development Tbk from 2010 to 2014 ROA increased but in 2013 the stock price decreased which was not 
followed by ROA. The results of this study show results that support previous research conducted by 
Raymundus (2009) ROA does not have an effect on stock prices. 
Based on the results of this research test in table 3, it can be seen that Earning Per Share has a prob 
value. (p-value) 0.0000 > 0.05; in accordance with the provisions of decision making, then H0 is rejected, 
which means Earning Per Share (EPS) as an independent variable partially has a significant influence on 
stock prices. The regression coefficient value shows a positive direction between EPS and stock prices, this 
explains that if EPS increases by 1 unit while other variables are constant, then the stock price will increase 
by 7.608745 units. 
The results of the study indicate that Earning Per Share has a significant effect on stock prices. In 
general, a high EPS will give a positive signal to investors about the prospects of the stock because EPS 
indicates the company's ability to generate profits for each outstanding share. Statistically, it is seen that the 
average EPS of Property & Real Estate companies 2010-2014 is Rp. 101,600 where there are 8 companies 
that have EPS above the average which is able to reflect that increasing EPS is the company's main effort 
to give a positive signal to investors to increase their EPS. demand for the company's shares. 
In this study, EPS information is the main thing that needs to be considered and used as a better 
benchmark by investors in making investment decisions. The results of this study are in line with the 
research of Indallah (2012) Earning Per Share has a significant effect on stock prices. 
 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research on ""The Influence of Profitability Ratios (Net Profit 
Margin, Return On Assets, Return On Equity and Earning Per Share) on Stock Prices in Property 
& Real Estate Companies Listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2010-2014 Period"". The 
dependent variable used is the stock price. While the independent variables used are Net Profit 
Margin, Return On Assets, Return On Equity and Earning Per Share. The Return On Assets (ROA) 
variable has the highest value of 0.254 found in PT (MDLN) in 2013. While the lowest value is 
owned by PT (RBMS) of -0.103 in 2011. The average value of the ROA variable is 0.053 with a

130","value, which means that the ROA data in this study varies and cannot represent the average ROA 
of Property & Real Estate companies for the 2010-2014 period. The Earning Per Share (EPS) 
variable has the highest value of 1212,820 which is found in PT (LPCK) in 2014. While the lowest 
value is owned by PT Ristia Bintang Mahkotasejati (RBMS) of -42,765 in 2013. The average value 
of the EPS variable is equal to 98.150 with a standard deviation of 196.5727004 where the standard 
deviation value is greater than the average value, which means that the EPS data in this study 
varies and cannot represent the average EPS of Property & Real Estate companies for the 2010-
2014 period. 
ROA and EPS simultaneously have a significant effect on stock prices in Property & Real 
Estate companies for the period 2010-2014. It is indicated by the probability value (F-Statistic) of 
0.000000 which is lower than the 0.05 significance level. this means that ROA, ROE, EPS, and 
NPM together can be used as a good reference for investors to invest in companies with good 
profitability, so that it is expected to be able to increase demand for a stock and increase the 
company's stock price. 
ROA does not have a significant effect on stock prices, this is indicated by a significant level of 
0.7998 which is greater than a significance level of 0.05. this is probably due to external factors 
such as the company's recent crisis. 
EPS has a significant effect on stock prices with a significance level of 0.000000 which is lower 
than the 0.05 significance level. EPS in this study shows that a good EPS value can attract the 
attention of investors to invest which will increase the demand for company shares so that it can 
affect the increase in stock prices.

1. Status analysis of workshop production line 
Under the background of increasingly fierce competition and the pursuit of low cost and high interest rate, how to 
improve its competitiveness and become a leading enterprise in furniture industry is an urgent problem for company 
A. The factory is a typical traditional manufacturing enterprise, and its product type is small batch and multi variety. 
At the same time, there are problems such as dark production environment, old processing equipment, frequent round-
trip flow between working procedures, and unreasonable product process route. The above problems lead to large 
reduction of production capacity, low utilization rate of personnel and equipment, and serious impact on production 
efficiency [1]. The factory mainly produces office appliances such as desks, filing cabinets and other products. In the 
process of optimization and improvement, this paper selects the representative type B products as the research object, 
and makes the general process flow chart, as shown in Figure 1.

1. Instroduction 
In order to adapt to the market changes and match the speed of tableware recycling with the flow of people, it is 
imperative to optimize and improve the recycling process of tableware. There are two peak periods in every dining 
hall: noon and evening. There are two recycling places on each floor of the dining hall, and each recycling place is 
equipped with one operator. Operators need to remove, classify and recycle tableware. Due to the current situation, 
such as the increase of the flow of people in peak period, the variety of tableware and the random operation of 
operators, the dishware recycling process is not smooth, the tableware is overstocked, the tableware is placed scattered, 
the utilization rate of personnel and equipment is low, and the labor intensity of operators is high.  
This study takes the second dining hall of our school as an example to optimize and improve the recycling place 
of tableware, improve its recycling efficiency, and further achieve lean recycling management.  
 
2. Research background 
The present situation of the tableware recycling place is composed of process, working area and operators. Tableware 
recycling process can be divided into student process and operator process, and equipment layout is work area layout.            
After field investigation and data collection, the overall layout of the working area of the tableware Recycling 
Office is shown in Figure 1. ① The size of the existing worktable is 2200mm long, 800mm wide and 900mm high. 
The working table is mainly divided into two parts: one is the tableware placing table, which allows customers to 
place the tableware; the other is the residue treatment platform, which is composed of two residue ports and two 
residue recovery barrels.  ② The area behind the operator is the place where the tableware is placed, and the processed

According to the comparison of the time required for full staff to handle a single plate before and after the 
improvement (Table 6), it can be concluded that after the improvement, the processing time of a single plate is reduced 
from 7S to 5.676s, and the work efficiency is increased by 19.2%. 
5.3 Flexsim simulation was used to compare the data before and after improvement 
Flexsim simulation is used to compare the data before and after the improvement. Through the improvement and 
innovation of worktable and work area and the setting of operation standards, the time for operators to process 
tableware after improvement is obtained, which is used as a variable parameter to simulate the improved system again 
with Flexsim software [6]. The comparison of simulation results before and after improvement is shown in Table 7.

Compared with the simulation results before the improvement, the maximum stacking amount of worktable is 
reduced from 8 to 6, the longest waiting time is reduced from 55.83s to 28.47s, the average waiting time is reduced 
from 10.62s to 3.57s, and the average waiting time is reduced to 33.6% of the original. The efficiency of the whole 
process of tableware recycling is improved, and the phenomenon of tableware stacking is greatly alleviated. 
 
6. Summary 
The results of this paper show that traditional IE combined with operations research and lingo can solve the furniture 
production problem of cluster type very well [14]. The traditional IE method is used to solve the bottleneck process 
problem, which reduces the total production line time of workshop 1 by 78S. Operations research combined with lingo 
solves the production line balance problem, making the production line balance rate reach more than 86% [15], which 
provides a theoretical reference for solving furniture production problems. 
In this study, 5W1H, ECRs and other analytical methods were used to analyze the situation of tableware stacking 
in the recycling place. Using human factors engineering and mechanical structure innovation, the recycling table and 
recycling equipment were designed and improved.  
(1) On the basis of reducing unnecessary actions such as bending, the working efficiency of staff is greatly 
improved, and the accumulation of tableware in peak period is reduced; through the application of human factors 
engineering, the degree of injury to waist muscles caused by staff bending for a long time is reduced, the workload of 
employees is reduced, and the employees' sense of identity with the company is improved.   
(2) Through the innovative design of mechanical structure,the maximum stacking amount of worktable is reduced 
from 8 to 6, the longest waiting time is reduced from 55.83s to 28.47s, the average waiting time is reduced from 10.62s 
to 3.57s, and the average waiting time is reduced to 33.6% of the original, improve the recycling rate of tableware and 
reduce the workload of the staff to a certain extent.             
The mechanical innovation involved in this study has good popularization. The sorting and recycling basket can 
be applied to all kinds of canteens, restaurants, and company canteens to improve the sorting speed of chopsticks and 
spoons; the convenient transportation recycling basket can be applied to the shelves of supermarkets and enterprise 
warehouses, which can reduce the secondary handling of personnel and reduce the workload. And the design is simple 
mechanical structure, low processing cost, high economy.

1. Introduction 
Human resources have an important role in the company (Cascio, 2015). According to Augustrianto (2019) human 
resource management is the science and art of managing the relationships and roles of the workforce to be effective and 
efficient in helping the company achieve its goals. Human resources have functions and objectives in helping a company 
to grow (Kasmir, 2016). PT Hariff is a company engaged in the defense sector. As a company engaged in the defense 
sector, which of course this company collaborates a lot with other parties and this company is also very concerned about 
the production process and quality to provide satisfaction to potential customers, therefore human resources play a very 
important role to be needed in each company (Guest, 1997). In implementing human resource management activities, the 
company must create a good organizational culture (Cameron & Quinn, 1999) and knowledge sharing to improve 
employee performance (Rohim & Budhiasa, 2019). Employee performance is defined as the employee's ability to perform 
certain skills (Amir, 2015). Employee performance is very necessary because with this performance, it will be known 
how far their ability is in carrying out the tasks assigned to them (Luturlean et al.,2021). For this reason, it is necessary 
to determine clearly and measure the criteria needed for the situation applied. 
Based on pre-questionnaire results regarding employee performance variables regarding punctuality of attendance, the 
majority answered on a scale of 2 (disagree) with the percentage in the first statement of 33% of the 10 employees who 
answered. In the second statement, namely, having knowledge of the majority of work answered on a scale of 3 (neutral) 
with a percentage of 50% of the 15 employees who answered. And in the statement having commitment and 
responsibility, the majority answered on a scale of 3 (neutral) with a percentage of 37% of the 11 employees who 
answered. The factor that can improve employee performance is that the company must create a good organizational 
culture. Organizational culture is essentially the organization's basic values, which will act as a basis for behaving and 
acting for all members of the organization (Cooke & Szumal, 1993). Organizational culture is how people behave in 
organizations and it is a set of norms consisting of beliefs, attitudes, core values, and shared behavior patterns in 
organizations (Silvianita & Tan, 2017). 
The organizational culture can improve employee performance, such as knowledge sharing, which is defined as a 
systematic process of sending, distributing, and disseminating from an individual or organization to other people or 
organizations in need through various methods and media (Silvianita & Tan, 2017). The process aims to optimize the use

the influence of organizational culture variables (X1) and knowledge sharing (X2) on employee performance (Y) is 0.437. 
or 43.7% and while the remaining 56.3% is the influence of other variables. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion that has been done previously regarding the influence of organizational 
culture and knowledge sharing on the performance of employees of PT. Hariff Daya Tunggal Engineering, it can be 
concluded which can provide answers to the problems formulated in this study are as follows:

Organizational culture at PT. Hariff Daya Tunggal Engineering within good category. 
b. Knowledge sharing at PT. Hariff Daya Tunggal Engineering within good category. 
c. 
Employee performance at PT. Hariff Daya Tunggal Engineering within good category. 
d. Organizational culture has a positive and significant influence on the performance of PT. Hariff Daya Tunggal 
Engineering. Knowledge Sharing has a positive and significant impact on the performance of PT. Hariff Daya 
Tunggal Engineering. Organizational culture and knowledge sharing simultaneously have a positive and 
significant influence on the performance of employees PT. Hariff Daya Tunggal Engineering because it has a 
determination coefficient of 43.7%, then the third hypothesis can be accepted.

Abstract 
This research was conducted to analyze service quality dimensions using the importance-performance 
analysis (IPA) method in Warunk Upnormal Jalan Riau Bandung. The purpose of this study was to determine 
customer expectations for service quality dimensions, to determine the reality of service quality dimension 
performance and to find out what aspects need to be improved on Warunk Upnormal Jalan Riau Bandung. This study 
uses quantitative methods with descriptive research types. Sampling is done by non-probability sampling method 
type of incidental sampling. Data analysis techniques used are descriptive analysis, analysis (GAP), and importance-
performance analysis (IPA). 
Based on the descriptive analysis test results, it is known that customer expectations for the dimensions of 
service quality are in the important category with a percentage of 82.8%. While the reality of performance on service 
quality dimensions is in the category of satisfaction with a percentage of 78%. Based on the importance-performance 
analysis (IPA) results, the aspects that must be improved are on the dimensions of empathy and responsiveness.

Introduction 
The culinary business can be called an all-time business that has special prospects. Moreover, the city of Bandung is 
a city of culinary tourism that is often trending on social media. Shifting behavior also occurs among Bandung 
consumers in awareness to use green products (Moeliono et al., 2020). In addition, changes in people's lifestyles 
continue to encourage the growth of the cafe industry. This is because now many people choose to socialize or gather 
at cafes (Hasbi et al., 2020). One of the famous cafes in Bandung today is Warunk Upnormal. Bandung has a large 
potential market share to open a culinary business for entrepreneurs. Warunk Upnormal Bandung was first established 
in June 2014, on Jalan PHH Mustofa No. 73 Bandung. Warunk Upnormal also opened 12 branches in the Bandung 
area. Branches of Warunk Upnormal have spread in several cities in Indonesia, this requires Warunk Upnormal to 
provide good quality service to customers. According to Cronin and Taylor (1992), two main factors that affect service 
quality are expected service and perceived service. 
From the results of the questionnaire's distribution above on the empathy dimension, the statement of Warunk 
Upnormal waiters being fast in serving customers has a disagreement percentage of 66.7% because the number of 
customers makes the waiter's performance longer. Then the Warunk Upnormal waiter statement is responsive to the 
customer's wishes and has a disagreement percentage of 56.7% because sometimes the waiter does not pay attention 
to the wishes conveyed by the customer. It appears that the Upnormal service quality of Warunk is quite good, but 
there are still dimensions that have more disagreements. Therefore, researchers are interested in researching ""Service 
Quality Dimensional Analysis Using the Importance-Performance Analysis Method at Warunk Upnormal Jalan Riau 
Bandung""

payments, Warunk Upnormal waiters are knowledgeable of all the menus in the restaurant and polite to the customers. 
3. Quadrant III (Low priority) 
The third quadrant contains factors that are considered in low level of perception and actual performance, its not 
important nor expected by the consumers. Therefore the companies do not need to prioritize or pay more attention to 
these factors. From the results of the diagram, five attributes are grouped into this quadrant such as: Upnormal Warunk 
waiters understand the needs conveyed by customers, Warunk Upnormal waiters are alert in helping customers, 
Upnormal Warunk waitresses are friendly to customers, Warunk Upnormal waiters are responsive to customer wishes, 
Warunk Upnormal waiters can convey information clearly. 
4. Quadrant IV (Possibly overkill) 
The fourth quadrant considered as overdo and not too important nor expected by consumers. Therefore the company 
is better off allocating the resources associated with these factors to other factors with a higher priority. From the 
results of the diagram, there are four attributes that grouped into quadrant IV such as: Warunk Upnormal has an 
interesting interior design, Warunk Upnormal has a fun game, Warunk Upnormal uniform is neat, Warunk Upnormal 
has a secure parking area. 
 
5. 
Conclusion 
Based on the calculation and data processing, several conclusions can be drawn to summarize the result in this study, 
which is: 
1. The level of customer expectations regarding service is within the important category, with 82.8%. 
2. The level of performance occurred within the satisfied category with a total average percentage of 72.8%. 
3. The aspects that need to be improved in increasing the dimensions of service quality in the Upnormal Bandung 
City warunk are based on Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA). Warunk Upnormal servants must responsive 
in resolve customer complaints and Warunk Upnormal servants must be faster in serving customers.

Abstract 
 
Manufacturing companies are companies that aim to produce certain goods. In the production, companies need to have 
accurate production planning. One of the affected production planning is the number of Work in process (WIP) owned 
by the company. If the amount of owned WIP is too large, then the company has large deposited funds, that is affecting 
the company's cash flow. In addition, the presence of a large number of WIPs can potentially cause death stock which 
is a loss for the company also. After doing the research, it was found that the main cause of the large number of WIPs 
was the lack of coordination that is occurred between PPC and production department, and furthermore it was found 
that hand written records is the root of the problem. Therefore, it is necessary to make improvements, by using shop 
floor management system. By Applying the shop floor management system is expected to eliminate problems that 
occur in the company due to large number of WIP owned by the company

1. Introduction 
 
This research will study will be implemented by using case study from a company. in Surabaya. The 
implementation of supply chain in company is started from the availability of raw materials to finish good goods. 
According to Tan, Jamaludin & Hamzah (2018) that in manufacturing companies, Work in Process (WIP) is very 
important in determining inventory levels and processing sequences. Knowing the movement of WIP is important, 
because the number of WIPs determines the efficiency of the process and determines the lead time. The following is 
one of the company's production plans. Table 1 is example of order for production planning

180","5.2 Managerial Analysis  
 
The result after applied shop floor management system in the company are showed in the number of cases 
caused by coordination problems was being much less, with fewer problems in the company, and number of WIP was 
also decreased. The other things such as the number of conflicts was also decreased. In addition, by applying a shop 
floor management system, it has successfully reduce the employee working hours, because there was no recording on 
paper, and production data is more organized and centralized 
 
The solution offered was the author to help the other manufacture company that have same problem about 
excessive WIP is creating a system that processes integrated each other. When each processes integrated, then each 
member from various departments can find the number of processes in each process, and if there are problems, they 
can be handled quickly so that they do not interfere with the production planning that has been made, and also problems 
with shipping to customers can be avoided  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The conclusion of this research is by applied a shop floor management system, it was reduced the number of 
WIP by 36121 pcs. The reduction in the number of WIPs was also affected to the cost reduction in the company for 
IDR 541.815.000. The existence of a shop floor management system is a good method for manufacturing companies 
to help maintain or even increase productivity, because it can monitor and control productivity, and the obtained data 
is real time, and also when there are problems, various parties can be involved directly solve the problems

190","Based on the results of research that has been done regarding the influence of the use of 
influencers on the purchasing decisions of Kripik Belings, several conclusions were obtained in 
this study. Several conclusions can be drawn which are expected to provide answers to the 
problems formulated in this study, namely as follows: Based on the descriptive analysis that has 
been done by the researcher on the respondents' responses to the influencer variable, the calculation 
results are 88%, and on the continuum line it can be seen that the score is included in the very high 
category. This shows that the selection of @keanuagl as an influencer to promote the “Kripik 
Belings”, is right. Based on the descriptive analysis that has been carried out by researchers on 
respondents' responses to the dependent variable, namely purchasing decisions, the calculation 
results are obtained by 58% and on the continuum line it can be seen that the score is included in 
the sufficient category. According to Adhimurti & Gabriella (2019: 56) stated that social media 
influencers do indeed affect the purchasing decisions of Generation Z consumers, but found other 
variables (independent/X) that also influence consumer purchasing decisions (dependent/Y), 
including the quality of influencer content, image influencer, reach shown through the number of 
followers, likes, and comments, resonance shown through share, and relevance shown through the 
similarity of the influencer's profile with the respondent's personality. Based on the results of the 
coefficient of determination of the influence of the use of influencers on the purchasing decisions 
of “Kripik Belings”,, it can be seen that the value of the coefficient of determination of R square 
in this study is 0.352 or 35.2%, which means that the variable use of influencers influences 
purchasing decisions by 35.2%. While the remaining 64.8% is influenced by other variables or 
factors not examined in this study. 
For business owners, it is better to The company is expected not to be complacent in 
carrying out the strategies that have been carried out. Influencers are indeed able to improve 
purchasing decisions, but on the other hand, there are many factors that make consumers decide to 
make a purchase, so that the “Kripik Belings”, should be able to pay attention to these other factors, 
such as the content presented by the influencer, and whether the image of the influencer is in 
accordance with the intended consumer. 
Although the influencers used by kripik belings are on the rise and can influence consumers to 
make purchases, they should not be used as the only marketing communication strategy to promote 
their products. The selection of the @keanuagl influencer has been rightly done by kripik belings, 
but there is nothing wrong with increasing offline promotions in order to get balanced results, 
which can influence consumer purchasing decisions.

Abstract  
 
The construction of a Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant in Indonesia has a high urgency to be realized in a short period. 
However, many significant factors arise during mechanical and electrical works that cause delays. Therefore, 
contractors need to plan the project carefully by anticipating all possibilities to minimize potential delays. With 
WBS, delay risks can be identified in smaller elements up to the resources level to avoid project time overrun 
effectively. This study aims to develop a risk-based WBS standard to improve mechanical and electrical works' time 
performance in Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant Construction Projects. Data was collected using questionnaire 
surveys from contractors involved in Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant Construction Projects and analyzed using the 
Delphi method and qualitative risk analysis. The result of this study is a WBS standard for mechanical and electrical 
works of a Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant Construction Project that contains the scope of works up to 8 levels. This 
study also identifies 47 responses of the 13 highest risks which affect project time performance as input for risk-
based standardized WBS development to prevent, reduce, or eliminate possible events that can delay the completion 
of the Construction Project.

1. Introduction 
In order to increase economic growth through infrastructure development in Indonesia, the government is making 
efforts to accelerate projects that are considered strategic and have high urgency to be realized in a short period. 
Based on Presidential Decree no. 56 of 2018, the construction of a Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant (CFSPP) is one of 
the Indonesian National Strategic Project programs in terms of the Acceleration of 35,000 MW Electricity 
Infrastructure Development. Power Plant Construction is a complex infrastructure project due to its many 
uncertainties and inherent risks, thus requiring proper management to run the project according to the targets and 
plans (Zegordi et al., 2012). 
 
However, delays often occur in the mechanical and electrical works of CFSPP construction projects in Indonesia and 
have become a phenomenon. PLTU Jeranjang 2, Lombok, experienced Commercial Operation Date's setback from 
2014 to 2020 because, among others, of design changes during the project, which led to much additional work and 
eventually caused a delay in project completion from the initial planned target time (Noviyanthi et al., 2018). PLTU 
Lontar Extension, Banten's Commercial Operation Date, was initially scheduled in 2016 and suffered a setback until 
2020; one of the reasons was the delay in the procurement of critical materials due to design error (Nugraha and 
Radhi, 2017). Sodikin (2013) also found that one of the leading causes of delays in mechanical and electrical works 
of several CFSPP construction projects in Indonesia was the delay in providing PLTU critical equipment such as 
steam turbines, boilers, and generators.

5. Conclusion 
The result of this study can be concluded as follows: 
• 
The standardized WBS for mechanical and electrical works of the CFSPP construction project were 
decomposed into eight levels. Level 0 is the system as the main deliverable, namely ≥ 50 MW CFSPP (PC 
Boiler type). Level 1 is the sub-system grouping of the CFSPP. Level 2 is sub-sub-system grouping, 
namely the breakdown from the previous sub-system. Level 3 is the project phase grouping. Level 4 is 
discipline grouping in each phase. Level 5 is the sub-work of each discipline. Level 6 is the work package. 
Level 7 is the activity in producing each work package based on the selected method and design. Lastly is 
level 8, which is the resource breakdown from each activity.  
• 
Risks that affect the performance of mechanical and electrical works of the CFSPP construction project 
were then identified from the WBS standard, with a total of 89 risk events. The 13 highest risks were 
determined based on survey results and experts validation. Those consist of the two highest risks in the 
work package category; the two highest risks in the alternative method/design category; the two highest 
risks in the activity category; the two highest risks in the materials resource category; and the two highest 
risks in the tools and techniques resource category; and one highest risk in the environmental category. 
• 
From the highest risks, 28 preventive actions and 19 corrective actions were formulated in response to these 
risks. These risk responses then became additional or recommended activities which, if implemented, can 
prevent or reduce the impact of risk events that can cause project delays. The risk-based WBS standard 
serves as the basis in project planning and controlling the time performance to achieve project goals 
completed on time.

Abstract  
 
The Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant development project has a crucial role in encouraging economic growth. The Coal-
Fired Steam Power Plant is a complex EPC project that often experiences delays in its completion. One of the factors 
influencing delays is scope changes. The delay of this Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant project can be overcome with a 
clear scope through the approach of project management tools, called WBS. This study aims to the development of 
risk-based standardized WBS for civil and structural works of Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant construction projects in 
Indonesia to improve time performance. Work Breakdown Structure is a decomposition of activities so that the project 
is easier to manage, and it can increase the probability of project success. The development of WBS standards using 
expert surveying and validation methods includes the highest risks affecting project time performance. The standard 
WBS for civil and structural works of the CFSPP project consists of 9 levels and 14 dominant risks to time 
performance. The recommended risk response is preventive and corrective measures to analyze the impact of dominant 
risks on-time performance.

1. Introduction 
According to Indonesian Act, No. 14 of 2017, electricity infrastructure is anything related to the power plant, 
electricity transmission, electricity distribution, substation, and other supporting facilities. Power plant development 
has a crucial and strategic role in realizing national development goals. The provision of power plants goes hand in 
hand with the development progress to be available in an even amount. The power plant project is a project that 
implements EPC contracts (Tsolas, 2020). According to Soeharto (2001), the EPC project is complex, complicated, 
and full of problems. The contract with the EPC model is unique because the contractor's function on the EPC project 
starts from the planning, procurement, and construction phase (Yasin, 2014).  
 
The development of 10,000 MW steam power plant in its implementation has faced many problems, one of which is 
dominated by delays in project completion (Sudirman and Simanjuntak, 2018). Some Coal-Fired Steam Power Plant 
projects are delayed, namely the Tembilahan Power Plant and Teluk Sirih Power Plant (Putri et al., 2017; Safira et al., 
2020). Both projects are subject to constraints on civil and structural works. Based on RUPTL data, the Tembilahan 
Power Plant project can only reach Commercial Operation of Date or COD in 2018. This is due to the delay in the 
work of the foundation which is an item of civil work and structure. Items of civil and structural works in the 
Tembilahan Power Plant project are experiencing delays that have not been resolved.  
 
Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate the risks of this work item (Putri et al., 2017). In addition, the Teluk 
Sirih Power Plant project is experiencing an extension of time due to the difference in pile depth between field work 
and planning (Safira et al., 2020). Clear scope definitions and well-structured configuration management can address 
project delays through a project management approach (Yang and Wei, 2010). Gladysz (2015) explains that the lack 
of standardization causes the control elements to time and cost not be fully defined. WBS in formal form as a project 
management tool has an important role in the project from the planning stage to the implementation stage (Suanda,

5. Conclusions 
The purpose of the first research shows the results of the development where the CFSPP as System Level 0 will form 
the WBS level into 9 levels. The development of this standard WBS can assist managers in project planning and 
control. The second objective of the research resulted in 14 dominant risks and the highest risk score was obtained 
from the work package category at Level 7 WBS. The third research objective shows that there are 33 preventive 
actions and 29 corrective actions which are then grouped into 5 categories. Each additional risk response cannot be 
adopted directly into the WBS structure but can be a prerequisite as an additional management or work plan 
requirement in this study. Recommendation additional prerequisites/response actions depend on the policies and 
decisions of the company or project to what extent it wants to control the work. The standard risk-based WBS can be 
used as the basis for time planning to assist project implementation. In addition, a risk-based WBS can be developed 
to minimize the impact of each risk, such as delayed work, design changes, to imperfect work results.

Abstract  
 
There is always uncertainty when implementing a project using an EPC contract, as the projects involved are very 
complex and risk affecting the performance of the project. Since one of these is the time performance of the project, 
it is necessary to identify the risks that may affect the time performance in order to minimize the decrease in the time 
performance so that the project can proceed according to the goal. It is necessary to develop a risk-based WBS to 
avoid poor time performance in the project implementation process. Because WBS is an effective tool for project 
management in planning and implementing a successful project. This study aims to develop risk-based WBS standards 
for CFSPP construction project preparatory, instrumentation and control works to improve time performance. The 
results of this study are WBS standards for the preparatory, instrumentation and control works of CFSPP construction 
projects consisting of eight (8) levels up to resources, 14 risk factors with the highest ranking in all risk categories, 
and 5 groups of risk response recommendations for improving time performance as the development of WBS standards

1. Introduction 
In engineering procurement construction (EPC) contracts, the project execution process is tied to a very complex 
project, so there is always uncertainty that can affect project performance, such as project time performance. 
Therefore, it is necessary to identify risks that may have an impact time performance to minimize declining time 
performance (Putra, 2013) so that the project can run according to targets and plans (Zegordi et al., 2012). 
Some effective techniques that can be applied for planning in EPC projects are developing WBS, arranging activities 
in sequence, establishing activity relationships, setting duration, setting milestones, planning resources, and 
determining project critical paths (Ud & Tahir, 2004). Because WBS is an effective tool for project management in 
planning and implementing a successful project (Burghate, 2018) and risk management needs to be well planned for 
the CFSPP project, because being able to manage the impact of risk on the project is a key factor for the success of 
project management (Iranmanesh et al., 2007). 
The object of this research is CFSPP which uses coal as fuel with a capacity of 50 MW – 100 MW, boiler with PC 
(Pulverized Coal) type and located on the coast of Indonesia, development of risk-based standardized WBS (Work 
Breakdown Structure) for Preparatory, Instrumentation and Control Works only focuses on the main process areas of 
CFSPP, namely Boiler & Auxiliary System and Steam Turbine Generator & Auxiliary System because they are in the 
critical path of the project schedule.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
From the obtained research results it can be concluded that: 
1) WBS Standard Form for Preparatory Work, Instrumentation and Control Work of CFSPP Projects in Indonesia, it 
was found that the WBS standard was decomposed into 8 levels to resources with an explanation of each level as 
follows WBS Level 0 – Project Name, WBS Level 1 – Sub System, WBS Level 2 – Sub-sub System, WBS Level 
3 – Project Phase, WBS Level 4 – Discipline, WBS Level 5 – Sub Work, WBS Level 6 – Work Package, WBS 
Level 7 – Work Activity, WBS Level 8 – Resources. Alternative of work methods become the shape of work 
activity and resources breakdown. 
2) The risks in this study that affect time performance are identified based on the critical path of the past CFSPP 
project schedule. From the results of the survey of respondents and the final expert validation related to the highest 
risk factor rankings in the preparatory work, instrumentation and control work of the CFSPP project that affect the 
time performance of the 70 risk variables, 59 variables were found in the high-risk category. Then the 2 highest 
rankings in each risk category were taken to be studied further in order to answer research questions 3. 
3) Based on literature, the preventive and corrective actions taken from an activity with high risk factors to develop 
the risk-based WBS standard against time performance, then the 14 highest risk factors that have been verified by

681","the experts got some WBS development input formulated as follows additional management, additional other 
WBS, additional related WBS, additional job requirements (Technical Specification), affect productivity 
coefficients. With a risk response, risk events that have a negative impact on time performance can be prevented 
and the project can run on target. 
 
The following is the author's recommendation so that this research can be further developed: 
This research is only limited to the Main Process Area of  CFSPP project, then it can be developed for other areas 
such as Utility and offsite related to the WBS standard starting from level 5 (Sub-sub work) to the resource level, as 
well as identifying the risks so that the CFSPP project can be easily managed. This research only analyzes project data 
archives and distributes questionnaires in CFSPP projects in Indonesia, then WBS standards can be developed for 
other power plant projects. Further studies related to the performance of other projects by considering the existing 
WBS standards so that risk identification can be appropriate and structured.

Abstract 
 The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the number of suppliers and defective communication with 
the logistics process in construction projects and how it affects its performance, specifically in Malaysia. The study was 
conducted in a qualitative format, with four semi-structured interviews. These interview sessions were performed with 
construction players such as senior quantity surveyor, assistant project manager and project executive. In addition, the collected 
data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. As a result, there are six (6) factors, namely numbers of strategic 
suppliers, effective communication, tracking facilities, cost transparency, early involvement of suppliers at the design stage and 
benchmarking, that have been identified that can boost logistics performance in construction. However, for this paper, only two 
factors were highlighted, and three (3) sub-factors have been discovered that would affect the performance of construction 
logistics in Malaysia. As a result, a positive outcome of this study would be to contribute to the acquisition of current research 
knowledge and make recommendations for future research.

1. Introduction 
 
Nowadays, logistics and distribution are getting more complex and advanced than before. Originated from the 
military sector, logistics is seen as planning and moving and maintaining military forces. Logistics shows its 
importance during world war II, where the army operation such as movement of food supply, medicine, soldiers, 
artilleries and others across the border (Kain & Verma, 2018). Logistics in the military sector have been practised 
since old age, and modern military shows substantial need to solve logistics problems. In this current era, logistics 
management can be defined as  the fragment of the supply chain management that schedules, manages and regulates 
the practical, effective forward and reverse movement and storage of products, resources and related information

logistics performance.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
From this exploratory analysis, it can be conclude that there are several emerging elements from the theme of 
“number of suppliers” and “defective communication” that may affect the performance of logistics in construction 
industry especially in context of Malaysia. All in all, this paper concluded that by improving strategic suppliers and 
strengthening communication among construction parties are very crucial especially to logistic process in 
construction project to bridging the gap to improve logistics performance. By reviewing the interview data, it seems 
like there is still a room for improvement to establish their supply base and communication system. They were still 
bound by the adversarial character of the conventional construction working culture. Thus, it will require all parties in 
the project to implement the changes. It is time for them to shift their perspectives and attitudes. These  phenomena 
that have been discovered will require an in-depth exploration to extend and understand its capability and ability for 
future improvement. More players in construction industry views on the same background should be applied for 
future report.

Abstract 
The Safety Instrumented System (SIS) is an automated system used to implement one or more safety instrumented functions. A SIS, like 
the Emergency Shutdown (ESD) system, consists of any combination of sensor(s), safety PLC(s) and final element(s) (e.g.  ESD valves). 
ESD valves are the last line of defense against risks, although the ESD valve has high performance, the data (based on expert judgment and 
OREDA database) indicates that ESD valves failures are the most critical in the ESD systems. 
In order to improve the reliability and safety of these valves, we applied the FMEDA diagnostic technique. We started with a decomposition 
of the ESD valve to the subsystems and we identified their functions. Then we described the failure modes, their mechanisms, their sites 
and their effects. Then we identified the impact of each failure mode according to the criticality classes and identified the failure rates and 
their class according to the criticality and the detectability by automatic diagnosis of each mode and from the failure rates we calculated the 
Safe Failure Fraction (SFF) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) required and we concluded that the actuator subsystem is the most critical 
system. Finally, we proposed preventive and protective measures to eliminate or reduce the risk of failure.

Abstract 
Modern steel operations demand more than traditional automation and supervisory systems in order to push higher 
the levels of efficiency and optimization. The impact of digitalization is reshaping this industry. Data insights are now 
available for the optimization of the operations, digital vision systems span from surface defects detection to online 
inventory updates. The capabilities of the shop floor personnel can be augmented by AR and remote assistance. All 
these create new paradigms and new tiers where more efficient and more profitable companies are moving to. The 
paper introduces some aspects of the fourth industrial revolution, including two case studies.

1. Introduction 
The steel-making operation works as the basic unit of functionality for multiple industrial sectors that founded the 
rapid growth of the global economy. It pioneered the emergence of the industrial revolution centuries ago and until 
currently strikes the force towards a fast-moving modernization. Some of the custom applications of the base metal 
are evident in the fields of engineering, machinery, equipment manufacture, railway and bridge construction, energy, 
power, and transportation arrangement. The extensive usage, assuredly, signifies that it is a fundamental backbone 
component by which the circular economy accustoms its capacity to lead the large market. Furthermore, this powerful 
application offers a gateway to broader steel demand worldwide, requiring increased production amounts to various 
business enterprises in heavy industry. 
A recent forecast from The World Steel Association (2021) shows a massive leap of steel demand that ranges to 5.8% 
during the current year. The growth in the succeeding year will further, and expectations run until 1,924.6 Mt of heavy 
metal sales per annum. Such undertaking raises the obligation to revamp the directions of the production chains to-
gether with the environmental and operational variables comprising the metallurgical industry. Moreover, the realiza-
tion that the current peak of steel trade calls after an economical production for running companies implies a momen-
tous alteration to the conventional business model of steel plant operations. While it crosses the commerce line to 
meet the desired output number supplying manufacturing organizations, operations are transitioning ahead with an 
improved, competitive, and dynamic framework. To strengthen it, managing to keep up with technological innovations 
is to coexist alongside the analytical approach of any companies that seek to hone the entire performance of operations 
at the highest level attainable. Ideally, one of the purposive applications is within the realms of the steel-making in-
dustry—the shop floor people, more specifically in the third line of support that resolves major technical concerns, 
rely on statistics, documentation, or analytics upon sorting out the approach. In simple terms, reliable assistance or 
database has to coincide with their tier level. As they take the lead in support management under operational patterns, 
established Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system seldom is insufficient and untimely for analytics. 
In the current period, steel plant operations utilized ERPs for add-on supervisions. Over time ERPs appears in distinct 
profiles, and features vary. However, ERP systems are falling behind time because of outdated features displayed at

214","The reheating furnace of the rolling mill can handle 3 difference sequences: hot charge, cold charge and mix charged. 
The hot charge saves the heating energy from ambient temperature to 800-900ºC, the normal rolling temperature is 
1,100ºC. There are multiple phenomena and factors influencing the balance of the right rolling temperature: higher 
temperatures require less rolling energy, but they contribute to generate a lot of scale losses. Lower temperatures are 
savers for the yield, but require more rolling energy. This is another step for the process optimization in terms of 
OpEx, but also CapEx and it requires a proper choice of the equipment plus cost of utilities and spare parts. 
In this case, starting from raw materials loading to process, the transformation time to finished product in the range of 
3 hours. Fully engineered solutions today can reach as low as 2 hours. 
5.3 Automation and big data applications 
The minimill with steel meltshop, reheating furnace and rolling mill offers much flexibility and quality control of the 
final products and requires sophisticated planning in order to control transformation costs scrap-to-rebar, lead time 
and overall efficiency of maintenance planning to ensure that the stable techno-economical conditions are attained 
and finance does not suffer large capital exposure. This means that it is paramount to decide the production planning 
(to order or to stock) and each department of the minimill has to follow the planning with tight margins on. This is the 
business model for all steel plants to remain competitive nowadays. 
In order to this, the traditional data collection is not enough. The amount of data is huge and the insights can only be 
generated through modern software applications. Moreover, the automation of each plant section, usually each system 
of machines, is stand alone and the only points of communication are ODBC databases or the like (level 2). On top of 
the organization there is ERP (level 4), accounting and finance of the organization, unrelated to what is happening on 
the shop floor. Therefore, all inventories and work-in-progress are tracked manually in most cases, till the finished 
products are available in the inventory and again manually the inventory is updated. MES systems (level 3) come to 
the rescue in these cases. 
Digital technologies find very productive applications in this plant to 1) monitor machines operations and elaborate 
sophisticated preventive maintenance programs, 2) check and predict online the quality of the semi-finished and fin-
ished products. All these features can be enabled by ingesting the data generated by the machines through data gate-
ways and elaborated in the cloud servers. 
TECH-IOMES M is the solution to enable these two big families of functions, starting from any equipment and with 
no disruption of operations. Moreover, they can be fully implemented and maintained from remote. The plant opera-
tors access web-based applications (front-end) connected via internet to the cloud-based applications (back-end). 
5.4 Flexibility and modularity – focus on what drives profitability and care for personnel 
The IIoT applications offer total flexibility, an accurate assessment guided by collaboration partners or internal per-
sonnel elaborates devise the roadmap to digitalization: prioritization based on management guidelines has to choose 
what will come first. 
The stepwise approach is also strongly recommended, being digitalization a profound change project. In fact, the most 
affected personnel can refuse firmly the implementation of such innovations, feared of losing the job. The success 
case in a small area is beneficial both to management and workers, with the advantage to minimize the risk also to 
disrupt all operations when rolled out to the whole organization. To emphasize success at all levels, enabling digital-
ization on final production steps will have catalyzing effects: improving customer satisfaction by delivering better 
experience impacts both the economical KPIs as well as the brand and the morale of the personnel. 
Moreover, the organizational leadership has to emphasize that digitalization, typically enabling artificial intelligence, 
is augmenting the human intelligence rather than replacing it. In the long term, the profile of the shop floor workers 
will feature more technically advanced skills than in the past. This is the way to achieve fully optimized, modern 
operations. 
The future approach will be to have more compact plant units, fully operational and automated, with higher intelligent 
manufacturing systems. These solutions are already available and extensive test runs are in progress. 
6. Conclusion 
Steel mill operation requires a fundamental redesigning in the age of modernization. Both the shop floor and manage-
ment units share how inefficient worksite performance-rooted from inadequate data resources and minimal techno-
logical intervention. On the other hand, the line automation and regular ERPs generally utilized in the production 
processes lag behind time as they have a fair share of feature limitations. Further opportunities in streamlining opera-
tional procedures in L3 units and management are inexistent, creating gaps across all corners. Digitalization frame-
work interfaced with industrial IoT evolutions that evolve in the face of up-to-date programming software embedded 
with sensor capabilities, visualization, and data analytics paved the way to bridging the issue. Through securing up-
to-date ERPs and technological innovations, there resides an improvement in collaborative insight generation among 
the units of the workforce. The analytics and statistical representations have become real-time as it delivers reliable

agement. Furthermore, it concludes that investing towards higher-level ERPs, digital technology, and optimized man-
agement techniques driven by modernization secures the health of steel-making businesses.

Abstract 
 
Over the years, many South African industries have been using Forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one point 
to another till today. The use of large forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing processes poses OHS risks to 
workers as its Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) produces fumes (Carbon Monoxide, CO) when in operation and 
exhaust fumes, (CO), are harmful to human’s health. On this basis, a new system design is recommended to 
eliminate the use of MHS that relies on ICE power source to prevent OHS risks in indoor manufacturing industries. 
In this project, Autodesk Inventor Professional software was used for design development of technical drawings 
and simulation as well as validation of the new system’s structure. Vehicle Dynamics’ principles and equations 
are used to determine the overall Rolling Resistance, Tractive Effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the 
power required to drive the system under 20 – ton load capacity. The new system design has been developed to 
operate using a Hydraulic Power pack source, where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, 
four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. Electro-
Hydraulic circuit systems were developed and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. Again, 
principles, laws and equations of Strength of Materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection 
of the new design system’s structure as well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments. 
The size and type of a Material Handling System (MHS) and/or equipment influences the effectivity of the internal 
logistics within manufacturing industries. Therefore, it is very essential to choose a correct MHS for a correct 
manufacturing process which requires material handling to complete its operation. Incorrect usage or selection of 
an MHS for an operational process may lead to down time, damage to facility, increase in operating costs and/or 
pose Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) risks to workers.

1. Introduction 
This research document covers the selection of materials and components to be used in the manufacture and 
assembly of the new system. Legislation covering lifting machinery, Electrical Machinery, Pressure Equipment 
Regulations, Environmental Regulations for workplace, ISO (international Organization for Standardization), and 
SABS (South African Bureau of Standards) are very strict when coming to materials & component selection and 
the process of manufacture and they need to be adhered to. Therefore, specification of the new system and material 
selection should be accurate in order to achieve correct results and that the new system may be able to perform at 
its design capacity and meeting engineering legislation standards and codes as well as achieving heavy duty 
material handling principles (Mafokwane, at el., 2019). 
 
Again, this document provides a detailed overview for manufacturing process and material selection of the new 
system’s components. Critical components of the new design system will be discussed and assessed, and are 
namely, Hub Bracket (Rear fixed & Front swivel), Main Frame Structure, Split Flange Joint Shaft, Spreader Beam 
and Steering Clamp bracket (Mafokwane, 2021).

drilling, and machining processes. Yield strength of ASTM A36 is less than that of cold roll C1018, thus enabling 
ASTM A36 to bend more readily than C1018. Normally, larger diameters in ASTM A36 are not produced since

8. Conclusion 
In conlusion, main objective of this research has been achieved through the design and development of the new 
proposed Material Handling System that is capable of replacing the use of very big forklift trucks within indoor 
manufacturing companies. Large forklift trucks rely on Internal Combustion Engine power source which 
unfortunately poses health risks to workers. ICE produces exhaust fumes (Carbon Monoxide) while running. 
Exhaust fumes are harmful to human health (Apple, 1972) & (Health & Safety, 2008). 
Therefore, the research beacame a success whereby a new proposed MHS has been designed using Autodesk 
Inventor Professional and material selection of the new design system’s components has been carried out and 
verified in relation with their strength & reliability properties and high strength properties. Technical design shapes 
and drawing have been populated as well through Autodesk Inventor Professional. Material chosen of component 
manufacturing of the new design system are readily available from the market, that means there is no need to 
mould any component when manufacturing (Mafokwane and Kallon, 2021).

Abstract 
Nowadays, health has become one of the most prioritized aspects of human life. This problem is caused by the outbreak 
of covid-19 the world currently experiencing that can lead to the death of a person's life. As dangerous as covid-19 
symptoms are, it can be prevented by keeping our hygiene clean. However, public facilities' sanitation is not well 
maintained as fewer staff are working on it due to the pandemic, such as the table around the area. Because of this, we 
create a product called ""Instant Desk Cleaner,"" which is an automated product that at the same time can clean and 
disinfect a table to prevent the virus from staying on the table and preserving the hygiene of people who are going to 
use it. We created this product from the survey to find the customer's concern and needs during this pandemic era. 
Moreover, we created four product concepts and narrow them down to the final concept by concept selection. Then, 
we created the 3D image of the product by using Autodesk Fusion 360 to make a suitable dimension of the product 
that can fit easily and operates effectively on the table.

1. Introduction 
Covid-19 pandemic is one of the disasters that the world is currently experiencing. Covid-19 or commonly referred to 
as the coronavirus, is a virus that attacks the human respiratory tract, which causes a person to have symptoms such 
as high fever, cough, flu, shortness of breath, and sore throat. In Indonesia, there is currently an outbreak of Covid-19 
caused by a coronavirus, resulting in the death of a person's life [11]. This condition shows that the essential thing in 
people's lives right now is their health. Due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus, many aspects of life have changed, 
such as forming a lifestyle and work stay at home, virtual optimization in various fields, and the emergence of 
togetherness and a sense of the same fate [10]. But not everyone agrees, and some of them still go outside the house 
to earn income to support their economy. Because of this, the government applies a new regulation called the new 
normal. The government made the new normal regulation to accelerate the handling of covid-19 in the health and 
socio-economic aspects, employing people adapting to daily life in this pandemic situation [12]. 
In applying the new normal regulation, many aspects need to be considered. One of them is the cleanliness in public 
facilities. Cleanliness in public facilities is paramount to people due to the virus spread by touching contaminated 
objects and surfaces [14]. If public facilities are not kept clean, people will be exposed to the virus. For instance, in 
general, a table is used by someone to complete a task they are doing or eat and drink. The coronavirus can survive 
on a table's surface within a week, depending on the material used. If it is not cleaned, those who use the table will get 
the coronavirus. 
 
To preserve the table's cleanliness in public facilities, a tool that can both disinfect and clean the table at the same time 
is needed and this product is safe to be operated on the table. Therefore, we designed a table cleaning tool that is user-
friendly to operate. With this table cleaning tool, users do not need to be concerned as this product is guaranteed can 
effectively and efficiently clean the table. This product will be automated as technology keeps growing and product 
these days use automation technology, which gives many benefits such as an increase in productivity and no human 
error occur during operating [13].

Abstract 
 
Agroindustry is a key component of Indonesia's economic system which has been experiencing “VUCA (Volatile, 
Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous)” as the most critical set of challenges recently. This study is the first to provide an 
overview of the agroindustry with a framework focused on the Indonesia Poultry Industry. Apart from playing an 
important role in the national economy, the poultry industry also provides a protein source for Indonesian people, 
with a 7.8 kg consumption per capita per year in 2019. This study aims to describe the challenges of the Indonesian 
poultry industry under VUCA conditions. The exploratory method was used to identify the potential factors through 
literature reviews and in-depth interviews with poultry industry practitioners. Furthermore, results were based on 
data obtained from primary and secondary sources. This research identified the various VUCA factors affecting 
businesses across Indonesia’s poultry industry. These include volatile conditions due to fluctuations in live bird 
prices, uncertain conditions due to chicken meat imports, and the unavailability of food chain facilities. The complex 
and ambiguous conditions occurred due to chicken meat oversupply and cartel practices. Finally, the research results

1. Introduction 
Agroindustry is a key component of the Indonesia economic system. The agroindustry refers to a subset of the ""farm 
to fork"" activities in the value-chain (FAO-UNIDO, 2015). According to Sukardi (2011), agroindustry manufactures 
products whose main components come from animals or plants. Furthermore, agro-industry also creates conditions 
that support advanced industries with resilient agriculture. Its significance ranges from creating jobs, improving 
income distribution, increasing marketed products' competitiveness and increasing added value, to developing 
agribusiness. It is considered a prospective approach to improving people's welfare, as agroindustry development 
can generate significant added value (Nurhayati & Yandi, 2019). 
 
In recent worldwide developments, the agroindustry shows that its existence is becoming very strategic. 
Nevertheless, it is facing challenges within the business environment, referred to as VUCA (Indonesian Ministry of 
Industry, 2021). According to Horney, Pasmore, & O’Shea, (2010), VUCA is a common acronym which stands for 
Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous. Volatility refers to how quickly an industry, market, or the world 
evolves. Uncertainty is related to the degree to which one can confidently predict the future. The more uncertain the 
world becomes, the hardest it is to predict. Complexity signifies the number of drivers which are required to take 
into consideration their variety and relationship. In a highly complex context, it is not possible to analyze the 
environment and make rational conclusions. The more complicated the world becomes, the more difficult it is to 
study. The ambiguity involves unclear information in the interpretation of something. A situation is ambiguous, such

employee's creative and learning potential, while maintaining an alignment objective in a VUCA business 
environment. Furthermore, organisational and management approaches must be innovative, reduce bureaucracy, and 
change leadership styles and cultures. These are the defining features of business agility. Hirzalla (2010) defined 
business agility as the ability to adapt quickly and profitably in response to changes in the business environment. 
According to Gagnon and Hadaya (2018), there are four dimensions of business agility: operations, research & 
development, transformation, and strategy. In the future, further research on the business agility model in the 
agroindustry is necessary. 
 
Through business agility, a business can better understand its customers and rapidly refocus its product marketing 
strategy to meet their evolving needs. Business agility in the poultry industry manages the system for facing VUCA 
challenges from both business and people perspectives. People or individual interactions will be more involved in 
the activity of businesses over processes and tools. Furthermore, agility helps a business to detect changes in the 
market and react quickly to competing product offers. This enables the business to be more competitive because it 
can change direction at a glance to transform its product offering and take advantage of market opportunities or 
counter potential threats. Implementing agile strategies also require an increased understanding and application of 
agile manifesto and principles. The agile manifesto describes an engaged and contributing customer throughout the 
development process. It also makes it far easier for developers to meet customer needs. Therefore, agile 
principles promote teams' flexibility, and agile manifestos and principles will create an agile mindset in each 
individual. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This research discussed the Indonesian poultry business which currently faces challenges of VUCA conditions. 
Furthermore, it examines how the poultry business reacts to address the VUCA challenges. It was observed that they 
will lose their market share progressively due to their inability to maintain their products relevant to current market 
demand. Financial difficulties may also occur due to their inability to quickly reduce costs during difficult times. If 
this condition does not change, the poultry industry may be acquired, become smaller, or even bankrupt.

Abstract 
The phishing attacks have been drastically rising in numbers in several platforms such as personal and business 
emails, short message services (SMS), and the emerging tactic that is through social media accounts. With the 
vulnerability of social engagement and trust in relationships, the study will show how phishing attacks are easily done 
with just minimal rapport in comparison to unknown senders and promotional links. The creation of a fake phishing 
website has been done and sent to 107 people - 46 via email, 37 via social media chat, and 24 via SMS. Data collection 
has been done through the use of the open-source phishing framework GoPhish for monitoring the links sent via email, 
Google Analytics for links sent via social media chat, and a link click counter for links sent via SMS.  The results 
have shown that out of the three types of phishing methods used, Social Media Phishing is where the targeted users 
are most vulnerable on which has a 24 out of 46 (52.17%) success rate, compared to Email Phishing which has 6 out 
of 37 (16.22%) success rate and Smishing which has a 1 out of 24 (4.17%) success rate.

1. Introduction 
Phishing is a social engineering attack that consists of creating spoofed emails to trick people into revealing 
sensitive information or installation of malicious malware (Hong 2006). Social engineering is the ability of deceiving 
someone in disclosing sensitive information from their targets. Users and organizations are susceptible to phishing 
even with vast security measures as it is based on the user’s awareness of the risk of phishing attacks. Based on the 
Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (2017), 93% of social attacks were phishing related and that 28% of 
phishing attacks are targeted (PhishingBox 2018).  
(Frye 2007) states that Email and Instant Messaging applications are important but vulnerable. Real-time and 
near real-time communications plays a very significant role in a more efficient functioning of an organization, which 
makes it a good target for hackers and social engineers. More and more troublesome and criminal minds are looking 
for more clever ways to trick users into downloading malicious software on their machines, one of these tricks is 
using a phishing attack (Frye 2007).   
Phishing, according to (Jagatic 2007), is a type of deception wherein an attacker acts like a trustworthy person to 
fraudulently gain sensitive information from a victim (Jagatic et al. 2004). Phishing is an email scam that attempts to 
steal personal information from users (Yeboah-Boateng and Amanor 2014). Another attack is Smishing, where attacks 
are conducted using SMS or text messages instead of email which posed risk on mobile device users. Mobile devices 
are as susceptible to phishing attacks as they are as common as desktops. Statista stated that in 2019, 70.7 million 
people accessed the internet through their mobile phones in the Philippines (Sanchez 2020).

of response n)] / (total number of respondents), it yields the equation [(10 * 5) + (4 * 4) + (1 * 3)] / 15 = 4.6 based on 
the targeted users’ answers on the Likert Scale. Based on Table 2 Likert Scale Range, 4.6 falls in the range of Strongly 
Agree, which states that the phishing campaign is effective in spreading awareness in a targeted user’s perspective.   
6. Conclusion 
A Post-Experience Survey has been distributed to 23 targeted users, 8 Email Phishing targeted users (5 who clicked 
the link, and 3 who did not click the link), 12 Social Media targeted users (9 who clicked the link, and 3 who did not 
click the link), and 3 smishing targeted users (1 who clicked the link, and 2 who did not click the link). The results 
show that trust is the greatest factor in why the targeted users have clicked the link. This shows that even if their 
devices or browsers have high levels of security, their interaction, closeness, and trust in other people is their greatest 
vulnerability. Curiosity is the next factor in why the targeted users have clicked the link. This shows that persuading 
skills can be a significant characteristic of a penetration tester when dealing with other people, because getting their 
curiosity can be a way for them to disclose their information.   
The Post-Experience Survey shows that 13 out of 15 (86.67%) target users did not receive any warning messages 
upon opening the phishing link. This shows that hosting a fake website on an online hosting application that has a 
legitimate domain can easily be sent via social media, email, and SMS. If the users trust the sender of the fake website, 
their sensitive information can easily be gathered. On the other hand, suspicion is one of the ways that a user can be 
protected from opening a malicious link. The Post-Experience Survey shows that 6 out of 8 (75%) target users have 
answered that they did not click the link because of their suspicion. This shows that clarifying when suspicion happens 
can be an additional layer of security for people especially for phishing attacks. 2 out of 15(13.33%) target users had 
an encounter with a warning webpage upon accessing the link. These users have used Facebook Messenger to access 
the given link. This shows that Facebook Messenger has a level of security upon sending phishing links.  
Conclusively, the target users have a 4.6 Mean Value on the answers on the Likert Scale about their rating on the 
phishing awareness campaign conducted by the researchers, which falls under the Strongly Agree range. This shows 
that the target users have an overall positive attitude on the process of the phishing campaign.

Abstract 
As we are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, people are coping up with the “new normal” and finding ways to 
prevent transmission of the virus. Pen and paper has been replaced by automation that will make life much easier for 
all.  Radio Frequency Identification or RFID is a type of wireless technology that utilizes radio waves in order to 
transmit data. RFID systems include three parts which are RFID tags, RFID reader, and an antenna. The RFID reader 
and antenna combination sends out radio frequency energy in order to power up the chip in the RFID card for it to be 
able to transfer data. When this type of system is applied in payment transactions like in a cafeteria or canteen, it will 
help eliminate long queues and record inventory and sales within a short amount of time. This paper covers the 
opinions and views of the customers and concessionaires regarding the alternative approach to the current payment 
system of using cash in transactions into a cashless transaction system using RFID technology. The researchers used 
survey questionnaires that made use of the Likert Scale in order to gather data and analyze the results. The paper 
shows comparison between the current and proposed processes and highlights the process which can be eliminated in 
order to improve the current payment system. Furthermore, the study includes a prototype design of the payment 
system with RFID technology.

1. Introduction 
Now that everyone is experiencing the effect of the pandemic, companies and establishments have been slowly 
adjusting for the “New Normal” to be able to continue operating their businesses. The pandemic suddenly became a 
turning point such as having a contact-free economy. The contact-free economy in the sense that e-banks and 
reloadable cards are used as a payment transaction when purchasing. RFID is one of the most convenient and beneficial 
systems in which it can help improve the daily services of a certain company or business (Manoharan and Rakshit, 
2020). 
RFID technology is one of the factors that can help affect the development of the so-called “New Normal” way of 
lifestyle especially in cafeterias because of the variations of features and benefits that it can provide not only for the 
customers but also for the concessionaires. And because of this pandemic, people are afraid to be infected by the virus 
through the use of physical money (Aji et al. 2020). People are still in the process of adopting new practices in the 
current situation hence, some prefer using cash as payment mainly because they lack trust in technology. Another 
problem is that university cafeterias or other establishments before the pandemic do not implement certain systems 
for their process to be more convenient for the customers and the concessionaires present (Marasigan, 2017).  
This research considered the opportunities of implementing a cashless payment system with RFID to Higher Education 
Institution’s (HEI’s) cafeteria to resolve certain issues and improve their services. Further, the system is more 
accessible to the users.

The MyMapua website is a school portal accessible to students wherein they can view important information such as 
schedules, transcripts, payables etc. In the payment history, it contains fees paid for school such as matriculation fees, 
library fine etc. In figure 12, it shows that their transactions using RFID will be recorded in the MyMapua account 
under payment history. This will allow the student to view where the money was spent, date and timestamp and should 
help the student track his/her expenses. It will also show the remaining balance of the student in the reloadable card.  
Conclusion 
RFID is known for its cashless basis transaction on every tollway that the people are driving in, one of its features is 
the convenience it provides for all the drivers in the country. And with the idea of the researchers to bring it to the 
cafeteria of the university, it has gained potential as based on the study conducted. With all the results provided, the 
satisfaction of the students and the concessionaires will definitely increase in time once the said system which is the 
RFID based payment system in the cafeteria of the HEI’s is going to be implemented in the near future. Given all the 
benefits that RFID can provide inside the vicinity, a lot of the customers gladly said that with the production of the 
said payment system it can have the ability to attain the highest potential of the cafeteria inside the university. The 
different features of the RFID based payment system will include the contactless transaction which can be very 
beneficial for the university and mostly after this pandemic that the people are encountering nowadays. One feature 
also is focused on the security of the customers and also the concessionaires itself; one factor that the system gave the 
students is its ability to track and record their transaction within the day which is also very efficient for the students 
and the accurate and efficient reports that it can provide for the concessionaires. The results on the survey conducted 
by the researchers are based on the ideas and opinions of both the customers and concessionaires on the 
implementation of the RFID based transaction system for the cafeteria, the outcome of the said survey attained positive 
feedbacks regarding the benefits of implementing the RFID technology to the cafeteria, some responses contained 
high development of sales and security of the customers while on the other hand, for the concessionaires; they stated 
that it would affect customer satisfaction and the growth of not only the university but also the cafeteria .  
As per the results of the study, it was analyzed that this specific technology which is the RFID technology-
based Transaction System in HEI’s will greatly affect its growth and development as a full standard and competitive 
university among the others. It was also said that this certain implementation will solely benefit the satisfactions of 
both the concessionaires and the students of the university.

Abstract 
 
Sustainability of Public Transport System is a hot topic that has become a rather taboo issue to be discussed in 
South East Asian countries like Bangkok, Thailand  and Jakarta, Indonesia. Malaysia too with its high vehicle 
congestion also belong to this category. The respective government dilemma is whether to increase allocation for 
more highways or to provide more fund to build more Public Transport such as Light Rail Transit (LRT), Mass 
Rapid Transit (MRT) or Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The aim of this study is to identify the determinants and 
challenges in ensuring sustainability of Public Transport in Kuala Lumpur and to propose policy to encourage 
more LRT ridership. The focus of the study is on LRT Kelana Jaya Line as it has higher ridership. A survey would 
be conducted using electronic questionnaires to gather the data for content analysis to be carry out.

1. Introduction 
 
United Nations [UN] had conducted a study which stated that by 2030, 5 billion people are projected to live 
in cities. Due to the high number of people living in cities, there will be cities with high level of pollution and fuel 
consumption demand. UN also came up with seventeen [17] Sustainable Development Goals. For this research, 
we are focusing on Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities - Make Cities and human settlements 
inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 
Sustainable Transportation refers to any means of transportation that is ‘green’ and has low impact on the 
environment. Sustainable transportation is also about balancing our current and future needs. Sustainable Transport 
drives Sustainable Development and it protects and preserve the planet and its resources for generations to come. 
Examples of sustainable transportation include walking, using LRT, MRT and BRT, cycling, transit, carpooling, 
car sharing, and green vehicles. There are five [5] common urban challenges which associated with high number 
of people concentrated in one area. Congestion are the most common problem which usually associated with urban 
areas. The reasons for the congestion is due to the high number of people still using private vehicle to commute 
instead of using public transport. Lack of funds to provide basic services include unable to build a proper road to 
connect from one area to another. There are not enough pedestrian bridge for pedestrian to cross busy streets. Next 
challenges are related to adequate and affordable housing for all population. Currently, the price of property in 
Kuala Lumpur has rocketed and too highly price resulted in people unable to purchase them. Most of the properties 
are to cater for T20 bracket, which is a high income earner.  
Declining infrastructure is concerning facilities that are outdated and need to do major repairs. This declining 
infrastructure can be building, underground water pipes and cables. All of these need to do major repairs work. 
Lastly, air pollution within cities due to the number of vehicles that are on the road. When the number of vehicles 
are high, it will mean more fuel will be burn off and resulted in more emission release to the air. Harmful emission 
will result in air pollution and also result in greenhouse effect. There are three objectives for this study which are 
to identify determinants of developing a sustainable public transport in Kuala Lumpur, to identify challenges of 
developing a sustainable public transport in Kuala Lumpur and lastly to evaluate and propose policy to push for 
sustainable public transport in Kuala Lumpur.

relationships for complex concepts pertaining to socioeconomic status or patterns of travelling to work. It allows 
concepts that are not directly measurable to be collapsed into a few interprefig underlying factors. The open-ended 
questions will be analyse through quantitative content analysis by the researcher with the aim of quantifying 
emerging characteristics and concepts. Meanwhile, concept analysis is the process of analysing verbal or written 
communications in a systematic way to measure variables quantitatively (Polit & Hungler 1995:209, 698). For this 
research, authors choose to use content analysis. Content analysis is a quantitative method, in which the results of 
content analysis are numbers and percentages. The main reason for also doing content analysis is to be able to 
make links between causes (e.g. program content) and effect (e.g. audience size).

Figure 1 shows that in order to create sustainable transportation in Kuala Lumpur, we need to know what is 
the determinants, challenges and this will lead to creation of Policy by the Government. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The findings provide an insight and overview on the challenges and determinants of achieving sustainable public 
transport system in Kuala Lumpur. The researcher greatly aware that in order to get more comprehensive research 
data, a wider range of literatures need to be explore to obtain an insightful and meaningful knowledge and 
information. It is hope that this paper, even though a conceptual paper will open the eyes and minds of the relevent 
ministry and agencies on the importance of developing a sustainable public transport in Kuala Lumpur.

Abstract  
 
Tanah Papua is the homeland of peace, harmony, and tolerance. YAPIS is the reflection of this situation. Higher 
education is a part of human resource development. However, there are always obstacles where the distance between 
Jakarta and Jayapura is wide. Meanwhile, natural conditions do not allow for the simultaneous dissemination of 
information. This research was carried out with a qualitative design with a case study format. The research focuses on 
higher education institutions in Yapis Wamena. This study explores the existence of YAPIS and the role of universities 
in Papua. There are two research questions, namely how Papuan universities maintain institutions. Second, how 
YAPIS become an institution that can manage education with all the limited conditions.  This research shows that the 
existence of YAPIS becomes a catalysator for the existence of multi-multiculturalism. Furthermore, the YAPIS 
institution centered in Jayapura made it possible to establish branches throughout Papua. Human resource 
development is the reason for the establishment of the organization. although there are religious differences, but that 
is not an excuse not to provide opportunities for anyone to keep learning. This research findings explores the existence 
of YAPIS formulated education a means of educating human life as a national mandate. Furthermore, with the support 
of various parties, YAPIS has so far managed education from elementary schools to universities. In addition, the 
current university enjoy its second year after the institutional transformation of the college. Higher education 
development is carried out to provide wider opportunities and the opening of non-monodisciplinary department 
programs. Finally, this paper conclude that science and technology as a mean to serve the society, not the religion 
itself.

1. Introduction 
Education is inseparable from human life that plays a role in helping humans significantly to grow their unique 
individualistic potentials and characters. Through education, humans can become educated and ready to support the 
development of society, nation, and state. All the people: young and old, men and women; poor and rich; physically 
normal or disabled; living in urban or rural areas; in the city center or remote areas have the right to education 
(education for all). The 1945 Constitution (UUD) Article 31 paragraph (1) states that every citizen has the right to 
education, as emphasized in Law (UU) no. 20 of 2003 concerning the National Education System (Sisdiknas) Article 
5 Paragraph (1) that every citizen has the same right to obtain quality education. Paragraph (5) states that every citizen 
has the right to have the opportunity to improve education for life, while Article 6 paragraph (2) states that every

285","of human resources. It is necessary to carry out various activities that lead to improving the quality of 
teachers/lecturers. This conditions shows that the program of Yapis spread out to the infrastructure to quality of 
education at most level. 
As an education system, every school under the auspices of YAPIS in Tanah Papua must meet various 
components that are also targets for achieving the educational goals themselves, which consist of an accreditation 
component including curriculum component standards, learning process components, graduate components, 
assessment components, education and education personnel components, facilities and infrastructure components, and 
management components, as well as education financing components. In practice, all of these components are objects 
that guarantee the quality of education. The point is that the quality of education that will be achieved by the target 
school is the components of education (Handbook, 2017). This article shows the development of Yapis Tanah Papua 
as pillar of education in the island. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The Islamic Education Foundation (YAPIS) currently has schools spread across various regions on the island of Papua. 
This shows its success in realizing the progress of national education in remote areas, namely in Papua. It has not only 
established schools up to the senior high school level but also several universities in Papua that are spread across 
several regencies/cities.

Abstract 
 
Pesantren has some uniqueness when compared with other educational institutions. This article aims to 
study the role of the Pesantren Darul Huffadh Tuju-Tuju in building the character of santri based on the 
Quran and local wisdom. This research applies a qualitative approach. Through interviews and 
observations, data collection is supported by written sources and strengthened by the author's intensive 
interaction with the director and alumni. The results show that this pesantren is unique. It requires all of its 
students to memorize the Quran as its main characteristic since its establishment until now. The strength of 
the pesantren is in the strong character attached to the figure of K.H. Lanre Said. His style is a blend of the 
main principles of the Quran and the local wisdom. The combination of religious background and social 
strata supports him with a strong character, which becomes a role model for the pesantren community. The 
central values underlying the character are taught to his children and students through exemplary 'taro ada 
taro gawu' and sublime messages. For Darul Huffadh, building the character of religious moderation must 
be built from three things: well, understanding of the Quran, mastery of the basic Islamic sciences, and 
strengthening local wisdom values. 
 
Keywords: Character, Darul Huffadh, Pesantren, Local Wisdom, Al-Quran, 
 
1. Introduction  
The The rampant corruption indicates that national character education must concern all parties (Wahyu, 2011). 
Theodore Roosevelt, an ex-President of the USA, said: ""To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to educate 
a menace to society"" (Nofiaturrahmah, 2014). Mahatma Gandhi also warned about one of the seven fatal sins viz 
""education without character."" In that context, the pesantren remains committed to educating students in moral and 
intellectual aspects. However, in that commitment, it often gets accusations of being a den of terrorists and radicalizes. 
That certainly leaves several questions, is it true, pesantren teach radical education and violence? Or is this just an 
accusation to smooth out the desire of who feel disadvantaged by the presence of pesantren? When a multidimensional 
crisis hit Indonesia, including a moral crisis, it had boosted human resources quality and referred to educational

684","(Fahmi et al., 2019: 349). For Darul Huffadh, Islam Nusantara is built from awareness of Indonesia's facts and history, 
pervading with diversity. This awareness is built from strengthening basic knowledge so that it grows with a strong 
foundation. For this pesantren, the idea of Nusantara Islam and religious moderation need not be a costly project. 
When pesantren and Muslims accept Pancasila as a pillar of the state, the essence of Nusantara Islam and religious 
moderation has been encapsulated in Pancasila. 
 
4. Conclusion 
K.H. Lanre Said, a Bugis scholar, who integrated the background of aristocrats and scholars, so that he was able to 
institutionalize religion-based characters and local wisdom. His calling is his conscience to dedicate in the religious, 
social field in the community by establishing educational institutions to educate the nation's life, he lived as he is, and 
his messages are deep and relevant to be practiced. The main values of principle in strengthening students' moderation 
are sincerity, in-depth knowledge, long experiences, good ethics, honesty, persistence, hard-working, truth, and 
patience. He was prioritizing the needs of pesantren more than everything, and sincerity in intention. His position was 
irreplaceable. He advised students to be not biased, increased reading resources, wandered for knowledge, istikharah 
prayer, and hajat prayer before making essential decisions, mastering of the primary and twelve basic sciences. Strong 
faith, courage, and others are as key to success. This statement strengthens Zubaedi's conclusions that the figure of the 
kyai is crucial in establishing Islamic moderation from the pesantren. For Darul Huffadh, religious moderation must 
be built from mastery of these twelve basic sciences. 
  
The central values or principles institutionalized and stated in his words and actions (taro ada taro gawu) 
make him highly respected. The humbleness that adorns his personality makes him even more appreciated. He hoped 
that these character values are referred to as Islam and local culture. He also hoped these values passed on to his sons 
and daughters and students through his exemplary and wise advice (pappaseng) to all Darul Huffadh communities. 
The central importance of Bugis culture relevant to the Quran and authentic hadiths are taught theoretically but, more 
importantly, are in real attitudes of integration of words and deeds. His speech and actions are integrated, which is his 
personality as a whole. The strength of pesantren, according to him, is in the values of his attitude and wise advice or 
core values. If it is held firmly and practiced in managing the pesantren, it will survive and prosper. 
Conversely, if left out, it will fall and fail. Its strength is not in modern management, not in finance, but full 
confidence without doubt about God's help according to the Quran's guidance. He proved that it developed rapidly 
without collecting any fees from students. The independence that is not only based on financial strength but also 
spiritual power and principles, even the spiritual power and faith, are more urgent than financial power.

Abstract  
 
This STEM project would utilize the Regression Modeling to predict the Housing Price based on Real 
Estate parameters and data of the King County (Seattle) in 2014-2015.  Clustering and Partitions algorithms 
were utilized to screen the factors and identified the top 2 parameters: (1) square foot of the house living 
space, and (2) house grade level.  Multiple Linear and Polynomial Regression Models were conducted to 
search the optimal predictive model of the housing price.  Based on the residual analysis, the extreme outlier 
was removed to improve the model goodness of fit.  Authors utilized both Python script and JMP JSL script 
to benchmark the coding language.  R-square and Residual Analysis were utilized as the model selection 
criteria.  The modeling results have indicated that the polynomial regression model has outperformed the 
linear regression model based on both R-Square and Residual Analysis.  Python script is similar to JMP 
script regarding the regression programming.  JMP Fit Model Regression platform can simplify the coding 
process for the non-programming JMP users.   Though, through this STEM project, authors have learned 
regression statistics which could also facilitate the Python learning on the same statistical regression 
functions.  It’s an effective learning methodology to learn Statistics, JMP Platform, JMP JSL, and Python 
together through a fun STEM project.

Abstract  
 
The use of lithium in non-renewable energy storage cathodes is possible to run out someday. Therefore, an alternative 
is sought to replace it, namely the manufacture of cathodes made from sodium sea salt as raw material. This has been 
proven because there are many patents and research conducted by researchers. To carry out production, a cost analysis 
related to the process must be carried out. This study aims to calculate the cost components, especially the Cost of 
Production in the experiment of making cathode active ingredients made from salt. The method used in this research 
is using primary and secondary data. The results obtained in this study are the Cost of Production of the cathode active 
ingredient products made from sodium is Rp. 132,677 per 100 grams and the selling price is Rp. 150,000 per 100 
grams. This price is very much cheaper compared to the price of active cathode materials made from lithium which is 
Rp. 250,000 per 100 grams. Apart from being cheaper, the Cost of Production is also easy to obtain, the production 
of active cathode materials also has a profitable economic value so that this study is appropriate to continue regarding 
scale up on a factory scale.

1. Introduction 
Energy demand in the future is predicted to increase along with the increasing human population in the world. 
However, this will have an impact on the need for electric fuel to be used. This is evidenced by the consumption of 
lithium in 2008 amounting to 21,280 tons and will continue to increase with a growth of 5% per year Hwang et al 
(2017). Lithium production and distribution will develop in certain regions such as Australia, South America, China, 
and the United States. In addition, the world energy storage market will reach $ 13.13 billion by 2023 from global 
data forecasts Liu et al (2020). Sodium is a material that is very satisfying to lithium which is used as a raw material 
for making cathodes so that it is more specific as a raw material for making cathodes Wang et al (2020).

Table 1 shows the data that the cost of goods manufactured per 100 grams of product is Rp. 132,677 and the product 
price per 100 grams is Rp. 150,000. So that there is a price difference between the Cost of Production and the selling 
price, the product profit per 100 grams of product is Rp. 17,323. From these data, it shows that the production of active 
cathode materials on a laboratory scale is still feasible. Comparingto the price of cathode active ingredients made of 
lithium, the price per 100 grams reaches Rp. 250,000, the cathode active material made from sodium has a higher 
economic value thus the price is very competitive with lithium. It can even be said that cathode active ingredients 
made from sodium are much cheaper than lithium. 
 
To restore the total cost to reach the Break Event Point (BEP) is when a total of 497.14 kg of active cathode material 
has been produced. Annual income or profit for 1 year with the installed capacity of the laboratory which is 10 kg in 
a single process is Rp. 12,472,864 / Year, the NPV value under normal conditions is 63,591,706, and the IRR value 
is 17.42%. So it can be concluded that the investment in making this cathode active material is feasible. 
 
4.3Sensitivity Analysis 
The sensitivity analysis has 2 scenarios, the first is if the investment cost increases by 30% and if it gets subsidized 
costs from the government so that it can reduce the costs that must be incurred to develop the active ingredient sodium 
cathode. When the investment cost increases to 30%, the NPV obtained is Rp.-81,493,745 and the IRR is 4.18%, it 
can be concluded that if the investment cost has increased by 30%, this investment can be said to be unfeasible. 
Meanwhile, for the second scenario, if the development of the cathode active material receives 30% assistance from 
the total investment cost, the NPV obtained is Rp. 208,677,157 and has an IRR value of 24.89% so that the investment 
becomes more feasible because it gets subsidies from the government so that it can reduce the costs incurred for 
investment. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The conclusions of this paper is the costs obtained in the production process of active cathode materials are as follows: 
Cost of production per 100 grams is Rp. 132,677; the market price of the active cathode is Rp. 150,000 thus the price 
of the sodium cathode active ingredient can have a profitable economic value. That is why it is very worthy of further 
study concerning its economic value. In addition, cathode active material made from lithium is much more expensive 
when compared to cathode active material made from sodium. The price of lithium raw material has a price of Rp. 
250,000 per 100 grams and sodium cathode active ingredient Rp. 150,000. This potential can potentially be chosen 
by factories that produce batteries because it will cut production costs at battery factories. Further studies that can be 
carried out in this research is the expansion of production to an industrial scale. because in laboratory production 
conditions it can be said that it is feasible for production or scale up.

Abstract 
It is critical for higher education institutions to work on improvement of their teaching and learning strategy by 
examining feedback of students. Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use 
of natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis to systematically identify, extract and quantify states and 
subjective information. Transfer learning (TL) could be a ponder in machine learning centering on putting away 
information picked up whereas understanding one issue and applying it to a diverse but related issue. In this paper, 
we present the results from applying BERT, a transfer learning method for one of text classification problems. The 
model aims to predict state positive, negative, or neutral of an online course from students’ reviews. This result will 
be compared with the contributions of authors Kastrati et al. (2020). The results which using BERT are quite good 
(Accuracy 88.93%), giving us more hope for future research.

1. Introduction 
Social media are giving the humus for the sharing of information and encounters and the development of community 
exercises (e.g., debating about different topics) (Dessì et al., 2019). As a result of this progression, an expanding 
number of course audits are being produced with the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which offers 
teachers a chance to analyze, discover the opinions of learners and improve teaching strategies (Z. Liu et al., 2016). 
Working towards improving MOOCs, it is important to know students’ opinions about the course and also the major 
course tools (Wen et al., 2014). That is the reason why Sentiment Analysis (SA) is widely applied to the materials 
such as reviews and survey responses by form, comment online about Cousera. SA is the computational treatment of 
opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text (Medhat et al., 2014). These sentiments can be categorised either into 
two categories: positive and negative; or into an n-point scale, e.g., very good, good, satisfactory, bad, very bad 
(Prabowo & Thelwall, 2009).  
Several different conventional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes (NB) and 
Boosting and 1D-CNN deep learning classifier using bag of words - BoW used for text classification (Kastrati, 
Arifaj, et al., 2020). In this paper, we use transfer learning methods for NLP, BERT (Bidirection al Encoder 
Representations from Transformers) for text classification task. The data set we use in this study are reviews of 
students who have directly studied online on the Coursera platform. Today, Coursera is a global online learning

306","Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive scores among those classified as positive (TP + FP). Recall is 
defined as the ratio of the number of true positives among those that are actually positive (TP + FN). When 
Precision = 1, all scores found are actually positive, meaning there are no negative points mixed into the results. 
However, Precision = 1 does not guarantee that the model is good, as the question is whether the model has found 
all the positives. If a model finds only one positive point for which it is most certain, then we cannot call it a good 
model. When Recall = 1, every positive is found. However, this quantity does not measure how many negatives are 
mixed in. If the model classifies every point as positive, then surely Recall = 1, but it is easy to see that this is a very 
bad model. F1 score =2(P∗R)/P+R. This is just the weighted average between precision and recall. The higher 
precision and recall are, the higher the F1 score is. You can directly see from this formula, that if P=R, then F1=P=R  
4.1 Aspect Categories 
The obtained performance of the BERT’s technique using positional word embedding with respect to Precision, 
Recall and F1 score is depicted in Table 1. We also compare with the results of Kastrati, Arifaj, et al. (2020). They 
used different algorithms to test the accuracy such as Decision Tree, SVM using tf*idf and tf. 
Table 1: Performance of techniques (aspect categories)

61.82 
61.04 
SVM using tf 
61.08 
60.68 
60.88 
 
The BERT technique shows the F1 score is 82.68%. Meanwhile the second-best result is 78.83%, which is 3.85% 
bigger. This can be assumed that BERT will be a new breakthrough in natural language processing technology. The 
reason for this result may be that BERT processes two-dimensional contexts, exploiting the meaning of sentences 
more clearly. 
 
4.2 Aspect Sentiment Classification  
Based on the labels distinguish the sentiments: positive, negative, and neutral. The BERT technique is also more 
efficient than other algorithms implemented by the authors Kastrati, Arifaj, et al. (2020). The specific results are 
presented in Table 2. 
Table 2: Performance of techniques (aspect sentiment classification)

78.86  
76.96 
77.90 
SVM using tf 
76.94  
75.93 
76.43 
 
The BERT technique shows quite good results with F1 score is 88.94%. Besides, decision tree and SVM using tf*idf 
algorithms also work very well when giving high results (88.67% and 88.31%). the results are much higher than 
model for prediction of the aspect categories. This will be explained by the truth that there's less covering between 
extremity labels than between aspect categories (Kastrati, Arifaj, et al., 2020). 
5. Conclusion 
In this article, we have exploited that BERT algorithm which using to analyze the sentiment of students who taking 
an online course on Coursera. The results show that the algorithm is quite suitable for the data set. We believe that 
the same effect can be applied to other datasets, which can be investigated further. Compared with other studies 
along with the implementation process, we have limitation: Although the obtained results are superior to some tests

from other techniques. We have to find ways to combine and improve more. 
In the future, as mentioned, we will experiment with more datasets of different fields to explore more about BERT 
as well as expand to the multi-label problem.

Introduction  
Synchronous reluctance motor or synchronous electric motors has been applied for explosion motor applications 
because of main advantages such a simple design of the rotor and motor in general. Through the absence of windings 
on the rotor, the machines have a high efficiency, are characterized by a smaller value of overheating of the stator 
winding and bearing assemblies. The design of SynRM ensures maximum overheat capacity and safety operation. In 
this paper, the results of the design and simulation of a synchronous reluctance motor with the rated power of 15 kW 
is implemented and analyzed. FEA method has been calculated to investigate electromagnetic torque, efficiency and 
temperature of windings.

The paper has presented a design program of a SYNRM Motor for industrial applications meeting IEC 60034-30. 
The program was used to calculate design parameters by using analytical method, associate with FEMM to validate 
and finally export the drawings from numerical data. Program is the combination of several drawing and calculating 
algorithms to improve accuracy. The program is also used for induction motor and special motor designs. Thanks to 
decreasing time and cost in design process, the integrated tool can be applied in manufacturing electrical motor 
companies to design and manufacture as well as a supporting tool for researchers who can adjust motor structure 
design. The synchronous reluctance motor is a promising electrical machine for energy-efficient mechatronic systems 
and drives. The advantages of SynRM are most apparent in the field of partial loads and at low speeds in the pick-up 
and reverse modes.

ABSTRACT 
    The stator and rotor pole structure and power inverters have significant influence 
on electromagnetic torque performances and efficiency performances. Many papers 
have investigated on those design parameters on motor result.  Inductance and flux 
linkage will be influenced by rotor and stator pole combination and magnetic 
circuit.  In this paper, a SRM 24/16 rotor shoe will improved form conventional 
SRM with the same outer diameter stator and stack length. The paper will 
investigate some rotor pole topologies to get reduce harmonic torque ripple. Radial 
forces of SRM 24/16 with normal and shoe pole have been compared and the shoe 
pole structure has more advantages.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) has been chosen as the right candidate to 
drive this small scale electric vehicle due to the advantages of simple construction, wide constant 
power region and effective torque speed characteristic. SRMs have been applied in various fields, 
from automotive vehicles to the aircraft engine areas.  However, power density and torque density 
are not as high as permanent magnet motors. The torque and efficiency performance can be 
improved by electromagnetic design and power inverter control method. In SRM, the number of 
stators, rotor and winding phase must be followed a regular.  The number of phases m is calculated 
with the number of stator poles N

The cross-section of a three-phase SRM 6/4 with one phase of its associated power 
converter. Each phase of the machine is made up of two coils wound around diametrically opposed 
stator poles and electrically connected in series. In the SRM, torque is produced by the tendency of 
the nearest rotor poles to move to a minimum reluctance position with respect to the excited stator 
pole pair.

The article has analyzed rotor pole design influenced on average torque and torque ripples by FEM

normal rotor and shoe pole. The shoe hole structure has higher efficiency and lower torque ripple. 
The stator and rotor geometry parameters were kept the same and phase winding and turn per coil

The shoe pole contributes to change the flux path and flatten flux density in air gap that radial force 
can be reduced while maintaining the average torque. Finite element analysis was performed to 
verify the radial and tangential force. The result shows that the radial force can be improved, and 
the average torque is even slightly higher than the conventional structure.

Abstract 
A non-natural calamity struck Indonesia during the start of 2020, namely in March, with the covid-19 epidemic. So 
that the government can take different measures to reduce and overcome the plague's tragedies. Implementing Disaster 
Mitigation in Non-Natural Sectors is one phase. As a result, the use of OCB in health organizations can help to reduce 
public fear of the Covid-19 pandemic through the disaster mitigation concept. The aim is to analyze the OCB abilities 
applied by the team in providing services during a pandemic. Besides, how effective is the organization when 
implementing OCB. This article applied qualitative design and data collection techniques with research studies, 
namely using literature, journals, scientific papers as well as news stories related to Organization Citizenship Behavior 
(OCB). The results of the study obtained show that the application of the five dimensions of OCB such as Altruism, 
Courtesy, Sportsmanship, Civic virtue and Conscientiousness in improving hospital performance due to Covid-19 can 
overcome patient panic and increase hospital effectiveness. In conclusion that organizations will be effective if there 
is a sense of belonging in the organization. The hospital will run effectively if there is a caring attitude towards others, 
a sense of wanting to promote the organization and a sense of responsibility. The weakness of this research is that it 
only discusses OCB indicators without looking at the influence of other aspects such as aspects of motivation, 
professionalism.

1. Introduction  
A non-natural calamity struck Indonesia during the start of 2020, namely in March, with the covid-19 epidemic. 
So that the government can take different measures to reduce and overcome the plague's tragedies. Implementing 
Disaster Mitigation in Non-Natural Sectors is one phase. As a result, catastrophe prevention through Organization 
Citizenship Behavior (OCB) by increasing the performance of health personnel is the first step in addressing Covid-
19. They work as heroes by facing considerable risks even to death. 363 medical and health workers in Indonesia died 
as a result of infection from Covid-19. With details, namely 202 doctors, 15 dentists and 146 nurses. Doctors who 
died consisted of 107 general practitioners (4 professors), 92 specialist doctors (7 professors), 2 residents and 1 in 
verification, all of whom came from 24 IDIs in provincial areas and 92 IDI city/regency branches in Indonesia (Pranita 
2021). As a result, non-natural disaster mitigation is required to address the Covid-19 issue in the healthcare industry. 
The ideas of OCB can be used by the Indonesian government to carry out disaster mitigation in the non-natural 
sector. They are working on handling Covid-19 just to help Indonesia get out of its slump from the pandemic. Health 
workers apart from doing their main duties also carry out extra tasks such as being willing to cooperate, help, provide 
advice, participate actively, provide extra services to patients, and are willing to use their work time effectively. Pro-

Civic virtue is a form of behavior that is involved in organizational activities and cares about the continuity of 
the organization. According to (Rusu and Baboş 2015), this behavior reflects a feeling of belonging to an organization, 
just as citizens are part of a country and bear a responsibility that comes from there. Civic virtue is a perception that 
assumes that the organization he is in is a part of his life so that the death of the organization under his auspices will 
make his career die too. Therefore, the civic virtue dimension can be found in superiors or leaders of an organization 
because they are the ones who think about what strategies and work programs in the future will look like to advance 
an organization. With the covid-19 phenomenon, hospital leaders who are referred to for the pandemic are looking for 
ways so that the hospital does not create a bad image in patients. The impact of this hospital is that some patients who 
are not Covid-19 are reluctant to do check-ups due to fear of being infected with Covid-19 from other patients. 
However, this has been anticipated by implementing health protocols. 
First, conceptual skills allow a superior to analyze and diagnose situations faced by the organization and be able 
to distinguish cause and effect. Planning and organizing require a high level of conceptual skills so that decisions are 
taken for the sustainability of the organization. Second, employee skills must be understood by a superior, able to 
work together, lead, control the behavior of subordinates and other groups. This study focuses on influencing others 
for organizational progress. So that the effective and ineffective superiors can see from their ability to coordinate and 
motivate. Third, technical skills are job-specific knowledge and techniques that are required by superiors to carry out 
organizational roles such as the ability to manage health workers. The specific skills required of a manager depend on 
the organization in which the boss is located and on his position in the organization. Like superiors in a hospital can 
treat patients. 
Effective bosses require all three types of skills - conceptual, human, and technical. If the boss does not have the 
skills of the three, it will make the organization experience collapse. Functions, roles and skills are closely related, 
and the ability to understand and manage behaviour in organizations is indispensable for superiors. If these skills are 
possessed, they will be able to make the organization effective by promoting the Civic virtue dimension. 
3.5. Conscientiousness 
Conscientiousness is the behavior to do things that benefit the organization, such as obeying organizational rules, 
creating creative ideas for the organization. This aspect is aimed at trying to exceed the tasks expected by the 
organization. The hospital has its own rules both for patients and for health workers. The Conscientiousness dimension 
emphasizes that health care must comply with the rules that have been made by the hospital, both in the form of written 
rules and unwritten rules. A good health worker obeys all the rules or can be said to have a high level of discipline. 
Also, they are required to be creative or create new things for the benefit of the hospital. One form of compliance from 
health workers is to follow all health protocols and wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for their safety. Health 
workers are also able to provide satisfying services to patients and even the service system is in the form of an action 
that does not saturate the patient. Behavior that obeys the rules is positive behavior which is good for the organization. 
However, within the organization, it is necessary to avoid excessive behavior. That is unwanted excessive behavior. 
This behavior is undesirable because it will hurt a person's life in the future (Miltenberger 2014). In addition, it is a 
reflection that service health correspondent to religiosity (Yusuf and Wekke 2020) and technology (Idris et al. 2020).  
4. Conclusion 
In the dynamics of organizational life, especially non-profit organizations such as health organizations, extra-role 
behavior which is commonly called organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is needed by applying five dimensions, 
namely Altruism, Courtesy, Sportsmanship, Civic virtue and Conscientiousness. OCB is a tool for dealing with Covid-
19 using the notion of non-natural disaster mitigation. The extent to which health workers contribute to realizing 
hospital goals is determined by several factors such as how much health workers show extra behavior or so-called 
organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).  
These behaviors lead to positive actions that benefit the health organization. Among others, the willingness to 
carry out tasks outside the main role it has, the willingness to protect the interests of the organization and take greater 
responsibility for the organization. This behavior is what embodies the goals of the organization. What needs to be 
considered are several factors that affect organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). According to (Organ 2017), the 
factors that influence include culture and behavior affecting organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Research 
focuses on Certain Forms of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB), Organizational Citizenship Behavior and

Abstract 
The construction environment has the potential to cause health problems and accident, so an assessment is necessary. 
The most important stage in occupational health and safety is the assessment stage, where the risk point of each 
identified hazard is calculated, and whether the hazard level is acceptable or not. In this manuscript the writer tries to 
identify and provide an assessment of work accidents which is an attempt to analyze the risks that occur in a 
construction work. The method used is direct observation in the field as a first step to find out what variables will be 
included in the questionnaire which will be distributed to staff / workers in the construction project of the Stella Maris 
Hospital Makassar. The value of the questionnaire is then processed by the Fine method which is the reference in risk 
assessment. The results of this data processing show that work accidents are grouped based on their cause and 
occupational variables where of all the risks of work accidents, only two accident variables are categorized as 
substantial (has a risk value of 70-180), while the rest is in the moderate category (has a risk value of 20-70). 
 
Keywords 
Work accident risk; construction environment; fine method; occupational health and safety; project 
environment. 
 
1. Introduction 
The development of the construction world in Indonesia is currently experiencing intense competition. 
Construction projects are a work sector that has a high risk compared to other sectors (Harvey et al. 2018) and is prone 
to work accidents (Hoła et al. 2017). In fact, not a few work accidents that occur are classified as fatal (Shao et al 
2019). Therefore, the role of occupational health and safety (OHS) is important in construction environtment projects 
(Niu et al. 2019).  Construction companies are required to be able to increase their resources, not only in human 
resources but also in other supporting resources. For example, the equipment used and also the resource management 
system that is owned. In fact, several construction environtment projects have implemented digital engineering and 
sensing and warning based technology for safer construction work (Golizadeh et al. 2018, Antwi-Afari et al. 2019). 
With the increasing complexity of existing systems in building construction, a company is obliged to pay attention to 
the control aspects in construction environtment management, especially risk management in the OHS (Occupational 
Health and Safety) sector and improve climate safety and work safety culture (Ajslev et al. 2017). OHS aims to protect 
workers from a variety of potential accidents in the site project (Ilbahar et al. 2018). The number of job accidents in 
Indonesia is quite high and continues to increase from previous years. Data from the International Labor Organization

Because the risk category value is quite large, the control in project implementation in terms of work 
safety must receive serious attention by project managers and implementers. The risk value in the 
moderate category was lowered as much as possible to the acceptable level, and the substantial risk was 
lowered to moderate or to acceptable. To reduce the risk value, the implementation of OHS/K3, project 
supervision, and control is very important so that the incidence of work accidents is kept to a minimum.

350","Finally, the use of information systems will assist lecturers and education personnel in conducting the quality 
assurance cycle of higher education institutions (Schomaker, R. 2015). 
Rachel in his research in Egypt also found the same research results that the use of information systems will 
have a direct impact on the process of organizing higher education institutions (Schomaker, R. 2015). Similarly, 
Roslan's research shows how an information system will assist students in activities so that the quality of an 
information system affects students' satisfaction in academic activities (M. Roslan Mohd Nor  & Malim, M. 2014). 
The results of this study also reinforce previous research done by (Zanial Zanial. 2011), that the Academic Information 
System has a significant effect on user satisfaction, and research conducted by Apri Wahyudi, Sowiyah, Alben 
Ambarita (Apri Wahyudi, Sowiyah, Alben Ambarita. 2014), that Academic Information System can help learning 
activities according to the needs of students. Furthermore, this study also confirms the results of research of Riza 
Wahyudi, Endang Siti Astuti, and Riyadi (Riza Wahyudi, Endang Siti Astuti, dan Riyadi. 2011) that Management 
Information System has a significant effect on student satisfaction. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Academic Information System simultaneously has a significant effect on student satisfaction. This can be understood 
because students assume that the quality of Academic Information System at STIE Enam Enam of Kendari is good. 
In general, the implementation and control of the quality of the system, the quality of information, and the quality of 
services provided for the students, have been felt very in accordance with their expectation. Thus, STIE Enam Enam 
of Kendari needs preparing Academic Information System in accordance with student activities, delivering data in a 
timely manner and accurately in accordance with the needs and understandable by students to maintain and, even, 
increase student satisfaction in using Academic Information System which exists. In addition, to be able to obtain 
more comprehensive results, this research can actually be developed by adding some other variables that can affect 
satisfaction, such as infrastructure facilities, learning models, and academic culture.

358","While the performance of the service unit, in general, is perceived good by the students when observed from the 
indicators of knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitude and behavior. Of these indicators, skills, knowledge, and abilities 
are indicators that are considered the highest role. This means that Service Units at STIE Enam Enam have good 
operational mastery and operational skills in providing Academic Information System services to students, and can 
work well in fulfilling student service requests. While the other two indicators, namely attitude and behavior, do not 
get a good perception by students. (Ismail, R., Wekke, I. S., Dinesh Kumar, A., Pandi Selvam, R., Shankar, K., & 
Nguyen, P. T. 2019). This has implications that the Service Units are not fully timely, disciplined and responsible for 
providing Academic Information System services to students. Therefore, there should be a policy in the future that 
must be made to better optimize the attitudes and behaviors in providing the services. 
The results of this study reinforce the theory put forward by Ahmad and Ogunsola that an information system 
that is planned, managed, and applied will have an impact on the management of higher education institutions (Ahmad, 
K., & Ogunsola, O. K. 2011).  will help the learning process and improve academic quality (Fantazy, K., & Abdul 
Rahim A. Al Athmay, A.-A. 2014).  will assist lecturers and education personnel in conducting the institutions’ quality 
assurance cycle, and will have a direct impact on the process of holding and managing higher education institutions 
[(Schomaker, R. 2015). and will satisfy the students in academic activities (Roslan Mohd Nor, M., & Malim, M. 
2014).  These findings also reinforces Zanial’s research which found that Academic Information System has a 
significant effect on user satisfaction (Zanial. 2011). and can assist learning activities according to student needs (Apri 
Wahyudi, Sowiyah, Alben Ambarita. 2014). 
On the other hand, these findings are not in line with Geiner, et al. which states that the capacity of the staff 
of the education personnel in managing the university will be the support of student activities (Greiner, M. E., 
Böhmann, T., & Krcmar, H. 2007). and to be a facilitator in carrying out the learning activities (Tach, E. C. 2002). 
The results of this study are also different from the findings of previous research done by Yamada that found that 
education in Japan can be an example of how the ability of employees in higher education institutions will give effect 
in the management of higher education institutions (Yamada, S. 2013).  Similarly, these results are inconsistent with 
Albadvi's findings that training activities to improve employee capacity are as part of continuing support for student 
satisfaction in their learning activities (Albadvi, P. R. A. A. 2007). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Academic information system and service unit performance simultaneously have a significant effect on student 
satisfaction. This can be understood because the students assumed that the quality of academic information system at 
STIE Enam Enam of Kendari is good. In general, in the implementation and control of the system quality, information 
quality and services quality provided to the students, are accordance to the expected norms. With regards to the 
relationship between the academic information system and the student satisfaction, this study partially confirmed that 
an information system that is managed in a planned and applicable manner will have an impact on the management 
of higher education institutions (Ahmad, K., & Ogunsola, O. K. 2011). aiding learning processes and improving 
academic quality in conducting the institutions' quality assurance cycle and the process of organizing higher education 
institutions and may impact user satisfaction in academic activities (Riza Wahyudi, Endang Siti Astuti, dan Riyadi. 
2011). In contrast, in the context of service unit performance, it was found that it could not be a supporter, facilitator  
(Tach, E. C. 2002.) and did not have a significant impact on high user satisfaction (Yamada, S. 2013). Furthermore, 
in order to study deeper on more related comprehensive topics, development should be done by adding some other 
variables that can significantly influence satisfaction such as infrastructure, learning model and academic culture, and 
others.

significant effect on student satisfaction. This means that the performance of Service Units in STIE Six Kendari has 
not been able to fully create student satisfaction as service users if observed through indicators of knowledge, skills, 
abilities, attitude and behaviour ) from all Service Units in STIE Enam Enam namely: Prodi (Study Program), BAAK, 
BAUK, and P3M. This can be understood because the attitude and behaviour factors in the implementation are not 
optimal according to the students' perception. This means that the Service Units has not been fully timely in providing 
Academic Information System service to the students. The Service Units has not been fully disciplined in providing 
Academic Information System service to the students, and not yet fully responsible in providing Academic 
Information System service to the students. Therefore, the policy that must be done to further optimize the performance 
of the Service Units, especially the attitude and the behaviour is to maintain the timeliness, discipline, and 
responsibility in providing services to the students of STIE Enam Enam Kendari. 
The implications of the performance of Service Units have not been fully able to create student satisfaction 
of STIE Enam Enam of Kendari as service object. The results of this study do not support those proposed by Greiner 
(Greiner, et al., 2007). The ability of educational staff in managing higher education institutions will be the carrying 
capacity for student activities (Sanusi, et al., 2020). They become facilitators in carrying out learning activities (Tach, 
2002). The results of this study are also different from the findings of previous research done by Yamada that found 
that Education in Japan can be an example of how the ability of employees in higher education institutions and give 
effect in the management of higher education institutions (Yamada, S. 2013). Similarly, these results are inconsistent 
with Albadvi's findings that training activities to improve employee capacity are as part of continuing support for 
student satisfaction in their learning activities (Albadvi, 2007). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The performance of Service Units has no significant effect on student satisfaction. This means that the performance 
of Service Units at STIE Enam Enam of Kendari has not been able to fully create student satisfaction as service users. 
Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Attitude and Behaviour of all Service Units in STIE Enam Enam are Prodi (Study 
Program), BAAK, BAUK, and P3M are less satisfying the students in serving the application of Academic Information 
System. The results of this study have implications that it cannot be a supporter Greiner, facilitator, and has no a 
significant impact on high satisfaction of the users.  Furthermore, to study deeper with more comprehensive topics, it 
is necessary to develop by adding several other variables that can significantly influence satisfaction, such as 
infrastructure, learning model, academic culture, and others.

Abstract 
 
Ergonomics is the study of the work people do, the environment and the tools they use to perform the work. Jowar 
roti or Jowar rotti is a flat and thin bread made from jowar (sorghum flour), very common in North Karnataka.  The 
dough is prepared by mixing the hot water with jowar flour, and then the roti/rotti is spread on a stone by tapping 
using the palm. The present work focuses on identification of ergonomic deficiencies in the Jowar Roti (Sorghum flat 
bread) making units and associated problems of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), workstation design, postural 
issues and safety and health issues. Roti making is the most laborious and stressful process. Incorrect postures 
sustained (sitting on floor) for a long period of time while performing roti making activities gives rise to 
musculoskeletal problems. The study consists of selecting 30 workers randomly from 6 different units as working 
group and 30 women participated in the study as control group.  Self reported Body Part Discomfort questionnaire 
was administered and the hand grip strength was measured before and after work. Rapid Upper Limb Assessment 
(RULA) was done on selected awkward postures from different activities. RULA results indicated (46.66%) postures 
in high risk and (33.34%) in medium risk. Statistical tests ANOVA between grip strength of two groups showed 
significant difference (F value - 94.52683, p < 0.01). CATIA V5 software was used for RULA analysis which indicated 
high risks (scores of 6 or 7). The workstation is redesigned and a standing workstation is modelled in CATIA V5 and 
RULA analysis for changed workstation indicated low to medium risks (scores of 3 or 4). The findings of the study 
highlights several environment and safety concerns for which suitable suggestions and recommendations are made to 
overcome the ergonomic and Occupational Health and Safety issues.

Introduction 
 
Ergonomics is defined as the discipline of designing the job to fit the worker, rather than fitting the worker to the job. 
The physical stress on the workers can be reduced by adapting the job, workstation, equipment and tools which fit the 
worker, thus eliminating several work related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In the present situation, the 
significance of ergonomics is focussed on improving productivity, health, safety and comfort issues in micro, small 
and medium industries. The micro and small scale industries in the informal sector employ a large number of workers 
for various jobs/tasks. These industries are surrounded by issues like productivity improvement, worker health and 
safety, and quality of products. Some more issues are workstation design, layout, job structure, poor work 
environment, and mismatch between job requirements and worker’s capabilities. All these issues may lead to worker’s

367","Moreover, the repetitive activities in awkward postures also contribute to stress on joints and muscles leading to 
fatigue (Faridah et.al 2020, Ali et. al. 2018). To reduce the risks of MSDs and discomfort, a new work station is 
simulated and modelled in CATIA. Based on the anthropometry dimensions for 50th percentile, the new design is 
made. The height of the platform is taken as 85 cm (Varsha et.al.2018, Qutubuddin et.al.2012, Manzoor et.al.2019). 
Figure 9 (a) shows the recommended workstation designed using Digital Human Modeling in CATIA, and 9(b) shows 
the drawings and specifications. To an extent the awkward postures are reduced, which in turn reduces the risk of 
MSDs. RULA analysis of redesigned workstation for activities such as kneading, patting, and baking roti’s indicated 
a maximum score of ‘4’ suggesting medium risk. Figure 10 shows the actual posture of pating roti, CATIA model of 
existing workstation and recommended workstation modelled in CATIA.

5.0 Conclusion 
 
The roti making units are a source of employment to a large number of women, therefore it becomes necessary to 
provide a safe work environment and ergonomically designed work place. The study was carried out at selected few 
roti making units. The workers reported through self administered body part discomfort questionnaire. The maximum 
pain was experienced in hands/wrists (76%) and upper back (73%), due to continuous repetitive work and awkward 
postures. 
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for working group and control group. In the working group, due to repetitive 
work a majority of women (56%) have normal BMI and only 10% workers were obese. The hand grip strength was 
measured for the working group before and after work. The grip strength reduced considerably due to repetitive work 
of hands and wrists. Statistical analysis by ANOVA between working and control groups indicated F-ratio being 
94.52683 and p-value < 0.00001, significant at p<0.01. RULA analysis of working postures of working group showed 
about 46% of postures fall in high risk category, signalling immediate change in postures. The actual postures were 
built in CATIA software and RULA analysis was done. The results were similar to manual RULA analysis. The work 
station was redesigned in CATIA to suggest improvements. The new station was simulated and RULA analysis was 
done. The maximum RULA score obtained was ‘4’, indicating medium risk. Statistical analysis ANOVA was done 
on RULA scores across different groups. The results are significant at p<0.01 and                       F-ratio=9.07665. 
Overall the ergonomic intervention study in roti making units points to various ergonomic deficiencies, poor layout, 
work environment and work practices. 
 
Recommendations 
• 
Job rotation to remove the risks of fatigue 
• 
Job design to incorporate good ergonomic practices and provide relief from repetitive motions, awkward 
postures etc. 
• 
Provide possible safety solutions wherever possible, near the stoves/fire wood, spacing between work 
stations, safety against burns etc. 
• 
Basic first aid should be available always. 
• 
Work stations designed ergonomically to accommodate variability in workers, based on anthropometric data. 
(5th to 95th percentile)

Good ventilation, lighting and thermal comfort. 
• 
Encourage the use of personnel protective equipments. 
• 
Preferably fire wood to be replaced by gas stoves. 
 
Roti making units represent a labour intensive industry. The women face many problems due to awkward postures, 
poor infrastructure and working conditions. Still local women prefer working due to economic conditions. Usually, 
the pains and discomfort is ignored due to fear of being jobless. The women workers lack awareness and education, 
and sometimes indifferent attitude of employers adds up to their woes. It is suggested to carry further research in 
biomechanical analysis of forces on wrists and hands, ergonomic assessment of work environment and physical 
workload of women.

Abstract 
 
Medical Waste is a problem that existed before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The significant increase 
in Medical Waste during the COVID-19 outbreak causes these problems to become more urgent and complex because 
they relate to health, environmental, and economic problems in developing countries. Many interrelated factors 
influence the management of Medical Waste. A comprehensive analysis is needed to understand the complexity of 
the problem. This study aims to explore the right strategies and policies in dealing with the amount of Medical Waste 
during an outbreak such as COVID-19 and in ordinary (non-outbreak) conditions. The factors considered are 
demographic, operational of the waste generation, emergency, and cost and investment aspects. A Systems Dynamic 
approach is used in this study to structure the complexity of the problem comprehensively. This research consists of 
three stages; where the first stage was a preliminary study by conducting a field study, and the second stage was 
developing the model. The third stage was testing the model. A case study of Surabaya, Indonesia, is selected.

1. Introduction 
The catastrophic outbreak of the corona virus-19 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a significant impact in 213 countries in the world (Worldometer, 2020). The 
beginning of the spread occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). This disease 
has infected 12,685,374 cases with a death toll of 565,000 worldwide (WHO, 2020). 
Besides impacting health and the economy (Susilawati et al., 2020), this virus also affects Medical Waste from 
handling COVID-19 patients. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia stated an increase in Medical Waste 
by 30% from normal conditions. Medical Waste comes from hospitals from patients, including patients infected with 
COVID-19. The increase in medical waste is due to the increasing use of PPE (personal protective equipment), and 
most of it can only be used single-use, such as hazmat suits, masks, headgear, towels, gloves, and googles. Countries 
globally, especially developing countries, experience the same problem with managing Hazardous and toxic materials, 
Medical Waste. The ADB (2020), the increase in Medical Waste occurred by almost 500% from ordinary in April 
2020. In Indonesia, through a survey conducted, Medical Waste increased from 13.6 tons/day or 0.96 kg/bed to 23 
tons/day or 1.62 kg/bed (an increase of 46%) (IESA, 2020). 
Management of Medical Waste is not a new problem in health, especially for developing countries (Chaerul et al., 
2008). Improper handling of Medical Waste increases health and environmental risks because viruses can last a long 
time in materials such as PPE (Chin et al. 2020). Therefore, Medical Waste must be destroyed as soon as possible to 
avoid transmission, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, because the infection rate for this type of virus is very 
high. Limited resources, such as processing incinerators, are the main challenges today, resulting in a gap between the 
generation of Medical Waste and a large processing capacity. In addition, the transportation of Medical Waste is also 
a significant concern at this time. 
Therefore, Medical Waste management is the most pressing problem facing the government, especially in the 
COVID-19 outbreak. So this topic is an area of interest, and many researchers have researched this topic, such as Italy

379","Meanwhile, the public health center has the smallest amount of Medical Waste, namely 3.623, 10 kg per month. 
In some health facilities, there are no inpatients. The operation is limited to minor procedures. 
Model testing in system dynamics simulation consists of two ways, namely verification, and validation. Model 
verification can be done by checking the consistency of the units on the VENSIM software. Then the validation is 
carried out by the limit adequacy test through a literature review from the previous, through interviews with the health 
office and the environment office of the city of Surabaya. In addition, validation was carried out with MAPE (mean 
absolute percentage error), with an accepted error limit of 5%. The model can describe the actual conditions if the 
MAPE is <5%, whether between 5% to 10%, and false if the value is above 10% (Morecroft, 2015).

5. Conclusion  
This study shows that the System Dynamics model is an appropriate simulation method in a complex Medical 
Waste management system. The model developed in the stock and flow diagram consists of 4 aspects: the demographic 
aspect, the emergency aspect, the waste generation aspect, and the cost aspect. The model was developed based on 
the COVID-19 referral hospital, non-referral hospital, health center, and clinics based on health services during the 
COVID-19 outbreak. 
The system dynamic model can help plan to optimize the Medical Waste management system during the COVID-
19 outbreak and ordinary conditions to reduce health and environmental risks. The more Medical Waste is processed, 
the more it will improve public health. 
The COVID-19 referral hospital has more complete health facilities than other health facilities, so the amount of 
Medical Waste generated is also more significant. The COVID-19 referral hospital generates a generation of Medical 
Waste for hospitalization of 5.457,49 kg per day. In contrast, in non-referral hospitals, it is 2.322,34 kg per day, health 
centers, 120, 77 kg per day, and clinics, it is 576, 65 kg per day. 
This research implies that the Surabaya city government can use the resulting model to address Medical Waste. 
The policy is in the form of the number of trucks, the type of processing technology, the number of processing 
equipment, and the percentage of the government budget for medical waste.

Abstract  
 
The pandemic, COVID 19, has affected global economy severely which caused an outbreak of crisis in all 
sectors of business. Firms are struggling to keep up with the normal functions in different stages of supply 
chain which brought sustainability under a big risk. Concerned by the COVID-19 outbreak, the main aim 
of this paper is to determine the threatening barriers to supply chain sustainability in the pharmaceutical 
industry of the South Asian region. This industry is one of the most pivotal and developing sectors in the 
south Asian region with respect to other industries in this region. Although economic growth is noticeable 
in this sector, many questions are arising about its sustainability and resilience in a true sense amidst the 
global pandemic. To establish the sustainability of this sector under a pandemic scenario, the major barriers 
in terms of social, economic, and environmental perspectives have been identified and analysed in this 
research. Twenty crucial constraints have been identified and classified in five categories through an 
extensive study of literature and opinion of industry expert. This paper uses, Interpretive Structural 
Modelling (ISM) approach to develop the hierarchical structure and connection between these obstacles. 
ISM presents the interdependency of the driving and driven power of these barriers. Another modernistic 
approach, Matrix of Cross-Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification (MICMAC), has been used to 
recognize the barriers as driving factors, dependent variables, and link variables using. The modelling of 
this study provides companies insight into obstacles and the efficient and effective management of their 
resources while making their supply chains sustainable. The study closes by discussing findings and future 
area of the research.

1. Introduction
All over the world, including district/city governments in Indonesia, most of them fail in electronic-based
government systemernment, because they adopt technology into their structures, functions and policies, but forget the 
human resources aspect of the government, most of them do not consider capacity human resources, so it becomes a 
serious threat electronic-based government systemernment success, including systems, structures, and even 
management and organizational culture. Meanwhile, the essence of human resource quality is an element of e-
readliness of electronic-based government systemernment according to (Robey et al. 2002, Giesecke et al. 2004) and 
(Zaied et al. 2007 and Konopaske et al. 2005) place learning organization as a model. to improve the adaptive ability 
of organizations to technological interventions by improving the quality of human resources. 
Technology, as part of the organizational pressure factor, is recognized as having intervened by organizations in 
change (Orlikowski 1996) affecting workflow, structure, systems and philosophy (Konopaske et al. 2005). Electronic-
based government systemernment as a form of organizational innovation through ICT aims to improve citizen and

Learning Organization mechanism within the framework of electronic-based government systemernment in 
Mamuju District. t emuan as a whole show that the mechanism can be implemented to realize organaisasi become a 
learning organization (learning organization) who bore traits and characteristics which are changes and development 
organization into a learning organization means that innovation organization to do or be realized, for example, making 
the organization managed to become organizations that adopt ICT can be realized by implementing a learning 
organization mechanism, allowing the organization to evolve into a learning organization. The organization itself has 
opportunity to spread the learning.  
Postulate 2 Organizations are able to implement organizational learning mechanisms for public services 
through electronic-based government systemernment. The implementation of electronic-based government 
systemernment as a form of ICT adoption as a form of technological intervention in organizations (Ivancevic, 2005), 
from the organizational environment will create a strong impetus for organizations to build organizational 
learning. This is because the implementation of electronic-based government systemernment requires capable human 
resources that can only be fulfilled through the ability of an organization to build a learning organization, namely 
building individual, group and organizational level capabilities (Phang et al. 2008). The ability of an organization to 
build an organizational learning mechanism, namely top management support, training and human resource 
development, feedback, and the use of SIM is encouraged because the organization implements electronic-based 
government systemernment. 
These findings generally indicate that what can be applied to realize an organization into a learning organization 
that gives birth to certain characteristics and bases which constitute a change in the organization to a learning 
organization means that organizational innovation can be carried out or realized, for example, the organization 
managed to become an organization which ICT can be realized by running the organization. learning, making the 
organization can evolve into a learning organization. 
The implementation of electronic-based government systemernment as a form of ICT adoption as a form of 
technological intervention in the organization of the organization will create strength for organizations that build 
learning organizations. This is because the implementation of electronic-based government systemernment requires 
capable human resources that can only be fulfilled through the ability of the organization to build a learning 
organization, namely building individual, group, and organizational level capacities. Organizational abilities in 
building learning organizations, namely top management support, training and human resource development, 
organizational management, organizations driven by organizations implementing electronic-based government 
systemernment. This article shows that there the dynamics of government workflow through the system. District 
Mamuju in West Sulawesi reflect this situation in various and couple ways. This conditions and the same time bring 
impact to development of government system to work.  
 
4. Conclusions 
Implementation of electronic-based government systemernment in the District Mamuju encourage organizations 
perform transformations organization of the mechanism manually to the mechanism of electronics is realized through 
changes in environmental organizations as a form of adjustments to the implementation of electronic-based 
government systemernment such as changes in the structure , mechanisms of work and patterns of communication 
and culture as well as the attitude of employees in work . Shape changes in the organization during the implementation 
of electronic-based government systemernment is the flow of work organization become more compact , the structure 
of the organization in the grouping more specific , workflow processes, communications , media and coordination -
based electronics , and behaviors , attitudes , habits of working and making decisions more flexible 
The mechanism of learning organization practiced during the implementation of electronic-based government 
systemernment in the District Mamuju such as decision and policy leaders are accompanied by the preparation of HR 
personnel are capable to work through strategies of education and exercise to improve the knowledge and skills of 
employees in the field of ICT, to encourage employees to share knowledge and skills ( share knowledge) through SIM 
and e-learning which can support the effectiveness of the implementation of electronic-based government

Abstract 
This article focuses on studying global stability of the prey-predator model with Crowley-Martin type functional 
response and stages structure for predator population. The analytical methods in this article are starting with the 
construction of a prey-predator model, determining stability of the equilibrium point by linearizing the model, 
analyzing the global stability of the equilibrium point using the Lyapunov method and the Krasovsky method, 
performing numerical simulations, and ecologically interpreting the global stability. The results of the study show that 
the prey-predator model with the Crowly-Martin type of functional response and stages structure of the predator 
population has one non-negative interior equilibrium point. The interior equilibrium point becomes globally 
asymptotically stable under a certain condition. This means that even if there is a tight interaction or predation on prey 
over a long period of time, the prey population will still be sustainable and also be stable. The global stability of the 
interior equilibrium gives an ecological interpretation that the ecosystem life is under control for a long period of time.

1. Introduction
Mathematical models are generally used to explain the natural phenomena and factual reality in a simple 
mathematical form, which in turn is also used to predict system behavior for the future (Toaha, 2013). The application 
of mathematical models in the ecological aspect has attracted experts to study and analyze mathematically the factors 
that affect the ecosystem of living things and the balance of living things and the interactions therein (Sivasamy et al, 
2019). Meanwhile, on the economic aspect, it has had a positive impact on the fulfillment of basic human needs and 
can increase income for the surrounding community (Dubey et al, 2018), with strict requirements in maintaining the 
stable environmental conditions, not damaging the ecosystem, so that the population remains sustainable and 
maintained its sustainability. 
Some strategies and conditions will be created naturally to protect the environment and it will continue 
throughout the life history of living things, with the main condition being that environmental conditions remain stable. 
The interaction pattern of living things consists of various types, including interactions with predator and prey that 
follows the Lotka-Volterra model (Didiharyono at al, 2021). The prey-predator model, in principle, illustrates that in

To determine the elements of the matrix 𝑃𝑃∗, Cramer's method is used to solve a system of linear equations by 
converting it into a matrix form. The Cramer method uses the determinant of a matrix and another matrix obtained by 
replacing one of the columns with a vector consisting of the numbers to the right of the equation, namely the elements 
of the Hermitian matrix. The form of a matrix of order 9x9 as shown below,

Next, matrix 𝑃𝑃∗ is determined whether is negative definite or not by taking into account the eigenvalues. The 
eigenvalues obtained are  𝜆𝜆1 = 48.1213350185760, 𝜆𝜆2 = 1386.32710869567, and 𝜆𝜆3 = 4310.07999498577. 
Since all the eigenvalues are positive, then the matrix 𝑃𝑃∗ is positive definite, so the Lyapunov function is obtained as 
follows, 
𝑉𝑉(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑓𝑓𝑇𝑇(𝑥𝑥)𝑃𝑃∗𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥). 
This can be written as

By substituting the value of the equilibrium point 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇4 = (1.54525, 0.03933, 2.63987) then we get the value 𝑉𝑉(𝑥𝑥) =
 0.2081225355. Since the value of the equation 𝑉𝑉(𝑥𝑥) > 0 then it can be concluded that the equilibrium point 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇4 
globally asymptotically stable. If the prey population, immature predator, and mature predator were initially around 
the interior equilibrium point, then the three populations will tend toward the equilibrium point 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇4 =
(1.54525, 0.03933, 2.63987). This means that the three populations will not be extinct for a long period of time.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The prey-predator model with Crowly-Martin type functional response and stages structure for predator 
population has only one non-negative equilibrium point 𝑻𝑻𝑬𝑬𝟒𝟒(𝒙𝒙, 𝒚𝒚, 𝒛𝒛) = ቀ𝝎𝝎,

𝝑𝝑(𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈+𝟏𝟏)(𝜽𝜽𝜽𝜽−𝒄𝒄)(𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅)ቁ. 
This equilibrium point becomes the only interior equilibrium point and it is locally and globally asymptotically stable 
when a certain conditions are fulfilled. This means that even if there is a tight interaction or predation on prey over a 
long period of time, the prey population will still be sustainable, stable, and sustainably maintained. This global 
stability provides an interpretation that the populations in the ecosystem is under control for a long period of time. As 
suggestions for further research, the model can be developed by considering some assumptions or consider the time 
delay and harvesting in the mechanism of growth of each prey and predator population.

Abstract  
The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between grades and playing an instrument. 
Furthermore, it will be determined if the number of hours one spends practicing their instrument and how long one 
has played their instrument affects one’s grade in a class. The data for this study was obtained through a Google Form 
and was targeted towards middle and high school students in the United States. Results of this study concluded that 
there is a correlation between playing an instrument and one’s grades in certain subjects. It was also determined that 
the amount of time spent practicing or how long one has played an instrument also had an impact on one’s grades in 
certain subjects.

1. Introduction  
Nowadays, there is a popular belief that music increases intelligence and/or grades. It has been statistically 
proven that “formal exposure to music in childhood is associated positively with IQ and academic performance” 
(Schellenberg, 2006). The results of this study don’t necessarily mean that students with a higher IQ receive higher 
grades, but it does contribute to popular belief. A study conducted on the grades of over 50,000 secondary school 
students in British Columbia determined that there is a symmetrical relationship between participation in music and 
academic achievement (Gouzouasis, Guhn, & Kishor, 2007). Using linear regression, the authors examined the 
extent to which grades in music courses predicted grades in mathematics, English, and biology, and found a positive 
correlation across all three cohorts which implies that music can be a “viable and useful predictor” of academic 
achievement. However, this study was limited to two years and relied upon grades in music classes, rather than any 
other measure of musical ability or time dedicated to practice. A more recent broad study of academic achievement 
in 110,000 7-12 grade students conducted by Guhn et. al determined that “music participation was related to higher 
scores on all 4 subjects [mathematics, science, two years of English] and these relationships were stronger for 
instrumental music than vocal music” (Guhn, Emerson, & Gouzouasis, 2020). This study controlled for differences 
in sociodemographic backgrounds and academic achievement prior to year 7, in an effort to exclude factors other 
than music courses that could contribute to high grades in core subjects, and still revealed higher academic outcomes 
for students who took school music courses relative to those who took none. Finally, a study on the psychosocial 
functioning of 354 students aged 16 to 19 focused on selected dimensions of emotional intelligence stress-coping 
strategies, and the results suggested that “music students are more aware of the emotions they feel, both positive and 
negative; express their emotions more easily; and can effectively use their knowledge about the emotions they 
experience.” (Nogaj, 2020). However, simply stating that there is a relationship between playing an instrument and 
grades raises questions of whether time spent per day and over the years impacts one’s grades in certain subjects. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to not only determine if there is a general correlation between grades and 
playing an instrument, but it is also to analyze the effect time per day and over the years has on one’s grades. 
Investigating the relationship between grades and playing an instrument can not only benefit students but 
instructors as well. For example, the main reason why playing an instrument affects one’s grades in classes 
positively is because it triggers both sides of the brain simultaneously (Stoklosa, 2016). Thus, instructors could 
create activities that mirror the actions of playing an instrument, which would then help the student and their grades. 
Because funding for music and arts is shrinking in American education, research that can prove that musical 
education assists in overall academic success would possibly gain support for this funding again. 
2. Methods  
In order to gain the results needed, respondents answered ten questions related to age, grades, and/or 
instruments/singing. Three questions were multiple choice and seven were open-ended. All questions were written 
in English. Respondents were asked to provide their average numerical math, science, and humanities grade over the

402","4. Conclusion  
 
Overall, the conclusions drawn from the statistically analyzed data are that 1) there is a correlation between 
playing an instrument and one’s grades in math, 2) there is a correlation between how long one has played an 
instrument and one’s grades in science only, 3) there is a positive significant correlation between how long one 
practices their instrument each week and one’s grades in math and science, and 4) there is a positive highly 
significant correlation between how long one practices their instrument each week and one’s grades in humanities. 
The analyzed results support the original hypothesis. The data for the humanities grades vs. how long one practices 
their instrument each week was more supportive because the calculated value exceeded the critical value for the 0.01 
threshold (99%). Realistically, these conclusions only point to the fact that people who play an instrument have 
higher grades in general. Any assumptions cannot be safely drawn about the psychological and/or neurological 
explanations for the data because the four conclusions mentioned above are not cohesive.  
For the chi-square test for association that determined if playing an instrument affected one’s math, science, 
and humanities grades, some categories had a value of 0 for the observed frequencies. For example, there was no 
one in the data that played an instrument and had a C in their math class. This then led to the numerical operation of 
“0/0” while calculating the chi-square values. For simplicity, these values were simplified to 0, but this may have led 
to a discrepancy in my final result.  
5. Future Research  
Future research could be done on a larger population to gain a more representative sample as well as more 
representative conclusions. Additionally, it would be more beneficial if research was done not solely based on 
grades, but perhaps include additional factors, such as the subject that respondents found was easiest for them or 
most intuitive. 
If this project was carried out again, the questions about how long one practices their instrument each week 
and whether or not they sing would be removed. These questions were not relevant to the survey. The majority of 
efforts would be focused on a more longitudinal study including younger students who are just starting out in 
learning an instrument so that their grades can be tracked over time by doing a similar study with a wide range of 
participants every year.  
Because it was proved that there is a correlation between playing an instrument and one’s grade in math, 
math teachers could incorporate musical aspects into their classes. James DiComenico investigates this idea in his 
paper. He surveyed 46 teachers regarding their use of music in classrooms and conducted an interview with an 
instructor that has 23 years of teaching experience. Through his survey, DiComenico determined that 40% of 
teachers use music daily to alter their student’s mood, 52% of teachers sometimes use music to teach core subjects, 
40% use music quite often to promote creativity and personal expression, and 40% of teachers sometimes use music 
to help with classroom management. DiComenico concluded his paper by writing that music has multiple benefits, 
including improving engagement, focusing concentration, and triggering imagination (DiComenico, 2017).

Abstract 
This paper investigates the information technology financial sector using the following indices: QTEC, DJUSTC, 
NDXT, and XTX. These indices stem from popular market indices such as the Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and Standard 
& Poor’s 500 Index and thus, are apt choices to study the sector. From a list of public technology companies with 
listed stocks, a sample of 40 stocks was selected. The past 100 days (100 business days before May 18th, 2021) of 
closing prices were used for both the indices as well as the stocks and the natural logarithm of all values was taken 
such that they could be compared despite different price ranges. These values were used to build simple linear 
regression models for all the stocks and for the indices themselves and Standard t-tests were run to determine whether 
there are statistically significant differences between the slopes of the price/value vs. time graphs. Based on the number 
of statistically insignificant values there are, a relative estimate can be made for how well the indices track the stocks 
overall and individually using the Chi-square test for homogeneity and index holdings. 
 
Keywords 
Stock market, financial indices, tracking market performance, stock price, linear regression.  
 
1. Introduction 
From the sheer number of published analyses on the stock market to the prevalence of major stock indices like the 
Dow Jones and the Standard & Poor’s 500, it is clear a majority of consumers and researchers rely heavily on market 
indices as measures of turbulence and trend in the market. However, the methods used to calculate the values of each 
index is often either undisclosed or too vague to be useful. As Zatlavi puts it, “Common approaches to index 
calculation rely on a company's market value generating a weighted average as the index” (Zatlavi, Kenett, Ben-Jacob, 
2014). This still doesn’t give enough insight into market index. From the description of the NASDAQ index, this 
index is “divided by an index divisor to arrive at a more appropriate figure for reporting purposes” (“NASDAQ 
Composite…”, 2021). Essentially, these methods are simply unavailable for the public and without them, consumers 
cannot definitively evaluate how well these indices actually track the movement of either a sector or the market as a 
whole.  
Thus, in order to determine whether or not consumers are justified in relying on these indices, statistics must be 
introduced as a way of testing the ability of indices to accurately depict market trends.  
 
2. Methods  
The main aim of the paper was to determine how well the market indices – QTEC, DJUSTC, NDXT, and XTX – track 
the technology sector and in doing so, the paper explores whether these indices move in similar ways. The technology 
sector was used as it was one of the sectors least affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as seen in Smales’ paper (2021). 
The analysis begins with a comparison of how many fail to rejects/rejects occur among the indices with regards to 
how well the slope of the index matches with the slope of a stock in the sample. This data is then used to conduct a 
Chi-Square test for homogeneity to determine whether the indices track the stocks in the sample similarly. Finally, 
using holding counts for each index, the paper establishes a standard by which to evaluate index performance.  
 
2.1 Project Research 
The following tests and data analysis/graph creation was all done using the Wolfram Programming Language, a high-
level language with a focus on functions. Stocks are investments into companies that often are associated with equity. 
Market indices factor in multiple stocks as to give an overall picture of the market/sector.

The Chi-square test statistic is 7.8125. At (4 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 3 degrees of freedom, the resulting p-value is 0.05005 
using a Chi-square distribution. At an alpha level of 0.01, this is not statistically significant, and null hypothesis was 
not rejected. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the category proportions are not all the same for all the 
market indices.  
 
3.4 Third Statistical Tool – Establishing Baseline for Index Performance 
In an attempt to give a baseline for how well these indices should do, the number of holdings within each index can 
be used. There is an expectation that an index should track its holdings well, or at least better than stocks not held by 
the index. Therefore, using list of 1,353 technology stocks, a ratio can be made of the holdings to total stocks for 
each index (essentially a probability of any given holding for an index to show up in our sample). This ratio can then 
be applied to the sample to give an approximate number for how many stocks the index should track well in our 
sample. A table shows this below:

The Chi-square Goodness of Fit test cannot be used here as the expected counts (the projected number of 
stocks to be tracked) are not all greater than 5. However, most of our indices do track a larger number of stocks than 
predicted (QTEC: 10 > 1.15, DJUSTC: 11 > 4.67, NDXT: 9 > 1.15, XTX: 2 < 5.79). 
 
4. Conclusions  
To reiterate, the stocks and indices had linear models fitted to them and standard t-tests were run in order to determine 
whether the difference of the slope of each stock versus a given index was statistically significant. The number of fail 
to rejects/rejects was counted and a Chi-square test for homogeneity was carried out in which the null hypothesis was 
not rejected, and the conclusion was that there is not enough evidence to justify there being a difference in category 
proportions. Finally, using a holdings/set space size ratio, it was found that three of the indices were tracking more 
stocks than the expected baseline (with the exception of XTX which suggests we should reevaluate any reliance we 
might have on it). Overall, the market indices do indeed track the technology sector well and do so in a consistent 
manner.

414","5. Future Research  
This paper used computation-heavy tests and methods to achieve conclusions and thus, the sample size was limited to 
computation limitations. With resources such as high efficiency computation clusters and large data storage bins 
offered by Amazon Web Services and others, the sample size could have been increased and more closing prices could 
have been factored in. There is a potential for selection bias in sample selection as the website might not actually 
contain all public technology-oriented companies and the web-scraping code may have failed to pick up on certain 
ticker symbols (unlikely, but possible). Another potential source of error would be the fit of linear models to the 
sample stocks. Model utility t-tests could have been run to ensure a linear model was appropriate for all the chosen 
stocks. It is possible Type I and II errors were made in the Standard t-tests and a Type II error in the Chi-square test, 
but those errors would not significantly skew the results. Further lines of questioning might include similar studies 
into other market sectors/indices and investigating the reliability of indices that don’t seem to be matching the sector 
very well (like XTX).

Abstract 
 
One of the important aspects of human resources is a factor related to motivation that affects employee performance. 
The purpose of this study was to determine work motivation, to determine employee performance, to test and analyze 
work motivation on the level of achievement of employee performance at PT PLN (Persero) UPP JJBT 1 Bandung. 
This research uses descriptive research and causal associative research with a quantitative approach. The sampling 
technique in this study was saturated sampling, as many as 43 employees at PT PLN (Persero) UPP JJBT 1 Bandung. 
Based on the results of the descriptive analysis related to the motivation variable, the average percentage was 86,7% 
included in the very good category. The results of the analysis related to employee performance variables obtained an 
average percentage of 88,62% included in the very good category. The data investigation approach used is simple 
linear regression. The results of this study indicate that H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted which work motivation has 
significant and influential effect on employee performance. Based on the coefficient of determination, it is found that 
the determination (R square) is 0,309 which means that the influence of the work motivation variable on employee 
performance is 30,9%.

1. Introduction  
 
PT PLN (Persero) is one of the state-owned companies engaged in electricity, which is engaged in the generation, 
transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Indonesia, both in urban areas and in rural areas, both among 
industrial, commercial, household and general. In other words, PT PLN (Persero) is one of the state-owned enterprises 
with a national scale that is responsible for meeting the needs of electricity throughout Indonesia. PT PLN (Persero) 
as an agency that has a big responsibility in serving the community so it must have potential employees. 
In 1972, in accordance with Government Regulation no. 17, the status of the State Electricity Company (PLN) is set 
as a State Electricity General Company and as the Holder of the Electricity Business Authority (PKUK) with the task 
of providing electricity for the public interest. In line with the Government's policy that provides opportunities for the 
private sector to engage in the electricity supply business, since 1994 the status of PLN has changed from a Public 
Company to a Limited Liability Company (Persero) and also as a PKUK in providing electricity for the public interest 
until now. 
According to the Regulation of the Board of Directors of PT PLN (Persero) No. 0014.P/DIR/2016 dated 
January 21, 2016 regarding the Organization of PT PLN (Persero) Central Java II Central Development Unit, the work 
area of UIP JBT II covers the areas of West Java and Central Java & DIY with the aim of increasing the effectiveness 
of the network construction activity management process and achievement of completion targets. UIP JBT II itself is 
located at Jalan Margo Utomo (formerly P. Mangkubumi) No.16 Yogyakarta, operationally active on April 1, 2016. 
In a company there is a phenomenon that occurs in the scope of the company, one of which is the work motivation of 
employees in the company which is quite influential in achieving company goals. Because, if employees have a high

close to one (1), it means that the ability of the independent variable to cause the existence of the dependent variable 
is getting stronger. The formula for its use is as follows: Kd = R2 x 100%

The table above explains the magnitude of the correlation or relationship (R) value, which is 0,570. From the 
output, the coefficient of determination (R square) is 0,309, which means that the influence of the work motivation 
variable on employee performance is 30,9%. Thus, from the results of 43 simple regression data processing of Work 
Motivation and Employee Performance above, it can be concluded that Work Motivation affects Employee 
Performance with an influence of 30,9% while the remaining 69,1% is influenced by other factors outside of work 
motivation. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Based on the results of the study indicate that work motivation has a positive and significant effect on employee 
performance at PT PLN (Persero) UPP JJBT 1 Bandung. Where, if the work motivation of employees is high, it will 
have an impact on the achievement of employee performance in the company. Maintaining employee motivation 
should be one of the focuses for every Human Resource Management in a company. One of the factors that influence 
employee performance is the motivation factor, where motivation is a condition that encourages someone to try to 
achieve goals or achieve the expected results. A strong form of motivation can produce good and quality results or 
performance from the work he does. This means that every increase in employee motivation in carrying out their work 
will improve their performance. Work motivation is a basic human need and as an incentive that is expected to meet 
the desired basic needs, so that if the need exists, it will result in the success of an activity. Employees who have high 
work motivation will try to get their work done as well as possible.  By paying special attention to employees regarding 
the needs needed at work, it will have a good impact on their performance results. The needs that can be met for 
employees are related to the need for achievement, the need for affiliation, and the need for power. The results of 
employee performance can be seen from the quantity of work, quality of work, timeliness in completing work 
according to the specified deadline, attendance at work, and the ability of employees to cooperate with other employees 
both in the same field or not.

Abstract 
 
In this study, the authors used a type of quantitative research, using two variables, namely Self-efficacy as a free 
variable and motivation as a bound variable. In this study, a population of 34 employees of OSDS AGIT Division was 
34 employees. To examine the effect of self-efficacy on employee work motivation, researchers used a simple 
regression tool using saturated sampling data collected through questionnaires. From the results of the study, 
respondents have felt the presence of self efficacy and good motivation in the work environment. From the results of 
hypothetical tests, it is known that self-efficacy has a significant effect on the work motivation of employees of the 
OSDS AGIT division. Based on the results of the coefficient of determination obtained an influential result of 75.5%. 
Researchers suggest that companies can choose self efficacy, by encouraging the emergence of positive beliefs in its 
abilities.

Technology In this modern era, it is commonly used by humans, both for educational needs, work, and even 
in general daily human activities. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of a safer, better life, and so on, it will 
encourage humans to make technological developments in order to solve the problems they face [1]. The development 
of various types of technology also has an impact on changes in various fields. Such as changes in science, industrial 
progress, office systems, communication advances, agriculture and other fields. Apart from these sectors, the 
development of technology also affects the daily activities of the population [2].

Abstract 
 
There are quite a few support programs for Hong Kong Youth (HKY) to start new business in Hong Kong 
or mainland China. However, our recent survey revealed that 51% of the sampled university students had 
never heard of these programs, 45% had heard about them but did not read the details, only 2% believed 
that they knew these programs well; while 2% absent. The survey also revealed that only 5% of the students 
had entrepreneurial intentions, and, among them, only 6% would consider entrepreneurship in mainland 
China. In the same survey around 20 years ago, approximately 50% students had entrepreneurial intentions 
and about half of them would like to consider mainland China for new businesses. These results show that 
HKY’s entrepreneurial intention has been decreasing and their perception of mainland China changed as 
well. Thus, the following questions arise: Do we have a good understanding of our youth’s mindset when 
making policies and launching support programs for them? Is it possible that the government’s good 
intention is not really appreciated by the younger generation? Will Hong Kong lack entrepreneurs in the 
future? 
   People may assume that if financial support is available, HKY will take entrepreneurial action. However, 
the latest research suggests that youth entrepreneurship is hindered not only by financial issues but also 
mindset issues. This paper will discuss youth entrepreneurship policy from a life-cycle perspective by 
evaluating the personal factors of HKY, including their attitude, awareness, intention, knowledge, skills, 
and then action; and the policy factors, including financial support, government policy, culture, finance, 
human capital, and market, as suggested by the theory of entrepreneurship ecosystem. Accordingly, an 
extended model based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) will be proposed to identify the association 
between policy factors and the personal factors of HKK. Finally, I will use engineering education as an 
example to explore the relevant policy implications and potential programs for the Hong Kong government 
and education institutions to consider.

1. Introduction  
 
In general, the police are tasked with maintaining the safety and comfort of the community, but violations of the 
rules committed by police officers are still possible. Of course, the violations committed will affect the performance 
assessment of members later. According to Prawirosentono in Edison, et al (2016: 195) performance is the result of 
work that can be achieved by a person or group of people in an organization, by their respective authorities and 
responsibilities, to achieve the goals of the organization concerned legally, not violating the law and according to 
norms and ethics. Therefore, to avoid things that are not desirable, it takes a strong commitment within Polri members 
to the organization. To maintain this commitment, Polri provides several benefits to its members that will not be 
obtained by anyone outside the Polri institution, one of which is an increase in salary and rank within a predetermined 
period. According to Robbins & Judge (2017) commitment is the degree to which a person works to identify an 
organization, its goals, and expectations to remain a member. Organizational commitment is defined as a condition 
in which an employee favors a particular organization and its goals and desires to maintain membership in the 
organization. 
The increase in salary and rank within a predetermined period is related to the career system adopted by the 
Polri institution. The career system applied by the organization must start from the career concept of the organization 
itself. Handoko (2012) proposes several career concepts, the first being a career as a sequence of promotion/transfer

effect of Organizational Commitment and Career System on Performance. The way to calculate R Square using 
the coefficient of determination is by using the following formula: 
𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾= 𝑅𝑅= 𝑟𝑟2 × 100% 
(0,747)² × 100 % 
= 55,80% 
This figure shows a coefficient of determination of 55.80%. This shows that the influence of the Independent 
Variable consisting of Organizational Commitment and Career System on the Dependent Variable, namely 
Performance, is 55.80%, while the remaining 44.20% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study.  
3. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussions that have been studied, the following finding are obtained: 
a. 
The result of the descriptive analysis of the performance of the non-commissioned officer of the Sub-Directorate 
of mass control of Samapta Directorate of Metro Jaya Regional Police are excellent. 
b. The result of the descriptive analysis of the organizational commitment of the non-commissioned officer of the 
Sub-Directorate of mass control of Samapta Directorate of Metro Jaya Regional Police are good.  
c. 
The result of the career systems of the non-commissioned officer of the Sub-Directorate of mass control of 
Samapta Directorate of Metro Jaya Regional Police are good.  
d. Simultaneously, organizational commitment and career systems have a significant effect to the performance of 
the non-commissioned officer of the Sub-Directorate of mass control of Samapta Directorate of Metro Jaya 
Regional Police.

Abstract 
 
One of the efforts to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Indonesia is carried 
out by accelerating village development. The digital village is one of the real development programs that is 
increasingly being carried out by Indonesia. The digital village is a driving force for strengthening smart village 
development. The Indonesian government fully supports village development through the issuance of the Village 
SDGs which were initiated due to the increasing enthusiasm of local governments in building smart villages. Because 
rural areas in Indonesia are dominated by agricultural activities, this research is focused on smart villages based on 
Agriculture Data Analytic (ADA). This study aims to analyze Indonesia's readiness in ADA-based smart village 
development through optimization of 2019 Village Potential data. The methods used in this study were descriptive 
analysis and multiple regression analysis and clustering. The variables used in the multiple regression analysis are the 
implementers of ICT management, implementers of agricultural based business activities, and implementers of 
renewable energy management in the village which are linked to existing sources of funds in the village. The variables 
used for clustering consist of 25 variables in 60.195  village potential data 2019, related to the condition of ICT 
infrastructure, ICT management, transportation, agricultural businesses and activities related to renewable energy. The 
results of multiple regressions show that the sources of regional budget revenue (APBD), Village Original Revenue 
(PAD),  self-subsistent (Swadaya) and other funds give a very significant contribution to the implementation of ICT 
management activities, agriculture, and transportation with an Adjusted R2 value of more than 0,9. However, different 
results show that the sources of Swadaya funds and PAD are less contributing to implementing renewable energy 
activities in the village (Adjusted R2 value is less than 0.6). The results of the clustering show that there are 5 village 
clusters with 5 levels of smart village potential. The clustering model has good validity with SSb value of 546.077,3. 
A quantitative approach of village potential data in Indonesia to assess the readiness of smart village development has 
not been widely used. Therefore, this research can be an alternative recommendation for stakeholders in formulating 
policies related to acceleration of village development in the context of regional development in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been disruption in international trade affecting many areas one of 
the sectors being the supply chain on products in different countries. Now most countries are back to 
manufacturing though an anomaly is evident on quantity produced resulting in a bullwhip effect on the fleet 
of the containers supply chain. There is incapacitation of production in some countries as the virus ravages 
the globe. This has led to an inverse balance in the quantity of container fleet flow in international trade. 
This has led to the research to delve into the container shortage globally which is now a crisis. Identification 
of the nature of the crisis, the analysis of the impact this has propelled to has been discussed. Post-Covid 
strategies to mitigate this effect are presented. Thematic analysis has been used in this juncture due to 
limitations and delimitations of geographical location and Covid-19 restrictions.

Shipping Container, Container Crisis, Shipping and Global Supply Chain.  
 
1. Introduction  
Globalization has been the way of life nowadays as trade crosses beyond the borders. There are about 170 million 
shipping container moving around the world to transport approximately 90% of the world trade (Shin 2021).This 
shows that there is a need for the supply chain to continue regardless of the locally produced inputs. The normalcy of 
trade includes the vessels and containers to transport the goods ordered to the destination of consumption and then 
distributed to the globe to meet the consumer demand. Practical examples include well renowned products such as 
mobile phones (Apple, VIVO, HUAWEI, Samsung); food products (coffee, rice, beans, meat); metals (gold, 
diamonds, iron, copper, uranium, titanium) and many more which require the usage of transportation units. There are 
numerous transportation units which include wagons, cartons, pallets, and containers (DeVogelaere & Frey 2014). 
The history in America shows that the cost of freight was reduced from $5.86 per ton for loose cargo to $$0.16 per 
ton when cargo was containerized in 1956 (ISBU 2010).  The logical explanation of this phenomenon is the 
introduction of consolidation as the container was a breakthrough in carrying numerous tonnes in unit. Containers can 
be carried in plentiful ways which gives birth to TEU’s. TEU is used as a measurement of twenty - foot equivalent 
unit. There has been a global index which will be explained in two sections. In 2000 -2008 the TEU increased from 
214,274,536 TEU to 473,821,055 TEU (Worldbank, 2009).  In 2009 -2017 there has been a substantial increase to 
approximately 750 million containers being transported world-wide (Rodrigue, 2020). American shipper (Miller, 
2021) concurs with this adding the statistics from 2018 as there was a slight increase then a demise in 2019 from 60%-

459","due to unprofitability (Forbes 2021). Some industries suffers more than other like automobile, which are preparing for 
shortages in spare parts (Auto 2021). At the same time, Jílková1 and Králová1 (2021) argues that the swift shift to 
online commerce with new consumer behavior in terms of products’ priorities and frequency of purchases during 
Scholars concur that Coivd-19 had made things worse as they resulted in unanticipated demand spikes added more 
pressure on supply chains while traders and manufacturers couldn’t ship all the quantities needed from products and 
components due to the unavailability of shipping containers. The ripple effect of the containers crisis has a possible 
negative impact on profitability and sustainability of industries   
(Brooks, et al. 2020). 
 
5.3 Strategies to mitigate the effect of the container crisis 
This study established that the unprecedented container shortage was due too drastic changes in consumption and 
shopping patterns, increase in e-commerce, and the lockdown measures. For (Baschuk, 2020) the drastic closure of 
all economic activities during the announcement of the first lockdown the shipping industry was shocked and woke 
in the morning to have container shortage. In Shin, (2021), shin literature discussion that the container crisis has caused 
China to pay premium rates for importers to return containers in order to cater for the crisis. Based on the above 
literature discussion it is clear that the shipping industry lack the ability to quickly adapt to the changing environment. 
Therefore, there is need to have a global shipping framework to cater for such pandemic like bottlenecks in the near 
future. The literature is also bringing to the afore the fact the shipping industry still have monopolies who are not to 
some extent are creating a critical shortage of containers for profitability margin which are beyond the reach of the 
small players in developing countries. The different scholars concurred that the volatility of the industry needs to be 
operationalized to suite the market mechanism at every moment (Haralambides & Thanopoulou, 2014; Baschuk, 2020; 
Miller (2021)). Capacity and production management are fundamental in stream lining container demand and supply 
(Haralambides, 2020). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The shipping industry is vulnerable from a lot of macro-economic threats. Taking insight from the global financial 
crisis of 2009 and the Covid 19 container crisis it is clear that they no consensus amongst the global in addressing 
container shortages. It remains vital for the governments and other trade facilitating institution and the academic 
framework to foster a sustainable shipping framework to curb the recurring shock. The global shipping framework 
need to integrate pragmatic researchers, specialist and government representative to look into liner shipping 
connectives and to monitor the changing terrain of e-commerce which is resulting in the demand for more 
containers. Much predictive statistical approaches are also needed to have a clear for focus on dealing with crisis in 
the near future.

The aviation industry covers all types of air travel and operations enable these services, which include the entire 
airline industry, aircraft manufacturing, aircraft maintenance, research companies, military aviation, and many others.  
For example, the airline industry delivers air transportation for passengers and cargo utilizing aircraft, such as using 
airplanes and helicopters. The aviation industry is a gigantic key enabler of many other economic activities worldwide, 
providing jobs to millions of people throughout the world and transporting billions of passengers yearly. Prior to 2020, 
air transportation is growing increasingly accessible and sought after as the results of the advancement in information, 
communication, and technology (ICT) facilitating the interconnected global community and the thriving tourism 
sector as well as the strong aviation safety record. However, the pandemic COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020, 
has brought a dramatic drop in demand in terms of air transport passengers and freight especially due to movement

Abstract 
The leading causes of work accidents on construction projects are related to the unique characteristics of the 
construction project, different work locations, openness, and weather conditions. The professionalism of the 
parties involved in implementing a construction project significantly affects a construction project's safety and 
success. A review of engineers' professionalism on the failure and accidents of construction projects took a case 
study on the Pier Head PCB 34 Toll Road Bekasi Cawang Kampung Melayu, which was carried out fast track. 
The method chosen was to carry out a literature study and a simple analysis of these incidents. A simple analysis 
shows that the failure and accidents of the construction project are caused by the deterioration of the already 
plastic steel material, which has a direct impact on the bracket's ability to withstand loads during casting. Such 
deterioration does not need to occur if the entire project cycle is carried out properly with the parties' professional 
handling. 
Keywords: Construction Failure, Deterioration, Pier-head, Toll road. 
1. Introduction 
A construction project's success, apart from being measured by the achievement of time, cost, and quality targets. 
It is also determined by safety in its implementation with zero accidents, and in the end, it can be used reliably by 
the wider community. The characteristics of construction work do have a high risk of danger, so they require 
comprehensive and well-systemized handling to reduce accidents' potential. Currently, zero accidents must be the 
leading and most important goal in the construction process. It is a ""goal"" in a step towards zero accidents and the 
final form of a ""journey"" to a ""process"" when composing a safe work sequence Zwetsloot et al. (2013). 
The leading causes of work accidents on construction projects are related to the unique characteristics of the 
construction project, different work locations, openness, and weather conditions. The implementation time is 
limited, dynamic and demands high physical endurance, and uses much-untrained labor, coupled with fragile safety 
management, resulting from which workers work with high-risk construction implementation methods. The causes 
of construction accidents can also occur due to improper construction implementation methods and weak 
supervision, resulting in the structural system collapsing and killing many victims. In several instances, the 
construction implementation method is one-factor causing construction accidents Zhang et al. (2019). Other causes 
are the lack of discipline of workers in complying with occupational safety and health (K3) regulations and 
insufficient quantity and quality of personal protective equipment in construction projects. 
One of the construction accidents that attracted enough attention was constructing the Bekasi Cawang Kampung 
Melayu Toll Road, better known as the Becakayu Toll Road. The design of the Becakayu Toll Road was started in 
1995. The Becakayu Toll Road project is one of the toll elevated (not built directly on the ground, but on the ground 
with other infrastructure underneath). Construction of this toll road began in 1997 and was stopped in the very little 
construction progress. The city's development is speedy, resulting in very rapid changes in city planning, drainage, 
land use, and others. Changes to these changes led to a redesign in 2006. However, the implementation of the 2006 
design stopped again. After being proclaimed by President Joko Widodo as one of the National Strategic Projects, 
then in late 2014, the implementation began, of course; in 8 years, there will be significant changes in land use, 
both for settlement, drainage, and utilities. If traced from 2006 to the resumption of the Becakayu Toll Road 
construction in 2015 (9 years), there has been a significant change from the initial design, due to changes in land 
use, buildings, infrastructure, and others, and because the nature of the project is National Strategic Project. So the 
owner decided to implement the fast track project management method (contemporary road design and execution).

479","5. CONCLUSION 
Based on the results of the analysis of the construction failure on the pier-head work of the Becakayu Toll Road 
above so that it does not recur in similar work in the future, the following are things that need attention both for the 
implementing contractor and the supervisory consultant, namely : 
1. Improved implementation supervision 
The enhanced supervision includes supervision when the implementation and supervision of materials used. 
Implementation supervision can be applied by tightening SOPs (Standard Operational Procedures) and 
implementing more risk management. 
2. Improved material supervision 
Material control can be improved by conducting periodic checklists with a series of tests. The material contained 
in the pier head bracket formwork is steel material. Tests commonly carried out on steel materials include tensile 
strength, deformation, and corrosion tests. The effect of corrosion on steel materials can reduce the strength of 
steel materials. 
3. Improved human resource management 
In this case, improving the quality of human resources, workers and masons who carry out construction can be 
done by improving human resource management. This HR management includes scheduling workers, 
counseling on SOPs, and counseling on the importance of K3 in construction. In the Becakayu Toll Road 
project, there are indications of poor human resource management, including a busy work schedule but 
inadequate shift/work change arrangements. As a result, the risk of workers experiencing fatigue and making 
mistakes is getting bigger. Improving HR management in work scheduling can be done by re-analyzing the 
needs and scheduling of worker shifts according to the time/target the contractor is trying to achieve. 
4. Re-analyze the strength of the pier-head formwork 
The pier-head formwork used in the Becakayu Toll Road Project is a cantilever/bracket system. The load on 
the formwork is entirely transferred to the pier body through the brackets. To reduce stress on the bracket, it 
can be done by installing reinforcing scaffolding/shoring. Shoring is a component made of metal assembled into 
a modular unit, which is usually used to strengthen freshly cast concrete (compressive strength is not optimal). 
In the case of the Becakayu Toll Road pier head, the shoring system can be used to carry the burden during and 
after casting. This reduces the stress on each bracket connected to the pier head body. 
This shoring requirement can be analyzed by recalculating the pier head formwork ability that has been used. 
Existing loads on the pier head work are the concrete's weight, the load the possibility of piling the concrete at one 
point (centered), the live load of workers, tools (vibrators), and other equipment. There are also shock loads, such 
as the height and speed of casting, which generally cause additional loads on the formwork. After the load has been 
calculated, the next step is to calculate the formwork ability. The bracket system essentially transfers all the load 
during casting to the pier body. In the Becakayu Toll Road Project case, structural failure was not found in the pier 
but the bracket. Thus, the bracket's ability to withstand stress needs to be recalculated by the existing condition of 
the test results. Shoring can reduce stress on the bracket because shoring transfers most of the load to the ground.

Abstract 
Parking facilities are essential infrastructure needs in the transportation system that can support activities to reach 
a specific area and create orderly, safe, and comfortable conditions. Parking is often a problem in the transportation 
system, both in big and developing cities that always face parking problems. The COVID-19 pandemic, in general, 
has affected various activities, including transportation and parking. This paper will discuss road performance and 
parking characteristics in the office area. The research method was carried out by surveying the parking area 
before the COVID-19 pandemic, during large-scale social restrictions, and after the new normal and calculating 
the roads' level of service. Data were collected from the south quarter office area and Jalan TB Simatupang. The 
results showed a decrease in parking volume up to 66.22% when large-scale social restrictions then increased 
41.71% after implementing new-normal and for the performance of roads after the new normal service levels A 
and B for a weekend. While weekends are at levels C and D. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic 
had a significant impact on the performance of roads and the characteristics of vehicle parking in office areas.

1. Introduction 
Traffic volume in Jakarta City decreased significantly in the first week of implementing restrictions on community 
activities  (PSBB) in mid-2020. This condition of movement restrictions caused the traffic atmosphere in the 
Capital City to feel more relaxed. The decrease in traffic volume can undoubtedly change the level of road services 
in Jakarta. In theory, the Level of Services (LOS) of the road should be of better value. Following the conditions 
of decreasing traffic volume, there will also be an adjustment in the number of vehicles that require parking spaces 
in various places. Changes in traffic patterns in several cities in Indonesia are the same as those in other cities 
worldwide. The decrease in traffic volume was caused by the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). 
COVID-19 began to spread around the Wuhan area and has now infected more than 100 countries. A total of more 
than 100,000 people in the world tested positive for this virulent virus. The number of new cases reported in China 
has indeed decreased. However, cases increased in South Korea, Italy, and Iran (Azarafza 2021). The increasing 
spread of the corona outbreak to various parts of the world is a serious threat to Indonesia's global economy. One 
of the sectors affected and felt is the office sector, and almost all Jakarta offices carry out large-scale social 
restrictions and work at home. When large-scale social restrictions occur, it dramatically affects the use of parking 
areas, limiting people entering the office, and when large-scale social restrictions, of course, the use of parking 
areas also decreases compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Parking facilities are among the most critical infrastructure needs in the transportation system to support activities 
to reach a specific area. Therefore, parking is significant at the local and strategic planning levels (Parmar et al. 
2020a). Christiansen (2017) said that parking policies significantly influence transportation, as nearly all vehicle 
trips start and end at the parking lot. According to Chen (2016), with the increasing number of private cars, the 
more convenient and efficient it is for people to travel. However, the parking problem has become one of the most 
prominent problems in many massive cities.  
Based on the background above, it is necessary to analyze the performance of roads and parking characteristics 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the office area to find out the characteristics of vehicle parking before the 
COVID-19 when the PSBB took place, and at the time the New Normal was implemented and the performance 
of the roads leading to the office area in Jakarta.

Traffic volume is the number of vehicles passing on a particular road in hours. Based on the Indonesian Road 
Capacity Manual (MKJI) 1997, road traffic volume is the number of motorized vehicles that pass through a point 
on a road piece per unit of time expressed in units of PCU/Hour. The measure of the effectiveness of the Los is 
divided into six classes, namely from the best level of service A to level F for the worst conditions. The analysis 
results can be seen in table 4. As follows:

18:00, namely service level B, namely stable flow, speed is slightly limited by traffic, drivers can freely choose 
their speed. On weekdays 13:15 - 14:15 includes service level C, which is stable flow; traffic can control speed. 
Then on a weekday at 16:45 - 17:45 D service level, the flow starts to be unstable, the speed is low and varies, the 
volume is close to capacity. 
5. Conclusion 
Based on several studies, it is concluded that parking volume has decreased during large-scale social restrictions 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic by 66%, then it has increased again by 41.71% after the implementation of the 
new normal. Furthermore, for the performance of roads on TB Sipatupang street Jakarta on weekends with service 
levels A and B, then on weekdays with service levels C and D. The results showed that the Cocid-19 pandemic 
had a significant impact on the performance of roads and the characteristics of vehicle parking in office areas.

Abstract 
 
The level of population mobilization in the Jakarta increased along with the population increase. It causes an increase 
in the number of transportation modes. To overcome congestion due to increased the transportation, the concept of 
transportation integration was developed, one of the component is the transportation connection facility. This study 
aims to determine the performance and level of services of pedestrian facilities on the connecting line between Jakarta 
MRT Station and  KRL Sudirman Station. The research methodology used survey measurements of volume and travel 
time to determine the level of service and direct observation of the availability of facilities. In addition, the survey was 
conducted by distributing questionnaires to 100 respondents to determine the level of performance of the connecting 
line. The data processing uses Microsoft Excel and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) using the 
Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) method. The results of the analysis carried out by direct measurement survey 
found that the pedestrian paths have met the minimum standards. From the measurement results of the volume and 
travel time of pedestrians, the service level is obtained with A category, the availability of facilities for regular users 
and and users with special needs is quite complete, as well as data analysis of the results obtained through surveys and 
questionnaires, it can be concluded that the performance of the connecting line is relatively good.

1. Introduction 
Dukuh Atas is the name of a area located in the southwest corner of Menteng, Central Jakarta. Dukuh Atas area is a 
strategic area which is close to the business center of Jakarta. The growth of development in this region includes 
commercial office towers, apartments, hotels, shopping centers, residential housing and shop houses. 
The inter-census population survey (SUPAS) describes that the population of DKI Jakarta in 2020 will increase by 72 
thousand people to 10.57 million people. Reports from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) and Bappenas stated that 
this number increased by 0.7% from the previous year which was 10,504,100 people. The activities of the population 
in an effort to meet their daily needs lead to a journey / movement from one place to another. In carrying out movement 
activities, citizen use transportation facilities and infrastructure.  There is only efficiently functioning public 
transportation system can effectively compete with individual transport vehicles (Solecka & Jacek, 2014). 
Based on the annual report of PT Kereta Commuter Indonesia in 2018, the average passenger volume was 922,736 
passengers / day, and the number of passengers was 336,798,524, an increase of 7% compared to 2017 which was 
315,853,991.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this research is to determine if supply chain integration could mediate the four 
dimensions of knowledge management orientation (organisational memory, knowledge 
sharing, knowledge absorption and knowledge receptivity) to shipping firms’ performance. 
This research is anchored on the Resource-based, Knowledge-based and Resource Dependence 
Theories. A survey questionnaire was deployed. Analysis of data from 171 respondents 
affirmed that supply chain integration has a mediation effect between each of the knowledge 
management orientation dimensions and firm performance. This finding suggests that the 
supply chain integration as the mediator should be deployed by all supply chain actors for their 
firm performance.

Abstract  
 
Over the past four decades, Malaysia and China’s economic relations have become stronger and their bilateral trade 
soared. China is Malaysia's biggest trading partner in the last decade. Today, the two countries are even more closely 
connected. Therefore, the paper attempts to study the accomplishments, particularly in strengthening the Malaysia-
China ties in both investment and trade. These policy initiatives are analysed in relation to multinational corporations’ 
plans and governments’ developmental aims in Malaysia. Policy recommendations are made to ignite the desire of 
Malaysia and other developing countries to improve the possible development MNCs activities and their impacts. 
Besides, tor many Muslim consumers especially those countries in Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) and Regional 
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Halal status products are depending on Halal logistics and its related 
chain especially with regard to Halal food. Halal logistics (HL) and Halal supply chain (HSC) are a growing concept 
as a spin-off from conventional logistics and supply chain concept due to the increasing awareness of delivering the 
Halal products. Recommendations are drawn not only for Malaysia but for other Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) and 
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) nations.

Abstract 
 
The difficulty of clean water in Indonesia, especially areas far from the city, resulted in a shortage of 
drinking water supply for the surrounding communities. CV Ulu Ulu Utomo company engaged in the 
trade and installation of deep water well pumps for irrigation and industry in the work of the project so far 
has not used the method of scheduling the project in planning the time and cost required, so there is still a 
delay in work time and additional costs. Therefore, this study aims to determine the form of network 
diagram, analyze the optimal time, and estimated total cost of deep well pump construction project in 
Sorong, West Papua using Critical Path Method (CPM). This research is a type of descriptive and 
accurate research that systematically describes project activities and data sources obtained from 
interviews, observations, and documentation. The results of research with Critical Path Method (CPM) 
showed a network diagram on a series of project activities that are on a critical path is the A1-A2-C2-C4-
D2-E2 trajectory with a normal time of project completion for 102 days and a cost of IDR 79.353.000 
while the project completion time is accelerated to 91 days over 6 hours at a cost of IDR 82.593.890.

1. Introduction 
The construction of clean water supply facilities and infrastructure in this decade is increasing. One of the 
basic necessities of living things is water, which is needed for drinking, household needs, and irrigation. But 
nowadays in certain areas often the water needed is difficult to obtain because of the low rainfall of one area, the 
discharge of small rivers, the absence of landfills, and far from other water sources. This is what happens in Sorong 
region, West Papua, which relies on surface water for daily needs is still very lacking, especially for irrigation that 
requires more water. One alternative is to use groundwater. In everyday life, the use of groundwater used by 
residents, namely wells dug, but currently the well dug is no longer able to work optimally. Currently, the 
government provides facilities regarding the manufacture of deep well pumps, so the Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources made a clean water procurement program carried out by drilling groundwater or by the 
manufacture of deep well pumps that have been started since the beginning of 2005-2018 calculated to have been 
built as many as 2,288 units of drill wells with clean water discharge with a capacity of 144.4 million m3 / year that 
can help 6.6 million people in difficult areas of clean water in 34 provinces and 312 districts (Hastuti, 2019). This is 
characterized by the increasing activity of deep well pump installation projects.

521","cost is greater than the previous normal cost. It is as described by Bishnoi (2018) that completing an activity in a 
shorter time, will require more resources and will lead to increased costs incurred to carry out accelerated activities 
in the project.  
Thus, if the project owner wants to accelerate the project time of CV Ulu Ulu Utomo company, it is better to 
use the accelerated CPM method because with this acceleration the project owner can optimize the duration and cost 
so that the project can run quickly and precisely. This research supports research conducted by Adebowale & 
Oluboyede (2011) with the CPM method the completion time can be reduced by 37 days with an additional cost of 
N830,000.00 ($5,355.00), so it can be concluded that if a project is accelerated it will be accompanied by an 
increase in costs. 
The S-curve becomes a necessary tool for project planning and control and for the evaluation of overall 
progress during the implementation stage (Cristóbal, 2017). According to Cheng et al. (2011) the S-curve can be 
used for several purposes, one of which is as a target used to evaluate the actual progress of the project and to 
monitor whether the project is on schedule. Based on the scheduling analysis of deep well pump construction 
projects in Sorong West Papua by CV Ulu Ulu Utomo on the S curve it can be seen that the project activities can not 
be completed according to the initial target schedule of completion of 3 months or approximately 90 days. However, 
the realization of the deep well pump construction project in Sorong West Papua by CV Ulu Ulu Utomo was 
completed within 102 days. From the calculation of the S curve obtained the result of weighing exactly 100% in 
normal conditions 102 working days, while if done accelerated weighting results 100% can be completed in 91 days 
more than 6 hours. So that by using the S-curve can be known if the deep well pump construction project is 
accelerated, then the project does not experience delays and the completion time is faster 10 days 2 hours than 102 
days normal completion time and thus the deep well pump construction project will experience an increase in costs. 
This is supported by the results of research Sabariah et al. (2012) which explains the effectiveness of the use of S-
Curve scheduling methods in the work of construction projects related to decision making related to time and cost, 
project time control, project cost control, project scheduling, strategies to reduce project delays, as well as project 
performance, their use is relatively high and better than other network planning methods. 
6. Conclusion 
Sourced from the results of research and discussion above, it can be concluded in the construction of deep 
well pump in Sorong, West Papua by CV Ulu Ulu Utomo using Critical Path Method (CPM) that the network 
diagram in the series of deep well pump construction project activities in Sorong, West Papua which is located on a 
critical path is the A1 (Mobilization and Demobilization of Personnel), A2 (Mobilization and Demobilization 
Equipment), C2 (Installation of Tools and Machines), C4 (Soft Stater Installation), D2 (Test Run Genset), and E2 
(Rechecking) with the total completion time of the normal time project for 102 days and the total cost of the project 
is IDR 79.353.000 while the project completion time is accelerated (crash time) to 91 days over 6 hours at a cost of 
IDR 82.593.890. With the acceleration of this duration the deep well pump construction project in Sorong, West 
Papua, the completion time is 10 days and 2 hours faster than the normal duration and has increased the cost by IDR 
3.240.890. 
In the preparation of network so that the determination of critical path can be optimal, is necessary CPM 
analysis so that it can be made comparisons in its calculations and get more accurate results. The next researcher 
should try other methods of scheduling projects such as bar chart, PDM, and continued with the acceleration of 
duration such as Crashing Method, Trade-Off, Labor Allocation, for better research results.

Abstract 
 
PT. Tunas Jaya Sanur, one of the big construction companies, always deals with the market segment's 
changing conditions. The better the market conditions, the greater the chance to get the project, and vice 
versa. The study's first objective is to identify the factors that have a dominant influence on Bali 
contractors' tenders' success in project tenders throughout Indonesia, especially PT. Tunas Jaya Sanur. 
The study shows two factors that positively affect the ratio of successful tender values: factors of quality 
of work and human resources (Xb1) and support factors for external resources and communications 
(Xb2). Furthermore, the researchers conduct modeling with multiple linear regression and obtain the 
equation, namely Y = 3.583 + 0.472 Xb1 + 0.611Xb2. The equation shows that the two independent 
variables positively influence the value of a successful project tender. The increase in one of the two 
independent variables will also increase a successful project tender value.

1. Introduction 
The construction service business market in Indonesia is very potential. The investment activities carried out by the 
government and the private sector is increasing every year. The utilization of the potential of the construction 
service business in Indonesia can be carried out by competitively involving national entrepreneurs through a process 
that is transparent, fair, efficient, and practical (economical), accompanied by law enforcement. Also, it is necessary 
to increase contractors' capacity and the implementation of policies that favor national entrepreneurs. It is hoped that 
the national construction service business's involvement will create jobs and improve public infrastructure services 
so that the national construction service business can compete in the regional market share and the international 
market. The intense competition in the construction industry today makes contractors' success to survive in the 
industry is determined by the ability to overcome uncertainties in cost, quality and time, satisfaction, occupational 
safety and health, and environmental impacts. The study discusses the factors that influence successful project 
tenders' value, followed by PT Tunas Jaya Sanur, and conducts modeling on these factors. It is all related to the 
value of project tenders successfully won in tenders throughout Indonesia. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Tender is a process to obtain goods and services carried out by an institution, both government and private. The 
process starts from planning the needs until completing all activities to obtain goods/services (Presidential Decree 
No. 54/2010). Tenders based on project ownership are divided into 2, namely public and private project tenders. The 
study analyzes the factors that influence the tenders' success rate that is followed. Factor analysis is a multi-variable 
data analysis technique that aims to reduce data. The research seeks to find the relationship between each 
independent variable that can be made from one or a series of variables smaller than the initial number of variables. 
Factor analysis is a technique that describes the relationship between the diversity of several variables in a small 
number of factors. Variables that have high correlation are grouped into one group, where the correlation between 
variables in one group and other groups is relatively small. The purpose of factor analysis (Hair et al. 2010) is to 
identify any relationship between variables using a correlation test to create new factors, or new variables, to replace 
certain variables. Factor analysis is carried out using SPSS and Smart PLS software here.

Hypothesis 2 states that Factor 2 (External Resource Support and Communication) positively and 
significantly affects the project's value. The parameter coefficient test result between factor 2 on the project 
value shows a positive relationship with a coefficient value of 0.404 with a t-statistic value of 4.278 and 
significant at α = 0.001. The t-statistic value is above the critical value of 1.96; thus, the hypothesis is 
accepted.  
 
5. Conclusions 
Based on data analysis and discussion, it can be concluded that from the analysis using SPSS and Smart PLS, it is 
found that two factors have a positive influence on the successful project value of major contractors in Bali province 
in project tenders throughout Indonesia. The two factors are the Quality of Work and Human Resources (Xb1) and 
External Resources and Communication Support (Xb2). The two factors above in the analysis using SPSS have an 
Eigen Value above one and a cumulative percentage above 60%. The results of modeling hypothesis testing with 
Smart PLS indicate that the two factors above positively affect the project's value during the successful tender. 
Furthermore, from the multiple linear regression test, one equation is obtained, namely Y = 3.583 + 0.472 Xb1 +

successful tender. It means that an increase in one of the two independent variables will also cause an increase in the 
value of the project from the successful tender. 
 
It is necessary to conduct similar research on other companies with the same qualifications and to participate in 
project tenders throughout Indonesia, such as PT. Tunas Jaya Sanur to complement this research.

Abstract 
 
Currently more than 80% of the world's energy needs are met from fossil energy sources (petroleum, natural gas, 
and coal). In the use of Photovoltaic, the resulting performance must be supervised in order to maintain the 
condition of the panel to reduce significant damage to the photovoltaic. Several studies have discussed various 
applications of electrical energy monitoring systems especially on photovoltaics. photovoltaic Performance 
Monitoring System Based Iot Using Arduino Uno on Pematang Johar has a problem formulation to know the 
performance of solar photovoltaics using internet methods, in order to facilitate remote surveillance. In this study, 
Voltage Divider, Current Sensor (ACS712), DHT22 Sensor, LDR Sensor (Light Dependent Resistor) and Blynk 
platform were used as sensor reading viewer. The research began with designing software and hardware circuits to 
test the success of the system, then designing the Blynk platform, as well as designing programs using arduino IDE 
software. In sending data using internet media, wi-fi module (NodeMCU) is used to send arduino reading results to 
Blynk platform with JSON program and the voltage sensor reading showed an error of 1.8 % on the current sensor 
showed an error of 3.3 %.

1. Introduction 
At present, more than 80% of the world's energy needs are met from fossil energy sources (petroleum, natural 
gas, and coal). The existence of an evergrowing industrial revolution resulted in the depletion of conventional 
energy supplies so that energy consumption rates such as electricity bills increased, plus the equipment needed now 
used large electricity consumption. Therefore, a reserve energy source is needed to minimize the use of conventional 
energy by utilizing available energy but is environmentally friendly.

543","But before calculating the percentage error, you must put the highest number in the system and subtract the 
measurement result. This is because the photovoltaic works at the highest voltage of 48 V and a current of 9 A, this 
is done to show the true error result. Then the calculation is obtained as follows: 
 
Voltage on Blynk 
= Data– Measurement Range 
= 48 V - 0.9 
= 47.1 V 
Current on Blynk 
= Data– Measurement Range 
= 9 A - 0.3 
= 8.7 A. 
Based on the data above, the error percentage results are as follows: 
Voltage % Error 
= (47.1-48) / 48 x 100 
 
 
 
= -0.012 x 100 
= -1.8% (negatives are negligible) 
Current % Error  
= (8,7-9) / 9 x 100 
= -0.08 x 100 
= -3.3% (negatives are negligible) 
The process of monitoring the performance of solar panels is carried out for one week from 09.00 WIB to 15.00 
WIB. This is because the most oprimal radiation process occurs between the following hours. The results of the 
average data that have been obtained from the monitoring process can be seen in table 2. below:

Based on the data in table 2, the average results on the measurement for seven days are with a voltage of 35.4 V, 
a current of 2.1 A, a power of 78.4 watts, a temperature of 29.8 ° C, a Humidity of 73.2%, and an LDR of 58.7%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the results of the Design and Testing, it can be concluded that the design of a photovoltaic performance 
monitoring system using the blynk platform uses serial communication between the TX and RX pins on Arduinouno 
and the wi-fi module (NodeMCU) with the JSON program method for data sending systems on the Blynk platform. . 
Programming is done twice on Arduino and NodeMCU because both are microcontrollers then the design of an IoT-
based solar panel performance monitoring system using Arduino Uno on PLTS runs well with an error reading of 
1.8% for the Voltage sensor and 3.3% for the Current sensor (ACS712) and the results of the average sensor reading 
for seven days with a voltage of 35.4 V, a current of 2.1 A, a power of 78.4 watts, a temperature of 29.8 ° C, a 
Humidity of 73.2%, and a weather of 58.7%. In the future, it is expected that the sensor reading error will not be 
more than 3% so that the data received is closer to the original data of the solar panels.

1. Introduction  
Indonesia, which is blessed with natural beauty, cultural diversity and also its historical heritage, can be 
used as a tourist attraction in developing tourism as well as a form of economic policy. Because tourism can bring 
benefits and advantages where the tourism sector does not only reach certain groups but also people around tourist 
objects who get income from other economic activities. The development of the tourism sector is considered to be 
one of the leading sectors in an effort to improve the economy in rural areas. The benchmark for tourism 
development in Indonesia is the number of foreign tourist visits which are a contributor to foreign exchange for the 
country which has an impact on economic improvement. 
The phenomenon of the spread of a virus which is currently known as Covid-19 is an event that is very 
disturbing to all people in the world. Coronaviruses (Cov) is a virus that infects the respiratory system. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) says that the infection from this virus is called COVID-19. The Corona virus is 
considered to have a very negative impact on human health, this virus can cause common colds to very severe 
illness, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-
CoV). (Pearlman, 2020) 
The COVID-19 case began in China on December 30, 2019, namely in the City of Wuhan with a diagnosis 
of pneumonia of unknown cause. Where the level of spread of this virus case is very fast and even reaches across

one another. So that there is a hyphen twice the line describing their roles can be carried out together without anyone 
dominating each other. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The actor network model in tourism management during the Covid-19 pandemic consists of actors inside 
the government, in which there are primary actors, namely the Mayor of Batu; and Secondary Actors, namely the 
Batu City Development Planning Agency, the Batu City Health Office, the Batu City Tourism Office, the Regional 
Finance Agency, the Communication and Information Office, the Transportation Service. And Outside Government 
Actors, consisting of Investors / Private Companies (Community Organizations), Society, Mass Media, and 
Academics. The institutional effort in the actor network is to form a covid task force team, based on the New 
Normal policy. The strategy of the Batu City Government is the implementation of health protocols in the tourism 
activities of Batu City.

Abstract 
 
Detailed disclosures of the company's financial statements and cash flows provide an overview of the company's actual 
performance. The purpose of this study was to prove and analyze: 1) The quality of accounting information disclosure 
has a significant effect on cash flow; 2) The quality of accounting information disclosure has a significant effect on 
the company's financial performance; 3) Cash flow has a significant effect on the company's financial performance. 
This research was conducted at all manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange using purposive 
sampling method. This research is a quantitative analysis using Partial Least Square (PLS). The results of the analysis 
show that: 1) The quality of Financial Accounting Information Disclosure has a significant effect on cash flow. The 
higher the quality of disclosure of financial accounting information, the higher the cash flow. 2) The quality of 
financial accounting information disclosure does not have a significant effect on financial performance. Users reduce 
dependence on firm performance because of less important measures of accounting risk and tend to engage in 
speculative trading.  3) Cash flow has a significant effect on financial performance. The higher the cash flow, the 
higher the financial performance. 
 
Keywords: 
Quality of Financial Accounting Information Disclosure, Cash Flow, and Company Financial Performance. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Financial accounting information is generated by management, and management knows this information will be used 
as input in the governance process (Ilona, Desi and Zaitul). Financial accounting information is carried out through 
disclosure of financial statements (Hendriksen 2002) which is a way to convey information contained in a company's 
financial statements. The full disclosure principle requires the disclosure of all circumstances and events that make a 
difference to users of financial statements. The importance of disclosure in the future (Wolk et al. 1991) in Subroto 
(2004) is because the business environment is increasingly complex and the capital market is able to absorb and reflect 
new information in stock prices quickly (in Tanor 2009). 
 
One of the factors that underlie investors' decisions in investing (Hidayah 2008) is the company's financial statements. 
Detailed disclosures in the financial statements will provide an overview of the company's actual performance. 
Companies that have implemented corporate governance and transparency have better quality, and are more trusted 
by creditors and investors. This causes the company to become more liquid and share prices will increase. Overall, 
the market performance will be better 
 
The liquid state of a company can be seen from the amount of current assets it has, which is more than double the total 
current liabilities (current liabilities). The most liquid asset is cash which is presented in the cash flow statement. 
Financial reports (Kusno 2004), especially those relating to information on changes in cash flow and corporate 
accounting earnings, are important information that investors can use to assess company performance. A higher 
increase and the positive effect of accounting earnings and cash flow components consisting of operating cash flow, 
investment and financing (Oktavia 2008) can increase firm value and increase shareholder wealth in the form of 
increased share prices.

569","financial statements to predict, compare and evaluate the company's ability to generate profits (earning power). 
Profitability is related to cash flow, especially for investors. 
 
Disclosure of information in the financial statements is done to protect the rights of shareholders. Information in 
financial statements must be presented adequately to predict the company's future financial condition, cash flow and 
profitability (Gunawan 2000; Bushe 1999;Tjakradinata 2000 in Anwar's research 2010). Detailed disclosures will 
provide an overview of the actual company performance. Types of financial accounting information (Dahlan 2003) 
consist of mandatory disclosures and voluntary disclosures. This has been done by more than 98% of sample 
companies through mandatory mandatory disclosures, and sample companies (2%) through voluntary disclosure still 
need to be maximized. 
 
The conclusion of the relationship between variables supports the theory of the quality of financial accounting 
information disclosure on cash flow variables. This answers the problem formulation that the quality of accounting 
information disclosure has a significant effect on cash flows 
 
2) Quality of Financial Accounting Information Disclosure and Company Financial Performance. 
 
The results of this study reinforce several previous studies, namely: Wolk, et al (1991). Information related to company 
performance is displayed through disclosure of financial accounting information in financial reports. Financial reports 
are very important information for investors in making investment decisions. Future disclosures are made because the 
business environment is increasingly complex and the capital market is able to quickly absorb and reflect new share 
price information through the accounting income statement. Quality accounting earnings (Tanor 2009) are accounting 
earnings that have little or no perceived noise in them and can reflect the company's actual financial performance. 
 
In conditions of market uncertainty, the value of relevant and reliable information reflected in company disclosures is 
an important factor (Hidayah 2008). The benefits of accounting information have no effect on risk perceptions 
(Lambert and Verrechia 2005; and Ferris, et al. 1990) in Hidayah 2008. This study explains that accounting 
information shows the performance, prospects, risk potential and firm value. , but this information does not provide a 
positive or negative attitude towards the company's shares. Use of information indicates a risk neutral preference. This 
suggests that users reduce dependence on firm performance because accounting risk measures are less important and 
tend to conduct speculative trades. 
 
Based on the explanation above, the variables of the quality of financial accounting information disclosure (indicators 
of the mandatory disclosure variable and the voluntary disclosure variable) together do not have a significant effect 
on the company's financial performance variables. 
 
3) Cash flow and financial performance of the company. 
 
The results showed that investors in the capital market have a strong interest in information related to company 
performance. Companies that have a good performance are able to maximize company profits which in turn will 
improve the welfare of share owners as indicated by the market price per share of the company. This can be seen from 
the increase in accounting profit and the flow component in the financial statements. The higher the increase and the 
positive effect of accounting profit and the cash flow component consisting of operating cash flow, investment and 
financing, will increase company value and increase shareholder wealth in the form of an increase in share prices. 
 
Analysis of cash flow and cash flow (Albrecht 2003) relating to company performance is seen as one of the methods 
to contribute to economic objectives in the market. Financial reports (Kusno 2004), especially those related to 
information on changes in cash flow and company accounting earnings, are one of the important information investors 
can use to assess company performance. A higher increase and a positive effect of accounting earnings and cash flow 
components which consist of (Oktavia 2008) that: operating cash flows, investing and financing, will increase firm 
value and increase shareholder wealth in the form of increased share prices. 
 
Hypothesis testing can be concluded that cash flow has a significant effect on financial performance. Cash flow has a 
positive effect on financial performance, meaning that the higher the cash flow, the higher the financial performance.

Abstract 
The main objective of this research is to see the causal relationship between infrastructure, taxes and GRDP 
per capita. The method used in this research is a quantitative approach with the variables are infrastructure, 
taxes and per capita GRDP. The infrastructure used here is the length of the road in kilometers; tax in rupiah 
units; while the GRDP used is per capita GRDP in rupiah units. All data used are secondary data in the form 
of time series data for the period 2006-2019. The results showed that first, infrastructure, taxes and per capita 
GRDP had no causality, but there was a one-way relationship, namely taxes affecting infrastructure; second, 
the cointegration test through the Johansen Co-Integration test shows that there is no cointegration; third, the 
function of impulse response and forecast error decomposition shows that the variable that most influences 
infrastructure and taxes is GRDP per capita, while the variable that most influences infrastructure is GRDP 
per capita; Fourth, the relationship variable based on the results of the Granger-Causality analysis test which 
is supported by the analysis of the impulse response function and the variance decomposition can conclude 
that the fluctuating tax growth has a direct effect (through per capita GRDP) on infrastructure improvement.

1. Introduction 
Economic development is defined as a process that causes an increase in the real income per capita of the population 
of a country in the long run, accompanied by improvements to the institutional system. The rate of economic 
development is often measured by economic growth through the increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or Gross 
National Product (GNI) produced by a country (Arsyad, 2010). Economic growth is a process of increasing per capita 
output for the long term, so that the percentage increase in total output should be higher than the percentage of the 
population and there is a long-term trend that this growth will continue (Tarigan, 2005). Process sentences are 
emphasized because they contain dynamic elements. The current theory of development economics continues to 
perfect the meaning and concept of economic growth. The theory states that economic growth is not only measured 
by the increase in GDP and GRDP, but also given immaterial weight, namely enjoyment, happiness, security, and 
peace felt by the wider community (Kuncoro, 2004). Economic growth determines the success of economic

4.  Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussion of the causality relationship of infrastructure, taxes and per capita GRDP, it can 
be proven that the three variables, namely infrastructure, taxes and per capita GRDP, do not have causality, but there 
is a one-way relationship, namely taxes affecting infrastructure. This suggests that the tax increase will improve 
infrastructure, including the addition of road infrastructure. The cointegration test through the Johansen Co-Integration 
test shows that there is no cointegration. The analysis of the impulse response function and the decomposition of 
forecast errors shows that the variable that most influences infrastructure and taxes is GRDP per capita, while the 
variable that most influences infrastructure is GRDP per capita. The relationship between variables based on the 
results of the Granger-Causality analysis test which is supported by the analysis of the impulse response function 
and variance decomposition can be relied upon that the fluctuating tax growth has an indirect effect (through per 
capita GRDP) on infrastructure improvement. The recommendations given are, first, to optimize the role of local 
government in infrastructure that can accommodate sufficiently, in this case the government acts firmly on tax 
collection so that taxes can become a resource for the government whose infrastructure is; second, it is necessary to 
supervise tax revenue and distribution so as not to misuse taxes; third, for further research it is necessary to examine 
the linkage between infrastructure and investment.

Abstract 
 
The decline in biodiversity is a global problem facing the world community. Metacognitive 
awareness affects the formation of a coherent mindset and creativity in students in solving 
biodiversity conservation problems. The purpose of this study was to determine metacognition 
awareness, creativity, and the relationship between metacognition awareness and student creativity 
in preserving biodiversity. This research method is a non-experimental survey involving 226 high 
school students. The instrument in this study was a metacognition awareness questionnaire and a 
test of students' creative essays. The results showed that the students' metacognitive awareness of 
cognitive knowledge aspects was 91.55 ""Super"" categories and cognitive regulatory aspects 60.36 
""Developed"" categories. The results showed that the student's creativity in the highest curiosity 
aspect was 54.65 basic categories; the highest fluency is 53.76 basic categories; the highest 
originality is 55.97 for the beginner category; the highest elaboration is 52.21 basic categories; the 
highest flexibility, namely 52.88 for the beginner category; and the highest divergent thinking is 
54.42 in the beginner category. There is a relationship between metacognitive awareness and 
student creativity. Based on the research results, it is suggested that training to empower students

Figure 1 shows the results of students' answers on the aspect of fluency. Figure 1 is an example of a student's 
answer with a score of 4, which means that the student's answer is able to mention some relevant ideas. The 
prerequisite for answering questions on the fluency aspect is basic knowledge. In this case students already have 
knowledge of the definition of biodiversity, germplasm, levels of biodiversity, threats, and conservation efforts. so 
that students are able to come up with some ideas for preserving biodiversity. Puryear (2015) explained that basic 
knowledge is part of declarative knowledge. Declarative knowledge is knowledge about a person's skills, intellectual 
resources, and abilities as learners. The relationship between metacognitive awareness and student creativity needs to 
be considered in more detail, not just paying attention to the cognitive aspects alone. Hargrove (2013) explained that 
metacognition awareness can improve students' higher order thinking skills. In more detail, Kozikoglu (2019) adds 
that metacognitive awareness plays a role in the formation of critical thinking patterns, creativity, and problem solving. 
Therefore, it is important to develop metacognitive awareness and creativity of students in learning. 
 
5.3 Validation 
 
The metacognition awareness questionnaire has been validated with Cronbach's Alpha coefficient is 0.18> 0.11, this 
figure shows that the instrument that has been compiled is valid and reliable. Creativity has been validated with 
Cronbach's Alpha coefficient is 0.79> 0.11, this figure shows that the creativity description test instrument that has 
been prepared is valid and reliable. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The conclusions in this study are as follows. 
1. The profile of students 'metacognition awareness on the aspect of knowledge about cognition is 91.55% in the 
super category.  60.36% of students' cognitive regulation is in the developing category. 
2. The profile of students' creativity in learning biodiversity, the highest curiosity aspect is at level 2 in the basic 
category with a percentage of 54.65 and the lowest at level 4 for the advanced category with a percentage of 0.66. 
The highest fluency aspect at level 2 basic category with a percentage of 53.76 and the lowest at level 4 category

Read carefully the case study below! (Questions 1-2) 
Forests in Indonesia have a variety of species. The distribution of biodiversity in it is 
also different. Forests on the island of Kalimantan, Indonesia have different 
biodiversity differences from forests on the island of Java. This is due to differences in 
soil physical and chemical factors. Kalimantan forests provide unique flora such as 
pitcher plant (Nepenthes, sp.) Nepenthes (Figure 1) has a variety of shapes and colors. 
Semar bags grow among ferns, pandanus, palms, and other shrubs. Currently the 
existence of semar bags is starting to be difficult to find, because their habitat has been 
converted into plantations and community settlements. 
1. Based on the above discourse, classify the level of diversity contained in the 
ecosystem, and come up with an idea to maintain the existence of the germplasm! 
Answer: 
The diversity of colors and patterns of semar bags including gene level diversity. 
The idea to maintain the presence of germplasm is by not illegally burning forests and 
creating a breeding ground for the pitcher plant.

Abstract 
 
The low income of fishers can be affected by natural conditions such as sea waves and rain. In this condition, the 
economic capacity of fishers is feeble. Fish cultivations can provide solutions so that fishers can still have an 
income.The fact is that the fisher's ability is not yet supporting to carry out fish cultivation. A synergy between 
institutions is needed to improve fisher's ability. This study aims to see a picture of fish cultivators and build an 
empowerment model for institutional synergy in fish cultivators.A quantitative descriptive research method. The 
sampling technique was purposive sampling, with a total of 92 fish cultivators as respondents: descriptive data 
analysis and focus group discussion. The study results describe fish cultivation in East Tanjung Jabung, for now, 
is only a side job. Fish cultivators still experience fish cultivation problems, including fish diseases, feed prices, 
capital, fluctuating prices, and abnormal fish growth. Marketing patterns still depend on intermediaries and have 
not been able to find their markets. The results of the analysis an institutional synergy empowerment model was 
built by mapping each institution's responsibilities by coordinating and communicating with each other to improve 
the capabilities of fish cultivators in dealing with problems.

1. Introduction 
East Tanjung Jabung Regency in Jambi Province is a coastal area. Generally, the livelihood of residents in coastal 
areas is as fishers. The lives of fishers in coastal areas are very worrying; they are still at the poverty line due to 
the difficulty of getting fish due to climatic factors (Kurnia Novianti, Henny Warsilah, 2016; Mussadun & 
Nurpratiwi, 2016). The coastal areas' climate condition is influenced by rain and sea waves, which causes changes 
in fishers’ income (Azizi et al., 2017; Pangalila, 2010). Rain and large sea waves make it difficult for fishers to 
catch fish, so there is a decrease in catch value (Marfirani & Adiatma, 2012; Patriana & Satria, 2015). There was 
also damage to fishing gear, so fishers had to spend more capital on repairing or buying new equipment. 
 
The dependence of fishers' income, who only rely on fishing, illustrates how few other opportunities are likely 
for fishers to spread their wings to other business types. When there is a large sea wave, fishers are usually faced 
with a dry season because they cannot catch fish for a while. For that, fishers must have another source of income. 
Coastal areas provide fish cultivation opportunities so that fishers do not have to depend on marine products 
entirely. Fishers do not need to worry about losing their income because fish cultivation can provide a good 
income for fishers. Several fishers have been doing fish cultivation in East Tanjung Jabung, but it has not provided 
maximum results yet, even though geographic conditions and government involvement have supported fish 
cultivation. The problem is that the fishers are still half-heartedly doing fish cultivation, so that cultivation has 
not provided maximum results for fishers. Another problem faced by cultivators is when the yield is high, fishers 
are faced with difficulties in selling (Budhathoki & Sapkota, 2018) 
 
Cultivation can provide additional sources of income and reduce poverty levels (Al-Amin et al., 2012). It is proven 
by research (Nzeve et al., 2018) that fish cultivation can support the lives of fishers, fish cultivation has a 
significant contribution to the welfare of fish cultivator households in Central Cub-County Kitui. Fish cultivation 
can also create jobs by empowering people around the cultivators, such as housewives and other underprivileged 
groups who do not have jobs to make processed foods such as fish smoking (Hino, 2011; Raodah, 2013;

considered to have 100% efficiency) as a reference from all DMUs being compared. The output variables are the 
percentage of steady roads, electrification ratios and community access to clean water (chosen as the Government’s 
Main Performance Indicator in infrastructure) with infrastructure expenditure (local government infrastructure 
spending plus provincial infrastructure spending in each regencies/ municipalities plus infrastructure spending from 
state budget in each regencies/municipalities). Regression using OLS to answer the second research objective is to 
determine the effect of the technical efficiency of infrastructure spending on unemployment in regencies/municipality 
in Jambi Province. The result show that the technical efficiency of infrastructure spending has a significant effect on 
unemployment of regencies/municipality in Jambi Province, its reduce unemployment.

1. Introduction  
Jambi Province is one of the provinces in Indonesia which has an area of 53,435 Km2, with a land area of 50,160.05 
Km2 and a water area of 3274.95 Km2. The population is spread across 9 (nine) districts and 2 (two) cities, which in 
2017 amounted to 3,515,017 people. The size of the infrastructure budget shows how much priority the Government 
has on infrastructure development in the region. The increase in the amount of budget and the percentage of 
infrastructure spending towards State spending in the last 5 (five) years and with the stipulation of infrastructure 
spending as one of the mandatory spending since 2017 (amounting to 25% of the Transfer Funds obtained by the 
Regional Government), will more or less have an impact on policy finance and infrastructure conditions in Jambi 
Province. 
 
1.1 Infrastructur Spending 
In order to find out how much local government infrastructure spending is in Jambi Province, the following will be 
presented in Figure 1. The infrastructure spending data used is the ratio of realized district /city infrastructure spending, 
realized provincial infrastructure spending in each district / city, DAK1 infrastructure spending that is derived from 
the APBD2 in each district / city towards the realization of regional expenditure.

609","This is reinforced by the data on the open unemployment rate in Jambi Province at the end of the study period, where 
the number of open unemployment based on the highest education attained has the following composition; No / never 
attended school, as many as 0 people; No / not yet graduated from elementary school as many as 3,581; SD as many 
as 7,691 people; 10,223 SMP; SMA as many as 26,102 people; SMK as many as 9,343 people; Diploma as many as 
2,374 people and universities as many as 7,502 people (BPS Jambi Province 2018). So based on these data the number 
of unemployed is actually dominated by the population who has the highest SMA followed by SMK. However, when 
viewed based on the percentage of the number of graduates at each level, the highest open unemployment came from 
SMK at 7.5% of the total number of SMK graduates, followed by SMA at 7.2% of the total SMA and University 
graduates by 5% of all. the number of residents who are scholars. 
 
There are several things that cause this condition to occur. First, the condition of districts / cities in Jambi Province, 
which is mostly still agricultural. So that most of the people's livelihoods still depend on the agricultural sector in a 
broad sense. So that the existing job offers have not been able to absorb labor based on the level of education, causing 
the number of open unemployed to be dominated by people who have a high level of education. In addition, the 
inadequate condition of infrastructure facilities such as steady roads, which percentage at the end of the study period 
was 69.782%, making information and mobilization of residents in areas with higher job offers also hampered due to 
the difficulty of information and transportation to get out of their places of residence.  
 
The results of this study are in line with the results of a study by Erdem and Tugcu (2012), who concluded that the 
higher the level of education completed is one of the factors that lead to increasing unemployment in Turkey in the 
long run. The average old school has also increased the unemployment rate in the short term although its influence is 
relatively small. Added by the research results of Manaseer and Al Qudah (2018) that the output of higher education 
levels in Jordan has a positive and significant influence on the unemployment rate in Jordan. 
 
6. Conclusions and Suggestions 
 
6.1 Conclusion 
Based on the analysis carried out on the research results and the discussion, which refers to the research objectives, 
the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1. The technical efficiency score has a value that fluctuates every year, and there is no single local government that 
every year always has a technical efficiency = 1 (TE = 1) throughout the study period. 
2. Technical efficiency of district / city infrastructure spending in jambi province has a significant effect on the 
unemployment rate in jambi province, which is able to reduce the unemployment rate. This result is in accordance 
with the predetermined hypothesis. Likewise, economic growth significantly reduces the unemployment rate. 
 
6.2   Suggestion 
a. In the future, further research is needed on measuring the technical efficiency of infrastructure spending by using 
multi-input and multi-output, with a larger scope. 
b. In the future, further research is needed on the effect of technical efficiency of infrastructure spending on the 
economy by using other determinants that are not discussed in this study. 
c. In the future, it is necessary to conduct research by also measuring the efficiency of the allocation and the economic 
efficiency of infrastructure spending and to determine the effect on the economy.

Abstract  
 
Activities at the port can be an environment that is potentially prone to accidents. Various studies have been conducted 
to reduce risks and discuss safety factors in large ports but little for small ports, especially in determining the analysis 
method. This paper aims to discuss various risk analysis methods that may be used in analyzing small port areas that 
are considered dangerous in port areas: (1) Formal Safety Assessment (FSA), (2) Risk-Based Decision-Making 
Guidelines (RPDM), (3) Frequency, probability, event tree (4) Quantitative risk assessment (QRA), and (5) Risk index 
and ranking. The literature method used is a literature study on a risk assessment which is then adjusted to the port 
characteristics. The results concluded that the FSA is a method that can still be used with adjustments in several ways, 
especially related to accident characteristics. Furthermore, we are developing the use of FSA with As Low As 
Sufficient and Practical (ALARP) based innovations, especially in small ports.

1. Introduction 
The port is one of the infrastructures in the marine transportation mode which plays an important role in supporting 
the smooth operation of sea and land transportation activities which are organized for the benefit of the public service. 
There have been many studies that have shown how important the role of port infrastructure is in economic growth 
and trade, job creation, and attracting investment  (Putra et al. 2018). furthermore, To further spur service performance 
improvements, especially related to safety, the Indonesia government has concerning sea transportation service 
standards, which emphasize more on the aspects of safety, order, regularity, comfort, convenience, and equality. A 
port is a vital means of economic development in a region and a source of state revenue, so a port that operates 
properly is needed so that the economy runs smoothly. In the eastern part of Indonesia, people with their economic 
activities rely heavily on the marine transportation sector, especially in Papua-Maluku Islands. 
 
1.1. Objektives 
The government has encouraged the development of ship infrastructure in Indonesia to be in line with the country's 
main infrastructure projects. As a result, sea transportation activities have increased, but this has increased incidents 
and accidents. Accidents issued by Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT)  in 2019, the number of 
accidents at sea has increased every year. From 2011 to 2018 there were 125 accidents (Figure 1), with the most 
accidents occurring around 43. During that time, 673 victims died or disappeared and 418 injured victims. The results

by applying various mitigation is required 
 
The value in question is the level (level) risk, which can be divided into risks that cannot be justified or accepted, 
except in extraordinary circumstances (intolerable), risks that have been made so small that it does not need further 
precautions (negligible), the risk whose levels were between intolerable and negligible levels so introduced methods 
(As Low As Reasonably Practicable = ALARP)(Selvik et al. 2020), 
 
""Reasonable"" or ""can be justified"". The opposite is ""unreasonable"" that is ""absurd"" or ""making it up"". Whereas 
""practicable"" is often defined as ""practical"" or rather ""can be applied relatively easily""(Baybutt 2014). Usually the 
reference is the availability of current technology and available resources. More details, if efforts to lower the risk of 
a job was difficult because the available technology is not adequate or require effort and funds were too large, then 
when it is necessary to re-think by finding another more adequate effort(Van Coile et al. 2019). 
 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
Risk assessments are nowadays an integral part of any port activity, mainly because of a need for port reliability, 
which is strongly related to service revenue. Port activity is much more sensitive to safety faults in the 
transportation of people and goods. An accident is an inability of a port operator and other partners in a process 
to manage unpredictable events. Risk Assessment and criteria, as presented in the paper, are strongly related to 
actual safety standards and modern port management. The use of Historical analysis, databases, statistics and 
frequency, probability, event trees in port risk assessments is not currently usable, due to the lack of accident 
data documented by the port in the form of accident reports. Analysis of both Refers to past accident data where 
the probability is only on certain events with frequent occurrences and subsequent impacts. National data 
collection was done by KNKT, and this was limited to major and reported accidents. Many accidents have been 
handled directly by the Polisi  Air (POLAIR) and the Port Authority. 
 
Format Safety Assessment (FSA), Quantitative risk assessment (QRA), The risk-based decision making 
(RBDM), and Risk Indices  Ratings guidelines provide proven methods for addressing real decision-making 
needs in the marine safety, security, and environmental protection arenas. Decision-makers throughout the 
marine industry will find the insights, suggestions, and procedures in the guidelines valuable in the conduct of 
their operations. The results conclude sequentially that the FSA, GRA, RPDM, and Risk Indices Ratings are 
deemed appropriate for port risk analysis. The use of the FSA with innovation ALARP needs to be considered 
in analyzing port safety risks. This is to ensure that safety resources are allocated to maximize the number of 
lives saved, and implies that the ALARP criteria result in stronger minimum requirements for life safety 
investments. 
 
The paper presents the methodology applying different approaches, deterministic and qualitative to present 
deeper understanding and relations governing risks. Operational (technical) risks are analyzed and discussed for 
further improvement in their management.

Abstract 
We know the world is in an uproar by a health problem where people are not free to travel for fear of being 
exposed to a virus called Covid 19. So that countries in the world do restrictions in relation to each other, this is 
done to break the transmission of the virus. Many in the countries of the world do lockdowns where in the area 
there was no activity at all for 14 days, this also happened in Indonesia but in Indonesia only did a large-scale 
social restrictions (PSBB). The effect of this for the business world is very large, where people's purchasing power 
decreases, the company's opinion automatically decreases. Because the company's revenue decreases, the 
company must make savings, one of which is employee downsizing, here we want to see about what factors the 
company does in maintaining and maintaining company efficiency. In this study, the Systematic Literature Review 
method was used with sources taken from Scopus, PubMed, and Proquest. in this study explains that layoffs are 
the last resort, and try not to lay off.

Abstract 
 
Materials Handling (MH) is one of the most essential aspects within manufacturing processes and/or industries. 
MH equipment are mechanical equipment used for the movement, storage, control and protection of materials, 
goods, and products throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption, and disposal. 
Transportation equipment used in manufacturing industries varies from pallet jack to forklift trucks and/or cranes. 
The size and type of a Material Handling System (MHS) and/or equipment influences the effectivity of the internal 
logistics within manufacturing industries. Therefore, it is very essential to choose a correct MHS for a correct 
manufacturing process which requires material handling to complete its operation. Incorrect usage or selection of 
an MHS for an operational process may lead to down time, damage to facility, increase in operating costs and/or 
pose Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) risks to workers. Over the years, many South African industries have 
been using Forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one point to another till today. The use of large forklift trucks 
within indoor manufacturing processes poses OHS risks to workers as its Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) 
produces fumes (Carbon Monoxide, CO) when in operation and exhaust fumes, (CO), are harmful to human’s 
health. On this basis, a new system design is recommended to eliminate the use of MHS that relies on ICE power 
source to prevent OHS risks in indoor manufacturing industries. In this project, Autodesk Inventor Professional 
software was used for design development of technical drawings and simulation as well as validation of the new 
system’s structure. Vehicle Dynamics’ principles and equations are used to determine the overall Rolling 
Resistance, Tractive Effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the power required to drive the system under 20 
– ton load capacity. The new system design has been developed to operate using a Hydraulic Power pack source, 
where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & 
lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. Electro-Hydraulic circuit systems were developed 
and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. Again, principles, laws and equations of Strength 
of Materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection of the new design system’s structure as 
well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments.

Factor of safety expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. Safety factors 
are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such 
as bridges and buildings, but the structure's ability to carry a load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy as 
shown in Table 8 (Engineering Toolbox, 2019).

10. Conclusion 
In conlusion, the main objective of this research has been achieved through the design and development of the new 
proposed MHS that is capable of replacing the use of very big forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing 
companies. Large forklift trucks rely on ICE power source which unfortunately poses health risks to workers. ICE 
produces exhaust fumes (CO) while running. Exhaust fumes are harmful to human health. Therefore, the research 
beacame a success whereby a new proposed MHS has been designed using Autodesk Inventor Professional and 
material selection of the new design system’s components has been carried out and verified in relation with their 
strength & reliability properties. Through this paper and its engineering analysis, it is proven that the use of internal 
combustion engines in heavy duty handling systems that are operated within indoor manufactring factories and or 
internal logistics can be eliminated and replaced with an eco-friendly hydraulic systems technology. Therefore, 
this new system design promotes Occupational Health and Safety of people working in industrial areas where Bulk 
Material Handling systems are in place (Mafokwane, et al., 2019).

and Von Mises stress values. The systems induce a deflection of 5.325 mm and Von Mises stress of 174.125 MPa 
giving a safety factor of 4.36 ul under full load capacity (Mafokwane and Kallon, 2019).
