Abstract 
Tax revenue collection is enchanted territory for many nations. The woes that governments face in trying to raise 
resources for service provision via tax revenue cannot be overemphasized. This study assesses the relationships 
between tax revenue mobilization and three of its predictors in Zambia. The three predictors are external debt, FDI 
inflows and copper prices. Public outcry about public debt, the quality of foreign investments and the fact that 
Zambia’s major export has historically been copper, make the three determinants important to study in this context. 
The study uniquely contributes to the role of prices of the country’s major export (copper) on its tax revenue. Data for 
tax revenue (as a percentage of GDP) was obtained from the Zambia Revenue Authority website. Secondary data for 
the predictors came from the world development index database for the years 1995 to 2019. The ARDL approach is 
used to model the long and short run relationships between tax revenue and its three determinants in this study. The 
study finds a positive long run relationship between external debt and tax revenue. Copper prices only had a positive 
long run relationship with tax revenue at the 10% significance level.  The FDI inflows show no relationship with tax 
revenue in both the short and long run. External debt and copper prices both had positive significant short run 
relationships with tax revenue. The study makes several recommendations for policy makers, tax revenue collecting 
authorities and practitioners as well as for scholarship.

1. Introduction
Every country needs tax revenue in order to finance its development programs. Tax collection is therefore crucial to 
a country's ability to provide social and other services. However, developing nations often collect consistently low 
taxes. This causes them to resort to debt for the provision of public goods. Other times, they encourage Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) inflows in order to increase economic activity and hence the tax base. Some of these countries are 
mineral rich. However, as Asfaha (2012) and Pedro (2006) highlight, most literature finds that mineral wealth is 
negatively correlated with economic growth and hence moves hand in hand with income inequality in developing 
nations.  
Additionally, developing countries; especially in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) have often come under pressure for what 
some people term as ‘reckless borrowing’. These countries between Marrakech in Morocco and Cape town in South 
Africa; the number dozens, often find themselves struggling to pay debt. Surprisingly, many are endowed with natural 
resources in the form of minerals. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia; for example, are among 
the top ten exporters of copper in the world. Copper therefore plays an important role in Zambia’s economy (Unceta,

1","6. Conclusion  
This study assessed the relationships between tax revenue mobilization and three of its predictors in Zambia. The three 
predictors are external debt, FDI inflows and copper prices. Public outcry about public debt, the quality of foreign 
investments and the fact that Zambia’s major export has historically been copper, make the three determinants 
particularly important to study. Data for tax revenue was obtained from the ZRA website. Secondary data for the 
predictors came from the WDI database. The ARDL approach is used to model the long and short run relationships 
between tax revenue and its three determinants in this study. External debt was found to have a positive long run 
relationship with tax revenue. Copper prices only had a positive long run relationship at the 10% significance level.  
The FDI inflows showed no relationship with tax revenue in both the short and long run. External debt and copper 
prices both had positive significant short run relationships with tax revenue. The study makes several 
recommendations for policy makers, tax revenue collecting authorities and practitioners as well as for scholarship.

Abstract 
The main objective is to explore the short term consumer credit high interest rate problem and the infectiveness of 
current interventions such as regulation while developing an alternative model. Therefore, the paper develops a 
theoretical alternative model which addresses the major interest rate cost drivers subject to stakeholder engagement 
through suitability, acceptability and feasibility assessment. This is because previous studies have arguably 
unsuccessfully attempted to solve the matter through policy regulation albeit without satisfactory stakeholder 
engagement hence the shortcomings.  The rationale of the new theoretical Interest Rate Model suggest that the 
alternative model informed by key stakeholder engagement would be more appropriate to address the adverse effects 
of high-cost short term consumer credit than regulation.

Short-term Consumer Credit, High Interest Rates, Policy Regulatory ineffectiveness  
1. Introduction
Short-term consumer credit has come under scrutiny for its association with high interest rates and exploitative 
practices, which have contributed to rising household debt and financial distress among consumers (Malone and Skiba 
2020; OECD 2019; Schwartz and Robinson 2018; Servon 2017; Skiba 2012). Despite this, the demand for short-term 
credit continues to grow, leading to concerns over potential increases in related negative impacts (Servon 2017; Bhutta, 
Skiba and Tobacman 2015; Stegman 2007). As such, various stakeholders have sought solutions to address these 
issues, with regulation being the most frequently proposed approach. However, the history of attempts to regulate 
short-term credit, such as payday loans, has been unsuccessful since the 1990s (Servon 2017). 
This study posits that the inefficacy of previous efforts to address the shortcomings of short-term consumer credit can 
be attributed to a fundamental flaw in the short-term consumer credit interest rate model. This model fails to 
incorporate the factors that drive the cost of interest, thereby perpetuating high interest rates and related negative 
effects (Miller 2013; Ackerman 1999; Arrow and Debreu 1954). As a result, regulation, although a necessary 
component of intervention, may not be sufficient to address the underlying issues in the interest rate model (GRZ 
2021; Malone and Skiba 2020; He and Tian 2020; Bernier and Plouffe 2019). 
2. Literature Review
2.1 Interest Rates
Interest rate refers to the fee charged by a lender to a borrower for the use of money, expressed as a percentage of the 
loan's principal (Belongia and Ireland 2014; Mashkin 2013; Gorder 2009; Trainer 1987; Fisher 1930).

Figure 3. Theory of Personal Reputation in Organizations 
In view of the foregoing, Figure.3 breaks down the theory of personal reputation in organizations (Ferris, Zinko, Blass 
and Laird 2007; Ferris et al. 2003) which provides the basis for the creation of a virtual community that is focused on 
predictable stakeholder behavior. This is achieved by tracking transactions and sharing information with other 
stakeholders as a basis for benefitting from good practices or avoiding bad practices that may jeopardize future 
transactions. 
The theory of personal reputation in organizations states that reputation is a valuable intangible asset that can be used 
as collateral over time (Chu 2002; Miller 2000). The norm in most markets, especially in developing countries, is that 
despite there being trustworthy consumers, very few benefit from their good business practices as there is usually no 
basis upon which to track their good consumer/business practices. Consequently, each time they transact in the market 
place, they are treated just like any other potential defaulter and end up not benefiting from their good consumer 
practices. 
This model is designed to change this by providing a platform through which those not in formal employment could 
trade directly with merchants until they build “Reputational Collateral” (Chu 2002; Miller 2000). This information 
sharing is developed from the credit bureau concept but with modifications as not much value is gotten from credit 
bureaus as they usually provide centralized information to a select few stakeholders. When those who have access to 
such information are considered relative to the entire marketplace, they turn out not to be spread wide enough to 
adequately address a market-wide phenomenon such as adverse selection (Ferris, Zinko, Blass and Laird 2007; Ferris 
et al. 2003). 
The model adopted for the creation of this virtual community is premised on the General Equilibrium assumptions of 
perfect information and complete markets (Ferris et al. 2007; Ferris et al. 2003). The aim is to achieve a low-cost 
interest rate model for short-term consumer credit. In view of this, the conceptual framework lays out the development 
and sustainability of an environment with predictable stakeholder behavior to actualize the rationale of the appropriate 
Interest Rate Model for short-term consumer credit. The study will track reputation and moral hazard as the 
independent and dependent variables respectively, and the constituent theories of reputation such as social comparison, 
self-regulation, signaling, social information processing, contagion, and communication theories as intervening or 
mediating variables. 
7. Conclusion
The main objective was to explore the short term consumer credit high interest rate problem and the infectiveness of 
current interventions such as regulation while developing an alternative model. The study developed an alternative 
model which addresses the major interest rate cost drivers anchored on stakeholder engagement through suitability, 
acceptability and feasibility assessment. This was because previous studies had arguably unsuccessfully attempted to 
solve the matter through policy regulation albeit without satisfactory stakeholder engagement hence the shortcomings. 
The rationale of the resultant Interest Rate Model suggest that the alternative model would be suitable, feasible and 
acceptable to key stakeholders. Therefore, the study contributes to relevant existing theory by advancing a proactive 
possible solution to the short term consumer interest rate conundrum. The theoretical model basically advocates for 
market driven solutions such as addressing the interest rate cost drivers to market problems unlike policy regulatory 
measures which are based on the inadequate reductionist methodology.

Abstract  
Globally, nowadays, security has become a major issue and we all come across various security threats; from data 
leaks, cybercrime, data stealing to data manipulation among others because of the traditional methods of enforcing 
security such as passwords with a high risk of exposure to hacking in spite enforcing other measures like multi factor 
authentication. While this may prove secure, biometric technology potentially has proved to be much more secure 
given that the mechanism requires identification and validation of users through data matching after users’ images are 
stored in a central database. They often store unique characteristics of the user. This is what makes biometric 
technology not to be hacked and more reliable. In this review, we focus on biometrics for crime reporting using geo 
spatial locations.

Abstract 
The competitiveness of automotive component manufacturers is no longer driven by the price at which they sell their 
components but by the quality of the products they deliver. Vehicle assembling corporations are inclined to moving 
their business to component manufacturers that deliver quality components as opposed to delivering low-priced 
components with poor quality. An automotive component manufacturer which manufactures vehicle side-steps 
through a blow-moulding process was struggling with the implementation of the principle of built-in-quality. This 
was reflected in their traditional reactive approach of using quality gates as opposed to driving built-in-quality in their 
conversion operations. This has resulted in high labour requirements (inspectors), high rate of reworks and scrap which 
impacted significantly on the profitability of the manufacturer. Given the severity of this problem, the aim of the study 
was to develop a strategic approach to aid automotive component manufacturers in the implementation of built-in-
quality in their manufacturing streams. Several lean manufacturing techniques such as Pareto analysis, 5why analysis, 
standard operating procedures, time studies, and statistical process controls were employed to identify operational 
gaps and opportunities in the manufacturing streams, to develop a strategic approach to implement built-in-quality. 
The results of the study were the implementation of built-in-quality on a manufacturing line, and the development of 
a 4-step approach for manufacturers to attain built-in-quality in their processes that was guided by Deming’s Plan-
Do-Check-Act cycle.

1. Introduction
Automotive component manufacturers hold core to the fundamental roots of mobility, which is one of the key drivers 
of economic participation. The manufacturers have the mammoth task of ensuring that the quality of their products is 
at the highest standard to remain competitive and claim market share. Reklitis et al. (2021) strongly advises that 
businesses need to focus on quality as the key driver of competitiveness as opposed to focusing on price tags only. 
This has seen most automotive component manufacturers going about the formation of quality gates in their 
manufacturing processes to inspect for quality as opposed to building quality into their products. The consequences 
of the formation of quality gates are a reduction in process capability, high scrap rates, high manpower costs and an 
overall reactive approach to product quality. Once quality issues are detected at the customer, the mindset is not on 
improving the process during the build, but on allocating the task of inspecting to a quality inspector as a quality gate. 
Ensuring product built-in-quality during manufacturing is one approach that manufacturers need to consider as a way 
of life and be embedded in the culture of the organization to remain competitive and profitable. Psarommatis (2020) 
recognizes product built-in-quality as a tool to overcome cost implications such as labour, reworks, and defect outflow 
to enhance competitiveness. The Fourth Industrial Revolution comes with many digital age innovations and enablers

5.7 Proposed improvements 
•
Move the weighing elements from the final inspector to the part moulding process to avoid assembling of
brackets and brightworks on over/under weight parts. Cost saving can be realised on the part assemblies that
are scrapped and time wasted on assembling an already out of spec part.
•
Automation of the weighing process – a Pokayoke system to be linked to the scale such that if a part is put
on the scale and is over/under weight, it can be rejected immediately and eliminate passing a defective part
to the next process.
•
Introduce torque wrenches that are Pokayoke controlled to eliminate the variations in torque specifications.
The Pokayoke system must not allow a sidestep assembly jig to open unless it has cleared off the required
torque specification.
•
Introduce a feed ratio controller on the feeding system of the material to ensure accurate balancing of virgin
and regrind material that is fed into the system to reduce appearance issues.
•
Give operators authority and ownership of the parts they produce by allowing them to reject parts that are
sub-standard. Quality responsibility to be on the shoulders of the entire operation as opposed to it lying with
the inspector alone.
6. Conclusion
The study applied several lean manufacturing techniques to identify gaps in the implementation of built-in-quality in 
automotive component manufacturers and developed a subduing strategy. Automotive component manufacturers can 
follow the developed strategic approach that is centred around Deming’s Plan-Do-Check-Act method. The study has 
shown to an extent that automotive component manufacturers need to invest in technology and empower employees 
to make decisions through coaching and training. automotive component manufacturers need to close the departmental 
gaps that are currently created during process design and enforce a unified multi-departmental approach towards 
designing their processes. Quality assurance must not be a departmental responsibility, but an organizational 
responsibility from the inception of processes. The employment of built-in-quality strategy brings into light hidden 
cost benefits of labour reduction, adequate utilization of resources and reduced process times especially in 
manufacturing lines where quality gates are in series with manufacturing processes. The first objective of the study 
was met through the development of a Pareto analysis, while the second objective was also met using a 5Why analysis 
technique which identified the root-causes of defects. The third objective of the study was also met through an 
experimental study of comparison. Gaps and opportunities that were identified using the various lean techniques led 
to the identification of technological advancements that can be employed to drive built-in-quality, which talks to the 
fourth objective. A detailed strategic approach was developed to aid automotive component manufacturers in 
implementing built-in-quality on their manufacturing lines. Further research into this area of study would be centred 
around the integration of shopfloor employees to fool-proof systems, defect detection technologies and 
comprehending digital product information to drive built-in-quality.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has brought many changes in our lives, and we must adapt in different ways. 
Quality 4.0 is also part of the change. 4IR affected how organizations perceive quality; how has it affected the higher 
education sector in South Africa? This is the question this study attempts to answer. The study aimed to assess the use 
of quality 4.0 trends in higher education institutions in South Africa. To best achieve the study, The following 
objectives were listed: (1) To identify the most used quality 4.0 trends in higher education institutions in South Africa; 
(2) To highlight the respondents' perspective on quality 4.0 and finally; (3) To recommend ways to a successful
implementation of quality 4.0 in higher education institutions. The study followed a quantitative approach using a
questionnaire to collect data from 300 respondents mixed between staff and students from higher education
institutions. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. To assess the reliability of the
questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha was used. The study revealed that quality 4.0 is a relatively new field in South Africa,
both on the business and academic levels. In addition, most of the respondents are not familiar with the quality 4.0
concept but are familiar with its trends. From the most used trend in higher education institutions, the top five were:
Online social platforms (YouTube, WhatsApp, Zoom, etc.), IoT, Simulation, AR and Big data analytics.

5. Conclusion and recommendations
The study offered perspectives on using quality 4.0 trends in the South African higher education sector. A review of 
the existing literature showed that quality 4.0 is relatively a new field in South Africa, both on the business and 
academic levels. Nevertheless, the results revealed that even though most of the respondents are not familiar with 
quality 4.0 concepts, they are at least familiar with some trends that come with it. This is generally because quality 
4.0 trends are similar to 4IR's. The literature identified nine trends: Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), 
Multi-Agent Systems, Systems Integration, Big data analytics, Simulation, Cyber Security, Cloud Computing and 
Additive manufacturing. Not all these trends are used to the same extent in higher education institutions. The results 
revealed that the top five were: Online social platforms (YouTube, WhatsApp, Zoom, etc.), IoT, Simulation, AR and 
Big data analytics. 
Although there is a need to commend higher education institutions on their involvement in adopting quality 4.0 trends, 
it is recommended that with the fast-growing technological rate, more should be done to keep up the pace. Developing 
institutions that are 4IR ready, raising awareness on quality 4.0, and empowering staff to use more quality 4.0 trends 
in their lecturing styles are a few recommendations higher education institutions should try to implement.

Abstract 
Businesses around the world strive to operational costs and waste across their supply chains to remain competitive in 
the growing global market. Initiatives for set-up duration reduction are critical for lean manufacturing implementation 
despite than many organisations that initiate Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) fail on implementation. The 
plastic injection moulding machines at an engineering firm are characterised by an ineffective process and the main 
problem was that the single changeover time ranged from 45 min to over 60 minutes, thereby leading to longer 
downtime and less production time. The scenario resulted in production capacity constraints, longer lead times and 
this led to loss of future business with some of the customers due to failure to meet delivery dates. The objective of 
this study is to identify and separate external and internal elements, establish cycle time and reduce tool changeover 
time for the plastic injection moulding machines. By implementing the new tailor-made SMED improvement 
programme of having tools ready before machine stops running, combining steps, bringing tool-holder before 
commencing the tool change process and establishing the production sequence to take advantage of temperatures, 
material type and colour, the engineering firm achieved 22% reduction in changeover time.

1. Introduction
Businesses around the world strive to operational costs and waste across their supply chains to remain competitive in
the growing global market. The case study engineering firm manufactures automotive components in metals,
leatherette and plastics, with divisions that include automotive trim, plastic injection moulding, automotive
accessories, component assemblies, product development, tool and die, quality and logistics. The engineering firm is
characterised by four pillars of success, namely manufacturing excellence, cumulative value-added, growth, and
people development, and the organisation values are respect, trust, teamwork integrity, responsible manufacturing and
professionalism. Many firms invest in the implementation of lean principles to remain competitive. The objectives of
lean principles is to satisfy customer demand as much as possible through reduction of waste. Elimination of waste
applies throughout the company; that includes human resources, design, production processes and activities, logistics
and inventory sectors. Waste is any substance, which is discarded after primary use because it has lost its value. If any
activity that a customer is not willing to pay for either with money, time or resources, thus, it is quite crucial to avoid
and eliminate it. Waste elimination is the process of getting rid of waste and Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED)
is one of the pillars of “Lean Manufacturing” that can be deployed to eliminate waste from processes.. It is a technique
that makes it simple and possible to conduct equipment or tool set-up and change-over activities within fewer minutes.
SMED uses a set of techniques to perform equipment set-up and change-over operations in less than 10 minutes.
The plastic injection moulding machines at the engineering firm are characterised by an ineffective process whereby 
the plastics granules are added into a hopper, then its passes into the barrel of the injection unit, which is set at a 
specific temperature, thus the material melts and changes from solid states to liquid states. Inside the barrel, the screw 
transports the molten material into the mould cavity in which the plastic solidifies in a matter of seconds. The mould 
would thereafter open, part is ejected and the mould would close again and the process is repeated. However, the main 
problem is that the single changeover time ranged from 45 min to over 60 minutes, thereby leading to longer downtime 
and less production time. The scenario resulted in production capacity constraints, longer lead times and this led to

Figure 3 shows the proportion of changeover work element to each other. It was found that about 70% of the activities 
taking place are non-value adding and can be converted to external work element.  As results, the changeover time 
decrease from 45 min/changeover to 35 min/changeover. This 35 min is made up of internal work elements combined 
with material purging and is 22% reduction in changeover time.

The data collection and analysis provided the work element sheets that were categorised as external and internal
elements. The total cycle time for changeover was established as 59.59 minutes. The implementation of the proposed
improvement initiatives by the engineering firm reduced the tool changeover time from 45 min/changeover to 35
min/changeover or 22% reduction. It is recommended that to sustain the minimum tool changeover time, the
established production sequence to be followed, that would minimise the time lost due to material purging, since the
production sequence takes advantage of material colour, type as well as material temperatures. Companies must pay
attention to SMED activities carried out during separation phase, since proper identification of internal and external

Abstract 
The current fourth industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, implies digitalisation is central to African countries to 
leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and boost its manufacturing sector. However, the lack 
of right governmental policies, poor state of industries, and lack of regulatory frameworks in most African countries 
make digitalization of industries and for the continent to realize the goals of integration in line with AfCFTA complex. 
For Zambia, where no national Industry 4.0 initiative is in force, how is the manufacturing industry preparing for the 
digital future? This study was designed to answer this question. The study used a quantitative research design, and a 
structured questionnaire distributed to manufacturing companies appearing on the Zambia Association of 
Manufacturers’ database for data collection. A total of 50 questionnaires were successfully completed. The data were 
analysed using SPSS to conduct descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. The results from the study show 
that the major challenges to the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies included; high investment cost of Industry 4.0 
technologies, need to reduce costs to stay competitive, IT security, growing complexity of processes and lack of skills 
and insufficient training of the staff. These findings suggest that Zambia is likely to lag the adoption of the current 
industrial development, digitalization, and greater integration trajectory, and risk being left out of the AfCFTA and 
Industry 4.0 opportunities. It is recommended that a Industry 4.0 national initiative be put in place to help bolster 
Industry 4.0 adoption by manufacturing firms in Zambia.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, refers to the integration of advanced technologies and the 
Internet of Things (IoT) into various industries, including manufacturing, logistics, and services. This concept is 
characterized by the use of cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics to 
create smart factories and supply chains that can operate more efficiently and with greater flexibility. Industry 4.0 will 
make global manufacturing much more connected and competitive in the future. It offers the potential for increased 
productivity, improved quality, and reduced costs, while also enabling new business models and opportunities for 
innovation. The fourth industrial revolution presents an opportunity for the manufacturing sector on the African 
continent to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies, especially as the continent looks to achieve a unified Africa in the Global 
Supply Chain through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The AfCFTA was launched to support 
African countries’ industrialisation by promoting linkages across the continent, which would facilitate growth of the 
manufacturing sector. The current fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, implies digitalisation is central to African 
countries to leverage the AfCFTA and boost its manufacturing sector. This is critical as history shows that no country 
has reached an advanced stage of economic and social development without an advanced industrial sector. Industry 
4.0 is often implemented with digitalization as the first important step. Digital technologies allow for new business 
models and value-producing opportunities, and are attainable for most developing countries, such as Zambia. It has 
been noted that, right from the inception of Industry 4.0, globally many nations stimulated the adoption of Industry 
4.0 technologies by launching Industry 4.0 Initiatives that created facilitating environments for accelerated adoption 
of Industry 4.0 technologies. These Initiatives are important in that; (i) to governments, these represent important

their respective strategies in order to survive in the global marketplace. These result is supported by Bogoviz et al., 
(2019) study, which states that developed countries have developed national strategies and policies to promote 
Industry 4.0 technologies, whereas developing countries have adopted Industry 4.0 technologies on a corporate level, 
relying on individual corporate initiatives than national and coordinated policies. Because of various policies for the 
advancement of Industry 4.0, the influencing challenges in industrialized and developing countries differ. 
6. Conclusion
The knowledge level analysis produced the mean Likert Scores for the majority Industry 4.0 technologies between 2 
and 3 scales, representing Low and Moderate levels, respectively. This implies that Manufacturing Industries in 
Zambia had a low to moderate knowledge on Industry 4.0, meaning most of the companies had a low awareness on 
the main technologies of Industry 4.0. They had low to moderate knowledge on internet of things, mobile technologies, 
cybersecurity, smart sensors, big data and analytics, cloud computing and predictive maintenance, all of which are 
core to digitisation. Some of the main challenges to implement Industries 4.0 identified by the companies were ‘high 
investment costs and a need to reduce costs in order to remain competitive as common challenges to digital 
transformation. On the question of whether the company had any strategy to move to Industry 4.0, 29% of respondents 
indicated that they do not have a strategy in place for industry 4.0, while 18% are preparing one, and 12% said they 
have a strategy for Industry 4.0 but it’s not part of their company strategy. Only 22% said they have a strategy and its 
part of their company strategy. Clearly initiatives at enterprise level are not leading to expected 4IR technologies 
adoption levels. These findings suggest that Zambia is likely to lag the adoption of the current industrial development, 
digitalization, and greater integration trajectory, and risk being left out of the AfCFTA and Industry 4.0 opportunities. 
The establishment of a national Industry 4.0 initiative would create an environment that facilitates industry adoption 
of new technologies because the economic challenges identified can easily be addressed by the Government.

Abstract 
The manufacturing sector is one of the most influential sectors in a country's economy, as it determines its current 
status and growth. Within this, the food and beverage industry is one of the biggest ones, representing a large part of 
the sector in Peru. Hence, the purpose of this research will be to improve the efficiency of one company in the food 
and beverage industry. Through the tools of Systematic Layout Planning and 5S, belonging to the Lean Manufacturing 
methodology, measures were proposed in order to achieve the objective. The first consists of generating proposals for 
plant distribution that allow optimizing times and reducing distances. Through the ARENA software, this tool could 
be simulated, obtaining promising results. As for the 5S, this will allow to keep the work areas clean and organized, 
managing to improve the flow of materials and the work environment. This research succeeded to increase the 
efficiency of the company's plant, demonstrating the effectiveness of these tools. In this way, this paper will serve for 
future research on Lean Manufacturing tools applied in the food and beverage industry.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing sector is a fundamental pillar for the growth of a country, both economically and competitively 
(Legarda-Zaragueta et al. 2014). This industry is a measuring tool to determine the economic situation of a country, 
besides being capable to identify the general economic behavior (Prospecta 2014). For this reason, a key to the 
manufacturing sector is plant efficiency, since it seeks to make the most of resources and create a relationship between 
the objective and the results obtained. In other words, good results are sought with the least effort (Chapman 2006). 
Likewise, the food and beverage sector generates a large part of the production and employment in industrialized 
countries (Organización Internacional del Trabajo 2022). In the case of Peru, this industry contributed 3.7% to GDP 
in 2019, which represented 26.2% of the manufacturing sector. In addition, it generated around 417,000 jobs (Sociedad 
Nacional de Industrias 2020). Regarding production, this obtained a percentage variation of 7.4% in 2021 compared 
to 2020, which shows a great growth in the production of the sector in the span of a year (Instituto de Estudios 
Económicos y Sociales - Sociedad Nacional de Industrias 2021). This growing industry means that companies must 
be more efficient, as they must make the most of their resources in order to meet demand. However, this is not a 
reality, since only 36% of manufacturing companies belonging to the food industry in a country with similar conditions

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the implementation of the 5S and SLP tools proved to be effective in the company. Although the 
industry standard efficiency was not reached, it was managed to increase by 30%, which is still significantly positive. 
On the other hand, the application of 5S provided an improvement in the work environment, facilitating the tasks of 
the operators and guaranteeing cleanliness and order in the work areas. Thus, the proposed objectives and the correct 
development of the investigation were achieved. In this way, this study can be useful for companies in the food 
industry.

Abstract 
The textile industry in the last decade has considerably increased its competitiveness worldwide, being one of the most 
influential in the Peruvian economy. For this reason, it is necessary for textile workshops to maintain high productivity, 
and to be more efficient, making the most of resources in their production. Therefore, the objective of this research is 
to improve productivity and have better results with little investment, since the textile sector mainly has micro and 
small companies (SMEs) that occupy a large part of the market, as the company in the present case study. To do this, 
through the tools of Kanban, 5S and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), they were implemented in the company to 
achieve the established objective. Thus, when implementing the 5S, it was possible to obtain better results in terms of 
a more orderly and clean work area, which allows workers to be more productive and have a better work environment. 
In the case of SLP, the relational diagram method was carried out and a simulation was carried out using the ARENA 
software, which had an increase in productivity by reducing the time to carry out a work order of 1400 T-shirts.

1.Introduction
From the financial perspective of the textile sector worldwide, a complicated situation is expected due to competition 
from countries with low wages, which causes a change in the structure of the supply chain of textile companies. In 
this sense, new structures such as outsourcing or mislocation can be observed. (Manfredsson 2016). This research will 
be focused on this sector, in which, worldwide, the number 1 country where 23% of textile production is concentrated 
is China; and in position 24, we can find Peru. Likewise, it may seem at first a place of not very high relevance 
worldwide; However, if the context of Peru is analyzed exclusively, it can be found that the textile sector from 2016 
to 2020 had the contribution of 2.1% of employment and 0. 8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and within the 
manufacturing sector, to which it belongs, represented 6.3%. (PRODUCE 2021) 
On the other hand, a factor that impacts the textile industry is the percentage of shrinkage that it has, which means 
those ""losses"" that are obtained throughout the process of the distribution chain and sales in the retail market. (Bruzzi 
sf). The processes where they are generated are in the transportation, storage, distribution, production, and sale of 
these goods that affect their nature and convert them into a quantitative loss, therefore, these losses can be counted, 
measured, weighed, etc., in units. (Ayala 2009). In the Peruvian textile sector, there was a drop in the production of 
the clothing subsector with a total of 35.9% between January and December 2020, where the most affected items were 
polo shirts, pants, and shirts. Likewise, a productivity of around 70 has been identified. 76% in a textile company

6. Conclusion
It is concluded that the implementation of the 5S, Kanban and SLP tools have shown to increase the productivity of 
the ca. These tools allowed reducing the time in the manufacturing process, improving order and cleanliness, and 
improving the process flow, which helped to solve the root causes of the previously mentioned problem tree, when 
the initial situation of the company was analyzed. 
In turn, it can be concluded that for the applied tools to be successful, a commitment must be required from all the 
people involved, as well as feedback, which is essential, since it allows the effectiveness of the tool to be achieved, 
achieving continuous improvement. sustainable and not temporary. Thus, it was possible to achieve the proposed 
objectives and the correct development of the investigation.

Abstract 
The Lean Six Sigma approach has become a popular initiative which companies have embarked on to remain 
competitive, ensure growth within the global market and to establish customer satisfaction and loyalty. Six Sigma is 
at the top of the agenda for many companies that aim to reduce cost and improve a firm’s productivity. This paper 
focuses on a production that was unable to meet the hourly target. Using the six-sigma approach and DMAIC 
methodology, the current problems on the line were studied and the root cause was established by using a fish bone 
diagram. Process improvement initiatives were characterised by the installation of a conveyor, synchronised with the 
takt time, and the production line was able to meet the daily output a. An Andon system was also installed to keep 
track of scoring, to ensure each process meets their required cycle time and process operation as well as to indicate to 
line management if there is an abnormality at any process or holistically.

Introduction
Manufacturing companies are struggling to keep up with fluctuating and an increase in volume at their production
lines. Their primary goal is to meet customer demands, with the shortest lead time and with the highest quality
(Rathilal, 2015). Efficient and low-cost production is the aim of any production process. Continuous process
improvement is critical for organizations to stay in business and to stay competitive in the industry. A sewing
component manufacturing company situated in South Africa faced challenges when they received an additional
volume of components requested by the customer daily. This production line named Line X was not able to meet their
hourly target and subsequently their daily score. This line is also a sub production line to the final assembly line before
the product eventually reaches the customer. The daily available time per day is 455min with a volume of 168 units
per shift. Their takt time calculated is 2.70min for each unit. Their plan or quantity to be met hourly is 22 units per
hour in an eight-hour shift. The Andon assists in the waste reduction of lean by lowering the response time to issues.
The system is supposed to give a quick overview of production visually and attract the attention of supervisors. The
aim of this study is to identify the root causes of inefficiency in the assembly Line labelled X. The fishbone diagram
will be used to investigate potential causes of the line not meeting their hourly score. This paper will also focus on the
use of the Six Sigma approach (DMAIC) to investigate and identify ways to ensure there is an improvement of hourly
targets online X.
1.1 Objectives of study 
This research paper objectives are: 
•
To identify constraints on a cell type process using a fishbone diagram.
•
To implement a pacemaker to ensure hourly production score is met.

As captured in week one, there was hardly no difference in the scores of the components being manufactured. This 
was commonly expected as the conveyor is still new and the employees were still getting used to working with a 
constant speed. The daily score eventually picked up and between week 2 and week 3 and then finally the desired 
output was achieved. In week 4 and week 5, we see that the daily target scores were achieved and now at a constant. 
Data from the andon system was also extracted to give us an insight of the amount of work delays in minutes. The 
information is summarized and shown below in Figure 12. 
Figure 12. Delay per process captured by the Andon system 
From the number of minutes captured for the delay at each process, we can see that at the start of week one, there was 
an average of 83.45min of delay which is equal to 1.39 hours of downtime. Whereas as the weeks went along and the 
member got aligned with their process and working with the conveyor, the delay decreased to an average of 7.25 min 
per process, 0.12hour of downtime. By this we can see that our objective was achieved by installing a pacemaker/ 
conveyor and the collection of data, in this case the downtime/delay time was captured with the Andon system 
installed.

Conclusion
The DMAIC Approach, is one of the fastest and most efficient way of defining the problem, measuring or collecting
data, analyzing the data collected, propose ways to improve the current situation and lastly how to control and maintain 
the selected recommendation if carried out. In a nutshell, six sigma was proposed as a tool to improve the reliability
& the quality of products by starting off at the manufacturing process to attain the end goal i.e. Reducing defects. The
article further goes on to stay that even though Sis sigma was developed as an operational strategy due to globalization, 
it is now a “competitive corporate strategy used extensively throughout the corporate world” (Kumar et al 2007).
From the constraints mapped out on a fishbone diagram successfully and from this we were then able to deal with 
issues relating to man and method. A pacemaker in the form of a conveyor was successfully implemented and was set 
and running according to the takt of the line.

The production line X were now easily able to now meet their production score of an hourly target of 22 an hour and 
were not able to meet customer requirements. Standardized work is now being followed, production members and 
each process were now able to work according to their takt. There was no discipline of the lie. Members did not leave 
their processes unless there was a member to relief them. 
The production visualization system or the Andon system was also successfully implemented at the line side. This 
assisted greatly at responding to issues at each process to ensure the line runs efficiently.

Abstract  
Digital media has influenced the even organizational communication has it has become the present day toolbox for 
knowledge sharing. It is a very dynamic form of information exchange that happens in real time and spaces reaching 
out to large numbers in an instantaneous manner as compared to traditional media. Effecting the integration of 
organizational discourse communication with digital media cannot go on without first analyzing the impact of digital 
divide as was the case with the Seventh-day Adventist in Zambia during Covid19 at the same time establishing if there 
is any impact among these challenges. A descriptive and survey design was employed in this research. The study 
population was made up of church members, church workers, and administrators of the Seventh-day Adventist Church 
from all the ten provinces of Zambia with a total membership of 1,295,153. The research objectives were handled by 
mixed method with an interpretive or constructive paradigm with an embedded subjectivism philosophy and SPSS 
was used for thematic and content analysis. The finding from this study posit that digital divide significantly impacts 
the Integration of Organizational Discourse with Digital Media as was the case during Covid-19 Pandemic. It was 
recommended that the organization builds up a digital media communication infrastructure spearheaded by experts 
who can effectively implement the established model of organizational discourse integrated with digital media and 
effectively use digital media engagement tools.

1. Introduction
Amid the Covid1-19 epidemic, the majority of states in the region enacted different lockdowns that imposed temporary 
restrictions on corporate operations and prevented public gatherings. This resulted in religious congregations and 
communities limiting attendance at religious services, halting events and physical meetings for various committees, 
boards, and unofficial groups, and prohibiting public gatherings. Kołodziejska (2021). Moreover, COVID-19 cannot 
be refuted; the lockdowns and accompanying economic troubles have had unfathomable repercussions, particularly 
for women, ethnic minorities, and low-income earners as a whole. Daniel Muzio and Jonathan Doh, respectively 
(2021). This has severely hindered the organizational discourse of many organizations. ""Organizational discourse 
involves studies of the function and impact of metaphor, language games, stones, narratives, rituals, rhetoric, texts, 
dialogue, drama, discussions, and sensemaking,"" as stated by Grant et. al.  (2001). 
The Seventh-day Adventist church began as a breakaway movement from existing churches in the United States of 
America, which was formally founded as a church in 1863 and established a mission in Zambia in 1905. Christian 
mission is central to the SDA church, just as it is to every other Christian denomination. This mission, with various 
goals such as the proclamation of the Gospel throughout the entire world, the restoration of humanity's relationship 
with God, and the establishment of Christ's kingdom on earth (cf. Bosch's standard work for an extensive historical 
overview of mission paradigms 1991), appears to fundamentally refer to principles that are typically only partially 
and/or temporarily attained. 
Numerous organizational discourse experts assert that digital media and virtual conferencing features can be used for 
discourse communication, but fail to specify the extent to which these elements can be incorporated and the difficulties 
associated with integration. Despite these knowledge gaps, organizational discourse academics and corporate 
communication experts have made little effort to explain why the Church in Zambia is not adopting technologically 
proactive procedures and processes. For lack of a well-integrated digital media and virtual conferencing 
communication model in the church's organizational discourse, there has been a growing trend among its members to 
feel isolated and out of step with the church's expectations, not to mention that this can perpetuate a communication

The above results in Table 8 present a summary of the relationship between digital media platforms and perception 
(bridges of hope). As seen from the table and figure, all the five digital media platforms (on average) show a 
statistically significant association with the perception variables (p=0.000). The strength of this association has been 
observed to be different by the Phi coefficient and Cramer’s V coefficient which have shown that the degree of 
association for the digital media platforms with quality life is not the same. The relationship represents a ranking of 
the media platforms in terms of how they contribute towards the perception ranked in the order Facebook, WhatsApp, 
WeChat, Instagram and Twitter in the last position. This is peculiar because Facebook has again assumed its first 
position. 
5. Summary of Findings
 The data collected from church members as internal church members was to determine the usefulness of digital media 
in Organizational Discourse communication. The first component was to determine how much volume of content 
about the organization’s identity was being communicated and the response hereof from the said church members. 
From data collected, there was an impressive degree of content volume communicated on digital media. From the 
second component’s data collected it was also established that the organization projection of its financial transactions 
via digital media was not as impressive to its church members.  As much as it was established from the respondents’ 
data collected that the organization had enough resources to establish an integrated digital media communication 
system, the organization rarely communicated on multiple social network sites (SNS). This could the explanation to 
why the respondents felt the organization didn’t have impressive volume of content to impact in organization’ s 
discourse communication. Data covered in this study confirms the need for organizations to be equipped with effective 
strategies of integrating organizational discourse communication with digital media. Because of the advent of dynamic 
communication and digital media being the case here, there is great need for organizations to narrow the focus on how 
they communicate in order to remain relevant and effective in OD communication. The advent of social network sites 
has leveraged the church members to interact with the organization in a dialogical manner. In the past communication 
was asymmetric and that now not being the case makes organizations to watch out for any communication distortion 
that might cause a communication barrier for their discourse.  
6. Conclusion
Regarding the influence of the digital divide on the integration of organizational discourse with digital media and 
virtual conferencing during the Covid-19 pandemic, the following conclusions may be drawn: 
I.
It goes without saying that the church has a fairly young membership, as 67 percent of respondents were
under 30 years old. This demonstrates that over two-thirds of the organization's church members are
screenagers. And because their gender, age, employment, and marital status impacted the extent of their
digital media involvement, the organization must continue to utilize digital media to engage with these church 
members. There are particular communication strategies that these church members would want to see their
organization employ. As a means of communicating with its church members, the company utilizes blogs,
podcasts, and Twitter less frequently than it should.

II.
The content of must align with the aims of the aforementioned church members. If the organization's content
aligns with their aspiration, this can be quite beneficial. This can be highly beneficial if these church members
observe the firm engaging in corporate social responsibilities that align with their goals. Such actions have a
tendency to manage the perceptions of these church members.
6.1 Recommendations for Changes of Practice 
Following are recommendations for the Seventh-day Adventist church in Zambia regarding its integration of 
organizational discourse with digital media and virtual conferencing. 
I.
It was recommended that the organization builds up a digital media communication infrastructure
spearheaded by experts who can effectively implement the established model of organizational discourse
integrated with digital media and effectively use digital media engagement tools. Obviously, this will permit
simultaneous communication of the same discourse across many media.
II.
Since digital media allows the communicated to, to also create content, it is imperative that the church create
and effectively implement a digital media policy for its members, so that their e digital media engagement
do not negate the organization's discourse.

Abstract  
Power production systems are made up of assets that support material handling and production of electricity. As these 
assets deteriorate, it may be difficult to deliver the expected quality of service, and to meet regulatory requirements and 
sustainable development goals (Lutchman, 2018).  
Moreover, Covid 19 has accelerated both manufacturing and service industries to go digital (Biard & Nour, 2021), increasing 
demand for both electrical power and production systems reliability. This challenge imposes an increase in the focus on efficiency of 
physical asset management and has prompted power production Industries to look for innovative solutions that yield maximum 
value for physical asset management functions. The arrival of asset management 4.0 concepts enables the exploitation of big data 
to improve and manage system reliability (Longhitano, et al., 2021).  
Furthermore, asset performance depends on various factors like quality of maintenance and operating environmental factors, such 
that even two identical assets will seldom obey their estimated mean time to failure (Longhitano, et al., 2021). Considering this, a 
data driven approach is necessary as it spot deviations in time and maintenance is done when required, increasing its 
effectiveness (Jasiulewicz-Kaczmarek, et al., 2020).  
The present research aims to develop a data driven asset management framework that is enhanced by Industry 4.0 technologies 
to execute the key functions of asset management in the operation, maintenance, and management phase of the physical asset’s 
life cycle, and effectively integrate the environmental, social, and economic aspects into physical asset management related 
activities to 
improve system performance and extend its service life.

Abstract 
Zambia like most Sub-Saharan countries grapples with low electrification rates especially in rural areas. Currently, 
rural electrification rates in Zambia stand at 8% (4.4% and 7.4% on-grid and solar respectively) and the country has a 
universal access to electricity Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of attaining 51% rural electrification rate by 
2030. The country has been advancing various renewable energy technologies, upscaling hydro power plants as well 
as subsidy-based electrification programs in selected areas. However, the electrification rate remains low. Further, 
with the shift in Government policy to remove subsidies in the energy sector, there was need to ascertain what 
influence the connection fee subsidies had on sustainable rural electrification in line with meeting the set universal 
access to electricity target. Therefore, the research conducted an analysis of connection fee subsidies on sustainable 
rural electrification with a focus on Chibombo district where the connection fee subsidy mechanism was implemented 
under the Electricity Services Access Project (ESAP).   
The study used a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach for data collection. Quantitative data was attained 
via the administration of research questionnaires with closed-ended questions while qualitative data was attained via 
semi-structured interviews with experienced experts in the electricity sub-sector. The study found that 938 
beneficiaries had been connected under the subsidy mechanism of the ESAP project which was almost three-fold the 
initial target of 385 beneficiaries. The study further applied descriptive statistics to analyze the quantitative data. 
Through correlation analysis, the study established a statistically significant positive correlation between connection 
fee subsidy and increase in electricity connections and sustainable electricity consumption levels. Further, the study 
found a negative correlation between high connection cost and rural electrification rates. The study also identified 
critical success factors for sustainable rural electrification which included: economic sustainability, social-cultural 
sustainability, institutional capacity and environmental sustainability. Thereafter, the study developed a sustainability 
framework for rural electrification by integrating the critical success factors with sustainable rural electrification.

Abstract 
The trend of coal production in Indonesia has been increasing since 2020. This increase in coal production also has an 
impact on sales of heavy equipment. Heavy equipment sales have increased from 2020 to the first semester of 2022. 
Mining haul trucks are currently equipped with industrial 4.0 technology, namely IoT, which can be used to monitor 
equipment health. Through predictive maintenance or maintenance 4.0, companies can manage resources and energy 
efficiently. The complexity of technology and this digital revolution if not managed properly will have a negative 
impact, one of them is reducing the competitiveness of a company. This study aims to identify maturity levels of 
maintenance in coal mining actors in Indonesia, especially about data driven asset management. There are four 
maintenance maturity levels that will be assessed: visual inspections, instrument inspections, real time monitoring, 
and predictive maintenance in industry 4.0. It will be combined with three data maturity levels: initial, established, 
and advanced. Questionnaire is used to collect opinions of maintenance managers as the owner of maintenance process 
about their experience in conducting maintenance. It is then summarized to state maturity level of maintenance 
practices in an Indonesian coal mining contracting company. It is concluded that maintenance characteristics in this 
company mostly fit with predictive maintenance in industry 4.0 characteristics.

1. Introduction
Baskoro et al. (2021) stated that energy is one of the factors related to economic growth and living standards, including 
in Indonesia. This energy is divided into primary and secondary energy (Kartiasih et al. 2012). The Ministry of Energy 
and Mineral Resources Republic of Indonesia (2022) defines primary energy as energy which in its original form is 
extracted by mining, damming, or utilizing renewable energy. Petroleum, natural gas, coal, and renewable energy are 
primary energy in Indonesia (Secretariat General National Energy Council 2019). Among these energy sources, one 
of the most important is coal. In 2025 it is estimated that 30% of Indonesia's energy sources will come from coal 
(Baskoro et al. 2021).

digital sensors, advanced and digitally connected machines, using special condition monitoring software, data is 
analyzed by data scientist, and organizations have highly skilled data analysis capabilities. The improvement must 
consider the four dimensions of maintenance strategy planning: service delivery strategy, organization and work 
structure, treatment methodology, and support system (Rahayu et al. 2019). This implementation can lead a company 
to be more competitive, especially in the resource costs (Wibowo and Nurcahyo 2020), by controlling or reducing 
failure before significant physical deteriorations occurs (Dachyar et al. 2018).

6. Conclusion
Diagnosis of maintenance maturity level is an important step to develop maintenance strategy. This activity should be 
taken if an organization want to shift their maintenance level to the higher maturity level. This study is carried out to 
determine which maintenance maturity level is an Indonesia’s coal mining contractor. Some literatures are taken as a 
baseline to create the questionnaire. The questionnaire is a multiple-choice type and spread to owners of related

maintenance processes. Their answers are mostly mapped in level 4 of maintenance maturity (predictive maintenance 
in I4.0). The compliance of their current state is 65% of the defined characteristics. As a recommendation, management 
should improve their process so that it will be fit with the characteristics. For future research, this diagnosis can be 
used to develop a framework for the company to be fully mature in maintenance. The framework should cover all 
maintenance aspects so that it can be fully deployed effectively. Due to limitation of diagnosis that is only conducted 
in a company, future research should be taken for other companies so we can compare which one is better. Based on 
this comparison, management can take counter measure to be more competitive.

Abstract 
PT XYZ is a company in the supply chain of coal distribution activities from Jetty Loa Tebu to Muara Berau. The 
coal distribution fleet operated is a barge guided by tugs. PT XYZ must be able to plan the needs of effective coal 
distribution capacity to avoid uneven distribution, anticipate fluctu ations and increase demand for transhipment. 
This study aims to calculate the projected number of coal transhipment and distribution capacity needs by barges 
at PT XYZ in the next 5 years and determine the appropriate capacity planning strategy to be implemented in 
meeting the needs. The research method used is forecasting to project the number of coal transhipment from 10 
years ago, the methods being compared are regression and decomposition which appropriate for long-term 
forecasting. The accuracy of the forecasting model is compared and shows that forecasting using decomposition 
has better results to apply because it has the smallest RMSE and MAPE values. Coal transhipment projection in 
2027 is 1,008,638 MT and we build with Fuzzy Logic Mamdani Optimization model with some rules and 
parameter. Furthermore, based on forecasting and optimization result we need to add 8 barges to balance the 
transhipment projection in 2027, a cost analysis comparison is conducted for alternative lead, lag, and average 
capacity strategies. The calculation results show that the lead capacity strategy has the lowest cost value and is 
the best capacity planning strategy by investing in or adding sets of tugs and barges.

1. Introduction
The area of Indonesia is around 7.81 million km2. Of the total area of Indonesia, 3.25 million km2 is sea and 2.55 
million km2 is the Exclusive Economic Zone. The efficiency of maritime transportation and logistics is very 
important for developing the economy in Indonesia (Amin 2021). According to Shipping and Transport Maritime 
Management, Netherland Maritime Institute of Technology one of the businesses that depend on waters is the coal 
mining sector. According to Fatai (2004) Coal commodities in Indonesia have a strategic role in supporting energy 
security while at the same time supporting the country's economy, especially foreign exchange earnings from 
exports, with looking at the real contribution to Indonesia's development, the coal industry is considered potential 
and prospective for the long term. However, not all products can be exported due to limitations such as irregular 
ship schedules, high transportation and logistics costs, and lack of logistics assets in the loading area. (Tinastiti 
2019). Therefore, a company that acts as a supply chain integrator is needed to increase the efficiency and 
effectiveness of coal delivery to customers through the assistance of information and communication technology 
systems. In Indonesia, Coal Logistics will be sent on Barge assisted by Tug and due to low waterways we need 
transshipment activity to transfer cargo from barge to vessel, which showing in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Flow of Coal Logistics in Indonesia 
Based on below operational data from 2013-2022, the idle time for tugboats and barges at the Loa Tebu Jetty is 
very high. The demand for coal loading and unloading services using tugboats and barges is growing fluctuatively 
and tends to be slow. Planning the need for the number of tugboats and barges is required routinely every year 
which refers to the actual coal sales data from the Jetty to the Offshore Going Vessel (OGV).

years from January 2025 to December 2029, in which half of the required capacity of tugboats and barges with 
the holding of the investment will be carried out simultaneously with half the capacity requirement for the 
distribution of coal by chartering tugboats and barges. Based on the calculation results, the total cost required to 
implement this strategy is IDR 3,257,754,662,465,94. 
5.1.4 Comparison between three Capacity Strategy 
After conducting a cost analysis for each alternative barge capacity requirement planning strategy, it can be seen 
that the best strategy for procuring barges at the Separi Jetty to meet the needs for coal distribution capacity is to 
implement a lead capacity strategy in the form of adding 8 (eight) sets of 7,500 MT barges, with the result that 
the total cost of this strategy is the lowest cost IDR 2,746,115,872,435.00 (Table 8).

6. Conclusion
Based on the results of calculations and analysis that has been done on the data processed, then it can be concluded 
as follows:  
1.
The accuracy of the forecasting model is compared and shows that forecasting using decomposition has
better results to apply because it has the smallest RMSE and MAPE values. Coal transhipment projection
in 2027 is 1,008,638 MT.
2.
In line with the significant increase in coal export, we have to add assets in order to fulfill export needs.
Based on forecasting and fuzzy logic calculation, the exact optimal number to increase the barge is 8.
3.
Appropriate capacity planning strategy to implement in fulfillment of tugboats and barges at this
company is the lead strategy capacity with the total cost IDR 2,746,115,872,435.00 for adding sets of
tugboats and barges the lowest.

Industry

Abstract 
Service delivery automation is seen as the new norm that uses automated service delivery channels and advanced 
technologies to provide services to customers. In recent years, the integration of advanced technology-based practices 
to deliver services in the banking industry has grown exponentially and is currently having a significant impact on 
customer perceptions and, subsequently, on the productivity of the entire financial sector. This paper looks at the 
influence and impact of adopting service delivery automation on the potentiality of job losses or unemployment in the 
South African banking industry, with a focus on the five prominent banking institutions in the country. An analysis of 
the employees' perceptions of the phenomenon at hand was conducted to determine whether service delivery 
automation brings along unemployment through job losses. A conceptual framework was developed to lay the ground 
for hypotheses to test the model developed for this paper. Through the hypothesis testing, it was found that there is a 
significant relationship between service delivery automation and the generation of job losses, whereby the more 
banking institutions integrate automation into their structural business model, the more certain category of job 
opportunities are lost or displaced. 
Keywords  
Service delivery automation, digitalisation, job losses, unemployment and banking industry. 
1. Introduction
In recent years, the integration of technologically based practices to deliver services has taken an exponential turn in 
the banking industry. It is currently impacting customers' perceptions and, ultimately, financial services' productivity 
(Malik et al. 2016). According to Makarand (2018), service delivery automation is an umbrella concept where a series 
of human activities are automated through advanced technologies in the service delivery chain. Service delivery 
automation is simply the capacity to complement innovative technologies that can simplify business processes and 
reduce disruption. Correspondingly, not all technologies provide automation and replace a single human action with 
technology. 
Notably, the hot and most common topic today is the implication of smart technologies, which have automation as the 
ramification. With the adoption of service delivery automation within the banking industry, banking institutions have 
revolutionised the way of interacting with customers. Banks have several proven automation adoption strategies at 
their disposal, from increasing cross-functional collaboration and execution to achieving ""quick wins"" via the 
automation of small tasks. What is critical to moving forward is an understanding that automation is not a silver bullet. 
Instead, banks view automation as a vital component of an overall digital business strategy that, over time, will include 
cognitive computing, human-centric design, the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. To that, human interaction 
in service delivery has been significantly redefined, meaning that the integration of machines seems to exponentially 
takes over human-intensive activities. Also, automation innovation in the banking industry brings both efficiency and 
disruption and radically new ways of engaging and doing business. For countries and organisations that are ready for 
the integration of smart technologies and have a well-trained workforce and are prepared to adapt to the machine-run, 
service delivery automation has the potential to uncover new value, create and redesign more jobs than those being 
lost and boost growth significantly (Accenture 2018). However, in the banking industry, such as the South African 
one, which is averagely less prepared and basically young, service delivery automation may bring more job losses

The researcher followed an inferential approach to provide interpretive arguments from figure 2. That is to say, the 
findings displayed could be interpreted and discussed from different perspectives depending on the purpose of the 
study. It is also necessary to note that the generation of job losses can be seen as the unemployment dimension 
emanating from adopting bank automation. From 2018 to 2021, Absa, Nedbank and Standard bank recorded 
significant levels of lay-off across the five banking institutions. Alternatively, the level of job losses was significant 
in the three banks. There were also some pivotal fluctuations in the number of FNB employees over the four years, 
especially a substantial decrease in the number of employees between 2020 and December 2021. On the other hand, 
Capitec bank showed a steady increase in the number of employees across the four years. This could be justified by 
the fact that the bank is a novice and still has to establish its footprint across the country and make itself known to 
customers despite being part of the big five. 
Overall, by the end of December 2021, there was a total of 136944 employees against 145528 employees in 2018. 
That is a decrease of 6 percent in employees across the five banks countrywide. Accordingly, Nedbank (2021) unveiled 
that self-service options for functions previously available only in branches or through employee-assisted channels 
were now digitally accessible. This has taken the total digital self-service functions to 171 (compared with 114 in 
2019). Besides, this demonstrates that most of these banks are moving towards an automated environment which tends 
to negatively affect the physical footprint of these banks. This finding is in line with the results reported under primary 
data, whereby the adoption of bank automation impacts the generation of job losses within banking institutions. In 
addition, in line with changing customer behaviour, banks are forced to make use of automation to respond to 
customers' preferences accordingly. Due to the closure of certain branches, many impacted employees were 
successfully redeployed to other roles in the banking environment, while some opted for voluntary retrenchment and 
others were formally retrenched (Standard bank group 2019). This shows the level of impact that the adoption of bank 
automation has on the generations of job losses. 
5. Conclusion
Service delivery automation through the adoption of bank automation displayed a strong relationship with the 
generation of job losses, which is also referred to as a dimension of unemployment orchestrated by implementing 
technology-based practices. The path analysis based on the primary data indicated that the more Absa, Capitec bank, 
FNB, Nedbank and Standard bank restructure their business models to integrate automation, the greater the number 
of job losses observed throughout the service delivery chain. Therefore, this seems to influence and impact low-skilled 
employees, unlike employees with technology-related skills, who are privileged and reap a large portion of the benefits 
of adopting automation. In addition, the inferential interpretation of the secondary data also supported the primary 
data's results. The implementation of service delivery automation creates new types of jobs or job opportunities which 
are not beneficial nor within reach of all employees at all levels because they require advanced skills. 
6. Recommendation for future research
The influence of service delivery automation on job losses was examined using the five largest banking institutions in 
South Africa as a case study. For more rigorous results, it would be commended to conduct a study that will examine 
the relationship between service delivery automation and the generation of job losses from the entire financial services 
institutions' perspective in South Africa. This would provide additional robustness in generalising the results.

Abstract 
Alzheimer is a disease that has aroused the interest of several researchers around the world for decades, and 
so far, no cure has been found to end its proliferation. One of the critical symptoms of AD is memory loss, 
something that puts the patient at great risk and puts his family in pain. This research aims to resolve this 
problem, it focuses on the development of an integrated solution, which will help Alzheimer's patient to have a 
certain autonomy and to create a certain peace of mind among their relatives. This project is divided into two 
main parts an electronic bracelet and an informatic platform. Hence, the electronic bracelet, which is mainly 
based on a GPS technology, will allow a real-time monitoring of the movements of the patient wearing it, and 
the informatic platform will allow the people taking care of the patient to visualise his actual position. This 
smart solution will reduce the risk of patients to get lost in the streets, and can gather information form 
patient all over the world to study their behaviour, and consequently have more comprehensibility of this 
disease. In this article, we will present the core concept of the electronic bracelet, and the architecture of the 
informatic platform.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to 
die. It is the most common cause of dementia; a continuous decline in thinking, behavioural and social skills that 
affects a person’s ability to function independently. AD is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and 
thinking skills and eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. Worldwide, at least 50 million people are 
believed to be living with AD or some type of dementia. The most dangerous part is that these patients lose control 
and if they escape, it would be so hard to find them.  To avoid the risk of losses in people with AD, several studies 
have been done. In a study, a researcher developed an electronic tracking system that is a mobile GPS receiver-
shaped, including function of telephony and data transfer via GSM / GPRS (Faucounau et al. 2009). This system 
aims to explore the needs and perceptions of wandering persons and their caregivers towards existing tracking 
devices as well as their acceptability and usability. In another related research the author tried to answer the 
growing number of people suffering from AD by offering a low-cost, easy-to-deploy technological solution 
(Bettahar et al. 2013). The goal is to perform a continuous and automated monitoring of the patient in his living 
environment. It is a multisensory surveillance system consisting of a network of sensibly distributed motion

147","4. Discussion and conclusion
As we mentioned above AD is a complex progressive brain degenerative causing cognitive and functional decline. 
So, the big challenge for scientists is to find a cure to recover the cognitive ability of Alzheimer’s patient. 
Unfortunately, till now there is no medical solution for this illness, but because of the current technological and 
software advances, we can reduce the bad effect of AD. In fact, the existing technological solutions have the 
ultimate goal to make the patients more independent, so they can handle autonomously their daily activities.  
The integrated solution that we propose has many features once implanted correctly, it will make it a prominent 
solution comparing to the already existing solutions in the market. By using geolocating technics, we propose to 
establish a distant monitoring of the Alzheimer’s patient, more explicitly the patient will wear a bracelet which 
has a GPS module and a permanent internet connection, so the web application already developed can monitor 
continuously the real time position of the patient. This web application has a confidential access by the caregivers 
and the responsible family members of the patient.  
Based on the need analysis that we have done, we have taken into consideration all necessary features that this 
solution must have, in order to work properly, for instance the long battery autonomy, the GPS position accuracy, 
internet coverage, water resistance, shock resistance, etc. But for us, the most ambitious goal, is to integrate a 
machine learning module, that can process a data collected from a several patients wearing the bracelets. This 
data is related to the patient health like his body temperature, blood pressure, heartbeat and the walking distance, 
and also this data contain the environmental conditions like the exterior temperature, the humidity, the noise, etc. 
Hence, the study of this data might guide us to understand more the eventual factors that affect positively or 
negatively the health situation of the Alzheimer’s patients.   
In this paper, we presented the outline of our solution especially, the choice of the bracelet and watches devices 
and the global features compared with anther solutions. We identified the methodology and methods. After a 
conceptual model has been presented. We finally identified the architecture of an integrated solution for tracking 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and discussed the study’s contributions.  
In the future, we intend to integrate a machine learning module, that can process data collected from patients 
wearing our bracelets. This module will recommend environmental conditions like the exterior temperature, the 
humidity, the noise, etc.

Abstract  
Indonesia is a tropical country where the equator passes, and the sun tends to shine longer than other countries. Solar 
energy is one of the sources of energy that Indonesia is currently developing. Thus, solar energy has considerable 
potential to be developed in Indonesia. According to the Institute for Essential Service Reform (2021), the potential 
for solar power in Indonesia reaches 207,898GW using 4.34% to 24.43% of the total land area. The Photovoltaic (PV) 
Module and Inverter are the two primary parts of a PV system. PV Modules are anticipated to last 25 to 30 years, 
while Inverters are anticipated to last 10 to 15 years. PV Modules and Inverters are not designed with reuse in mind 
when entering the end of life of the product, therefore, some of the materials used to produce PV Modules and Inverters 
will be discarded because they cannot be reused. Indonesia will produce a significant amount of electronic waste due 
to the lifespan of a PV system. This study was conducted based on examining information from papers, journals, 
research reports. This research will discuss the policy, regulation, the projection of Solar PV waste in Indonesia in the 
future and classify the different kinds of hazardous waste in PV systems.

1. Introduction
Greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia are expected to continue to increase in 2021-2030. This is in line with the 
increasing use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. According to data released from the Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry on 2021, Indonesia produces greenhouse gas emissions of around 1.9 billion tons of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) (Laporan KLHK 2021). In 2021, Indonesia managed to reduce emissions by 69.5 million tons of CO2 
equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 where previously in 2019, Indonesia produced greenhouse gas emissions of around 1.9 
billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Laporan Kinerja Ditjen EBTKE 2021). This achievement consisted of several 
factors, namely the implementation of new and renewable energy, energy efficiency, low carbon fuels, clean 
generation technology and others. In this implementation, the new and renewable energy sector contributed to the 
largest emission reduction with a reduction of 30.34 million tonnes of CO2e. It is anticipated that the energy supply 
of renewable energy will continue to grow considerably in order to satisfy the energy demand, and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions all at once (Madsuha et al. 2021). In Indonesia, solar energy has considerable potential to be developed. 
According to the Institute for Essential Service Reform (2021), the potential for solar power in Indonesia reaches 
207,898GW using 4.34% to 24.43% of the total land area. However, the PV systems are expected to last around 25 to 
30 years. After the system reach its lifespan, the system had to be dismantled since it would no longer be able to absorb 
energy as effectively because of the degradation over the years and will cause a lot of waste, especially the hazardous 
one (Fthenakis 2000). 
1.1 Objectives  
This research will discuss the policy, regulation, the projection of Solar PV waste in Indonesia in the future and classify 
the different kinds of hazardous waste in PV systems.

As part of the construction of the solar system network, leftover cables and wrapping are appropriately preserved so 
that they may be reused if necessary. Copper is particularly common in the cables. In order to properly manage 
hazardous waste, copper must be isolated from other heavy metals. Copper may contaminate water and soil and 
endanger the life of living creatures if segregation and management are not done as prescribed. Printed circuit boards, 
which can include heavy metals like lead, tin, and copper, the scrap from other solar system components found in the 
inverter, solar charger controller, and battery management system.  
6. Conclusion
As one of the nations strategically located on the equator, Indonesia has the potential to develop solar energy because 
the sun shines for a longer period of time there. At the moment, Indonesia is actively working toward a goal of 23% 
new and renewable energy by 2025 and reaching emission-free by 2050. Indonesia is progressing in the 
implementation of innovative and sustainable energy, particularly in the energy from solar power plants. Despite the 
fact that solar energy has no emissions, the parts of a power plant system eventually create hazardous waste, and such 
as mercury, lead, tin, and zinc, which can have a harmful impact on the ecosystem and human health. The estimated 
waste that will be generated from the PV system from one of the solar power plant installers in Indonesia is 72,277 
tons for the PV module and 190 tons for the inverter.

Abstract 
The fuel supply chain is one of the important activities in the downstream oil and gas business in Indonesia. However, 
the company encountered several obstacles in distributing fuel oil through small-scale fuel stations. This study aimed 
to apply the Soft System Methodology (SSM) approach in obtaining the concept evaluation of fuel oil supply chain 
activities from terminal to small-scale fuel oil stations. However, this study only performed four SSM steps by adding 
a System Diagram and Multi Actor Analysis tables to understand the problems better. Nevertheless, this study has 
successfully identified the problems, the actors involved, and the relationship between actors in fuel supply chain 
activities. Therefore, it can provide an overview for the stakeholders involved, especially the heads of the company, 
to take transformation steps. This study will be continued by solving problems using the AHP-TOPSIS hybrid method 
in future research.

Introduction
Total Indonesian energy consumption in 2021 was 909.24 million BOE (Barrel Oil Equivalent), with the most 
significant percentage of consumption in the transportation sector of 388.42 million BOE or 42.72%. Based on the 
type of energy, 430 million BOE of fuel oil is still used as the largest energy source in Indonesia (HEESI 2021). One 
of the important activities in downstream oil and gas business activities in Indonesia is trading activities. PT Pertamina 
Patra Niaga, one of the oil companies in Indonesia, has built fuel oil stations that are smaller than the average number 
of stations. Through this small-scale station development, they hope to increase fuel oil sales, make it easy for the 
public to access fuel oil purchases, and help the government create an equitable distribution of fuel oil availability and 
distribution.  
Based on Reid & Sanders (2013), Supply chain management (SCM) involves managing the flow of materials and 
information from suppliers and buyers of raw materials to the final customer. A supply chain is a network of all the 
activities involved in delivering a finished product or service to the customer. The objective is to have everyone in the 
chain work together to reduce overall costs and improve quality and service delivery. The performance of a supply 
chain is characterized by its ability to remain market-sensitive without losing integration through the chain (Gupta and 
Singh 2015). 
The fuel supply chain is one of the important activities in the downstream oil and gas business in Indonesia. These 
activities consist of two network systems, which are the supply system network and the distribution system network. 
In the fuel oil distribution system, fuel oil terminals and stations play an essential role. Their performance will 
determine how fuel oil can be delivered to end customers. Nowadays, in Indonesia, smaller fuel stations have been 
developed. It help customer in rural areas to get easier the fuel oil, but on the other hand, companies must face 
challenges in distributing fuel oil to this smaller fuel station so the process will more effective and efficient. By using 
the Soft System Methodology framework approach, the pattern of these fuel oil distribution activities can be analyzed 
and modelled, so it will help the company know the problem and the transformation that must be applied.

5. Conclusion 
Making the right decision to solve a problem involving many criteria needs to be done appropriately. The decision 
cannot be adequately taken if the problem is not explained clearly and in detail. Using the Soft System Methodology, 
this research has identified problems in the fuel oil supply chain from the terminal to the small-scale stations. The 
actors involved and the relationship between actors in supply chain activities have been analyzed in detail to provide 
an overview for the stakeholders involved, especially the head of the company, to take transformation steps. This 
research will be continued by solving problems using the AHP-TOPSIS hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method 
in selecting the fuel station as a station hub.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the need for public transportation keeps on growing rapidly. One of the globally rapidly growing 
transportation modes is the Train. Train operation has something to do with the signaling system. 
Communications-based train control (CBTC) is a modern type of signaling system based on two-way 
communication using radio waves between Wayside and Onboard devices. CBTC System is a fully automated 
system that requires robust maintenance of many components in order to prevent failure. Even after the 
maintenance, a CBTC failure may still occur. Focused on the Onboard CBTC device, a Reliability Centered 
Maintenance (RCM) method is adopted as an effort to discover the severity level of failure and what kind of 
maintenance should be given to the Onboard CBTC device. FMEA and FTA methods are also included in the 
RCM method to conduct the evaluation. The evaluation result indicates that Remote Input Output (RIO) is the 
most vulnerable equipment to experience failure, in severe conditions, it’s resulting in an emergency brake and 
threatening the safety of passengers. It also indicates that the frequently unclear reports from Mainline officers 
and different directions from the control center significantly impact poor handling, resulting in delayed traveling. 
In addition to the need for maintenance, this research aims to produce guidelines in form of a Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP) for dealing with Mainline failure during operating hours. It is expected that any different 
direction from the control center and engineer’s action can be eliminated in dealing with the Mainline failure.

Introduction
In recent years, many countries started to develop mass transportation to reduce road congestion. One of the 
common mass transportation used in urban cities is Urban Rail transport. The massiveness of Developing Urban 
Rail Transport also needs advanced technology to make it always in good operating condition. Train operation 
has something to do with the signaling system. Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a system that 
used radio Communication from onboard components to Wayside components. CBTC used radio communication 
to ensure train information in real-time (Dimitrova and Tomov 2020). The CBTC system aims to ensure a highly 
reliable seamless and Redundant connection between the Urban Rail Transit and the track (Dimitrova and Tomov 
2020). CBTC system also made by an interlocking system so, if one of the CBTC Component doesn’t run or gets 
failure it means the other component can’t run perfectly. So, it is necessary to always ensure the CBTC equipment 
is in a ready-to-operate condition but in mainline operations, there are still failures in the CBTC component 
subsystem. To handle failures that occur in the mainline, guidelines are needed in handling failures. guidelines 
are needed so that there is no disagreement between the machinist and the operation control center when carrying 
out the handling. using one of the train operators in Indonesia which is currently the only one that operates the 
CBTC signaling system in Indonesia, this research is intended so that when a failure occurs, the handling carried 
out is standardized.  
1.1. Objectives 
This study’s main objective is to know what kind of failure occurs on the CBTC On Board device. Then it can be 
given handling recommendations that can be obtained from specification documents or from expert opinions and 
experience in the Mainline. 
a. Expected Output
As a guideline in dealing with operating disorders, it is hoped that this study will produce several outputs
that are beneficial for the operation of facilities that run the CBTC system as the operating system. A

Conclusion and Discussion
CBTC is a signaling device consisting of OnBoard and wayside equipment connected using two-way 
communication radio signals. CBTC devices are designed with high standards in order to have good durability 
and can work optimally in accordance with standards. The high standards provided include the CBTC Onboard 
device, but in practice, it does not rule out the possibility that there will still be failures in the device. Failure itself 
can be fatal to operations, tight headways, distances between trains that are not far apart, high speed, failure to 
detect locations can result in collisions, double track lanes with heavy traffic, making a failure in the field must 
be handled immediately so that operations can still run well and smoothly. This study provides recommendations 
to prevent and reduce the possibility of failure on the mainline and treatment if failure is forced to occur. The 
proficiency of the control center officer in providing direction and the field officer in carrying out the direction is

critical to the successful implementation of the handling. All forms of CBTC OnBoard failures that occur in the 
field cannot be underestimated and must always receive more attention so as not to become a bigger problem in 
the future. The author also recommends more in-depth research and research updates considering that technology 
continues to develop and does not rule out the possibility that there will be faster, safer, effective,e and efficient 
ways to handle it so that wasted time can be reduced to the maximum level. And for further research, more in-
depth research is needed for components with the largest number of failures, whether the fault is in the treatment, 
or the device is not in accordance with the standard function that should be.

Abstract 
Jakarta, as center of government and economy, promises a better life, making it a magnet for residents outside Jakarta 
and driving the pace of urbanization. As a megacity that is home to more than 10 million people, Jakarta faces complex 
transportation problems such as congestion and low public transport usage. The activities of the people in Jakarta 
require reliable public transportation to support them. The Jakarta Provincial Government has provided various public 
transportation modes to support its citizens, such as bus and train services, to attract public transport users. However, 
this is considered insufficient as a solution to increase the number of public transport users. Therefore, the government 
has introduced a transit-based transportation development policy as a way to integrate transportation networks and 
services. As a new policy in transportation development, the government needs to evaluate the policy to determine its 
success in increasing the number of public transport users and other benefits obtained. This research aims to identify 
important factors, stakeholders, interest holders, objectives, and relationships using a systematic framework based on 
soft system methodology. This paper will explore the conceptual model of these relationships, which will help the 
government understand the interdependence of the system and design an appropriate strategy.

Abstract 
Transportation sector has been known as a contributor to the greenhouse gasses emissions and air pollution which 
caused environment and health problems. Indonesia as an oil net importer is also bothered by the fluctuation of oil 
price which is influenced by geopolitical situations around the world. Indonesia is in the top tenth of countries who 
contribute greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere and transportation itself accounts for 14.17% from the total (Crippa 
et al. 2021). As the busiest city in Indonesia, there are 3.5 million units in Jakarta province only (Indonesia State Police

The way to reduce greenhouse gasses such as electrification in the transportation sector has become important. Battery 
electric vehicles are one of the answers to reduce greenhouse gasses, but penetration in the market is not so 
encouraging. To seek the opportunities to boost penetration of battery electric vehicles, we need to know the priority 
ranking of factors in the purchase intention of Indonesian people. With the rank of priority on factors which showed 
from the level of the strength, could help stakeholders focus on the improvement of factors which have the highest 
level of influence.

Introduction
The problem of determining vehicle routes in logistics has meaning It is important for logistics companies to 
reduce transportation costs and late fees. This route determination problem is known as the Vehicle Routing 
Problem, abbreviated as VRP. VRP can be defined as a Goods distribution management that pays attention to 
service, for a certain period, a group of consumers with a number of vehicles conveniently located at one or 
more depots run by a group of motorists using the road network (road network) appropriately. VRP includes 
determining a number of routes, where each route is passed by one vehicle that starts and ends at the depot of 
origin, so that the demands of all customers are met while still meeting existing operational constraints and also 
minimizing global transportation costs. There are various types of VRP, one of which is VRPTWcan be defined 
as the problem of finding a cost-minimizing route for a number of homogeneous vehicles stationed at a depot, 
whose task is to deliver goods to a number of customers (Ursani et al. 2011). 
In this study, the VRPTW problem is found in CV. Harapan Indah which is one of the industries that produce 
ice for consumption which is in the city of Padang. The resulting product is in the form of ice crystals. The 
company currently delivers ice to 30 places across the city of Padang. The delivery process uses 5 Colt Diesel 
cars with a capacity of 250 bags of ice per car. Figure 1 represents the map of delivery locations.

Figure 3. Best Total Cost Results from VRPTW Using the ABC Algorithm 
It can be seen from the picture that the total cost is Rp. 65,335.- with a total cost penalty is IDR 45,378.- and a 
total fuel cost of IDR 19,957.-. 
b.
The VRPTW solution uses the Camel Algorithm
Solving VRPTW using CA is solving cases with real data obtained from companies through direct observation.
The data was processed using the help of MATLAB R2014a software with the camel algorithm. Data processing
is carried out on the amount of food 1000. and the results are as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Best Total Cost Result from VRPTW Using CA Algorithm 
It can be seen from the picture that the total cost is Rp. 35,865.- with a total penalty fee of IDR 20,734.- and a 
total fuel fee of IDR 15,132,-. 
6. Conclusion
After processing the data and analyzing the results, it can be concluded that the transportation route using the 
Camel Algorithm (CA) is more optimal. There are 5 routes formed from this algorithm with a total cost of 
Rpp.s. 35,865. - with a total penalty fee of IDR 20,734. - and a total fuel fee of IDR 15,132, -. This proposed 
route produces a better total transportation cost than the initial route. Where the existing initial route has a total 
cost of Rp. 312,205. In Research Metaheuristic Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows 
(VRPTW)this is a lot it's the number of trials too little so that there is less comparison that allows you to get a 
smaller total cost.

Abstract 
The growth of industries that use heavy equipment in Indonesia continues to increase so that the use of spare parts has 
also increased significantly. Most of these spare parts are still imported from outside so that the need for warehouse 
storage in Indonesia. Spare parts are included in the perishable goods commodity and are urgently needed to support 
the operations of a unit, however, currently many are still being managed not in accordance with the principles of 
good warehouse practice. The spare parts warehouse has many types of items, so there is a need for grouping to suit 
different levels of importance and usage, so it is necessary to align these priorities as a reference for further inventory 
management with the aim of mitigating shortages and dead stock inventory. This study only focuses on the type of 
fork-lift and for the flow of research it is carried out by grouping all items into three classes according to the abc 
analysis rules, then the three classes are continued with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis that is Analytic Hierarchy 
Process to get the priority ranking. After that, from the ranking results, the highest ranking is taken indicating the 
highest priority will be managed further with economic order quantity in the hope that inventory management for parts 
with the highest priority class can be managed better.

1. Introduction
The growth of industries that use heavy equipment such as the mining, construction, agriculture and other sectors has 
resulted in the development of heavy equipment sales in Indonesia. Basically, the trend of heavy equipment sales in 
Indonesia is closely related to the after sales of each brand to satisfy and attract customers, in this case spare parts are 
the main key in after sales of heavy equipment sales. Only a few spare parts for heavy equipment brands in Indonesia 
are produced domestically and most of them are imported from abroad. That way, the importer needs to provide a 
warehouse for storage of imported spare parts. Spare parts warehouse management must be managed properly to avoid 
technical and non-technical problems that can cause losses to the company. According to (Irene Roda et al) Warehouse 
spare parts with commodity goods that are easily damaged and urgently needed to support the operations of a unit, but 
currently many are still being managed not in accordance with the principles of good warehouse practice.  
From data (Figure 1) on the trend of heavy equipment sales in Indonesia from 2015 to September 2022, it can be seen 
that fluctuating conditions tend to increase every year. However, there has been a decline in the last 2 years, namely 
from 2019 to 2022, at which time there was an outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the world which 
required world life to be temporarily paralyzed for the industrial sector. 
Demand for spare parts is specific and different compared to other materials such as products or intermedia which are 
fast moving materials with regular requests, demand patterns for spare parts can be slow moving, irregular, intermittent 
or other demand patterns (Conceicao et al 2015). Warehouses with commodity spare parts have thousands of types of 
goods, it is necessary to group them in an integrated manner and these goods have different levels of importance and 
use, so that there is a need for priority alignment as a reference for further management of the inventory system.

6. Conclusion
This study analyzes the new methods to mitigate shortage and dead stock spare parts inventory using 3 methods that 
never been put together, so that will be the research gap of this study. we can understand that managing a spare parts 
warehouse needs good optimization for business continuity. This can be a benchmark for other companies, especially 
with commodity spare parts. however, there are still sections that can be improved, such as more data usage, choices 
on more criteria and alternatives in AHP.

Abstract 
Investment analysis needs to be conducted for determining whether investment projections are feasible to run. In order 
to reduce water loss, provide bills accurately, provide a quick solution for identifying pipe leaks, monitor water quality, 
read water usage in real time, and reduce potential errors in customer water meters, it is necessary for customers to 
replace their analog meters with smart meters. Therefore, this study aims to identify the important factors, actors, 
goals and the connection by using a systematic framework based on Soft System Methodology (SSM). This 
identification is used for decision making in the model field problem, with approaching of new technology and topics 
in Regional Drinking Water Companies (PDAMs).

1. Introduction
Water is a basic need and an important element used in every human life (Rahardjo 2008). This issues bring out the 
companies that provide and serve clean water. One of the clean water providers for regional areas in Indonesia is the 
Drinking Water Companies (PAM). The problems faced by Drinking Water Companies (PAM) in providing clean 
water services are the lack of water sources and water loss. The water loss reaches 33% and it is mainly caused by the 
damage of customer’s water meter (Hidayat 2011). 
In 2021, PT DEF has achieved a KPI (Key performance indicator) of Water Sales 154,120,000 m3 (Rp 
1,116,785,909,620) while the percentage of water loss is 48.76% (Rp 89,020,864,636). This percentage of water loss 
exceeds the average of national water loss that is 20% according to Minister of Public Works Regulation No 
20/PRT/M/2006. 
There are several solutions to increase Water Sales and reduce Non-Revenue Water (NRW), in a Physical and 
Commercial way. In 2021, Physical activities have a target of 6,185 m3 with an actual achievement of 6,925 m3. 
Physical activity is an activity of detecting physical water leaks. Besides physical activities, an active leak detecting 
is carried out by establishing a District Meter Area (DMA). DMA is a NRW management which is carried out by 
dividing networks in certain areas into smaller or more specific areas. 
Whereas for Commercial activities such as illegal connection and by pass has a target of 64,700 m3 with an 
achievement of 60,680 m3, Illegal Use activities has a target of 79,198 m3 with an achievement of 649,061 m3, Meter 
Anomaly Activities has a target of 250,420 m3 with an achievement of 147,305 m3, Meterization Activities has a 
target of 67,398 m3 an achievement of 94,506 m3 and for the achievement of Improve meter access activities of 
94,238 m3 and a target of 98,716 m3. 
Based on the achievement of Physical and Commercial activities, the Commercial has an impact towards the failure 
of water sales and NRW achievement. This is because commercial activities have a direct impact on the company. In 
commercial Gap activities, the biggest achievement was in Illegal Use (IU) activities of 12% and Meter Anomaly of 
59%. The activities such as Meter Anomaly, Meterization and Improving meter access had a largest portion of

4.3 Conceptual Model of System’s Problem 
The next stage in this research is to create a conceptual model to support SSM-based analysis of complex 
organizational situations which will be useful for showing how the expected model is used (Wilson 2001). The 
conceptual model is depicted in the following system diagram (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Conceptual Model 
The conceptual model shown in Figure 1 explains that the Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) as a problem 
owner has the main goal of making decision in investment plan of replacing analog meters to smart meters. In order 
to achieve this, there are several policy interventions such as non-revenue water and life time water meters. Moreover, 
Capital expenditure (Capex), Operating Expense (Opex), Water Sales, and Risk Identification are external factors or 
inputs that cannot be controlled. Therefore, the output generated by the system is Feasibility Indicator (NPV, IRR, 
and Payback Period), Financial Risk Impact estimation, and Recommendation and Mitigation. 
5. Conclusion
It is necessary to develop a financial model for the feasibility of investment planning to replace analog meters to smart 
meters. Where the financial model can be used as an investment decision making tool for Regional Drinking Water 
Company (PDAM). In addition, risk identification is used to determine all risks that affect the achievement of the 
investment. In further research, it is necessary to develop a financial model to obtain analysis and indicators of the 
feasibility of an investment plan by considering uncertain risk factors.

Abstract 
The power quality indices corresponding to voltage event are provided by IEC 61000-4-30 and IEEE 1564 standards. 
The popularization of machine learning techniques in modern and smarter power grids inherently characterized with 
randomized big data motivates their inclusion. We aimed to establish key voltage disturbance event features that a 
machine learning model can use to attain a high classification and prediction accuracy. The feature extraction was 
achieved using the singular value decomposition and wavelet transform of a three-phase system represented as a space 
phasor model with the corresponding ellipse parameters and the shape index feature extracted. The 6 by 500 dataset 
with the six (6) features (rms, event duration, 3rd harmonic, 5th harmonic, 7th harmonic, shape index) was used to 
classify voltage sag, swell, interruption, harmonics, and normal conditions. MATLAB R2021a classification learner 
application was used to create a supervised machine learning model by training twenty-nine (29) classifiers and 
comparing their performance using the accuracy (%), confusion matrix, total cost validation, prediction speed and 
training time. The results indicated that without the shape index, the voltage sag and voltage interruption events were 
misclassified in some scenarios for all the classifiers, with the highest accuracy obtainable of 99.6% by four (4) 
classifiers. The inclusion of shape index feature improved the trained models to 100% classification accuracy for 
fourteen (14) classifiers. The training, computing and processing is required to be of high performance and accuracy 
to increase the online situational awareness of network operators when such systems are implemented.

1. Introduction
The growing interest in power quality issues due to the continues developments in the power grid structure, i.e. its 
generation composites that now include prosumers, and high integration of renewables, transmission and distribution 
modes are now bidirectional and the utilization of power has loads that are linear and nonlinear with demand response 
capability. It is the fact that power quality monitoring demands a large storage of data for analysis to instigate 
appropriate actions depending on the operational mode. A commercially available classification system must, 
therefore, be reliable and show high accuracy. The trained model must be able to understand all possible system 
conditions. This is important because once implemented, the user has is not supposed to redo the training process. The 
training, computing and processing is required to be of high performance and accuracy to increase the online 
situational awareness of network operators when such systems are implemented. This paper presents the classification 
of the common power quality events related to voltage deviations such as voltage dip, swell, interruption, and 
harmonics. These are expected to be experienced in modern systems having high renewable energy integration with 
converters, electric vehicles and other non-linear loads. 
1.1 Objectives 

To determine the optimal sampling frequency using the relationship of the root mean square value in per unit
of the un-disturbed red phase at various sampling frequencies.

To generate synthetic training dataset from a power network analysis and modelling

To extract key features in the three phase voltage system that uniquely describes each voltage event i.e. the
equivalent voltage signature using the principal component analysis (PCA)

To establish existence of patterns among identified features

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
To have a model with 100% accuracy, the potential improvement was achieved by incorporating ellipse characteristic 
features and wavelet transform features in the training dataset. By including the shape index feature the voltage sag 
event and voltage interruption event which were initially in some instances misclassified became more distinct as can 
be seen in Figure 10.

The techniques that improved and had an accuracy (validation) of 100% were SVM (i.e. quadratic, cubic, fine 
Gaussian and medium Gaussian), KNN (i.e. fine, medium, cosine, cubic, weighted, and subspace ensemble) and 
Neural Networks (i.e. narrow, medium, wide, and bilayered). However, other techniques were unable to provide 100% 
classification accuracy, those included linear SVM (99.8%), decision trees (99.6% for fine, medium and coarse), 
subspace discriminant ensemble (99.6%), trilayered neural network (99.4%), coarse Gaussian SVM (99.2%), coarse 
KNN (89.8%), subspace discriminant ensemble (88%), Kernel Naïve Bayes (79%), Boosted trees ensemble and 
RUSBoosted trees ensemble (20%). There were three classifiers that failed to provide any predicted model, that is, 
the linear discriminant, quadratic discriminant and the Gaussian Naïve Bayes. 
 
5.4 Validation 
Only 80% of the dataset was used during the training process. The validation of the trained model was done using the 
remaining 20 %. Furthermore, a MATLAB Simulink model in Figure 11 was created to generate voltage swell and 
sag events testing datasets, it is a modified version to one proposed by (Tan and Ramachandaramurthy 2015).

6. Conclusion 
The research aims at establishing key voltage disturbance event features that a machine learning model can use to 
provide 100% classification accuracy (validation). The sampling frequency selection was achieved by minimizing the 
error in the root mean square value of the reconstructed waveform from its corresponding original waveform. The key

features extracted from the three-phase voltage waveform included the rms value, presence of 3rd, 5th and 7th 
harmonics, duration of disturbance, and shape index obtained from elliptical shape representation of space phasor 
model. The classification learner application was used to create a supervised machine learning model by training 
twenty-nine (29) classifiers and comparing their performance using the accuracy (%), confusion matrix, total cost 
validation, prediction speed and training time. The results indicated that without the shape index, the voltage sag and 
voltage interruption events were misclassified in some scenarios for all the classifiers, with the highest accuracy 
obtainable of 99.6% by four (4) classifiers. Some classifiers such as the Quadratic discriminant and Gaussian Naïve 
Bayes failed to be trained. The inclusion of shape index feature improved some of the trained models and it was 
observed that fourteen (14) classifiers were able to achieve 100% classification accuracy. However, the Quadratic 
discriminant, Gaussian Naïve Bayes and now including the linear discriminant classifiers failed to be trained. The 
training, computing, and processing is required to be of high performance and accuracy to increase the online 
situational awareness of network operators when such systems are implemented. 
The research provides additional insight into the process of power quality disturbance identification and 
characterization with emphasis on voltage events. It identifies that addition of shape indices for each event enables a 
machine learning model to have higher prediction accuracy. However, the model is limited to six features, which 
limits its application. 
Future research may include increasing the features, training dataset and validating the efficacy using data from real 
power stations, noise detection and filtering, as well as fault type characterization. Furthermore, detailed comparison 
of the classification technique is required to narrow down to an optimal technique. The feature extraction and 
representation might be modified to ensure that all classifiers learn something than failing completely.

Abstract 
The production operations of oil and gas in offshore areas require a fleet of ships to support their logistics activities. 
One of the commonly used types of fleets is the Crew Boat. The Crew Boat is used to support routine oil and gas 
offshore production operations with daily movement activities that are quite dense, thus requiring an evaluation of the 
Crew Boat movement routes. This research aims to obtain an optimal route for the movement of Crew Boats in 
supporting routine oil and gas offshore production operations with a case study conducted at an offshore installation 
in Indonesia. This research used a combination of genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization to obtain an optimal 
route. The results of this research found that the combination of genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization can 
provide optimal solutions for the traveling salesman problem with fewer iterations compared to solving it using genetic 
algorithms alone.

1. Introduction
The business activities in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry may include exploration and exploitation. 
Exploration is a part of the upstream oil and gas activities aimed at discovering new oil and gas reserves. Meanwhile, 
exploitation is a production operation aimed at extracting oil and gas from reservoirs, bringing them to the surface, 
and transporting them to oil and gas processing facilities. Oil and gas production operations can be carried out onshore 
or offshore. 
Offshore oil and gas production operations require a fleet of ships to support logistics activities. According to Coyle 
(1992), logistics activities aim to ensure product availability in the right quantity, condition, time, place, and cost for 
customers. Logistics activities in offshore oil and gas production operations include equipment and material supply 
operations required for production operations, well maintenance activities, and facility maintenance activities. In 
addition, a fleet of ships is also needed as a means of transporting personnel or materials from one facility to another. 
In one of the offshore areas in Indonesia, there is an upstream oil and gas business operator's working area. As an 
offshore field, the working area requires a fleet of ships to support daily production operations. Currently, daily 
operational activities in the working area are supported by one crew boat. The crew boat serves as a means of sea 
transportation to transport personnel between platforms. Currently, personnel transportation is carried out for 
production operator shift changes as well as security personnel changes between platforms. The crew boat is also used 
to support routine patrols of navigation aids and subsea pipeline facilities. 
Based on the explanation above, the daily movement activities of the crew boat are quite busy. However, to date, there 
has been no evaluation of the crew boat's movement route to obtain an optimal movement route. An optimal movement 
route can be obtained through the solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). According to Chen & Chien 
(2011), the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) can be solved using the parallelized genetic ant colony system

iteration. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization can 
provide a better optimal solution for the traveling salesman problem with a shorter number of iterations. 
6. Conclusion
The optimal route for the movement of crew boats to support routine offshore oil and gas production operations can 
be obtained using a combination of genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization. This research concludes that the 
combination of genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization can provide a better optimal solution for the traveling 
salesman problem with a shorter number of iterations than using genetic algorithm alone. The authors need to convey 
that this research only considers the route for the routine movement of one crew boat unit without considering external 
factors, such as weather conditions, waves, and sea currents.

Abstract 
The Methodist portal, myMU, is a platform used at MU that allows students, faculty, and parents to access different 
resources and information. The portal serves both undergraduate and graduate students, which also includes online 
students. Many of our peers have mentioned that the interface could be daunting for first-time users and lacks 
instructions on how to navigate each tab. Recently, there have been updates to the student portal and one of the goals 
they were able to achieve was downsizing the student portal from 18 to 8 tabs. However, the faculty portal has not 
been revised; we hope to help streamline it. This research aims to evaluate both the student and faculty portals to 
enhance user experience through user surveys/focus groups and by incorporating the International Standards 
Organization (ISO) standard ISO 9241, which addresses the accessibility of interactive systems to meet the needs of 
users.

Abstract 
Globally, SMEs play a vital role in a country’s economic growth through employment creation, contributing to GDP 
and fostering competition and innovation. However, these SMEs face a plethora of challenges which threaten their 
stability and continued existence. Worldwide, mortality rate of SMEs is high, with the situation in Zambia being no 
different. The case is worse among SMEs suppliers in the Zambian mining sector, whose sole dependency is on the 
mines. These SMEs risk failure to obtain regular business contracts due to competitive pressures with international 
suppliers, possible mine closures, low mining activities and unstable international market prices. Scholars suggest 
that SMEs can improve their relative competitiveness and sales performance by enhancing their visibility and 
building customer relations through adoption of social media platforms such as Facebook. Surprisingly, there has 
been inconclusive findings, some reveal a positive relationship, others a negative one while others suggest a zero 
relationship between social media (Facebook) adoption, relative competitiveness and sales performance. In light of 
the mixed findings, this study seeks to examine this in the context of SME suppliers in the Zambian Mining sector 
where research on the subject is non-existent. Mixed method approach of data collection will be employed. Findings 
of this study will help decision making among SME managers and policy makers.

Abstract 
Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a type of transfer learning where a large, pre-trained model (Teacher Model) transfers 
knowledge to a smaller, simpler model (Student Model) to make the latter more efficiently trainable. Knowledge 
distillation (KD) can effectively transfer the knowledge of a teacher model to a student model in image classification 
tasks. However, the results of KD can vary depending on the specific method and approach used, thus a standardized 
improvement method is necessary. Data Augmentation techniques are powerful performance improvement methods 
for image classification. In this paper, we propose a standardized approach to improving knowledge distillation using 
various Data Augmentation techniques based on the α value. The results showed that Data Augmentation techniques 
provided a significant performance improvement in the Knowledge Distillation model. We demonstrated that as the 
strength of data augmentation increases, the performance of knowledge distillation (KD) also increases proportionally. 
And It seems that the α value does not have a significant impact on the performance improvement of knowledge 
distillation (KD).

1. Introduction
In deep learning, transfer learning refers to the process of transferring the knowledge learned by one model to another 
model that has not been trained. This is typically achieved through a concept called knowledge distillation (KD), 
which is designed to transfer the knowledge learned by a large, pre-trained model (teacher model) to a smaller model 
(student model) to improve the efficiency of the student model learning. 
Currently, deep learning models are becoming deeper and wider, with more parameters and computational 
requirements, and as a result, the performance of these models continues to improve. Knowledge distillation aims to 
enable smaller networks to achieve similar performance to larger networks, as shown in Figure 1, by transferring the 
knowledge learned by a pre-trained teacher model to the student model. Many papers have demonstrated that using 
knowledge distillation during the learning process can improve performance and stability (Ridnik et al. 2022)(Gou et 
al. 2021)(Cho et al. 2019). In addition, there have been several attempts to improve the performance of Knowledge 
Distillation (KD) by applying data augmentation separately to KD, as demonstrated by (Fu et al. 2020) and (Wang et 
al. 2019), and by enhancing the Teacher model used in KD, as shown in various attempts such as (Mirzadeh et al. 
2020) and (Beyer et al. 2022). Other methods have improved Knowledge Distillation (KD) by varying the ways in 
which knowledge is distilled such as response-based distillation (Hinton et al. 2015)(Feng et al. 2021), feature-based 
distillation (Park et al. 2019)(Heo et al. 2019) and relation-based distillation (Romero et al. 2014). 
Especially in (Yim et al. 2017). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of KD in improving the speed and accuracy 
of model optimization, reducing the size of deep neural networks, and facilitating transfer learning between different 
tasks and domains. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of KD on various benchmark datasets and tasks, including 
image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. They demonstrate that KD can significantly 
improve the performance of deep learning models while reducing their computational complexity and memory 
requirements.  
However, these various methods are merely ways to expect effective optimization performance for KD in different 
environments, and cannot be considered standardized improvement methods in an integrated environment.

The experimental results confirmed that applying data augmentation to models learned through KD resulted in an 
average accuracy increase of more than 14% compared to models without augmentation as shown in Figure 3. We 
also found that the α parameter, which adjusts the intensity of the distillation loss, did not have a significant effect on 
accuracy improvement when using data augmentation. However, an interesting phenomenon was observed where 
performance improvement was relatively lower when α was set to 1.0, when learning using 𝐿௄஽ without using 𝐿஼ா 
(Table 1). 
Through our experiments, we found that data augmentation can significantly improve the performance of knowledge 
distillation (KD) for image classification problems. As we applied more powerful data augmentation methods, we 
observed a consistent improvement in KD performance. These results suggest that further research into more advanced 
data augmentation techniques may lead to even better performance in KD. However, the α parameter does not 
significantly affect accuracy improvement when using data augmentation.

3 Conclusion 
This paper conducted experiments on applying Data Augmentation to Knowledge Distillation (KD), a method for 
effectively training the Student Model, a relatively small architecture in the Image Classification field, and found that 
it significantly improved the model's performance.  
We also tested the effect of different values of α on the performance of Data Augmentation. The results showed that 
the performance improvement of models trained with KD and Data Augmentation was substantial, and the impact of 
α value was minimal. Additionally, an interesting finding was observed that when the α value is 1.0, the performance 
improvement of Data Augmentation is relatively reduced compared to other α values.

Abstract 
In general, it is difficult to recognize EMG patterns for controlling prosthetic arms because they are not fixed and vary 
greatly in characteristics. In this paper, we evaluate the classification ability of root mean square, integral, and power 
spectral densities to identify various hand motions including wrist flexion, extension, wrist adduction, abduction, 
grasping, and abduction. To perform this study, EMG signals are measured in the finger extensors, carpal tunnel 
extensors, carpal tunnel flexors, and carpal tunnel flexors. EMG signals are analyzed for root mean square, integral 
and power spectral density. Through experiments, it was shown that the proposed method can estimate hand 
movements efficiently. 
Keywords 
EMG signals, EMG patterns, finger extensors, hand motions and prosthetic arms. 
1. Introduction
1.1. Research Purpose
In this paper, various control methods were used to solve the user's inconvenience and various control methods caused
by using an acupressure point switching device as a control signal in previous studies on mechatronic prosthetic arms
with a light and foldable structure. By analyzing and improving the patterns of EMG signals, it can use signals from
the body's muscles known as one of the most effective control methods. Develop a mechatronic prosthetic hand with
a foldable structure that can replace the arm function of a brachial amputation patient, and study a more convenient
EMG control method suitable for multi-degree-of-freedom multi-lateral control. I want to show a functional prosthetic
hand, but I have a purpose.
Therefore, the first research direction focused on the design and construction of an analysis system for EMG 
acquisition for prosthetic hand control, and the second research direction aimed at a classification method of EMG 
signals to distinguish each motion from a practical point of view. 
1.2. Automated Prosthetic Research 
After World War II, much research was conducted to develop prosthetic arms for many people with disabilities due 
to the war. In 1961, Wiener (1961) proposed the possibility of using biosignals to control mechanical devices, and 
Reiter (1948) proposed EMG signals or EMG signals, which are minute voltage signals generated during muscle 
contraction. Since hand control was developed, continuous development attempts have been made by a small number 
of research groups or schools. 
A brief look at the situation in which artificial automatic prostheses operated by an external power source have been 
studied is as follows. Since 1950 IBM Arm of Alderson (1968), Russian EMG Control Hand of Popov (1965),

3. Conclusion
In this study, a folding mechanism developed for the wrist amputee who needs a prosthetic hand was studied to operate 
according to the classification of EMG signals to use as an effective method for controlling the prosthetic hand. The 
system for EMG analysis used in this study enabled monitoring by accepting EMG signals from four muscles. EMG 
signals were measured in each channel during 6 types of motion. By measuring signals from four muscles for each 
motion and classifying the signals, it could be used as an effective signal for controlling the prosthetic hand. It was 
confirmed that it is possible to implement the control method.

Abstract 
In this paper, we present an EMG signal analysis and classification technique for hand gesture recognition specialized 
for autonomous vehicle environments. In addition, we propose a new user interface method that considers the bio 
signals received from wearable devices and the characteristics of self-driving cars. EMG is an electrical property 
produced to command the contraction and relaxation of muscle tissue. The medical surface EMG sensor mounted on 
the MYO armband used in the experiment transmits EMG signals and sensor information wirelessly from the arm to 
the terminal via Bluetooth. The EMG-based interaction system proposed in this paper processes the collected EMG 
signals to classify hand gestures and interacts with the autonomous driving system. Gestures for control transfer are 
classified in a double threshold method through EMG signal analysis and used as a more efficient interface by applying 
a separate low pass filter. This EMG-vehicle interaction system was developed to enable control of an autonomous 
vehicle through a system capable of controlling an autonomous vehicle. In addition, we introduce constraints and 
methods using vehicle state information to reduce gesture recognition errors that may occur in situations unintended 
by the driver.

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the Study
With the recent increase in self-driving cars, human error, which is the biggest cause of traffic accidents, can be greatly
reduced, reducing the accident rate. On the other hand, drivers who will use self-driving cars expect to have a new
experience in the vehicle space as the operation for driving is greatly reduced.
The development of high-speed mobile communication can be fully utilized as V2X communication, and a car 
connected to a computer network can provide more infotainment technology to drivers and passengers. Connected 
Car, which provides various information services by receiving various accident information, road conditions and 
parking space information through the Internet, is a technology with high utilization as a road safety and driving 
assistance device. The spread and development of such wireless mobile high-speed communication can greatly change 
the existing infotainment system that occupants can experience in a vehicle. 
According to the classification and definition of autonomous driving systems by the Society of Automotive Engineers 
(SAE), an association of automotive engineers, autonomous vehicle technology can be divided into five levels. 
Currently, vehicles that consumers can purchase are driving assistance systems corresponding to the second level of 
the autonomous driving system. Level 3 of the autonomous driving system defines that autonomous driving is possible 
under the condition that the system responds when the driver is asked to drive. Therefore, the driver and the 
autonomous driving system must cooperate to drive, and in this situation, the transfer of the driving control right 
between the driver and the autonomous driving system inevitably occurs. However, the interface between the vehicle

4. Conclusion
In this paper, a method for an intuitive user interface for safe and efficient driving mode conversion in an autonomous 
driving environment is presented. Recently, in order to find a specific button typical of the autonomous driving mode 
switching method, a new switching method was implemented and tested using an EMG-based wearable device as a 
method to reduce the risk of gaze dispersion that occurs while driving. Through experiments, it was confirmed that 
the operation using gestures, which is the method presented in this paper, relatively reduces driver's distraction 
compared to the existing button operation method, and enables switching of driving modes while stably maintaining 
vehicle steering. In particular, the proper setting of the number of sampling of EMG sensor values for recognizing 
gestures and the low-pass filter that rectifies them prevented most unintended commands, preventing the recognition 
rate from deteriorating due to errors. In addition, additional vehicle information was used to limit the control transfer 
conditions, and it was confirmed that this allows the driver to more safely switch the vehicle from manual driving 
mode to autonomous driving mode. In addition, by determining the amount of force given to the driver's arm and the 
position of the arm through the EMG, it is possible to determine whether the driver's current condition is a state in 
which he can manually drive a vehicle or not. This can be used to safely move the vehicle to the shoulder of the road 
or other safe areas in preparation for a situation in which the driver cannot accept the system's mode change request 
when the system requests a transition to the manual driving mode. 
In this paper, a new type of user interface is provided, and as a comparison target, the button operation, which is a 
general mode switching method, was selected as a standard in consideration of one of the vehicle peripheral devices 
or the installed infotainment environment among the autonomous driving mode switching methods, and the 
experiment was conducted. . In order to secure more reliability of the proposed gesture-based method, it is necessary 
to compare the lack of information sharing that is not provided by car companies and to compare with more various 
wearable devices or buttons and interfaces mounted on vehicles and vehicle models. In addition, it is judged that more 
quantitative and qualitative evaluations that individual drivers can experience and feel are additionally needed in the 
future through more diverse driving environments and many experimental groups. Based on this, future research will 
attempt EMG analysis through Recurrent Neural Network, which will show good performance in analyzing time-
sequential data as it is likely to be a method that can more closely judge the recognition rate and situation. This is 
expected to be able to implement more abstract and complex gestures, and it is judged that higher flexibility for the 
proposed gesture method can be secured by applying it to an autonomous driving system.

Abstract  
Many wholesale companies do not use an adequate control of their inventory level, and variables such as product 
demand tend to vary continuously due to seasonality and market trends, generating costs that reduce profitability and 
eventually produce customer dissatisfaction with the service offered. In this paper we propose the application of a 
method to reduce the level of uncertainty and risk in sales and to simulate the implementation of a policy of continuous 
inventory review. Using the monthly demand of the wholesale company and considering the maximization of profit, 
the ARIMA time series model was chosen, developed through the R programming language, and then modeled in the 
Arena software the results of the forecast found. The relevance of the study is to present inventory improvement tools 
that encourage a favorable management in terms of inventory management costs.

Forecasting, Inventory, Simulation-Based Optimization, Arena And Time Series. 
1. Introduction
Alim and Beullens (2021), Alharkanet al. (2020) and Perez et al.(2021), argue that inventory is a key element in the 
supply chain, as it seeks to facilitate the balance between supply and demand to maximize profitability and maintain 
the competitiveness of companies. In wholesale companies where sales are frequent and of large quantity, bullwhip 
inventory effect affects operational planning (Tao et al. 2019). 
In the same line, Salas-Navarro et al.( 2017) states that today many of them present problems to manage their 
inventories negatively impacting how the customer is attended, their competitiveness in the market and financial 
performance. Kourentzes et al. (2020) states that this is because the demand forecasting process is unknown to firms. 
For this reason, it is important to develop a forecast for the generation of demand approximations; as mentioned by 
Morcillo  et al. (2021), it allows a better evaluation of costs and profitability. Additionally, Benhamida et al. (2021) 
states that it helps to reduce the uncertainty between demand and inventory.  
The time series is a set of observations correctly ordered in time presenting the crucial dependence between them, 
where the longer the series, the greater the probability of a mathematical model fit (Bandura et al. 2021). 
In this article the Croston, Arima and Exponential Smoothing time series forecasting models will be used to obtain a 
forecast on a monthly basis, and then simulate in the Arena program the inventory behavior that allows to obtain 
variables such as the economic lot, reorder point, among others. 
In reference to the above, the following question arises: Is it possible to gain benefits on supply planning management 
of a wholesale company through the use of forecasting and simulation tools?

The table above shows the profits of 12 products, where an increase in the scenario of profit improvement of 156 211 
soles (peruvian money currency) is evidenced, representing an increase of 47.06% on average with respect to the 
current scenario.  
Finally, to corroborate the statements presented, a statistical analysis was performed comparing the results of both 
scenarios in Minitab. We present paired t-test with 95% confidence interval, where the null hypothesis (Ho) states that 
there is no difference between the profits of both scenarios (Table 5).

6. Conclusion
From the results in the previous section, it is concluded that it is feasible to optimize the inventory management process 
by implementing a forecast based on the ARIMA technique, since products tend to be mostly stationary.  
Short-term forecasting approach accompanied by an inventory policy significantly reduces the level of imbalance 
between demand and inventory thanks to the tools of the review model such as the reorder point, the economic lot 
quantity, and the replenishment period. However, this must be complemented with the implementation of the 
simulation software, in this case the ARENA program. 
In summary, this research used simulation modeling and optimization to determine the inventory policy parameters 
for different products.  
Finally, as for the practical implications of this study, the proposed improvement tools were used to encourage efficient 
inventory practices for companies focused on wholesale.

Gold is a precious metal commodity used in many industries. Developing research institutions assess gold as a safe 
haven for investors during severe market pressure. In Indonesia, there are 15 gold producers, with one of the largest 
being PT Antam, Tbk. (""ANTAM""). The Precious Metal Processing and Refining Business Unit is part of ANTAM's 
operations and is responsible for gold processing and refining facilities. To respond to the growing demand for 
precious metal products, the Precious Metal Factory is expected to optimize its production capacity and product 
quality. Currently, the lack of recording and standardization, as well as the absence of digitization in the production 
process, results in significant loss and high cycle time. The aim of this study is to conduct a process reengineering 
analysis to reduce cycle time and increase production in the production of Antam's Precious Metal. This involves 
identifying waste in the production process using Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and optimizing the layout and 
facilities to meet the production capacity of Antam's Precious Metal

1. Introduction
Gold is a precious commodity used in many industries. Building up gold reserves, for example, is fundamental to 
establishing central bank monetary policy. Significant changes in gold prices affect economic growth (Bildirici and 
Gokmenoglu, 2020). Many investors include commodity investments in their portfolios, emphasizing that additional 
effects come from the relationship among commodity markets. In fact, it can lead to risk shocks on one commodity 
market spreading to other commodity markets and causing financial losses (Walid Mensi et al. 2021). 
Gold has a long and unique history as a financial asset over the past 6,000 years. Growing research assesses gold as a 
safe haven for investors in times of severe market stress. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the price of gold has risen 
from $252 in July 1999 to $1,600 per ounce in 2012, and many Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been established 
to facilitate small investors in buying gold (Zhen He et al. 2018). For decades, investment and trading in precious 
metal gold have attracted the attention of traders, portfolio managers, and investors. Hedging, diversification, and 
safe-haven properties of precious metals, especially gold, have offered significant motivation as one of the alternative 
investment instruments (Baur and Lucey 2010). 
Fluctuations in COVID-19 cases result in uncertainty effects that are subsequently transferred to the monetary market 
(Baek and Lee, 2021). After COVID-19, financial market volatility has significantly increased, resulting in huge losses 
for market participants. In contrast, commodity prices are highly fluctuating with the decline in crude oil prices due 
to reduced demand. However, gold prices reached an all-time high with expectations of economic recovery. As a 
result, during the pandemic, financial markets became more volatile (Su Yuandong et al. 2022). 
The initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US instantly had adverse effects on US Treasuries, international 
markets, and prompted investors to invest in precious metal gold (Semeyutin and Downing 2022). Retail investors' 
attention currently focuses on the current gold price trend and projects its future (Piccoli Pedro et al 2021). 
Based on USGS Table 1 data, the total world gold reserves are estimated to be 54,000 tons of gold. Countries with the 
largest gold reserves include Australia, South Africa, and Russia. Indonesia has gold reserves of 2,500 tons. Gold

6. Conclusion
Through the use of BPR (Business Process Reengineering) and VSM (Value Stream Mapping) tools, we can 
understand the existing process in the gold manufacturing industry and improve it. By creating current state mapping 
and future state mapping, we can increase the production of precious metal gold. This can serve as a benchmark for 
other companies in the precious metal gold industry. However, there are still areas that need improvement, such as 
automation in every process. This is because many other industries are already implementing Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
Customer needs for automotive products are still increasing, this has forced the automotive assembly industry to 
focus more on productivity and make measurement adjustments and improvements to produce products that meet 
customer demands and improve performance. As one of the largest automotiveare unprepareds in Indonesia, PT 
Astra Honda Motor faces complex problems related to increasing customer demand which is not in accordance with 
the plan, reducing component availability and disrupting the production process, while also causing greater 
performance losses, including operators who unprepared, erratic machine cycles can even be slower because they 
have to work not according to machine capacity, it can even cause start-up defects in machines used for production 
processes. All that of course resulted in quality problems becoming more frequent. The overall productivity of the 
integrated manufacturing system through the overall effectiveness of the equipment regardless of capabilities, and 
flexibility is considered insufficient as a solution to drive improvements and improve performance. Therefore, PT 
Astra Honda Motor must pay attention to equipment flexibility and overall equipment effectiveness (OEEFlex) to 
address customer requests. This study aims to identify losses related to the effectiveness of the equipment as a whole 
and the possibility of repairs carried out by implementing equipment flexibility that can drive the repair process, this 
is done by looking at the planning, losses, and availability of parts by eliminating unplanned events by finding the 
causes and take precautions. This study provides a contextual model of overall equipment effectiveness and 
equipment flexibility that will help automotive assembly companies meet customer demands through customization.

1. Introduction
The production process in a manufacturing company is a routine that is always carried out, so it is often assumed 
that the production process is running properly and correctly, however, it does not rule out the possibility of 
problems occurring in the production process. This of course can affect productivity. For this reason, companies 
must examine more deeply regarding efficiency in the production process as an effort so that the company's 
productivity does not decrease. Efforts that can be made by companies to increase their productivity include 
humans, machines, and materials. In addition, the company must also optimize the company's resources used and 
become a benchmark for the company's success in meeting the production targets set by the company. 
PT Astra Honda Motor is a multinational company engaged in the motorcycle assembly industry, which is one of the 
most well-known motorcycle manufacturers in Indonesia. The products produced by PT AHM are processed at five 
plants, namely the Sunter Plant, the Pegangsaan Plant, the Cikarang Plant, the Karawang Plant and the Kerawang 
Plant. The products produced by PT AHM are distributed to areas in Indonesia and exported to foreign countries. 
The products produced by Plant Sunter are Honda PCX and ADV type motorcycles. Meanwhile, the Pegangsaan 
plant produces all-sport motorcycles. The Cikarang plant produces all-matic type motorcycles. The Karawang Plant 
produces Beat and Vario type motorcycles, and the Karawang Plant produces all-sport type motorcycles. The 
products produced from all the plants are then distributed to regions in Indonesia and exported to foreign countries. 
When researchers made initial observations, problems were identified in the production section, where there was a 
problem with the company's inability to produce products to reach the machine capacity according to the set

After carrying out a root causes of failures analysis and carrying out corrective actions according to the solutions to 
the problems described above on the three HPDC 800 machines, the final OEE data downtime is obtained as shown 
in Table 4 below: 
Table 4.  OEE Final Calculation Data Downtime 
5. Conclusion
OEE is a useful tool for increasing the implementation of the total productive maintenance (TPM) program which is 
carried out quantitatively, so as to create overall equipment effectiveness and minimize downtime on the HPDC 800 
machine. Meanwhile, the flexibility of OEE (OEEFlex) can be continuously increased if there is involvement from 
management in carrying out equipment (machine) repairs, because with the involvement of repair management 
carried out on the HPDC process line it can be controlled properly and produce maximum results. 
FMEA is a method used to find the root causes of failures that occur in HPDC machines and prevent recurring 
failures on these machines. The OEE value can be increased if FMEA is carried out, as seen from the increase in 
production from 2,400 CCL to 3,600 CCL produced or an increase of 38.73% to 61.22% of CCL production. In 
addition, the FMEA has reduced the downtime of the three HPDC machines as a whole, from 28,152 mins to 17,170 
mins.

Abstract  
Irritable bowel disease is typically situated towards the end of the human gastrointestinal tract thus, challenging and 
restricting the efficacy of traditional drugs. Nanotechnology, regarded as a game-changer in the modern 
pharmaceutical world has shown the advancement of drug performance in extraordinary ways up to laboratory scale. 
Failure of standardized protocols, potential toxicity, inability to up-scale practice, among others have been mooted to 
prevent the advancement of novel drug development using nanotechnology to commercialization. This study was 
Qualitative. Data was collected using an Integrative Review of 144 articles. Specific quality control was adopted to 
ensure that Validity (saturation) and Reliability (trustworthiness and repeatability) was established. This paper 
culminated in a series of schematic frameworks of fundamental key strategies to advance the development of nano-
enabled drugs, responsibly, demonstrating mitigation strategies for hazard characterization, risk evaluation, risk 
reduction and quality control along the lifecycle of product development for nano-enabled drugs.

1. Positioning nanotechnology in drug development
In this highly competitive and technology driven world, the medical and pharmaceutical fraternity is constantly 
searching for smarter technologies and novel and innovative ways of developing, manufacturing and managing drug 
development towards clinical trials and commercialization (Safari et al. 2014).  
Nanotechnology, viewed as a disruptive technology in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution(4IR) has been 
regarded as the solution and game-changer to produce cutting-edge drugs with smarter solutions and predictable 
performance that have minimal side-effects, are cost-effective and environmentally friendly (Seifirad et al. 2016; 
Sardo et al. 2019; Ahadian et al. 2020 & Kazemzadeh et al. 2022). Nanotechnology refers to materials with at least 
one dimension in nanometers (1-100nm) and displays extraordinary features, from their counterparts, that are 
attributed to their small size, large surface area, reactive surface structure, versatile chemical composition, unique 
solubility and variable shape (Hartwig 2021; Zhang 2020; Kazemzadeh 2022). These nano-derived components in 
drug delivery, present an improved rate of dissolution and adsorption in the human body and are used in the form of 
polymers, dendrimers, liposomes, micelles, solid-lipid nanoparticles (NPs), hydrogels, metallic NPs, semiconductors, 
carbon nanotubes and nanocrystals (Zhang et al. 2020). Nanoparticles are favoured in the pharmaceutical industry 
because they can control and regulate the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs (Zhang et al. 
2020) relative to the extracellular matrix, inflammation, tissues and therapeutic action (Yang et al. 2011) better than 
systems using the same materials as macromolecules, and deliver them to different parts of the body for a sustained 
period (Hartwig et al. 2021).  
The nano- particles are useful because they can accumulate at the inflamed tissue thus delivering the drug directly to 
the active site of the disease via muco-adhesion, muco-penetration, passive targeting of inflamed tissue and capturing 
of immune cells over a prolonged period while minimizing the systemic effects as is experienced with traditional 
drugs (Ovadje et al. 2015; Chaudhari et al. 2020, Jain & Parkhe 2020, Zhang et al. 2020 & Hadji & Bouchemel 2022). 
Another promising feature favouring nanoparticles is their ability to protect drugs that are usually prone to degradation

Abstract 
Lightning is essentially an electromagnetic field phenomenon that can fundamentally be characterized using scientific 
methods. It would interest property designers and managers to have a facility of protection against lightning for 
property and life and one stage to effect the protection is an ability to predict the occurrence of lightning. In one type 
of approach, lightning alert regions can be configured around important assets such as buildings in different locations. 
Notifications about alerts in an area of interest can be sent via emails, SMS texts to phones and user interface (UI) 
platforms on personal computers. The meteorology industry can leverage real-time lightning information to improve 
forecasting, monitoring and safety of communities. This paper uses big data from 2016 to 2022 to show how much 
lightning Zambia experienced in the seven-year span. Big data was used to detect patterns and trends around the 
country. Big data is one common and contemporary factor that informs policy and decision in business sectors. The 
paper also shows how an alert region, Lusaka city, can be configured in order to send alerts and warnings to the users 
within the city about lightning threat developments. By employing AI-based analytics the results show that Zambia 
experienced a total of 89,826,330 lightning events from 2016 to 2022. By centering Lusaka city at coordinates 15.3875 
oS and 28.3228 oE, 168 alerts were monitored using Thunderstorm Manager between 25 January 2023 and 24 February 
2023. The longest lightning threat duration observed was 11 hours 20 minutes within Lusaka city.

1. Introduction
The rainstorms that strike the African continent from October to April in the Southern hemisphere and April to October 
in the Northern hemisphere wreak havoc on life and property around the continent. Scientists and advocates of 
lightning protection have provided some information over the years that can help in the protection against this natural 
phenomenon. Such information is readily available in international standards such as IEC 62305 series, DHEN 
Lightning protection guide and NFPA 780 (Mpanga et al. 2021, 2022a, 2022b and 2022c). The impact of lightning 
occurrence is that it fixes the nitrates into the soil, it is the cause of the electrical rhythm of the earth and it can help 
explain the climate change patterns (EIT 2009, Williams 2009 and Williams et al. 2014). Thus, despite its 
manifestation in spectacular fashion such as damaging physical installations and presenting danger to life, lightning 
is essentially an electromagnetic phenomenon that can fundamentally be characterized using scientific methods. It 
would interest property designers and managers to have a facility of protection against lightning for property and life 
and one stage to effect the protection is an ability to predict the occurrence of lightning. In one type of approach, 
lightning alert regions can be configured around important assets and locations. Notifications about lightning threat 
development (LTD) in an area of interest can be sent via emails, SMS texts to phones and user interface (UI) platforms 
on personal computers.  
Articulation of the spread of the electromagnetic fields due to lightning and taking steps to protect buildings and 
electrical and electronic systems can enhance safety of communities. This is now more significant because 
governments around Africa, Zambia included, are determined to install early warning systems for their citizens. A 
lightning detection and warning system (LDWS) can be one of such systems since lightning is one natural phenomenon 
not adequately addressed in Africa (Mpanga et al. 2021). It is not covered in national documents such as public health 
act and occupational health and safety (OHS) act (Gomes et al. 2016b). An LDWS would involve articulating the 
lightning occurrence statistics for a country like Zambia in order to advance the reasons for the need for a detection

48 km from the center, 70 occurred between 8 km and 24 km from the town center, and 22 occurred within a radius 
of 8 km. These statistics help to see which infrastructure in which area are more exposed to lightning strikes. 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Lightning is a probabilistic event and thus there are places where it might not strike for several years. It might take 
even decades to prove the efficiency of the detection and warning systems. This implies that even the results presented 
in this paper require continued observations and analysis for the foreseeable future in order to arrive at more reliable 
figures. A period of at least ten years of data accumulation and analysis is proposed henceforth. 
5.4 Validation  
Figures 12 and 13 are validations of the result in Figure 9 about the LSPZs in Lusaka. Observations done between 25 
January and 24 February 2023 revealed that Lusaka south and south-east are the more prone areas to lightning strikes. 
Lightning threats were seen to develop in the south-east region of Lusaka as shown in Figure 12 and sometimes from 
the western side as shown in Figure 13 and move towards the southern side of town as indicated.

6. Conclusion
The objectives of this paper were to determine lightning statistics and characteristics for the seven-year period from 
2016 to 2022, determine the lightning strike potential zones (LSPZs) in the capital city, and to configure a lightning 
detection and warning system (LDWS) for Lusaka. It was determined that Zambia as a whole experiences on average 
4,600,000 lightning strikes per year and this translates to a lightning flash density of 7 flashes/km2/year on average. 
The determined LSPZs in Lusaka were found to be more in Chawama, Kabwata and Lusaka Central constituencies 
than in the other four constituencies. The monitoring of the lightning threat developments (LTDs) within the capital 
from 25 January to 24 February 2023 showed that 13% of lightning flashes were experienced within a radius of 8 km 
from the town center, 42% occurred within 8-24 km radius, and 45% within the 24-48 km radius. The longest duration 
of LTD recorded was 11 hours 20 minutes on 8-9 February 2023. Further studies are needed to establish why the 
central business district experience fewer lightning events despite having the tallest buildings in the country.

Abstract 
Foundries using organic binders like alkaline phenolic show interest in the use of inorganic binders like sodium silicate in 
core making and mould process. The cost of dumping waste sand from alkaline phenolic plants are more as they contain 
more toxic gases as compared to those of inorganic sodium silicate plants. Foundries are looking into saving cost by 
possibly using their already existing reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant in new plants using sodium silicate. This 
research initiated to assist an alkaline phenolic foundry decision to use their already available reclaim sand in the new 
sodium silicate plant planned to build. A process for preparing foundry cores or moulds, sands and chemical resins used 
made available. The chemical binders consisted of inorganic binder of Alkaline phenolic and an organic binder of sodium 
silicates with their catalysts. Sand materials consisted of new silica sand and reclaimed sand from foundry alkaline phenolic 
moulding plant. Core prepared by mixing sand with each binder and allowing them to cure at room temperature. Alkaline 
phenolic at a 1, 5% binder addition to sand and 20% to binder of catalyst addition. For Sodium silicate testing completed 
at 3% binder addition to sand and 10% to binder of catalyst. The curing time of 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours. The results 
showed that alkaline phenolic developed higher bending strength with new silica sand with strength of up to 32 N/cm2 than 
with reclaimed and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand mixture which only reach the bending strength of 15 N/cm2. Alkaline 
phenolic developed higher Tensile strength of 25 N/cm2 with reclaimed sand and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand with 20 
N/cm2 than with new sand reaching only five N/cm2. In conclusion, new sand can develop strength with both alkaline 
phenolic and sodium silicate binders. It is difficult to develop strength with sodium silicate binder when using reclaimed 
sand. Based on this research it not recommended the use of Reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant on the new sodium 
silicate plant.

1.0 Introduction 
In foundry production system, the more we can reuse the sand the more cost effective is the process. Sand reclamation is 
very important as it reduces cost of production in the foundry, as new sand is expensive. Recycling foundry as much as 
possible also reduce the cost of dumping waste sand.  This research focus on of effect of sand condition on bending strength 
and Tensile strength behaviour on self-setting sodium silicate sand binder system and alkaline phenolic sand binder system 
at different curing times. This research will assist the foundry to determine cost effectiveness of using their already available 
reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant when starting new sodium silicate plant. Alkaline phenolic ester cured 
(organic) and sodium silicate (inorganic) system are the two chemical bonded sand systems focussed on this research  
1.2 Objectives 
To mix sand with alkaline phenolic and soidium silicate resin 
To produce cores for bend strength testing and tensile strength testing using the mixed sand 
To allow the cores to cure for different times

5.0 Conclusions 
New silica sand can develop bending strength with both alkaline phenolic and sodium silicate binders. Higher bending 
strength reached with sodium silicates than alkaline phenolic when using new silica sand. Alkaline phenolic binder can 
develop strength with reclaimed sand and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand. It is difficult for sodium silicate to develop bending 
strength with reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant. Sodium silicate can develop higher tensile strength with new 
sand than alkaline phenolic. Alkaline phenolic can develop tensile strength with reclaimed sand and 20:80 new to reclaimed 
sand whereas sodium silicate struggle to develop strength with reclaimed sand. It is not advisable to use reclaimed sand 
from alkaline phenolic plant in the sodium silicate plant. For future, more test with different new sand to reclaimed sand 
ratios should be tested to see how to reduce the use of new sand. The sodium silicate samples can be cured using CO2 gas 
or using heat in the furnace to improve curing time.

Abstract 
Accessibility to social and economic amenities and the provision of a crucial link between production and consumption 
make transportation infrastructure one of the most crucial factors for a nation's development. This is especially true 
for landlocked nations like Zambia, which depend on a vast network of both public paved and unsurfaced roads. 
Poorly maintained roads lead to both macro and micro economic losses, and this study focuses on sustainable 
prioritization of asphalt-paved road maintenance projects. Regardless of how well-designed or constructed they are, 
all pavements deteriorate over time because of the combined effects of traffic loads and the environment which could 
lead to huge costs of repair and rehabilitation if not addressed effectively. Maintenance treatments slow down the 
degradation process and so extend the pavement life. The choice of which public road to maintain is a challenging 
decision that governmental agencies must make that can be addressed by taking a multi-criteria decision-making 
approach. This study answers the question of which public roads to sustainably prioritize for maintenance considering 
decision-criteria subject to factors that include physical, climate resilience, socio-economic and environment aspects 
addressing an African’s concern. In this study, the authors establish the importance of decision-criteria aspects and 
develop a score card utility matrix as an objective decision-making tool. In developing this score-card, the authors 
rely on semi-structured questionnaire guides and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) structured questionnaire 
approaches in data collection, while adopting a combined AHP and utility matrix approach in developing a score card 
assessment tool.

1. Introduction
Accessibility to social and economic amenities and the provision of a crucial link between production and consumption 
make transportation infrastructure one of the most crucial factors for a nation's development (Bayoumi et al. 2021; 
Marai et al. 2021; Ng et al. 2019). This is especially true for landlocked nations like Zambia, which depend on a vast 
network of both public paved and unsurfaced roads (Ng et al. 2019). Poorly maintained roads lead to both macro and 
micro economic losses, and this study focuses on sustainable prioritization of asphalt-paved road maintenance projects 
(Adlinge and Gupta 2009; Llopis-Castelló et al. 2020). Regardless of how well-designed or constructed they are, all 
pavements deteriorate over time as a consequence of the combined effects of traffic loads and the environment which 
could lead to huge costs of repair and rehabilitation if not addressed effectively. Maintenance treatments slow down 
the degradation process and so extend the pavement life (Adlinge and Gupta 2009; Pearson 2011).

Abstract 
Sustainability is a topical issue in the global air transport sector. There is consensus among global air transport 
stakeholders that the current air transport systems will not be sustainable in the future. As such, there is a call for 
action to develop more sustainable air transport infrastructure including airports, airlines, air traffic control, air 
navigation systems and other supporting infrastructure. Among the challenges aviation and aerospace managers face 
today is defining sustainability.  One of the most widely used definitions of sustainability was developed by the United 
Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) also known as the Brundtland Commission 
who defined Sustainability as the ability to meet our current needs without comprising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs. Notably, there is no one universally accepted definition of sustainability specifically for the 
air transport or airport sectors. 
Globally, various government agencies and transport organizations have dedicated resources to the development of 
sustainable airport infrastructure. For instance, in 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the United States 
civil aviation industry regulator launched the sustainable master plan Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grant to 
fund airports of all sizes across the United States to support development of airport sustainability planning documents. 
The first of its kind, the FAA sustainable master plan AIP grant has funded 44 airports in the United States as of 2022. 
Of these, six airports are classified as small hub airports in the United States National Plan of Integrated Airport 
Systems (NPIAS). Small hub airports are primary commercial airports that handle more than 10,000 enplanements 
annually, similar in operation to most commercial airports located in major African Cities like Nairobi, Lagos, 
Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, etc.  
Using the multiple case study methodology, the author will analyze the sustainability management plans prepared by 
the six US small hub airports and find areas of application in African airports. The author hypothesizes that there are 
approaches to sustainable airport planning that are transferrable for applications in African airports based on 
similarities in the number of operations between airports in the two geographic regions and the ease of adoption of 
selected sustainability projects. 
The expected results will show the lessons learned from development and incorporating sustainability principles in 
airport planning from the perspective of US airports and provide recommendation for sustainable airport planning in 
African airports.

Abstract  
 
Zimbabwe is considered as one of the developing countries in Africa. Analytical statistics show that as the country 
will be developing, the power demand in that country will also increase. Currently, the amount of the power that is 
being generated in Zimbabwe is lower than that required for consumption. The power utility company in Zimbabwe, 
ZESA, prefers load shedding when such a scenario that consumption exceeds generation occurs. Load shedding can 
be an intentionally engineered electrical power outage where electricity supply is stopped for non-overlapping period 
over a particular zone. Currently, load shedding is done manually where an electrician will be assigned a task to go to 
the substations and isolate as well as restore power when the intended period of the shedding is reached. This has 
never been an effective method since it doesn’t allow operations to be done effectively in emergency scenarios which 
is leading to equipment failure. This has also caused a lot of accidents to the operators since the reclosers are prone to 
many hazards such as explosions and arcs when being operated. This paper is intended to phase out manual load 
operations and allow load operations to be performed remotely using low cost GSM module or RTC technology that 
if the period of shedding is foreknown, the system can be hardcoded so that it will isolate power and restore power 
when the set period is reached automatically.

Abstract  
During the last decade, the name smart city has been trending around the world playing a role in urban strategic 
planning. The concept has been recently introduced to embrace and contain modern urban challenges (Dameri, 2017). 
Chatterjee and Kar, (2015) said that the smart city definition varies concerning the context and perspective through 
which it is being conceptualised and applied. After a comprehensive literature review; Yin et al., (2015) defined it as 
‘A system integration of technological infrastructure that relies on advanced data processing with goals of making city 
governance that more efficient, citizens happier, business more prosperous and the environment more stable’. This is 
based on technical infrastructure, application domain, system integration and data processing. Smart cities contribute 
to urban sustainability, this urban sustainability relies on several elements and their mutual relationships, including 
natural resources, human, technological, social and cultural. Interactions of these have the economic growth, social 
equity and environmental issues. In their assessment of how future studies will be applied to cities, Miguel et al., 
(2016) noted that long-term planning for modern cities is difficult due to the increased complexity and diverse nature 
of the cities that rise due to cities’ operational processes and diversity. Since cities differ from country to country and 
city to city the inception of smart cities has seen flooding of the literature with a plethora of frameworks. In order to 
develop a sustainable smart city, one needs to make no mistake in choosing the correct framework to work with, hence 
the purpose of this research is to carry out a swot analysis on different smart cities frameworks.

Abstract 
The subject of reverse logistics has grown exponentially due to an increase in production and consumption activities. 
Companies are now more pressurized by regulatory bodies to be more responsible in dealing with the environment 
and producing their products. Reverse logistics has been proven to be an effective and efficient way to deal with the 
environment and optimize the performance of organizations. However, this concept is often misunderstood and many 
companies still don’t realize the benefits of implementing it in the operation of their businesses. Academic research 
in this field is limited, especially in the context of the Republic Democratic of Congo. They are no studies conducted 
to evaluate the effect of reverse logistics practices on the economic performance of companies, this is the case of the 
manufacturing companies such as Simba Breweries in particular. The gap has been identified and should be filled by 
researchers. The study aimed at evaluating the economic benefits of the reverse logistics system at Simba Breweries. 
For this, a descriptive research design was followed and data was collected through a questionnaire and analyzed using 
descriptive and inferential statistics. The results indicate that there was a positive and significant correlation between 
Reuse practice and the economic benefit of the company with a correlation and regression coefficient of 0.91 and 3.38. 
The study identified the economic benefit of implementing RL practices. Reuse practice decreases the cost of 
production by 65% and increased the profitability of the company by 60%. More research is needed to investigate 
feather the implementation of other practices of this system.

1. Introduction
Over the years, the subject of reverse logistics has received growing importance across the globe (Agrawal et al. 2015). 
It accounts for the end of the life cycle of products such as packaging material in both, developed and developing 
countries (Govindan and Soleimani 2017). It has been pointed out by many others as being an effective and efficient 
way to deal with environmental pollution and improve companies’ performance (Mwanza et al. 2017). 
The study aimed at identifying the economic effect of reverse logistics practices on the economic performance of the 
company. The reverse logistics system deals with the inverse flow of products from their point of consumption to the 
point of production to recapture value and proper disposal (Banihashemi et al. 2019). It is implemented in developed 
companies as a strategic tool to protect the environment and decrease the cost of production. This system is more 
successful in developed countries with strong regulations for the protection of the environment (Mwanza et al. 2016). 
Luthra et al. (2017) and Yu et al. (2018) indicated that in Europe, firms are held accountable for the waste they 
generate. However, in the de context of developing countries, the subject of reverse logistics is still in a state of infancy 
due to several barriers (Bouzon and Rodriguez 2018). Waste management and reverse logistics practices are still in 
the infancy stage in developing countries (Waqas et al. 2018). Post-consumer products such as used glass bottles from 
beverages are buried in landfills, dumped on roadsides, burnt, and thrown away in significant amounts; this leads to 
issues such as environmental pollution, waste of resources, and health problems (Menon et al. 2017). 
Manufacturing companies can take advantage of the benefits of the reverse logistic system to protect the environment 
in which there are doing business and cut off on their cost of production. In DRC, the subject of reverse logistics is a

Reuse 
From the Pearson correlation coefficient table 7, the study found that there was a positive and significant correlation 
between Reuse and the economic performance of the company with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. This indicated 
that whenever there is a change in the reuse practice, there will be a positive effect on the economic performance of 
the company. From the regression model, an increase in a unit of reuse practice by holding all other independent 
variables constant will result in a 0.38 increase in the economic performance of the company which is a 38 % variance. 
The studies conducted by Guta (2016) confirmed that the reuse of RL practice has a positive and significant impact 
on the economic performance of the company. A change of a unit in the reuse RL practice will automatically affect 
the economic performance of the company. The results revealed that out of the three reverse logistics practices 
considered, only the reuse practice was implemented in the company with an overall mean of 3.60 and a standard 
deviation of 0.113. The other two RL practices recycling and remanufacturing were found to not be implemented by 
the company with their overall mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0. 
6. Conclusion
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the reverse logistics system on the economic performance 
of the company. To conclude, the results from Tables 1, 2, and 3 indicate that the company had a reverse logistics 
system in place in which only the reuse practice was implemented out of the three practices considered in this study 
with an overall mean of 3.60 and a standard deviation of 0.113. Results in Table 4 indicated that the reverse logistics 
practice implemented by the company increases brings economic benefits to the company as the grand mean found 
was 3.69. Tables 7 and 8 indicate that reuse practice had a positive and strong correlation with the economic 
performance of the company, a unit increase in the reuse practice resulted in an increase of 0.38 in the economic 
performance of the company. The study also indicated that the reuse practice decreased the cost of production by 65% 
and increased the profitability of the company by 60%. However, remanufacturing and recycling did not have any 
correlation with the performance of the company as they were not implemented. In Table 5 the study found that the 
high cost related to the implementation of the RL system, the lack of the implementation of IT solutions, the lack of 
collaboration with partners in the Supply Chain, the lack of government implication in green, and the product return 
are the biggest challenges faced by the company.  
There is a need of conducting more research on the topic of reverse logistics in general, especially in African countries, 
and the focus should be on its economic benefits on the performance of manufacturing companies and other RL 
practices. The study contributed to the body of knowledge and covered the gap by focusing on the evaluation of the 
economic benefits of this system on a manufacturing company in the RDC. Firms in this industry should focus on the 
implementation of the reuse RL practice and open doors to other practices of the system to maximize the benefits. The 
study was limited to one company in the brewery industry of Lubumbashi/DRC and considered only three practices 
of the system. Further research can pick it from here and include many companies and other practices.

Abstract 
Digital readiness is the organizational readiness to face digitalization. The development of digital audit must be 
balanced with digital readiness. Organizations can use a specific capability maturity model to assess their existing 
position in relation to the adoption of digital audit readiness measures and receive help in advancing to the required 
level of implementation of relevant capabilities. This study looks at how such a model might help integrate measures 
linked to digital audit readiness and aid in achieving the right degree of maturity. Based on four digital transformation 
process categories: internal policy and governance, information and technology, digital process transformation, and 
human resource management, the implementation of digital audit readiness has been evaluated. Five maturity levels 
describe the various phases of implementing digital audit readiness measures (incomplete, performed, managed, 
established, predictable, and innovating). Aligning IT governance frameworks can assist implement digital audit 
readiness. To determine whether an organization is prepared for digital transformation, it is necessary to assess its 
readiness for a digital audit. The results of the digital audit readiness assessment will show problems with how digital 
audit transformation is being used. Sub-criteria that have a low level of maturity and high global weight can later be 
prioritized for increasing audit readiness.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation (DX) should be implemented to improve effectiveness and efficiency. The government of 
Indonesia is aiming to establish “Indonesia Digital”, making it no different from other countries. The four strategic 
sectors for digital Indonesia for 2021–2024 are digital infrastructure, digital government, digital economy, and digital 
society. Digital government, or e-government, has been developed recently and is also applicable to government internal 
audit activities. Internal auditing is a consulting and assurance activity that is objective and independent, with the goal 
of adding value and improving organizational performance (IIA 2022). Government audits are a crucial tool for keeping 
tabs on how government funds are being used, preventing corruption, and enhancing performance (Cao et al. 2021). 
Along with technological advancements, digital audits are necessary. Several elements need to be taken into account, 
including cost, time, technology, personal data protection, cyber security, and proper user training (Lois et al. 2022). 
Digital auditing, which uses information technology, can shorten the time needed to conduct audits, increase 
productivity, reduce costs, and improve performance with quick data transmission. Internal auditors can reorganize so 
they can work virtually, which increases audit efficiency (Teeter et al. 2010). Internal management, audit 
implementation, and audit objects are the three areas of change for the digital audit. This will have an impact on the 
transformation of business processes, IT, and human resources (HR). 
There are issues with the study in this case study, including: (a) the factors that influence organizational readiness in 
the digital audit transformation are unknown; (b) digital readiness has not been carried out before the digital audit will 
be implemented; and (c) the level of the organization's readiness to implement the new system is unknown. Designing 
a digital audit readiness model is the initial step in solving research problems.

344","Based on the weighting of the criteria and sub-criteria, it was determined that internal policy and governance had the 
highest weight of criteria (0.301), with financial resources being the most important sub-criteria, followed by the 
internal policy of DX governance, project management, and DX strategic and planning. Information and technology 
is the second-most important criteria, with the weight of criteria is 0.291. The two most significant sub-criteria are 
data governance and data analytics, whereas enterprise architecture maintenance is the least important. With a weight 
of 0.286, digital process transformation is the third most important criteria. These criteria consist of six sub-criteria, 
with data-driven decision management being the most important and horizontal integration being the least significant. 
Human resource management is the criteria with the lowest weight, with the weight of criteria is 0.122. This criterion 
has four sub-criteria, the most important of which is HR Skill Development and the least important of which is 
Organizational Structure Management. 
In table 9, the results of the criterion weighting are shown in descending order from highest to lowest. To make it 
easier to see the overall weight values in Figure 4, the global weight for each sub-criterion is given in descending 
order of importance. 
Figure 4. Global weight of sub criteria 
Based on the global weight, the order of priority or level of importance that affects the assessment is: first, financial 
resources with a global weight of 0.143; second, quantitative performance management and data-driven decision 
management with a global weight of 0.073; third, internal DX governance policy with a global weight of 0.059; and 
the lowest global weight is in the organizational structure management and enterprise architecture maintenance sub-
criteria with a global weight of 0.018. 
6. Conclusion
The development of an integrated digital audit must be followed by digital readiness. In this study, capability maturity 
models or frameworks are used to assess digital readiness. The capability maturity frameworks combine the DX-CMM 
and Indonesian regulations. This model is the ""digital transformation capability maturity framework"" (DX-CMF), which 
has four aspects: internal policy and governance (IP), information and technology (IT), digital process transformation 
(DP), and human resource management (HR). Using established standards that have been approved by professionals, 
maturity is evaluated. The final outcome of the maturity assessment will be used to determine levels of digital readiness. 
The organization's digital readiness to adapt its auditing procedures to include digital ones can be assessed. 
Based on the results of weighting using AHP, the highest criteria weight is Internal Policy and Governance (IP), 
followed by Information and Technology (IT), Digital Process Transformation (DP) and the lowest is Human Resource

353","Management (HR). Whereas the most significant weight in terms of global weight is at financial resources (IP4) and 
and the lowest is organizational structure management (HR2) and enterprise architecture maintenance (IT8).  
For a future study to find out if digital audits are ready, a maturity level assessment will be done. The evaluation results 
will subsequently be used to formulate a strategy for digital audit transformation.

Abstract 
The service concept at teller counter in the banking sector currently is not only inefficient but also does not involve 
the role of the customer. To respond to this condition, along with the rapid development of technology, a new digital 
product is needed to accommodate the problems while maintaining the customer's experience during transactions. In 
other words, the implementation of new digital product must benefit for all sides, both from the bank's side and from 
the customer's side. Specifically on the customer side, a special investigation is needed to ensure that the new products 
implemented by the bank still achieve their satisfaction so that customers still want to entrust their financial processes 
to certain banking companies. Using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, this 
paper will discuss about customer’s respond due to service digitalization at counter teller in banking companies.

Abstract 
The South African foundry industry is in a state of decline. From 2010 to 2020, almost 37 foundries were closed, 
resulting in 123 operational foundries from 160 foundries. A benchmarking study was done using analytical factors 
to determine how competitive SA (South Africa) foundries were compared to those in other countries. Notably, an 
attempt was made to map the analytical factors, such as capacity utilisation, labour productivity, process yield, and 
energy cost, of SA foundries and compare them to Chinese foundries. Questionnaires were formulated to acquire 
primary data from SA foundries and China. In South Africa, 11 out of 14 foundries responded to the questionnaires 
administered through face-to-face interviews, whereas in China, one out of three foundries responded through email. 
On average, data from SA foundries indicate that they are uncompetitive in gating systems, scrap casting, labour 
productivity, capacity utilisation, and energy costs. In conclusion, based on these analytical factors, Chinese foundry 
has a competitive edge over SA foundries and the EU; consequently, buyers may prefer to acquire casting from china 
due to lower production cost, which translates into cheaper casting. It is recommended that SA foundries invest in 
upskilling their workforces, adopt casting simulation software, and participate in energy efficiency programmes to 
improve their competitiveness.

1. Introduction
The South African foundry industry is in a state of decline, and meaningful interventions are required to reverse the 
industry's current trends. Notably, the foundries have to assume a position of competitiveness both locally and 
internationally. The National Foundry Technology Network (NFTN) has identified the foundry industry as a key 
manufacturing sub-segment that needs to be targeted for revitalisation. Since 2010, there has been a rapid closure of 
foundries – between 2010 and 2015. In 2020, the industry lost 37 foundries, resulting in 123 foundries in operation 
(Lochner et al. 2020) 
Several challenges in the industry had previously been identified by the nftn that may have contributed to the industry's 
poor performance.(Rasmussen 2013; nftn 2015): Lack of product volumes to achieve manufacturing economies of 
scale, Aged infrastructure for capital equipment parts; high levels of capital investment needed, Low capacity 
utilisation at many foundries, Local buyers offering ad-hoc low volume orders; and Limited collaboration in the 
industry to develop the collective capacity and capability (nftn 2015). In general, the closure of foundries in South 
Africa is primarily due to a lack of competitiveness compared to international competitors and failure to overcome 
challenges that have been reported for some time (Davies 2015). 
To address these challenges, strategic and operational performance initiatives are required. Benchmarking is one of 
the strategic techniques used in production, research and development, and marketing to compare the performance 
against the competitors and the industry (Hanson and Voss 1995). Benchmarking techniques have been applied to a 
broader range of products, practices, and performances, and it is a way to compare a company's performance with the 
industry standard or competitors (Hanson and Voss 1995). Benchmarking can help identify where improvements can

production schedules will enable foundries to manoeuvre this challenge. In addition, investing in modern technologies 
would help the foundries compete with China and the EU regarding labour productivity. 
4.3 Capacity Utilisation 
Capacity utilisation measures how much of a company's production capacity is being used to produce goods or 
services. It is calculated by dividing the actual output of a company by its maximum potential output and then 
expressing the result as a percentage. Capacity utilisation for SA Foundries is at (75%) at their best performance, while 
the average is (43%), as shown in Table 2. Table 3 shows that the Chinese foundry has (90%) capacity utilisation 
while the EU has (54%). South African foundries are underutilised, whereas Chinese foundries use 90% of their 
capacity. This has decreased SA Foundries' revenue, while Chinese Foundries have seen an increase in profits. To 
remain competitive, SA Foundries need to increase their utilisation rates. Several factors contribute to the low capacity 
utilisation: insufficient order, manual operations, and inadequate energy reliability. For SA foundries to compete in 
the market, they must adopt new strategies to maximise capacity utilisation.  
4.4 Energy Cost  
Energy is the key analytical factor for the foundry industry and constitutes one of the most critical cost factors in 
operations. Most of the energy in foundries is consumed in the melting section, which accounts for approximately 
(55%) of electricity consumption. Table 2 shows the electricity cost in SA, which is a variance of (4%), with the best 
rate at R1, 25kwh, the average rate at R1, 64kwh, and the worst rate is R1, 93Kwh. The variance in electricity rate is 
based on whether the electricity is supplied directly by Eskom or the local municipal. According to (Kaziboni et al. 
2018), foundries purchasing electricity from their local municipality could pay up to (30%) more than when they 
purchase electricity directly from Eskom. Therefore, foundries receiving electricity from local municipalities have a 
cost disadvantage and are less competitive. 
 In this, (72%) of foundries receive electricity from their municipality, costing them R1,65-1,93Kwh. The cost of 
electricity for the SA foundries supplied by the municipality is higher than that in China, which is R1, 24Kwh, while 
competitive at 1,25Kwh to SA foundries supplied by Eskom. However, S . A foundries no longer enjoy the benefits 
of cheaper electricity as Eskom drastically increased the price of electricity to maintain their ageing infrastructure The 
SA foundries. Therefore, most SA foundries are becoming uncompetitive due to the rising electricity cost in South 
Africa. Energy consumption can be significantly reduced by introducing energy efficiency practices in foundries, 
leading to cost savings and improved environmental sustainability. Furthermore, it can also result in improved process 
efficiency, better product quality, and increased production throughput.  
5. Conclusions
The study provided the analytic factors benchmarked with Chinese foundry. The analytic factors of process yield 
include gating system, scrap/reject casting, labour productivity, capacity utilisation and energy cost. All the derived 
analytical factors show that the Chinese foundry has an average competitive edge over SA foundries. However, they 
are some exceptions where some SA foundries are compared on their best performance. 
As a result of this analytic factor, it demonstrated why most buyers would prefer to purchase casting from China than 
in South Africa. Chinese foundries provide higher process yield (less gating systems, less scrap casting), higher labour 
productivity, higher capacity utilisation, and lower energy costs. This factor results in lower production costs and more 
profitable business, which gives leverage to cheaper casting than the competitors. The main aspect that SA foundries 
need to focus on is the upskilling of employees, which will assist in reducing casting rejection and producing more 
good casting, adoption of a simulation package to optimise the liquid metal casting, and energy efficiency practices, 
which will assist in reducing the energy consumption. The capacity utilisation will be realised by a localisation 
programme which will assist foundries in the increase in orders to allow better capacity utilisation. South Africa has 
the potential to save their local foundries if attention is given to the analytical factor provided in order to compete with 
Chinese foundries, which are flooding the market with cheaper casting.

Abstract  
Lean-based sustainability refers to studying and analyzing a current process and improving it. The process can be 
improved by indicating the non-value-added activities that delay the process and eliminating, combining, or 
simplifying these non-value-added activities. In this manner, waste has been reduced to a minimum, and overall 
process efficiency and customer satisfaction are augmented. The paper aims to oversee the current process of Manhole 
construction and work in a manner to reduce the time taken, materials used, and general resource wastes. Specifically, 
it has been observed that the Manhole backfilling process can be broken down into key activities. The process can be 
improved and made more efficient by linking lean-based tools to sustainability. The results have revealed that the 
overall process time and total lead time have been improved by around 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively. Furthermore, 
waste production has been significantly reduced by approximately 83.5%. The waste mentioned above reduction 
percentage has been obtained without sacrificing or compromising the quality and standards.

Introduction
1.1. Lean Concept
Lean is widely known as the waste elimination approach. The “Lean” methodology originated in Japan and has since
been related to separating wasteful activities from those that bring value to a business and its supply chain. Waste is
responsible for roughly 95% of the total cost (Kilpatrick 2003). The lean process was not new when broken down into
its component elements, but it was new. Lean provides us with a concept concentrated around understanding value. It
gives us a methodology to prioritize value-creating actions and arrange the entire process more efficiently. In addition, 
lean thinking provides help to reduce the human effort required and reduce time and space (Womack and Jones, 1996). 
Therefore, lean methodology is essential and fundamental. These days, manufacturing industry globally, business 
executives are applying the lean concept in many operational areas inside their organizations to achieve optimal 
performance and satisfied customers. 
1.2. Sustainability Concept 
In the Brundtland Report, the United Nations (UN) defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same. In addition to natural resources, 
both social and economic resources are required. Sustainable living is not just about natural resource conservation but 
also includes economic growth and social equality.

4.3. Cost Reduction 
The cost of constructing a Manhole is drastically decreased from 12,186.20 QAR to 2,337.05 QAR. The 
improvement registered is a staggering 521% less than the old process; see Figure 8. 
Figure 8. Cost comparison between the current process and the improved process 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation
This paper presented a lean-based methodology for enhancing the sustainability performance of one of the major 
processes for Manhole construction, the backfilling process. Non-value-added activities have been identified and 
reduced waste to a minimum by combining, eliminating, or simplifying the actions taken. In turn, the process’s overall 
duration and the drastic saving of material utilization have decreased, which works hand-in-hand with the 
sustainability concept without compromising the standards and quality of work being done. Cost reduction was also a 
major factor in optimizing this process rather than the traditional backfilling procedure. Continuous improvement by 
implementing these methodologies on a larger scale will incentivize a more sustainable construction process. 
However, there is much more room for improving the process, and further analysis is needed for continuous 
development and improvements. Using different eco-efficiency indicators to assess the proposed approach is a future 
research trend; for instance, Abdella et al. (2020, 2021); Kucukvar et al. (2020); Kutty et al. (2020 a,b)

Abstract 
The study aimed at investigating the impact of operations strategy on business performance at Lusaka Business 
and Technical College in the last 5 years to address challenges that the institution was facing. A descriptive case 
study design with a target population of 150 respondents was considered. A sample size of 75 was stratified into; 
Top Management, Middle Management, Academic Staff, Administration Staff, Regulators, Industry Partners and 
Clients. Purposive sampling method was used to arrive at the sample by identifying members of the population 
who were willing to be in the study. Primary data was collected using self-administered Likert type questionnaires. 
Secondary data was collected from physical and online publications and other sources The collected data was 
processed and analyzed with the aid of “Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)” Version 26. The results 
were presented in tables and figures. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses at 0.05 significant level 
(β =0.808, F =28.281, R=0.808, R2=0.382, P < 0.05). Test results showed that operations strategy has an impact 
on business performance. The financial impact was also established with average income growth of 1 Million and 
2 Million Kwacha before and after implementation. The income made the institution finance its operations better 
than before. Contribution to the country’s economic growth is by improving labor productivity through 
technology. The results revealed that Operations Strategy has an impact on Business Performance. The study 
recommends that technical institutions formulate and implement operations strategies that are market-centered 
and can contribute to business performances.

1. Introduction
The findings of the study aimed at contributing to the already existing knowledge on the relationship between 
operations strategy and organization performance of institutions. In 1994, The Ministry of Science, Technology 
and Vocational Training (MSTVT), appointed a national task force to review government policy on Technical 
Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET). The report was submitted in January 1995 after 
which the Government issued a new policy directive whose objective was to develop a system for TEVET that 
would satisfy the demands and requirements of formal and informal sectors. The Government enacted a law 
in1998, which allowed the institute to operate autonomously on business lines and the Management Board was 
constituted to run the institution. Mandated Functions of LBTC  Management Board in accordance with the 
TEVET Act of 1998 are; provision of training in technical education, vocational and entrepreneurship ,develop 
curricula for the college, ensure standards prescribed by TEVETA are maintained, provision of training for 
members of staff, administration of the affairs of the institute, charge and collect fees for tuition, boarding and 
other services provided by the institution subject to the approval by the Minister  and do all such things as the 
management board may consider necessary to promote technical education, vocational and entrepreneurships 
training. This meant that grants from the Government would soon diminish because its intention was to ensure

The calculated R=0.808, is the multiple correlation coefficient between all the independent variables and the 
dependent variable. In this model (1), the value is 0.808, which indicates that there is a strong positive linear 
relationship between respondents’ perception on the impact of OS on BP. This further implies that respondents 
are of the view that OS have an impact on BP. The adjusted R2 for operations strategies on business performance 
is 0.630. The values of adjusted R2 mean that operations strategies included in this regression model explain 
approximately 63% from the variations in the business performance at LBTC.This further implies that the 
regression results found a positive relationship at 0.05 significance level between dependent variables and 
independent variables.  
As shown from Table 4, the value of R Square is 0.753. R square is simply the squared value of R which indicates 
that 75% of the variance in the dependent variable (business performance) is explained by the independent 
variables (operation strategies) in the regression model. Therefore, there is a positive significant relationship at 
0.05 significance level between dependent and continuous independent variables.  A constant value (alpha) of 
0.365 which is the predicted value of the dependent variable measuring (business performance) when the predictor 
is set at 0 and the coefficient of the independent variables (operation strategies) (beta=0.808, is the size of the 
coefficient of independent variable means that the size of the effect it has on the dependent variable is 0.808.   
The prediction component as shown in Table 1 is the t-value and significance. The t-statistic (1.060) is the 
coefficient of determination divided by its standard error. If 95% of the t-distribution is close to the mean than the 
t-value, then the coefficient will have a p-value of 5%. The p-value indicates that the independent variables 
measure operations strategies. The results indicate satisfactory goodness of fit between the independent variable 
(operation strategies) and dependent variable (business performance.) It also showed that the F-value which is the 
mean square model divided by the mean square residual yielded F = 28.281 meaning that the model is significant 
to predict the impact of operations strategies on business performance.

Where: BP= Business Performance, OS=Operation Strategies.  
6. Conclusion
The financial records from audit reports during the study period indicated that the impact of operations strategy 
was practically determined with an increase in income from 1M to 2M kwacha before and after implementation 
respectively. 
The theoretical results of the study showed that training institutions should be involved in analyzing operations 
strategies in order to evaluate their impact on business performance, analyzing OS and their impact on BP brings 
positive benefits, employees are aware of OS strategies of the institution, Stakeholders are aware of the impact of 
OS on institution performance, some of LBTC strategic objectives have been implemented, LBTC interacts with 
stakeholder groups such as employees, students, the board, the authority TEVETA, EIZ,GIZ, industry, Ministry 
of Technology and Science and other cooperating partners, LBTC standards are established and verified by the 
regulatory authority TEVETA, financial impact of analyzing and implementing OS is experienced both in the 
short and long term, and implementation of strategic objectives is the responsibility of all employees. This further 
implies that operations strategies have an impact on business performance at LBTC. It was also established that 
LBTC in collaboration with GIZ has made a contribution towards the growth of the economy through the training 
and upskilling of technical labor force from informal and formal sectors respectively. This is in conformity with 
other research findings in section 2.4 which established that there is a linear relationship between operations 
strategy and business performance. This suggests that operations strategy can be applied to any form of business 
ranging from domestic business setups up to big business corporations, social groupings and/or organizations. 
7. Recommendation
The study recommends that institutions formulate and implement operations strategy if they are to remain 
competitive in the business environment since there is sufficient evidence that there is a linear relationship 
between the two variables. Further studies are however recommended that will determine the performance of 
college graduates from an industry perspective. We also recommend that further studies be conducted to analyze 
skills gap between college graduates and industry so that necessary interventions can be made to narrow that gap 
and increase production levels.  
8. Limitations of the study
The first limitation of the study came with the collection of primary data from the respondents especially those 
from industry, cooperating partners and regulators. Most of them indicated that they were very busy with their 
work schedules and the researcher allowed them to attend to the questionnaire willingly at their convenient time 
because any form of forcing could have contravened with ethical issues of the study. However, this created a delay

Management Lusaka, Zambia, April 4-6, 2023 
in the processing and analysis of the data and hence the compilation of the thesis report. The second and last 
limitation is that the results could suffer from a social desirability bias (Mohr et al. 2001), where respondents tend 
to respond with the intention of pleasing the author (Nederhof 1985).

Abstract 
Road safety is an interesting and complicating field. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes, and between 20 to 50 million are 
injured, 93% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these 
countries have approximately 60% of the world's vehicles. The young are particularly vulnerable on the world’s roads 
and road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 (WHO, 2021). First, 
the consequences of these numbers are reflected in families' pain, human tragedy, shattered destinies, and lives. Then 
in the economic situation of the country and its health services. Road traffic safety refers to the methods and measures 
used to prevent road users from being killed or seriously injured. Despite decades of research, this continues to be 
debated due to the factors associated with it such as road users’ factors, environmental factors, road conditions, and 
economic factors, so forth. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important stage when it comes to understanding 
data and extracting useful information. Several analyses have been conducted in order to better understand the factors 
most affecting Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) and reveal hidden information that can give insights to road stakeholders 
and law enforcement to take some preventive actions against accidents. Among the most important part in EDA is to 
determine the dependent and independent variables which make the data interpretation better and obvious. This paper 
presents some dependent and independent variables of road accident and the metrics for measuring the traffic accident 
severity.

Abstract 
Mechanised core shops use core blowing machines. Core making is done using organic and inorganic binders. The 
cores are either cured with a gas or warm air to make them solid. The core making process is influenced by several 
factors from sand quality, machine operation and machine design and other related parameters. The foundry relies on 
the core shop to supply cores to be able to produce the hollow features in castings. An unreliable core shop becomes 
a bottle neck to the overall foundry process. This study was performed in a foundry investigate the causes of reduced 
core shop productivity based on the numbers of defective cores produced in relation to recorded production parameters 
which were the operators, core shooters and sand quality. The analysis showed that all parameters recorded resulted 
in defective cores to varying extents. Certain elements of the chosen parameters where also shown to be more 
problematic than others.

Abstract 
The agricultural sector in Zambia has been described as the backbone of the economy. It contributes to the 
country’s GDP, national exports and employs most of the population. The agricultural sector in Zambia is 
dominated by small and medium scale farmers who are mostly located in the rural areas. Due to the importance 
role played by the small and medium scale farmers in Zambia, it is necessary to conduct a competitive analysis 
to assess their competitive environment. Michael Porters five forces model was used in the analysis. In assessing 
the competitive environment of the agricultural sector, this analysis focuses on small and medium scale farming 
with reference to the crop sub sector and focusing on the major crop -maize. The analysis was informed by 
Secondary data sources from peer reviewed journal articles and professional reports about the agricultural sector 
in Zambia. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data in line with Michael Porter’s five forces framework. 
The findings indicate that the threat of new entrants to small and medium scale farming is relatively high due to 
lack of barriers of entry and supportive government programs for the farmers, the barging power of buyers is 
relatively high because buyers are often fewer and buy in large volumes which makes them more powerful than 
the small and medium scale farmers. The bargaining power of suppliers is also high as the small and medium-
scale farmers are mostly dependent on subsidies due to the financial constraints that they face.

1. Introduction
The agricultural sector plays an enormous role in the economy of Zambia and is said to be the backbone of the 
economy. The agricultural sector contributes approximately 12% to the national exports earnings and to the 
country’s Gross Domestic (GDP) (Policy Monitoring and Research Centre (PMRC) 2021).  The agricultural 
sector is arguably the main source of income and employment for much of the population in Zambia. The 
agricultural sector employs 70% of the labour force and provides a livelihood for most people living in the rural 
part of Zambia (PMRC2021; Mwando 2022). The agricultural sector in Zambia is dominated by small and 
medium scale farmers who are mostly located in the rural parts of the country. The small and medium scale 
farmers supply about 80% of the domestic food in Zambia (World Food Program 2020). It can thus be observed 
that the small and medium scale farmers in Zambia play an important role in the economic development of the 
country and as such it is important to conduct a competitive analysis of the industry. The competitive analysis 
done through Michael porters framework highlights how attractive the industry is from the eyes of the small and 
medium scale farmers. Michael Porter’s five forces has been used by several researchers to analyze the 
competitive environment of various industries (Yunna and Yisheng 2014; Rajasekar and Raee 2013). Assessment 
of the agriculture industry in Zambia in the context of the small and medium scale farmers is vital because of their 
contribution to the economy and it can help to devise strategies that benefit the small and medium scale farmers 
in Zambia.

Imported commodities can be found in supermarket chains and markets across the country. It can be observed 
that mostly the imported products are of high quality and have better packaging thus offering great competition 
to the small and medium-scale farmers who have little resources to compete (World Food Program 2020).  
3.5 Rivalry among Established Firms 
One of the factors used to assess the the level of rivalry within an industry may include number of firms in the 
industry and exit barriers. The agricultural sector in Zambia has many players who are predominately small and 
medium scale farmers Due to the large number of small and medium scale farmers in the industry, the agricultural 
sector can be argued to be perfectly competitive as opposed to being in a monopoly or oligopoly. The agricultural 
sector is characterized by many small and medium scale farmers of which non-has a significant share. 
Furthermore, the small and medium scale farmer produces homogenous products which is maize in this scale and 
normally provide little to no differentiation.  
In terms of exit barriers, it can be observed that the agriculture industry has low exit barriers. The low levels of 
investments and mechanization by the small and medium scale farmers makes it easier for them to leave or join 
whenever they decide to. These factors increase the rivalry in the industry as many new players can join at any 
time without having much investment. 
4 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
Based on secondary data this paper conducted a competitive analysis of the small and medium scale farmers using 
Michael porters five forces model. The results show that the threat of new entrants is relatively high. This is 
because there are so significant barriers to entry as small and medium scale farming is not mechanized in Zambia. 
The government policy of FISP and FRA can also be viewed as encouraging factors rather than restricting entry. 
The barging power of buyers and suppliers is relatively high and outnumber the buyers who mostly impose the 
buying price. As for suppliers, the small and medium scale farmers’ financial constraints bring about challenges 
of accessing farming inputs. When it comes to the threat of substitutes, small and medium scale farmers mostly 
cultivate maize which is a staple food in Zambia and thus a crop may not have much threat of substitution. 
However, the threat of substitution can be looked at from the point of view of the other players in the industry 
who also cultivate the same product and offer it to the market. Threat of substation comes from large and 
commercial farmers who have more resources to package and reach out to the markets. 
The results of the five forces analysis suggest that the small and medium scale farmers do not benefit the most 
out of their farming activities. It can be argued that from the small and medium scale farmer’s perspective, the 
profitability is on the low side as it appears that the farmers are at the mercy of the buyers and suppliers who exert 
more influence on them. That being the case, the small and medium scale farmers need more support in terms of 
adequate farming inputs (which are normally in short supply or delayed) and cost reflective prices which absorbs 
their cost of production. The small and medium scale farmer’s views should be considered when the floor price 
for commodities such as maize is being determined. Since the small and medium scale farmers account for a 
larger proportion to the provision of food security and employment, there is need to ensure that their challenges 
such as access to credit, market and fair prices are in improved. The government as well as the private sector 
should offer agricultural credit at lower interest rates to the small and medium scale farmers. This has potential 
to boost their faring activities as they will be able to meet some of their farming requirements such as farming 
inputs. 
5 Limitations  
This study has some limitations. Firstly, this study is based on secondary data of peer reviewed articles, 
professional reports, and websites. It would be great to conduct a Five forces analysis using primary data such as 
a survey or interviews with small and medium scale farmers. Secondly this study only looked at small and medium 
scale farmers in crop production with particular emphasis on maize. Future studies can look at the other sub 
sectors of the agriculture industry or the whole industry analysis.

Abstract  
The construction industry is a hazardous field, with a high risk of accidents due to the nature of the work involved. 
These accidents range in severity from minor to major injuries and even fatalities, leading to a growing need for 
occupational health and safety measures. This study therefore aimed to identify and evaluate the accident prevention 
practices utilized in the construction industry in Zambia. The study used a mixed-method approach that included semi-
structured interviews and a survey questionnaire, with a sample population consisting of National Council for 
Construction (NCC) - registered local contractors in grades 1 and 2, including both employers (contractors) and 
employees (workers) working on construction projects in Lusaka, Zambia. The study found that common accident 
prevention practices in the Zambian construction industry included safety training and orientation, the provision and 
proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), safety inspections, strict safety enforcement, and the provision of 
safe working conditions and environments. The research is essential in providing useful information for policymakers, 
stakeholders, and practitioners in the construction industry in Zambia, by identifying effective accident prevention 
practices that can be adopted to improve safety in the workplace.

1. Introduction
The Economic Commission of Africa (2017) recognizes the importance of high-quality infrastructure development in 
promoting industrialization, structural transformation, and economic growth in developing countries. Zambia has 
shown a commitment to public infrastructure development through initiatives outlined in the Seventh National 
Development Plan 2017-2021 (Ministry of National Development Planning 2017). Over the past decade, the industry

and healthy working environments; provision of adequate and appropriate information, instruction, training and 
supervision; and safety and health standards and procedures. 
6. Conclusion
The research identified and evaluated the accident preventive practices common to the Zambian construction industry 
as safety training and induction, provision and proper use of PPE, provision of safe and healthy working environments, 
safety inspections and enforcement. Furthermore, the study categorized these practices into three main groups for 
simplicity purposes namely: accident control measures, safety audits and inspections and shared expectations in the 
construction companies. It is important to note that the research focused on large construction companies, which may 
introduce a bias in relation to company size and safety practices. However, other studies, have suggested that company 
size is not necessarily a determinant of safety climate. Therefore, the findings of the study are still relevant and 
important for improving safety practices in the Zambian construction industry.  
The low levels of adherence to reporting accidents, injuries, near misses, and illnesses on construction sites identified 
in the study are concerning. It is important for employers to create a culture of safety where workers feel comfortable 
reporting incidents without fear of retribution. This can be achieved through education and training, clear reporting 
procedures, and effective investigation and follow-up.  
Overall, the study highlights the need for ongoing vigilance and improvement in safety practices on construction sites 
to prevent accidents and protect the health and safety of workers.

ABSTRACT 
Transportation is crucial in the delivery of medicines and medical equipment world over. In Africa, the challenge 
of poor road infrastructure and limited options of delivery channels restrict delivery to road transportation. In 
Zambia, the Zambia Medicines, and Medical Supplies Agency (ZAMMSA), faces these challenges to deliver 
medicine to the Last Mile. It would be useful to know how exactly ZAMMSA has responded to the logistical 
challenges that relate to last mile system. Therefore, the main objective for this research was to evaluate the last 
mile delivery logistics process performance at ZAMMSA, to investigate challenges of the transportation system 
in use in relation the Last Mile delivery process, to assess the Last Mile delivery performance at ZAMMSA and 
to address any challenges pertinent to transportation.  A quantitative approach was used, and data was collected 
using semi-structured questionnaires. Purposive sampling technique was adopted and 50 employees from 
ZAMMSA were selected. The data was presented through tables, graphs and charts and standard deviation was 
used to analyse the responses. Data was analysed using Microsoft excel.  The main findings of the research were 
that ZAMMSA uses a combined transportation system of own and outsourced vehicles and the challenges of the 
Last Mile system at ZAMMSA lead to operational inefficiencies. The implication of these results is that the Last 
Mile logistics system is particularly ideal for organisations that pursue the profit-making objective. However, the 
Last Mile system can still be used by any logistics Organisation to improve efficiency in the Supply Chain. To 
improve efficiency and the operation of the Last Mile system at ZAMMSA, it was recommended that staff be 
trained to understand how the concept is operationalized.  
Key words 
Cross-docking, Last Mile, Logistics, Medicine, supply Chain Management 
1. Introduction
Globally Last Mile logistics is an emerging research area with growing interest from scholars and practitioners, 
especially over the past five years (Cárdenas, et. al., 2017). The mainstay of the health system stems from a well-
organized supply chain of vaccines, medicines delivery, and other health commodities. In developing countries, 
health product supply chains are characterised with many problems which negatively affects the overall health 
care system (Yadav, 2015).  
Transportation in Logistics Management is a fundamental part of the supply chain of goods and services from the 
point of origination to the destination (Tseng et. al., 2014). Multi-national companies such as Coca-Cola and 
international pharmaceuticals such as Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Bayer have demonstrated how they 
depend on a reliable transport system for their deliveries. (Tseng et. al., 2014). Further, change in techniques and 
management concepts increases moving load, distribution speed, and quality of service, running costs, facilities 
usage, and energy savings therefore making transportation to be a key aspect of logistics utilization (ibid).

The ZAMMSA, being a quasi-government institution does not pursue the profit maximisation objective which is 
essential for Last Mile delivery system (Yadav, 2013, Nakagawa and Beale, 2019).  
The study established that ZAMMSA faces challenges due to a low knowledge base in the transport and logistic 
department because of low investment in training and development. The RBV theory is applicable as people are 
a key resource for any transport and logistics system (Chopra & Peter, 2011). Further, the study shows that 
ZAMMSA routing is not well planned as some deliveries are impromptu and dictated by the trans-shipment of 
medical suppliers from international suppliers. 
5.
Conclusion
The study concluded that ZAMMSA uses a combination of own fleet and outsourced third party logistics. Last 
Mile activity was also found to be quite challenging due to the lack of proper addresses of facilities, thus leading 
to slow rate of delivery of health commodities to the Last Mile. Last Mile delivery system at ZAMMSA has 
improved operations due to an increase in the number of vehicles, but it has come with increased operational costs. 
One factor affecting the performance of the Last Mile logistical delivery system at ZAMMSA was the lack of 
training and development for staff in the logistics department. Efficiencies of the system could be improved with 
training that will bridge the existing knowledge gap identified among the logistical staff.   
6.
Recommendations
In line with the research objectives, it is therefore recommended that: 
1.
Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency invests in other transportation systems that would enhance
the effectiveness of the Last Mile delivery system. Airfreight logistics for the Last Mile was found to be a
feasible option in South Africa, Nigeria and Uganda (Dube & Shivanandan, 2016);
2.
Improvement to vehicle scheduling and routing could be a way to increase the efficiencies of the Last Mile
delivery at ZAMMSA. Vehicle routing for the Last Mile is challenging and hard, yet is is thought to increase
efficiency and reduce operational costs (Gevaers et al., 2014);
3.
Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency invests in training and development for its logistics staff so
that the knowledge gap is reduced. This would increase operational efficiencies as was also suggested by
Nakagawa and Beale, (2019);
Since Last Mile delivery is such an important phenomenon in transport and logistics, further research in the field 
is recommended. As such, this study recommends further study on: 
1.
Ways to improve efficiency in the Last Mile delivery system

Abstract  
While the Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a broadly recognized management notion and has become one of the most 
used solutions in manufacturing industries, its implementation in various industries still needs further research.  This 
study explores TOC implementation in a minerals environment where there are mining and minerals extraction 
activities.  An instrumental case study approach is used for this research.  The paper aids in explaining the method of 
TOC implementation in a continuously run concentrator plant.  The 5-focusing steps, as pioneered by Goldratt, are 
used to identify constraints that limit the performance of a concentrator plant.  In place of applying only the sequential 
TOC approach, the study uses a combination of existing improvement techniques with TOC.  The theory’s intended 
impacts on different sections of the concentrator were detected.

1. Introduction
Business organizations continually track and implement new management concepts as well as sprouting practices. 
While the Theory of Constraints (TOC) is no longer a new concept, up till now, it has not been extensively investigated 
by researchers, mainly with respect to its implementation characteristics.  TOC attracts managers due to its simplicity 
and often does not require any added investment.  It is a systematic method for improving manufacturing effectiveness 
focusing on identifying and removing constraints that limit throughput.  TOC has a strong customer focus approach 
and thus capable of transforming organizations.  The successful application of TOC tends to increase industrial 
capacity.  The theory can be used in manufacturing and services industries as well as in various managerial areas, such 
as: project management, quality management, information systems and others.  However, it is particularly prevalent 
in production planning.  TOC operates according to the principle that says ‘a chain is no stronger than its weakest 
link’.   
Mining is an important part of the South African economy and has been a driver of much development of the country 
(Mutemeri and Petersen 2002).  Until recently, it has been an essential pillar of strength for the South African economy. 
Mining has been on a gradual decline since the 2008 recession and the South African mining industry is yet to fully 
recover.  This has been aggravated by the current global pandemic crisis and so many mining companies have moved 
to ‘survival mode’.  The South African energy supply uncertainties have caused further instabilities to this industry. 
Hence, now more than ever, the South African mining industry is under persistent pressure.  Some of the previously

constraints.  A blend of practical improvement solutions ought to be rationally chosen in view of several criteria within 
the business environment.     
The production system studied has varied processes and so production processes require different capacities.  This is 
a multi-dependent one.  In order to control a bottleneck and to comprehend the diﬀerent capacities between processes, 
process engagement is necessary.   
The results show that the manufacturing system is extremely interconnected and exclusively intricate such that when 
applying TOC to it, a very adapted approach to bottleneck/ constraint identiﬁcation and improvement strategy is 
needed.  Gupta (2202), affirms that the real-world manufacturing environment is much more complex than that offered 
in literature.  Accordingly, the bottleneck limitation and other probable restrictions should be jointly well-thought-out 
when defining the target productivity for a system improvement.  This study contributes to production management 
theory by proposing an alternative way that reflects on variances in processes and capacity utilization when 
implementing TOC.  
A successful implementation of TOC and its thinking processes as a way to improve the productivity had been shown. 
However, there are challenges that peculiar to the mining industry and an adjusted TOC implementation process flow 
has been proposed.

Abstract  
Natural disasters are among the most destructive occurrences that pose a substantial risk to individuals, property, the 
economy, and so on. Flooding, which is produced by typhoons, monsoons, and excessive rainfall, is one of the most 
frequent natural disasters and has been one of the Philippines’ main concerns in recent years. The findings of the study 
will give information on the elements influencing flood disaster preparedness. An online survey questionnaire was 
deployed among Filipino participants to gather data pertinent to disaster preparedness through multiple regression. 
Results show that significant factors are Age (p-value = 0.000), Gender (p-value = 0.034), Province/City (p-value = 
0.000), Type of Residential Homes (p-value = 0.000), Risk Perception (RP) (p-value = 0.000), Media (M) (p-value = 
0.000), Personal Experience (PE) (p-value = 0.000), Perceived Severity (PS) (p-value = 0.000), Perceived 
Vulnerability (PV) (p-value = 0.000), Attitude toward the Behavior (ATB) (p-value = 0.000), Social Norms (SN) (p-
value = 0.000), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) (p-value = 0.000), and Intention to Follow (ITF) (p-value = 
0.000). The researchers were able to determine the perceived preventions of disaster preparedness and mitigation in 
the Philippines' flood-prone areas. This study has successfully provided findings that can be utilized by the academe 
or government leaders in implementing determining factors that may affect a person’s preparedness for flooding.

  Abstract 
In recent years the performance of most african capital markets has shown a downward trend, Zambia included. 
The Lusaka Stock Exchange stock price index performed the worst, dropping 26.83% in local currency by the end 
of 2016. This study sought to find out the effect of exchange rate on stock market capitalisation.  
The time sample that was used in this study was a yearly time series that span from 1994 to 2017, thus representing 
23 observations from each ZMW/USD exchange rate and market capitalisation. Multiple regression analysis was 
performed using the Johansen Cointegration test and the Vector Error Correction model (VECM), where market 
capitalisation was used as the dependent variable while Exchange rate, Inflation rate and GDP were used as the 
independent variables. All the findings were conducted to test whether F-test statistic hold at 5% level of 
significance and these were done using E-views, statistical software package.  
The probability rejection rule of p value < 0.05 indicating relationship between variables, the research results with 
a probability of 0.0416 and 0.0440 shows that there is a long run relationship between valuables. While the study 
also found a negative relationship between exchange rate and stock market capitalisation, that the coefficient of -
0.109843 indicates that the stock value decreases by 10.98 percent for any one percent depreciation of the Kwacha 
against the dollar. Hence, this suggests that the depreciation of the exchange rate negatively affects the 
performance of the Lusaka Stock market capitalisation. GDP also showed a negative effect of exchange rate on 
GDP implying that for any one percent depreciation of the currency, GDP decreases by -54.15879. The results for 
inflation rate also showed a negative relationship between exchange rate and inflation. Inflation rate of -20.7728 
showed a negative effect. If the currency depreciates by any one percent change, inflation changes by - 20.7728.. 
Therefore, this study recommends that the bank of Zambia, ministry of finance and mines to adopt policies that 
can lead to boosting the economy via an increase in productivity so as to ensure an increase in foreign exchange 
earnings in the country. These policies may include a predictable and non-discriminatory regulatory environment 
and an absence of undue administrative impediments to business more generally. Hence, ensuring that there is 
public sector transparency, which may include an impartial system of courts and law enforcement penned at 
redressing the tax system that could constitute eliminating barriers to attracting more firms to participate in the 
capital market. Generally, development in financial inclusion in the financial system will encourage both foreign 
and domestic capital flows. Therefore, the more foreign currency inflows in the country the better will be the 
performance of the stock market which will ultimately result in an increase of values all shares on the stock 
market.

1. Introduction
The development of capital market and its link to economic performance is of great importance to all countries 
across the globe. The performance of capital market is known to be an important economic driver and this largely 
attributed to the role of mobilising savings and investments. Since privatisation of the Zambian economy in the 
1990’s, capital markets has played a critical role in the provision of funds to investors. Today, the performance of 
Zambian capital markets has a broader perspective, partly due to the influence of ideas among policy makers. The 
consensus holds that Zambia needs a stable and efficient financial policy to achieve macroeconomic objective of 
economic growth shaped by the evolution of the capital market. To achieve this, the government is rigorously 
applying orthodox performance strategies with an emphasis on implementing strict financial policies. These

From table 6 and the VECM equation established, the positive constant shows that the stock market capitalisation 
increases by approximately 291.558 percent due to the influence of other factors not captured in the model. In the 
long run, the study found negative relationship between exchange rate and stock market capitalisation, that the 
coefficient of 0.109843 indicates that the stock value decreases by 10.98 percent for any one percent depreciation 
of the Kwacha against the dollar. 
5.2 Proposed Improvements  
This research does not exhaust all the independent variables that affect the performance of the stock market 
capitalisation. This research suggests that further studies should encompass other variables, such as foreign direct 
investment, Consumer Price Index (CPI), bonds, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables. The research 
also suggests that causality relationships can also be employed by other researchers.  
6. Conclusion
From the research conducted, the findings conclude that a negative and significant relationship between exchange 
rate and stock market capitalisation both in the long run exists. The coefficient of -0.109843 indicates that the 
stock value decreases by 10.98 percent for any one percent depreciation of the Kwacha against the dollar. The 
gross domestic product and inflation also shows a similar trend, GDP and Inflation decreases by -54.15879 and- 
20.7728 respectively showing a negative but significant relationship. Therefore, the study contributes to relevant 
existing theory and practice by advancing a proactive possible solution to the effect of exchange rate on stock 
market capitalisation. Hence, according to the results, there is need for a careful review of the tax system and 
policy administration in Zambia that could constitute eliminating barriers to attracting more firms to participate 
in the capital market. Generally, development in financial inclusion in the financial system will encourage both 
foreign and domestic capital flows. Therefore, the more foreign currency inflows in the country the better will be 
the performance of the stock market which will ultimately result in an increase of values all shares on the stock 
market.

Abstract  
The objective of the study is to determine the effect of procurement management on project performance as little 
research has been conducted on this topic regarding government institutions in Zambia. The researcher determined 
that Contract management at the Ministry of Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development (MIHUD) was not 
adequate as most of the respondents felt they had adequate training and personnel in contract management despite the 
project management challenges being faced by the Ministry in Zambia. A Quantitative research design was adopted. 
Primary data was collected using structured self-administered questionnaires on employees involved in the 
procurement and project management of public infrastructure. The constructs in this study were developed using 
measurement scales adopted from prior studies. The instrument was evaluated for reliability and validity. Quantitative 
data were analyzed to determine any statistical relationships that affect project performance due to procurement.  The 
Coding of data was done for ease of data interpretation. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 20. The result of this 
study showed that all the procurement management variables for the research have a significant effect on project 
performance. Procurement planning and bid solicitation had a positive correlation and contract management had a 
negative correlation based on the study’s findings. Finally, it was recommended to give due attention to all the stages 
of procurement management and give contract management training to both procurement staff and project managers. 
The researcher recommends future researchers consider a larger sample size, other variables that are not included in 
this study, and other government ministries and quasi-government institutions to get more reliable results.

carried out in time resulting in loss of disbursed funds. The analysis discovered that although the MIHUD had 
challenges in contract management of public infrastructure, most respondents agreed that political statements did 
affect how contracts responded to instructions. Most of them were reluctant to meet their contractual obligations and 
they felt there was no political will to fund the projects till completion. The failure to timely release funds on time by 
the Ministry of Finance impacted the projects negatively due to time value of money and costs associated with 
mobilizing and demobilizing. The MIHUD's Monitoring, and Evaluation system are not up to speed with the current 
state of projects and will need to improve on their project monitoring and evaluation systems. 
In view of the findings, the Ministry of Infrastructure Housing and urban Development need to ensure the procurement 
schedules are implemented and payments made within set timeframes. MIHUD also need to ensure right procurement 
personnel to achieve high efficiency in procurement management. Additionally, it was observed that there was 
significant information sharing on why procurement had stalled with the public due to the number of procurement 
related queries raised at PAC. Improved communication will result in less audit queries by the Auditor General’s 
office as most the raised queries are addressed at PAC. More so, the ministry should also need to invest in the capacity 
building and development.  Ministry staff as determined from the study do not value the relationship of contract 
management and project success. The Ministry of MIHUD cost the Zambian government resources due to lack of 
capacity in ensuring the contractor has submitted all guarantees in cases of default and there have been instances as 
raised in the Auditors General’s report of 2022 highlighting lack of any advance payment records making it difficult 
to recoup disbursed funds.

Abstract  
This study aims to explore the impact of digital transformation on behavior intention in the pension fund sector in 
Indonesia. To address this, a research model based on Technology Accepted Model (TAM) through 6 hypotheses is 
developed. The proposed research model and research model were tested with 780 pensioners in Indonesia and resulted 
in Trust not having an impact on behavior intention in digital platforms for pensioners while other hypotheses 
perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, mobility, customization, customer involvement,  are accepted. This 
research was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may give a significant factor in digital transformation 
in the pension sector. Need further investigation regarding trust does not positively impact behavior intention due to 
many studies resulting in a positive impact on TAM theory.

1. Introduction  
The Covid-19 crisis has given a positive impact like digital transformation acceleration in every aspect. Covid-19 has 
also given an impact on the insurance market where the total claim for life and health insurance sky-rocketed 
meanwhile the claim for travel insurance and vehicle insurance were decreasing. However, all insurance companies 
had undergone a change of system to interact with customers. Even now, while more than 90% of the market has been 
doing business remotely where they were directly impacted by Covid-19 in the context of attracting new customers or 
retaining existing customers (Itapro, 2020) restrictions that occurred have made the public able to adapt with various 
digital technology like payment system and other financial services that available online. It includes products, services, 
technologies, and infrastructures that make a person or a company to have online access to payment, savings, and 
credit facilities without having to visit bank branches or being face-to-face with financial service providers (Ozili, 
2018) 
Technological changes in the insurance industry are served and offered in various ways including how the companies 
interact with customers (Deloitte Digital, 2017 ; Zagorin, 2018). In several published reports, one of the most important 
technology developments in the life insurance industry is automation which is used to customize a claim settlement 
(Deloitte Digital, 2017 ; Zagorin, 2018). One of the state-owned enterprises (BUMN) that has been assigned to provide 
social insurance like pension program and personal retirement savings for civil servant and state officials, always 
strive to improve their services for their customers through various innovation, one of them being a transformation 
from offline service to digital service. It helps customer to submit their claim and payment of their pension fund online. 
 
2. Problem Statement  
Digital transformation has two functions that can make banking offers new services through an electronic platform 
(e.g. e-banking, virtual banking) and service point (e-branch, POS) and also decrease operational expenses due to the 
limitation of physical office and employees (Deng, Huang, & Cheng, 2019). One study shows the need for research 
from another banking sector to find out a generalized impact on senior-age customers (Rajaobelina et al, 2020). Digital 
transformation for senior-age customers definitely has a big impact on service quality due to a habit of onsite service, 
so the research on this topic is considered important to be done because senior-age customers might not be familiar",,"Proceedings of the 4th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations
