Abstract 
There are laws and rights aimed at people with disabilities, especially those with Mild Intellectual Disability (LDD), 
who actively participate in society but face barriers in learning and participating in various activities. In Colombia, 
where 1.3 million people with disabilities are registered, 16.8% correspond to the category of DIL, some of whom 
are part of the economically active population. Despite this, significant employment gaps persist. In order to address 
this gap, this research focuses on the analysis of the specific problems related to the labor inclusion of people with 
IDL in logistics environments, particularly in cold rooms. The aim is to prevent occupational hazards through the 
application of Industry 4.0 technologies. Through the collaboration of the Analytics and Design Research Seedbed, 
with entrepreneurs and experts in the field, significant challenges in labor inclusion in low-temperature environments 
were identified. The agile Scrum methodology was used to develop a prototype of an application that addresses these 
issues. This prototype meets the functional and non-functional requirements necessary to ensure the protection and 
prevention of risks for workers with DIL who perform functions in refrigerated rooms. This prototype manages to 
provide an inclusive alternative for people with disability Intellectual Light, challenging business cultural paradigms, 
by integrating mobile devices with Industry 4.0 technologies, encouraging greater interaction between machines and 
human beings, thus prioritizing the health and safety of employees in their daily activities.

Table 7. Application Development Description 
 
 
 
4.4 Prototype development with Balsamiq 
The development of the prototype was carried out using the Balsamiq tool, which allows for the rapid creation of user 
interfaces and interactive prototypes. The images and tables provided during the design phase were used to guide the 
implementation 
of 
the 
prototype. 
 
Iteration and Tweaking: The application of Scrum allowed for continuous iterations and tweaks based on the feedback 
received. Each module was developed separately, then integrated to form the complete prototype. 
Prototype Validation: Usability and functionality tests were performed to validate the prototype with the end user, 
the Scrum team, and stakeholders. It ensured that all functional and non-functional requirements were addressed 
effectively. 
 
4.5 Prototype Results and Evaluation 
After the implementation of the prototype in Balsamiq, the results obtained are evaluated. The tool allowed for a clear 
visual representation of the user interface and sequence of actions. The following are the main aspects evaluated: 
Usability: The ease of use of the interface was evaluated, considering accessibility for people with IDD. Core features 
such as facial recognition, emergency button, and pictogram interaction were found to be intuitive and easy to 
understand. Consistency with Requirements: Each module of the prototype was compared to the established 
functional and non-functional requirements. It was ensured that all required functionalities were present and that non-
functional aspects, such as usability and security, were satisfactorily met. Technology Integration: The effective 
integration of technologies such as facial recognition and RFID technology was verified. It ensured that these 
technologies contributed significantly to the improvement of labor management and safety in specific environments. 
 
5. Discussion and Conclusion 
The implementation of the Scrum methodology in the design of the prototype of the mobile application ""DILSA"" has 
generated significant results and effectively addresses the challenges identified in the labor inclusion of people with 
mild intellectual disabilities (DIL), particularly in specific environments such as refrigerated rooms. 
 
5.1 User-Centered Design 
The Scrum methodology, by focusing on ongoing collaboration with the stakeholder and support professionals, has 
ensured user-centered design. The participation of the Product Owner and the Scrum Team in the definition of 
requirements and the design by sections has allowed the application to be adapted to the specific needs of people with 
DIL. 
 
5.2 Adaptability and Flexibility 
The adaptability and flexibility inherent in Scrum has been instrumental in addressing the changing nature of the 
requirements and needs of people with DIL. The ability to make continuous adjustments during the design process 
has made it possible to create a prototype that fits the dynamics and diversity of the capabilities and skills of this user 
group. 
 
5.3 Integration of Industry 4.0 Technologies 
The design of the DILSA prototype integrates Industry 4.0 technologies, such as facial recognition using artificial 
intelligence, RFID technology for location and temperature monitoring, and a repository of pictograms that facilitate 
communication with people with IDD. This integration reflects the synergy between agile methodologies and cutting-

5.4 Impact on Labor Inclusion 
The DILSA app, when fully developed in 2024, has the potential to have a significant impact on the labor inclusion 
of people with DIL. The combination of functionalities such as facial recognition, real-time location and access to 
relevant 
information 
will 
contribute 
to 
creating

environments. 
 
5.5 Challenges and Ethical Considerations 
Although the DILSA prototype shows significant promise, there are significant challenges and ethical considerations. 
Data security and privacy, especially in work environments, need to be addressed holistically. In addition, it is 
essential to ensure that the application promotes the autonomy and dignity of people with IDL, avoiding 
stigmatization and promoting equal opportunities. 
 
6. Conclusions and Future Work 
In this article, the methodology used in the research was presented, highlighting the literary search, the round tables, 
and the application of Scrum in the design of the prototype of the DILSA mobile application. The results obtained 
demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in creating user-centered solutions adapted to the specific needs 
of people with IDL. In future stages, the actual development of the application will be carried out, considering the 
results and challenges obtained and discussed in this phase of the research process. The developed prototype 
represents a significant step towards the creation of a mobile application focused on the work management of people 
with Mild Intellectual Disabilities in specific work environments, such as refrigerated rooms. The app, called DILSA 
(Disability Intellectual Light Solution App), combines advanced technologies, such as facial recognition and RFID, 
with pictogram-based design approaches to improve accessibility and understanding for end users. The app addresses 
the specific challenges associated with DIL, such as adaptation in the work environment and the need for visual tools 
to facilitate learning and task completion. In addition, it focuses on complying with Colombian regulations related to 
the labor inclusion of people with disabilities. 
 
The results of the prototype evaluation indicate that the specific objectives and requirements set have been met, 
providing a solid basis for the future development of the complete mobile application. The Scrum methodology 
proved to be effective in managing a project of this nature, allowing for continuous adaptations and incremental 
deliveries. In conclusion, DILSA aspires not only to improve job opportunities for people with Mild Intellectual 
Disabilities, but also to promote a change in the business culture towards inclusion and the use of 4.0 technologies 
for the benefit of all sectors involved.

Abstract 
Tackling the reduction of carbon footprints in global supply chains presents a significant challenge for many 
companies, driven by tighter governmental emission standards and increasing environmental consciousness among 
consumers. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate carbon emissions considerations into supply chain management 
strategies. This work focuses on supply mode selection for a company that deals with a variety of products, each 
subject to periodic stochastic demand, with unfulfilled orders being backlogged. The products can be supplied through 
multiple distinct supply modes, each characterized by its own carbon emission levels, delivery speed, and cost 
implications. The company needs to allocate order quantities to each supply mode to minimize the costs associated 
with holding, backlogging, and purchasing, while also ensuring that the carbon emissions from these activities do not 
exceed a certain limit. We present a novel solution method for this problem, and benchmark it against other methods 
that are less sophisticated in a comprehensive numerical analysis.

Abstract 
Efficiency in companies is an important factor to calculate because it is the key number that makes it easier to have a 
clearer image of how the company works and what results its operation is providing, especially in companies in the 
commercial sector that always have constant on real time production, so they are constantly searching for new clients 
and new guidelines to compete with other companies in the same sector. In this research, the central problem identified 
is related to the efficiency of the production process, which originates mainly due to the lack of standard procedures, 
a correct order in the production area and the absence of adequate maintenance on the machine used in printing plastic 
bottles. With the aim of implementing a continuous improvement model, various lean methodologies will be applied, 
such as standardized work, SLP and autonomous maintenance along with various statistical tools that allowed us to 
reach the expected results. These techniques were implemented throughout two improvement cycles to optimize the 
production of plastic bottles and maximize efficiency, achieving important changes in the main KPIs outlined in our 
research going from 74% to 82% of efficiency during the labelling of the plastic bottles, giving us 9% more of the 
projected profits, reducing costs and increasing monthly sales. Therefore, this article seeks to determine what are the 
necessary improvements that must be implemented to increase productivity in the production area of a company in 
the commercial sector.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing in Peru contributed 12.4% of the country's Gross Domestic Product in 2022 and the plastics sector 
contributes 4% to the manufacturing industry, it concentrates 13.2% of formal private employment, according to 
information from the Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE) website, being the third activity that 
generates the most jobs after the Commerce and Services sectors. In a context of pandemic that has negatively affected 
economic growth in the manufacturing sector, with a decrease of 11.2% in the last year and the bankruptcy of many 
companies due to the partial paralysis of the national economy, it is essential that companies become more competitive 
and survive in a market affected by the continuous effects of the health emergency. 
The company on which we will focus the research is part of the commercial sector and was founded in 1999. It has 
more than 20 years in the market, leader in the development and market of school supplies, household items, balloons 
and party items, whose objective is to always exceed the expectations of their customers with quality, innovative 
products and the excellent service that characterizes them. 
The main activities that this company carries out are the import of home’s products and school supplies.

5. Discussion and Conclusion 
As evidenced by the financial flow, revenue was calculated based on the average number of customers projected for 
the first month, as observed in the field during the month of October. In addition, it is estimated that the number of 
customers will gradually increase month-on-month by 0.90% as the proposal is implemented. 
 
By calculating the Net Present Value (NPV), it was assessed whether the investment in the project was favorable or 
if, on the contrary, investment was not recommended. The NPV yielded a value of 5,576,532, which is greater than 
zero, indicating that the project will generate a higher return than the opportunity cost of the funds invested. 
 
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was also calculated, which reached a value of 197%, meaning that it exceeds the 
opportunity cost. Regarding the Benefit/Cost indicator, a value of 64.22 was obtained, and since it is higher than 1, it 
is concluded that the project's income will exceed the expenses. 
 
Finally, as far as the Payback Period is concerned, this indicator determines the time needed for the company to recoup 
its investment. In this case, the S/4,730 invested will be recovered in a certain number of days (Table 6).

After the respective studies and having applied the engineering tools, our efficiency will increase by 9%, which will 
positively impact our sales, also increasing our operating profit, generating a very good impact on the company's 
finances, also taking into account This is still recovering from the year 2020, 2021 and 2022 where its sales fell to 
negative since schools did not attend in-person classes so parents did not buy plastic bottles or any school supplies. 
Therefore, in addition to the fact that the company was already in recovery, our improvements have encouraged it to 
be strengthened and consolidated. 
 
In summary, the SLP tool as such and the reorganization of the area that was carried out, favored the new order and 
how the operators were organized to carry out their tasks since the scope they had improved their times. 
On the other hand, the manuals and training implemented under standardized work tools have complemented the 
operators with years of experience in the company and the new income that has come to the company to support with 
the campaign and with the orders that arrive during these months of the year. 
 
Finally, the Autonomous Maintenance tool has allowed the machines used to stop fewer times during a workday and 
this makes work more fluid, more plastic bottles are produced during a work hour and therefore more boxes come out. 
a day, thus fulfilling more work orders and meeting the needs of the main clients of the largest retailers in the country. 
It should be considered in future research or when the subject is dealt with more thoroughly, perhaps to try new tools 
or even an attempted sand run or some simulation program of the thermal transmission machine.  
 
Also, it should be recommended that the company improve the issue of soils as it limits help with the issue of the 
redistribution of its production area, in addition to being a time bomb with respect to rollover type accidents. On the 
part of this study, it could be improved with respect to the time that has been given to this report, since probably with 
a little more time invested, more information could have been collected and more staff trained, which would have 
made them even more efficient. 
 
It is recommended that, in future projects based on this or similar development, key performance indicators (KPIs) 
should be continuously monitored to assess the efficiency of production areas and detect possible improvements in

logistics processes. Since it is virtually impossible to maximize the efficiency of industrial and logistics processes 
completely, there will always be scope for optimization, and an area conducive to its implementation would be to 
improve efficiency in labelling areas. 
 
It is recommended to carry out a case analysis in related sectors, as in Peru there are not many examples of application 
of methods such as autonomous maintenance, standardized work and SLP in companies engaged in the manufacture 
of plastics or other manufacturing industries. Carrying out studies in companies in these sectors would allow us to 
gather valuable information on how these methods have been put into practice and what the results have been. It is 
essential to conduct a detailed analysis of the difficulties encountered, the solutions implemented, and the 
achievements made in these related industries. 
 
Finally, it is good to mention that the methods and tools used in this research could be used as references for companies 
in other sectors such as mass consumption, construction, health, production and transportation and logistics.

Abstract 
This research project focuses on enhancing manufacturing efficiency through the application of Master Production 
Schedule (MPS), KAIZEN, and Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) tools. The company's initial efficiency level 
of 58.8% is attributed to factors such as a lack of trained personnel, absence of a requirements plans, and wastage of 
raw materials, primarily due to insufficient inputs during production. To address these issues, the project measured 
key indicators such as efficiency level, effective production hours, and raw material waste. The engineering tools 
MPS, KAIZEN, and SMED were then employed to create a production and supply tool, implement training plans for 
operators to reduce losses and reprocessing, and redesign the workshop layout to decrease production times and 
achieve line production. During the initial two months of implementation (August and September 2023), the project 
successfully increased the average production efficiency to 76.79%, reduced raw material waste to 2.11 kg per day on 
average, and extended the effective production time to 7.08 hours per day. The economic benefits of the project were 
realized, with a 6-month projection demonstrating positive results. In a pessimistic scenario, the net present value 
(NPV) was only $1487.38 lower than without project implementation. In a normal scenario, the project yielded 
impressive results, including an NPV of $15 385.67, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 69%, a benefit-cost ratio (B/C) 
of 4.5, and a payback period of one month and 15 days.

1. Introduction
In Peru, the textile and clothing sector is very important despite being strongly hit by everything that the pandemic 
meant, since it is the third with the highest participation in the manufacturing GDP of our country in 2019. The industry 
generates approximately 400 thousand jobs in 2019, representing 2.3% of the working population in our country. It is 
worth mentioning that companies in the textile sector are almost entirely SMEs, which on many occasions do not have 
production plans or training for workers to be able to carry out their work in the most efficient way possible, while 
only 0.1% of Companies in this sector are considered medium and large companies IEES (2021). Furthermore, this 
study revealed the great pain that occurs in the industry's SMEs in Peru, limiting their development and growth, with 
the main problems being the lack of trained personnel, the lack of a requirements plan, and waste of raw materials in 
production. In this research, the aforementioned problems were addressed through the implementation and use of the 
MPS, KAIZEN and SMED tools. 
The average efficiency in the textile sector is 75.8% IEES (2021), in addition, SME type companies do not carry out 
projects using Lean tools, in fact it can be identified that many of these do not They have a training plan for the

The purchase of fabrics and different inputs for the production of the garments was made, as seen in Figure 15, thanks 
to the data obtained in the tool, which will result in a more complete warehouse and thus not present stock breaks that 
prevent regular production. 
 
For the use of the Kaizen tool, the training schedule was taken, which consisted of five stages: Identification of 
weaknesses and opportunities, strategy planning and guidelines, staff training, implementation workshop, start-up and 
performance evaluation and impacts. 
 
For the first phase, the staff was met to measure the weak points, where the number of poles reprocessed due to 
operator errors per month and the number of poles reprocessed due to operator errors per month were identified. Then, 
together with the General Manager, planning and strategy guidelines were made to achieve the expected objectives. 
Subsequently, on-site personnel are trained in the processes and effective use of semi-automatic machinery. 
 
Regarding the tool SMED, by analyzing the entire production process, opportunities for improvement in 
manufacturing times were found considering all the activities of the process, shown in the Figure 15: 
 
 
 
Figure 15. SMED tool template 
 
5.3 Discussion 
At the end of the implementation, it was possible to see that efficiency by applying these tools increased, as mentioned 
by Villafana, I. (2022), thanks to the MPS it was possible to determine the capacity of the equipment and have better 
planning of the requirements, knowing what quantity of each input is needed to produce the estimate, by being able 
to know this we were able to manage production and demand planning, managing to generate an improvement in 
efficiency to 73% in the first month of implementation and 80% in its second month, being able to verify that MPS 
helps us improve production efficiency, likewise, having better planning and avoiding stock breaks helped us increase 
effective production hours to around 7 hours. 
 
For the KAIZEN application, Dasgupta et al. (2023), increases efficiency in this implementation by training the 
personnel of the textile workshop to ensure that they carry out their activities better and faster, thanks to this it was 
possible to develop training for the company's personnel, reducing the waste of raw materials to 2.18 kg per day of 
production. 
 
6. Conclusion 
At first it was found that the company had a very low level of efficiency, being 17% below the technical gap of the 
industry, so a diagnosis was made that shows a lack of planning in production and in the supply of materials, which 
generated stops in production due to stock outages, at the same time, by not having prior planning, the operators, in 
coordination with the sales team, had to plan on the fly, taking away production time cash.  
 
On the other hand, after seeing the results of the implementation of the pilot test, during the months of August and 
September, of the tools to improve the manufacturing process, it can be concluded that with the implementation an 
improvement was achieved in the level of efficiency. An average of 8% raw material waste (5.5% less) and effective 
production time (5.2% more) was achieved. Furthermore, by obtaining results of the indicators above those expected, 
we can conclude that the project generates economic benefits for the company, by increasing the level of efficiency 
by 17%.

Abstract 
The present investigation centers on examining the epidemiological pattern of the COVID-19 pathogen within the 
jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study places particular emphasis on the environmental variables and 
healthcare. The study utilizes a combination of objective approaches, spatial analysis techniques, and statistical 
models. The utilization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and statistical software is prevalent in analyzing 
data and creating maps to identify spatial patterns and variations in COVID-19. In addition, the study uses artificial 
intelligence and advanced technology to explore the relationship between access to medical services and the viral 
epidemiological curve. The examination of the geographical distribution of COVID-19 infections indicates that there 
are spatial discrepancies among different regions. Areas with high infection rates, such as Riyadh, Makkah Al-
Mukarramah, and the Eastern Province, exhibit concentrations of cases exceeding 100,000. Moderate infection rates 
are observed in regions like Medina and Asir, while lower rates are found in the northern and southern parts of the 
Kingdom. The findings of hot spot analysis further confirm the concentration of COVID-19 in the central region of 
the Kingdom, while cold spots are identified in the northern and southern areas. These spatial patterns provide insights 
into the distribution and intensity of the virus across the country. The study shows the Kingdom's initiatives to restore 
economic activity and sustainably, including prioritizing essential goods and services, directing government spending 
to the most affected sectors, and leveraging national talent. These efforts have contributed to the Kingdom's economic 
recovery and growth. The result of the study provides important insights into the dynamics of the virus. It can be a 
basis for making informed decisions regarding public health interventions and recovery efforts.

Abstract 
In the supply chain, every logistic process is important, from the beginning of the production process until the product 
reaches the final customer, but one of the most relevant is the storage of these products, because if there is not an 
adequate storage or an inadequate control of SKUs, this can generate a very large loss at an economic level in the 
company. In this scientific article a diagnosis of a logistics operator which distributes and stores pharmaceutical 
products was made, in this diagnosis it was detected that there were certain deficiencies in the processes of receiving 
and picking and could be made an implementation of tools to optimize these same within the operator. The selected 
tools were a WMS, barcode, HandHeld and ringscanner; with these tools the times in the logistics activities mentioned 
above improved significantly, increasing productivity in time and giving the company greater responsiveness in orders 
and control of all SKUs, evidenced by a simulation in the software ""Arena"".

1. Introduction
1.1 Objectives
General objective: To make an improvement proposal to reduce logistics process times by systematizing the
warehouse in a logistics operator.
Specific objectives:
•
Objective 1: Develop the background and state of the art of a logistics operator to improve times in receiving
and picking.
•
Objective 2: To develop a diagnosis of the problem by means of a Pareto diagram.
•
Objective 3: Design and develop a proposed solution based on the systematization of the warehouse.
•
Objective 4: Validate the solution in terms of time reduction in reception and picking processes, economic
viability, and its impact on workers.
2. Literature Review
For article selection, searches were conducted in English, using the keywords ""Inventory AND warehouse,"" ""Picking,"" 
""Reception,"" ""Reduce AND Time,"" and ""systematization."" All articles were sourced from the SCOPUS and EBSCO

2. During package inspection, an operator is utilized, with the inspection time following a normal distribution 
with a mean of 15 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. 
3. An attribute was set to determine how many products passed quality inspection, using a discrete 
distribution of DISC(0.8,1,1,2), where 1 represents accepted orders and 2 represents rejected orders, thus 
indicating which orders proceed to the next registration process and which remain in the reception area. 
4. Scanning of boxes is initiated following package inspection, with scanning time following a normal 
distribution with a mean of 20 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. This activity is performed by 
a group of 3 operators and 3 scanners, marking the conclusion of this segment within the overall model for 
order reception and registration time (Figure 4). 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Simulation model for the reception 
 
For the shelving area, the following configuration was decided upon (Figure 5): 
1. An activity where product data is entered into the system, processing 20 entries at a time. This task takes 
time following a normal distribution with a mean of 8 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes. The 
information is also input into the WMS for further processing and to facilitate product location within the 
warehouse. This activity takes time following a normal distribution with a mean of 5 minutes and a standard 
deviation of 2 minutes. 
2. For the picking process, the same tool is utilized. Orders arrive every 2 hours throughout a day, within an 8-
hour shift over 6 days. Upon receiving the order, the picking list is printed, taking time following a normal 
distribution with a mean of 5 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes. Subsequently, the operators 
review the optimal route according to the WMS for picking the required products, which takes them 5 
minutes. Once the route is established, the 3 operators retrieve their baskets for picking, which takes them an 
average time of 20 minutes. 
3. The same 3 operators then pack everything into a box and proceed with the packaging process, which takes 
time following a normal distribution with a mean of 10 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes. 
 
 
Figure 5. Simulation model for the shelving area 
 
5.4 Validation 
The proposed hypothesis was that the productivity of receiving and picking would increase by more than 10%. As a 
result, it was found that for the receiving area, both activities improved their productivity by 58%, and for the 
shelving area, it increased by 38% compared to the pre-implementation levels of these tools. 
Here is a table displaying the proposed results (Table 6):

In this table, you can observe the ""As Is"" times collected before implementing the mentioned tools, and the ""To Be"" 
times after the implementation of the tools. These ""To Be"" scenario results reflect that productivity would not only 
improve in the time taken to perform logistics activities but also in monetary terms, as there would be a capacity to 
handle almost double the number of orders per day in both the reception area and the shelving area (Figure 6). 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Value proposition 
 
The image shown above describes the improvements that would be achieved with the proposed model for the first 
tool, which would be the WMS. This would help to streamline productivity in the warehouse picking process. Next 
is the implementation of the barcode, which helps to speed up the item reception process, making registration faster 
and less laborious. 
 
6. Conclusion  
It can be concluded that implementing the mentioned tools in the article results in a significant improvement in 
reception and picking times. Additionally, operators do not need to exert extra effort or work overtime to meet the 
demand of daily orders. An effective solution design was achieved through systematization, meeting productivity KPI 
standards with improvements of 58% and 38% in each process, quantitatively substantiating the enhancements. 
Regarding time analysis, due to the company's restrictive schedule, a larger dataset couldn't be obtained for a more 
precise time average, which could lead to better results. For future work, focus should be placed on better time analysis 
and the recreation of a simulation for even greater accuracy in potential improvements.

Abstract 
The surface water at Pattensen, Turkeyen, Guyana (South America) was tested for the presence of heavy metal cations 
and anions, electrical conductivity, EC, turbidity and salinity in the presence and absence of an adsorbent, ground 
coconut midrib in its uncarbonized state. Metal Cations tested for were: Fe3+ and Al3+, Anions tested for were PO43- 
and NO3-. Other parameters evaluated was free chlorine.   The adsorbent, prior to be used was ground, extracted with 
hexane and subjected to drying. The coconut midrib in its uncarbonised state,  was effective in extracting Fe, Free 
chlorine, Al3+, PO43- and NO3-. Salinity also decreased. For example, the status of the surface water prior to the use of 
the adsorbent was: Al3+ : 0.689mg/L; PO43-: 0.90mg/L; NO3-: 10.18mg/L; Salinity; 0.01mg/L.  For the water treated 
with the absorbent, the respective concentrations were: Fe: 0.01mg/L; Free Chlorine: 0.00mg/L; Al: 0.20mg/L; PO43-
: 0.40mg/L and NO3-: 4.56mg/L. Salinity was registered at 0.0 mg/L. Thus, the adsorbent in its uncarbonized state, 
was effective in removing cationic and anionic pollutants from the selected surface water.

Abstract 
Sargassum, though commonly called a seaweed, is a macroalgae originating in the mid-Atlantic that affects Caribbean 
coastlines, generating an environmental, economic, and social crisis as it washes up on shores. This article aims to 
highlight the complexity of the issue and the need to address it in a multidisciplinary way. To best address this issue, 
a collaboration between academia, government, industry, and society is needed. To support industry efforts, this article 
highlights various studied uses for the seaweed, including its use as an ingredient in fertilizers, cosmetics, and as a 
source for terpenes, which can be used in the creation of various synthetic polymers. In this sense, the sargassum 
problem could be converted into a source of valuable resources. However, the constant arrival of sargassum to beaches 
has negatively affected local economies as it can make an area undesirable for tourism. Due to the large scale of the 
issue, it can be hard to mitigate. In the Dominican Republic and Mexico, for example, the governments developed 
monitoring systems to help prepare early responses to the problem. This paper aims to present an initial framework 
that can be used in future research when addressing the issue of Sargassum in the Caribbean, broadly covering most 
of the problems it causes, government and non-government management solutions, and possible uses that are being 
developed for how to deal with it.

1. Introduction
Sargassum seaweed is a complex environmental issue that requires a multidisciplinary response in order to fully 
address. More in-depth studies regarding the origin, life cycle, and effects on coastal ecosystems is still needed to 
understand the extent of the problem. In response, various governments have developed programs for early detection 
of incoming seaweed clusters to provide early and accurate information to allow for effective decision-making. In this 
sense, the challenge comes to the integration of scientific knowledge, technological abilities, and environmental needs 
in order to address this international issue. In Mexico, a collaborative multi-sector effort is expected to achieve 
commercialization by the end of 2024 (Peters, et al., 2023). 
Sargassum is currently a heavily discussed topic in regard to Caribbean beaches. As the seaweed’s growth has become 
unrestrained due to climate change, as ocean temperatures rise and other meteorological and oceanographic changes 
have created very favorable conditions to foster the sargassum’s growth (Secretaría de Marina, 2016). Based on the 
findings by the Gulf of Mexico Research Consortium (CIGoM), most of the algae affecting the Caribbean comes from 
clumps that branch off the Sargasso Sea, a region of the Atlantic Ocean to the west of Bermuda, with an approximate 
area of over 4 million km2, where the algae float en masse on the surface. Just like Sargassum is not actually a seaweed, 
the Sargasso Sea is not actually a se. it is a region of the ocean enclosed by the North Atlantic Current, the Canary 
Current, the North Atlantic Equatorial Current, and the Gulf Stream, which form a closed clockwise loop which 
encloses the area. This ocean gyre has also been found to recently be in a weakened state, which further contributes 
to the release of algae clusters (Smeed, et al., 2018).

Abstract 
Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in increasing productivity across various applications, yet concerns 
about their security persist. We defined a novel research area for LLM security – grey box testing, which involved 
adjustments of partially known information about LLMs, i.e. parameters such as temperature. This is the first 
investigation on the impact of temperature on LLM security, more specifically, jailbreaking. Jailbreak prompts, 
concatenated with inappropriate questions, were sent into top-performing open-source LLMs – Vicuna, Llama 2, and 
Mistral, with benchmarking against ChatGPT. Experiments were repeated over 5 temperature points: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 
0.75 and 1.0, revealing a strong correlation between temperature and jailbreaking success. An increase in temperature 
generally results in higher jailbreaking success for Llama 2 and ChatGPT, and the converse is true for Vicuna and 
Mistral. We revised our hypothesis such that LLMs with low jailbreak success rate at 0 temperature are more 
vulnerable to jailbreaking as temperature increases, while LLMs with high jailbreak success rate at 0 temperature are 
less susceptible to jailbreaking as temperature rises. This research emphasises the importance of cautious usage of 
open-source LLMs and highlights the need for further research under grey box settings in other areas including data 
extraction and hallucinations.

1. Introduction
The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has skyrocketed over the past year, with more than 180 million users 
in ChatGPT alone (Duarte 2023). These models are trained on vast amounts of textual data from the Internet to produce 
coherent responses for tasks such as question answering, summarisation, and translation (Zhao et al. 2023). Moreover, 
the recent shift to multimodal instruction-tuned LLM models like Macaw-LLM (Lyu et al. 2023) and GPT-4 (OpenAI 
2023a) involves incorporating image, video, and audio data in the training process. With such capabilities, LLMs are 
increasingly being used for many real-world applications, such as education (University of Illinois 2023), finance 
(Kopyl 2023) and healthcare (Kennedy 2023). As enticing as LLMs are, training and achieving state-of-the-art models 
from scratch can cost millions of dollars (Li 2020). Consequently, organizations may opt for open-source LLMs as a 
more cost-effective alternative to their commercially available counterparts (Hu et al. 2023). However, the growing 
dependence on LLMs has sparked privacy and security concerns. One such issue is ‘jailbreaking’, a process where

Abstract 
This research aims to present a base literature exploration study on the existing relationship between the development 
of deep learning-based assembly assistance systems to promote quality assurance and quality control in industrial 
assembly lines. The use of artificial intelligence in industry has become more common with the advance of Industry 
4.0. Understanding that quality assurance is a difficult term to describe and evaluate in industrial contexts due to the 
difficulty of measurement methods and their limitations, an artificial intelligence approach may lead to total quality 
control within an assembly process by checking every step and every product assembled within a process. This study 
aims to understand how to develop an augmented intelligence-based assembly assistance system to guarantee the 
quality of a product during the assembly process.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence is a term used to describe computational systems used to automate human intellectual 
activities,focusing on problems without an algorithmic solution (Bezerra et al., 2023; Luger, 2009). The term has two 
main divisions: machine learning, a group of techniques that use supervised learning to develop the activities and deep 
learning, techniques that create algorithms to mimic human brain functioning (Data Science Academy, 2022). 
Recently, data-driven approaches based on Machine Learning algorithms and models have increasingly been used (de 
Queiroz et al., 2023). Also, the use of  AI has become more common in daily activities and within the development of 
intelligent manufacturing systems (Bezerra et al., 2023).  
The use of artificial intelligence techniques in quality assurance can permit a more efficient and more trustful approach 
to collect data for a quality control system since, in a practical situation, a traditional measurement model may not 
track a defect if its occurrence is not great enough in a set of products (Bezerra et al., 2023; Thamm et al., 2020a; 
Toledo et al., 2014). Focusing on assembly lines, the use of the Assembly Assistance System (AAS) for error 
prevention is a way to guarantee the quality of a product’s assembly process, especially within low operator 
qualification contexts (Thamm et al., 2020b).

Abstract 
The present research identifies the issue posed by the lack of a standardized and efficient process in the cutting area 
of a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise in the textile-fashion sector in Peru. In an effort to address this challenge, the 
Single Minute Exchange of Die methodology was leveraged to enhance productivity by reducing waste associated 
with changeover times, manifesting as bottlenecks. Additionally, support was provided through other Lean 
Manufacturing tools such as 5S and SPP to propose areas for improvement that reinforce the implementation of the 
aforementioned technique. The results demonstrated a productivity increase of 39.36% in the area, transitioning from 
an average capacity of handling 3.45 orders per day to achieving a daily average capacity of up to 4.81 orders.

The Textile and Garment subsector plays a significant role in our country's manufacturing sector, as evidenced by its 
contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2019, this subsector accounted for 6.4% of the share in the 
manufacturing GDP, ranking third in terms of contribution. 
Furthermore, according to estimates from the Textile and Garment Committee of the SNI (2021), the Textile and 
Garment subsector generates approximately 400,000 annual jobs and represented 26.2%, equivalent to 2.3% 
nationally, of the manufacturing workforce in Peru in 2019. This subsector also has important links with other sectors 
or industries, such as agriculture, livestock, manufactured fibers, chemicals, and plastics, generating around 900,000 
indirect jobs in the economy. 
The textile sector contributes to the Peruvian economy not only to meet domestic demand but also generates income 
through exports. According to COMEX (2022), figures from SUNAT, in January 2022, Peruvian textile exports 
reached a value of US$ 132.9 million, representing a 31.1% increase compared to the same month in 2021 and a 33.3% 
increase compared to January 2020. This export figure at the beginning of the year sets a historical record in terms of

promotion of procedure standardization. This leads to a reduction in variability, reflects higher product quality, and 
decreases waste generation. 
 
Next, a flowchart, Figure 5, was modeled depicting how the activities of the cutting process should be carried out after 
applying SMED. With the assistance of this flowchart, the collaborators were trained to simulate the utilization of this 
new process and the necessary sequence. In this way, the timing of all the activities undergone by any entity was 
recorded, enabling a performance comparison.

6. Conclusion 
Initially, the company's current state was evaluated using a problem tree analysis, enabling the identification of root 
causes and initiating the diagnostic process leading to improvement proposals. This analysis pinpointed low 
production efficiency issues caused by delays in fabric roll inspection, piece labeling, and bag removal from the cutting 
area. 
 
The SMED methodology was applied via simulation using the Arena program, resulting in optimal outcomes after 30 
iterations. This process showcased reduced total production time per order through decreased setup times, achieved 
by transitioning external activities to internal ones. Additionally, productivity increased, reaching 3.45 garments/day 
without SMED and 4.81 garments/day with SMED. 
 
Moreover, two key performance indicators, machine efficiency and operator saturation during non-machine time and 
internal activities, were evaluated to assess the tool's efficacy. Machine efficiency approached 100%, while operator 
saturation indicated enhanced resource utilization, with an increase of up to 39.43%. 
 
Economically, three indicators were examined: NPV, indicating project profitability when exceeding 0; IRR, with a 
value of 719%, suggesting project acceptance due to its positive value; and the Benefit-Cost ratio, resulting in a value 
of 25, confirming the project's viability by demonstrating that benefits outweigh costs. 
 
In terms of applicability to similar textile companies, our study's findings highlight the potential for enhancing 
efficiency and productivity through SMED implementation. By addressing common challenges such as setup time

reduction and resource optimization, other companies in the industry can potentially achieve comparable 
improvements in their production processes. 
 
However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of our study, including restricted access to company 
information. Future research directions could focus on expanding data accessibility, exploring long-term sustainability 
of implemented improvements, and investigating the applicability of SMED in diverse textile manufacturing contexts. 
Additionally, ongoing research efforts could delve into refining SMED methodologies and strategies to address 
emerging challenges and opportunities within the industry.

Abstract 
Innovation can be considered a factor that drives economic growth at the territorial level, which is why there has been 
a search for operationalizing the concept of innovation through the measurement of innovative performance in 
systems. Recent studies have focused on summarizing the current measurement instruments applied in countries or 
industries, focusing on briefly presenting their themes and characteristics. In this sense, the aim of this work is to 
present a literature review on the measurement of innovative performance, exploring and classifying the antecedents, 
methodologies, application contexts, possible impact on the technological gap, and commonly measured dimensions 
that define innovation in terms of measurement. The results allow us to observe the relevance of the mentioned topic, 
and consequently, the opportunity to expand existing knowledge in future research.

1. Introducción
En las últimas décadas, el concepto de innovación ha adquirido un rol protagónico en el discurso académico, 
empresarial y político, dada su capacidad indiscutible para impulsar el crecimiento económico, el desarrollo sostenible 
y la competitividad global, originado en los inicios de la segunda revolución industrial, y formalmente introducido 
por Joseph Schumpeter en 1911 y 1912, así las cosas, el término ""innovación"" ha evolucionado desde su concepción 
inicial centrada en la mejora e introducción de productos, servicios y procesos, hacia una noción ampliamente 
multidimensional que permea todos los sectores de la sociedad (Schumpeter, 1911). Esta transformación refleja no

The BOM is structured hierarchically, breaking down the product into assemblies, sub-assemblies, and individual 
parts, each with a unique part number and name. Level 0 represents the complete product, the DualFan Clothes Hanger. 
Level 1 includes the Final Assembly, which is a higher-level assembly consisting of various sub-assemblies and parts. 
Levels 2 and 3 include sub-assemblies like the Structural Assembly, Functional Assembly, and Electrical Assembly, 
and parts such as the Frame, Main Rod, Hooks, Rotational Hinges, and others. These levels are further broken down 
into individual components that are either manufactured represented by ""Make"" or purchased represented by ""Buy"". 
Each entry in the BOM also has details such as Drawing Number, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Make or Buy decision, 
Risk classification (High, Medium, Low), and Compliance standards (ASTM, UL, FCC, FDA, ANSI). The Risk 
Classification indicates the criticality of each part or assembly, where ‘High’ denotes essential components whose 
failure would cause significant issues, ‘Medium’ for important but not critical components, and ‘Low’ for components 
not critical for functionality. The Compliance indicates the standards and regulations that each component must adhere 
to, such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials), UL (Underwriters Laboratories), FCC (Federal 
Communications Commission), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and ANSI (American National Standards 
Institute). 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
5.1 Numerical Results  
In the numerical analysis section of the report for a fanned clothes hanger, the team conducted critical structural 
evaluations. The buckling analysis determined that the ABS plastic hanger, with dimensions of 51 cm by 3.6 cm by 
14 cm, could withstand a significant critical load before buckling, calculated using Euler's formula. This high critical 
buckling load suggests that the hanger has a low probability of buckling under typical usage scenarios. The beam 
bending analysis revealed the hanger's resilience to bending under load. By calculating the bending moment and the 
resulting stress using standard beam theory equations, the team confirmed that the maximum bending stress and 
deflection were within acceptable limits. The stress was found to be approximately 2.8 MPa, and the deflection was 
minor at about 1.2 mm under the considered loading condition, which ensures the hanger's structural performance 
under expected use conditions.The safety factor, a crucial measure of design reliability, was computed by comparing 
the yield strength of the material to the maximum bending stress. The resulting safety factor was approximately 14.29, 
indicating a highly conservative design. This high factor of safety implies that the hanger is capable of handling loads 
far greater than those it is likely to encounter during normal operation, providing a substantial margin to account for 
uncertainties in load estimates, material behavior, and unforeseen usage conditions (Figure 6).

5.2 Proposed Improvements  
Here the future work includes enhancement of the time it takes for the fan to dry clothes and shoes. It is needed that 
the team perform analysis and create the prototype to verify the design requirements which is in progress. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The presented senior design capstone project has innovatively designed a travel accessory designed for individuals 
who wear the same clothes regularly, such as for work, daily life, or school. Unlike traditional bulky closet-sized 
alternatives on the market, this product caters to the needs of those with an active lifestyle, providing a convenient 
and compact solution. It helps get rid of any sweat residue overnight on top wears or shoes, that might turn into mold 
from the humid environment. Keeping garments and shoes dry and germs-free avoids any smells that usually get into 
them. Currently, the prototype of the project is manufactured and fabricating the final product is in progress by the 
team.

Abstract 
The tourism sector in South Africa has experienced significant adverse consequences owing to the COVID-19 
pandemic. As the economy begins to reopen, guest houses are concentrating on enhancing their facilities to attract 
more tourists. This study examines the factors that impact holidaymakers when selecting accommodations on the 
South Coast. To conduct this research, data were gathered from TripAdvisor.com and through two unstructured 
interviews. ATLAS. ti software was used to analyze a total of 186 reviews and interview data. The study revealed that 
the provision of amenities such as air conditioning, private beach access, interconnected rooms, safety, microwaves, 
refrigerators, cable/satellite TV, walk-in showers, 24-hour security, and free parking significantly influences the 
customer experience. Moreover, the quality of service provided by guest houses plays a crucial role in customer 
satisfaction. However, this study had certain limitations, including its design and data collection methods. It is 
suggested that guest houses recognize and effectively manage service quality to ensure customer satisfaction and 
loyalty.

1. Introduction
The tourism industry worldwide has experienced a substantial impact owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 
tourism sector in South Africa identified as one of the most severely affected regions (Rogerson and Rogerson, 2020; 
Assefa, 2023). During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the South African government implemented strict lockdown 
measures to curb the spread of the virus. These measures were in line with international trends, and resulted in a 
decline in tourism activities. Unfortunately, many businesses, regardless of size, had to close their doors, lay off staff, 
and sell assets to stay afloats. The global pandemic has resulted in a decline in economic growth and employment 
prospects, especially among individuals engaged in informal industries in the Global South, such as South Africa. The 
tourism industry, which plays a major role in the South African economy, has experienced substantial repercussions 
as a result of the ongoing pandemic. International travel restrictions and concerns regarding virus transmission have 
resulted in a decrease in the number of tourists visiting South Africa, particularly the South Coast region. This has led 
to a significant reduction in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and disruptions in the supply chain of the tourism 
sector. 
The worldwide outbreak has also affected the behavior and intentions of individuals who engage in holiday travel. 
During the initial phase of the pandemic, a research investigation was conducted in South Korea, wherein it was 
observed that the perception of the risk associated with COVID-19 had a significant impact on individuals' behavioral 
intentions, which gave rise to ""untact"" tourism. The term ""untact tourism” refers to the type of tourism where physical

When deciding on a place to stay, tourists consider the comments of people who have visited the area to be very 
important. The review mentioned, “If you are from outside of South Africa, it is recommended to shop around and be 
cautious, especially during tough economic times. Some establishments take advantage of foreign visitors. It is best 
to read reviews and do your research before making a decision”. 
 
Feedback from the customer shows that changes in weather conditions did not affect their stay. Even though the 
weather was not good, the stay was enjoyable, nice room, good service, and breakfast could do with more diversity. 
(How about a few slices of cheese for the continental breakfast) All in all, we have nothing else to ""complain"" about 
- so that must be good. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
During the study, it was found that customers' experience with a guesthouse is greatly influenced by the amenities 
provided by the property, such as air conditioning, a private beach, interconnected rooms, a safe microwave, 
refrigerator, cable or satellite TV, and walk-in showers. These findings are consistent with the work of Andika and 
Baiquni (2021), who listed free parking, high-speed Internet, a swimming pool, free breakfast, and 24-hour security 
as factors that contribute to customer experience. During the study's interview, a participant revealed that customers 
nowadays prefer to have access to functional Internet so that they can work while on vacation. This implies that 
property owners should ensure that their business offers the Internet, TV, air conditioning, and other amenities to 
enhance their customers' experience. The study found that customers expected property managers and staff members 
to have information about their surroundings and be able to provide guidance. The location and maintenance of a 
property are the factors responsible for a positive customer experience. During a survey of customer comments, it was 
found that the presence of animals and excessive noise levels hurt guesthouses. To avoid this, it is highly recommended 
that owners of guesthouses prevent their animals from interacting with visitors. In addition, they should maintain their 
properties well and offer a sea view while ensuring that the noise levels are kept at a minimum. 
 
This study found that service quality plays a significant role in customer satisfaction when selecting a guesthouse. 
Service quality refers to the overall assessment of a service's performance and ability to meet or exceed customer 
expectations(Torres 2014). It is a dynamic, multidimensional concept that includes various dimensions and aspects of 
both past and present service experience. It is often described as the result of an evaluation process in which customers 
compare their expectations with those of the service and perceive that they have received.  
 
The dimensions of service quality are multifaceted and include factors such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, 
empathy, and tangibles. These dimensions are crucial in shaping the overall perception of service quality, and are 
often used as a framework for evaluating and improving service delivery. Additionally, service quality is influenced 
by various factors such as social capital, cultural values, and customer expectations. The impact of these factors on 
service quality highlights the complex nature of service quality assessment and management in various contexts. 
 
Moreover, service quality encompasses meeting customer expectations and creating value for customers (Li et al., 
2017). This emphasizes the importance of meeting customer needs and delivering values that surpass expectations. In 
conclusion, service quality is a complex concept that includes various dimensions and is influenced by factors, such 
as customer expectations, social capital, and cultural values. Guesthouses must understand and manage service quality 
effectively to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty in diverse industries. 
 
5.4 Validation  
One limitation of this study was its design. Exploratory research is vital for producing new knowledge and 
understanding, particularly in under-researched areas or where specific research problems lack definitive answers(Van 
Cauter et al., 2014). It is important to recognize the limitations of this type of research. These limitations include the 
use of unvalidated scales, small sample sizes, and undefined populations, all of which can affect the reliability and 
generalizability of the findings(Jansen et al., 2006). Furthermore, exploratory research is broad in scope and seldom 
provides conclusive answers to specific research questions, thereby limiting its conclusiveness. Despite the limitations 
in the research design, the findings provide insights for property owners interested in using their properties as 
guesthouses or improving them.

© IEOM Society International 
The second limitation of this study was the data collection method and type of data used. Secondary data research 
offers advantages such as cost-effectiveness, larger sample sizes, and increased generalizability, but it is crucial to 
acknowledge its limitations(Harpe, 2009). One of the primary limitations is the potential inadequacy of data sources, 
which can affect the reliability and quality of the findings(Areco et al., 2021). Additionally, secondary data research 
may not address specific research questions as it is confined to existing datasets, thus restricting the scope of research. 
In this study, we removed irrelevant data and supplemented the secondary data through interviews. Although 
secondary data research has advantages, researchers must carefully assess the quality, relevance, and limitations of 
the data sources they use. To ensure the validity and reliability of research findings obtained from secondary data 
sources, it is important to address these limitations. Another challenge is related to the number of interviews 
conducted. However, this did not affect the data because the interviews were selected sources of data to validate the 
findings from the secondary data.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected the global tourism industry, with the tourism sector in South Africa 
being one of the hardest hits. As the economy reopens, individual guesthouses take measures to ensure that their 
property stands out in the market. When choosing a place to stay, holidaymakers must consider several factors that 
can affect comfort and enjoyment. The main objective of this study is to gain a deep understanding of the factors that 
influence the decision-making process of holidaymakers when selecting accommodation in the South Coast area, 
which relies heavily on tourism.  
 
This study is exploratory and based on existing data obtained from the TripAdvisor.com database and interviews. The 
parameters were set, specifying the timeframe from 2022 to 2023, area, and type of accommodation. A spreadsheet 
was created with three columns: date of comments, comments, and ratings. The initial search yielded 2357 reviews, 
which was too many to read. Thus, a random sample of 331 reviews was selected based on the guideline of 95% 
confidence level, with a margin of error of ±5% and a population proportion of 50%. The sample size was chosen 
using a random number generator in Excel and subjected to quality assessment to ensure appropriateness for academic 
publication.  
 
The names of the reviews and properties were removed, leaving 186 reviews for further analyses. These 186 reviews 
were analyzed qualitatively using ATLAS.ti software for thematic coding and categorization of the identified themes. 
During the study, it was found that customers' experience with a guesthouse is greatly influenced by the amenities 
provided by the property, such as air conditioning, a private beach, interconnected rooms, a safe microwave, 
refrigerator, cable or satellite TV, a walk-in shower, 24-hour security, and free parking among other factors. The study 
also found that service quality plays a significant role in customer satisfaction when selecting a guesthouses.  
 
One limitation of this study was its design. Exploratory research is vital in producing new knowledge and 
understanding, particularly in under-researched areas or where specific research problems lack definitive answers. 
The second limitation of this study was the data collection method and type of data used. Secondary data research 
offers advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, larger sample sizes, and increased generalizability; however, it is crucial 
to acknowledge its limitations.

Abstract 
The rail operator in South Africa is currently facing a challenge related to motor alternator failures in electric 
locomotives that operate between Durban and Johannesburg. A study was conducted to identify the causes of motor 
alternator failures in a locomotive between Johannesburg and Durban using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis 
(FMEA). A focus group of 13 participants was used to gather the necessary data. The study found 35 root causes, with 
the top 20% responsible for 80% of failures. The major causes identified included overhead sparks, inconsistency in 
overhead voltage, insulation failure, slow speed, bearing quality, humidity, defective rivets, and deterioration of 
windings. Sparks in overhead railway catenaries are mainly caused by impulsive noise, whereas voltage inconsistency 
can be caused by dynamic stiffness, wind-induced vibrations, high winds, geometric parameters, faults, and 
environmental influences. Insulation failure in electrical systems can be caused by factors such as space-charge 
accumulation, partial discharge, thermal loading conditions, high-temperature exposure, moisture, material 
degradation, and electrical treeing. Based on this study, it is recommended to develop a maintenance strategy to detect 
challenges in advance and to implement an overhaul program to address system deterioration.

1. Introduction
The South African rail operator faces the challenge of motor alternator failures on electric locomotives that run 
between Durban and Johannesburg. When failures occur, the locomotive is withdrawn from the service and the train 
is cancelled, leading to lost opportunities, customer frustration, and revenue loss. While maintenance strategies are in 
place, such as inspections every 45 days and inspections before train departure, existing strategies do not seem 
adequate to prevent motor alternator failures. The fleet in question has been in operation since the 1980s and underwent 
a major upgrade in 2001 to upgrade the control system and reduce maintenance costs by replacing the old components 
with new parts. However, this initiative did not address motor alternator failures or improve fleet reliability. Motor 
alternator failures can be caused by various factors such as damage to the bearing, stator, and rotor. According to Lee 
and Cheng (2020), most motor failures occur because of the damage to these components. Furthermore, Zhang et al. 
(2009) highlighted that thermal overload can cause the deterioration of key motor components such as stator winding 
insulation, bearings, motor conductors, and core. Therefore, the causes of motor alternator failures in locomotives can 
be attributed to various factors, such as damage to the bearing, stator, rotor, and thermal overload. Thus far, extensive 
research has not been conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the causes of motor alternator failure in locomotives 
that operate between Durban and Johannesburg. This study aimed to help rail operators enhance the availability and 
reliability of their fleets.   Therefore, the results of this study can aid rail operators in enhancing the reliability of their 
fleets.

Figure 1. Risk Priority Numbers 
Out-of-round commutators in DC motors can be caused by a variety of factors, including the commutation torque 
ripple, arc discharge erosion, and commutation arc (Türker and Khudhair 2017). Commutation torque ripple, which 
causes abrupt changes in the torque output, is a common problem in brushless DC motor drives. This phenomenon 
can result in mechanical wear of the commutator and brush, resulting in an out-of-round commutator. Furthermore, 
arc discharge erosion at the carbon contacts during the commutation process can contribute to commutator and brush 
wear. Furthermore, the current ripple generated during the commutation process in brushless DC motor drives can 
affect the mechanical integrity of the commutator. As a result, it is recommended that the company regularly checks 
the commutator and brush conditions to reduce the commutator’s failure. 
5.4 Validation 
Creswell and Miller (2000) define research validity as the extent to which a study accurately measures or predicts 
what it is supposed to. Validity is established in qualitative research through various procedures, such as triangulation, 
which involves the use of multiple data sources, methods, or theories to ensure the credibility and authenticity of the 
findings (Whittemore et al., 2001). Furthermore, the distinction between ""validity of measurement"" and ""validity of 
research"" has been emphasized, emphasizing the importance of both aspects in ensuring the overall validity of a study 
(Truijens et al., 2010). Research validity refers to the extent to which a study accurately measures or predicts what is 
supposed to ensure that the results are credible and trustworthy. It involves establishing the plausibility and 
defensibility of the data as well as ensuring that the research methods and measures are sound and reliable. This is 
crucial for ensuring that the findings of a study can be applied to real-world situations, and that the conclusions drawn 
are meaningful and relevant. This study used an audit trail to ensure the trustworthiness and rigor of the research 
process. This process was implemented by recording in detail all step-by-step processes followed in the decision-
making process of this study.  
6. Conclusion
This study aimed to identify the causes of motor alternator failures in locomotive operations between Johannesburg 
and Durban. To achieve this, the study used Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The study relied on a focus 
group of 13 participants who were purposively selected because of their roles in improving the fleet's reliability and

their knowledge of the challenges and products being investigated. The research team conducted several meetings to 
collect data, both face-to-face and online, using Microsoft Teams. The study identified 35 root causes of motor 
alternator failures, with the top 20% being responsible for 80% of failures. The major causes identified were overhead 
sparks, inconsistency in overhead voltage, insulation failure, slow speed, low and high segments, common out-of-
round, bearing quality, humidity, defective rivets, and deterioration of windings. The sparks in the overhead railway 
catenaries are mainly caused by the impulsive noise generated from the gap between the catenary and the pantograph. 
Voltage inconsistencies in overhead railway catenaries can be caused by dynamic stiffness, wind-induced vibrations, 
high winds, geometric parameters, faults, or environmental influences. Insulation failure in electrical systems can be 
caused by a combination of factors including space charge accumulation, partial discharge, thermal loading conditions, 
high-temperature exposure, space charges under high-voltage direct current fields, moisture, material degradation, and 
electrical treeing. The study recommends that the company develop a maintenance strategy to detect any of the 
challenges in advance and implement an overhaul program to deal with system deterioration.

Abstract 
Since the evolution of Industry 4.0, one of the most important phenomena of the 21st century has been the business 
digital transformation (DT) process. This process is understood by several authors as the use of new digital 
technologies (all those electronic tools, automatic systems, devices and technological resources that generate, process 
or store information) that allow significant improvements to be made at the organizational level. Thus, Verhoef et al. 
(2021) associate DT with the creation of new business models that help create and appropriate greater value for the 
company, thus enabling greater competitive advantage. And Hess et al. (2016) mention that one of the greatest 
challenges in business management is to achieve the integration and exploitation of the new technologies that 
organizations in all sectors face, also, to achieve customer satisfaction by promoting dynamic changes in the routines 
and organizational processes. Bringing the aforementioned to fruition in practice requires, among other things, 
changes in the capabilities of people and processes within organizations. From this arises the purpose of conducting 
exploratory research on what factors are considered determinants in the implementation of the digital transformation 
process based on the development of dynamic capabilities in small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), in order to 
leverage the competitiveness of these.

Resumen 
A partir de la evolución de la Industria 4.0, uno de los fenómenos más importantes del siglo XXI ha sido el proceso 
de transformación digital (TD) empresarial. Este proceso es entendido por varios autores como el uso de nuevas 
tecnologías digitales (todas aquellas herramientas electrónicas, sistemas automáticos, dispositivos y recursos 
tecnológicos que generan, procesan o almacenan información) que permiten realizar mejoras significativas a nivel 
168","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
Adicionalmente se conoce la implementación de tecnologías digitales emergentes tales como: Inteligencia artificial, 
Robótica, Internet de las cosas (IoT), Aprendizaje automático, Realidad aumentada, Simulación y Blockchain 
(Medina-Chicaiza et al., 2022). El uso de estas tecnologías genera cambios en los sectores económicos, sistemas 
socioeconómicos y la cultura global al generar alteraciones en los modos usuales de hacer las cosas, la manera de 
actuar de las personas, inclusive la influencia en sus gustos y preferencias. 
Asimismo, en varios estudios como por ejemplo el de: Cacho-Elizondo & Lázaro Álvarez, (2018) hacen alusión al 
uso de plataformas de servicios digitales, las cuales permiten desarrollar el compromiso con los clientes, proveedores 
y socios comerciales; el de Parejo et al., (2021) donde nombran la importancia de hacer presencia en plataformas 
colaborativas para acceder a una mayor porción del mercado, revelando el impacto de dichas herramientas digitales 
para sostener el comercio electrónico; y el de Trujillo Valdiviezo et al., (2022) donde muestran el incremento 
significativo de la presencia empresarial en línea en el periodo crítico del COVID-19 en América Latina, lo cual se 
evidencia en el crecimiento de los sitios web empresariales (800% en Colombia y México y un 360% en Brasil y 
Chile). 
En este mismo sentido, autores como Del Do et al., (2023) afirman en su estudio que la transformación digital surge 
por la integración y explotación de las nuevas tecnologías digitales denominadas SMACiT: Social (Redes Sociales), 
Mobile (Dispositivos Móviles), Analytics (Análisis de Datos), Cloud Computing (Operaciones en la Nube) e Internet 
of Things (Internet de las Cosas). Es decir, hacen referencia a un conjunto de tecnologías digitales potentes, de fácil 
acceso para las organizaciones y con alto grado de complementariedad lo que las hace ideales para las Pymes.  
6. Conclusiones 
La pandemia de COVID-19 ha actuado como un catalizador inesperado, acelerando la adopción de la transformación 
digital en las pequeñas y medianas empresas (Pymes). Este fenómeno ha forzado una reevaluación de estrategias 
comerciales y modelos de interacción con clientes, destacando la transformación digital no solo como una necesidad 
inmediata sino como un componente crítico para la supervivencia y el crecimiento sostenido. Las Pymes, a través del 
desarrollo y fortalecimiento de capacidades dinámicas, pueden no solo adaptarse sino también anticiparse a cambios 
rápidos y disruptivos en el mercado, asegurando su relevancia y competitividad en un entorno digital cada vez más 
saturado. 
 
Por su parte, la adaptabilidad y la agilidad empresarial, fundamentadas en capacidades dinámicas sólidas, emergen 
como pilares esenciales para que las Pymes naveguen con éxito la transformación digital. La capacidad de detectar, 
capturar y transformar recursos y competencias en respuesta a las oportunidades y desafíos que presenta la 
digitalización es crucial. Este proceso de transformación digital se extiende más allá de la mera adopción de 
tecnología; implica una reconfiguración estratégica que abarca la gestión organizativa, el liderazgo, la cultura 
corporativa, y la interacción con el entorno de mercado y tecnológico. 
 
Así mismo, se hace evidente que la inversión en tecnologías digitales, junto con el desarrollo de una cultura 
organizacional que favorezca la mentalidad digital y la innovación, son factores determinantes en el éxito de la 
transformación digital de las Pymes. Sin embargo, estas inversiones y cambios culturales deben estar alineados con 
una estrategia digital claramente definida que se integre con la visión y objetivos generales de la organización. La 
estrategia digital no solo guía la adopción y aplicación de tecnologías, sino que también asegura que la transformación 
digital refuerce el valor para el cliente y la ventaja competitiva en el mercado. Tal como lo afirman Del Do et al., 
(2023), la revolución digital es una oportunidad, pero además es una obligación porque los clientes son cada vez más 
digitales, poseen más información, comparan, buscan mayor valor y desean una experiencia más satisfactoria. 
 
Por último es claro que las Pymes enfrentan el desafío de adaptarse continuamente a las rápidas evoluciones en 
tecnologías digitales y cambios en el comportamiento del consumidor. La capacidad de las empresas para anticipar y 
responder a estas tendencias, aprovechando tecnologías emergentes como la inteligencia artificial, el internet de las 
cosas (IoT) y la big data, será fundamental para innovar y mantener la competitividad. Este dinamismo requiere no 
solo de una sólida infraestructura tecnológica sino también de un enfoque estratégico que promueva la 
experimentación, el aprendizaje continuo y la agilidad operativa.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to propose a linear programming model that satisfies hypothetical nutritional requirements 
that the U.S. Army canine unit might have. The study established specific amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fat 
necessary for canines that partake in military activity. It was determined that each daily portion would consist of a 
base amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. However, in order not to compromise the dogs´ health and maintain 
their peak performance, there had to be a limit set on the daily intakes of macronutrients.  Through linear programming 
optimization sensitivity and dual analysis, our research highlights the economic and sustainable feasibility of 
producing a plant-based diet for military dogs without compromising the canine's health or military performance. The 
scope of this research is purely based on a theoretical proposed diet using public data to provide a methodological 
approach for balancing nutritional quality while maintaining cost efficiency.

1. Introduction
The importance of canine obesity and dietary needs has surged in recent years, bringing pet nutrition into the spotlight. 
This topic is even more important when referring to service military dogs. The earliest recording of dogs used in

practices and sustainability. Vitamin A was omitted from the current model due to technical considerations, given its 
significantly lower values relative to other macronutrients, though its inclusion in future iterations of the model is 
acknowledged as necessary for enhancing the nutritional quality of the food. In terms of macronutrients, it was 
concluded that both protein and carbohydrates are utilized in their minimum required amounts, and any significant 
increase could adversely affect canine health, emphasizing the importance of maintaining nutritional balance. 
  
The sensitivity analysis contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the decision variables. It revealed that the 
quantity of egg could be increased significantly while maintaining the plant-based nature of the food and without 
compromising sustainability. However, the associated cost increase and the transition to a non-plant-based diet upon 
exceeding a certain threshold would render the solution less ideal. Conversely, the removal of salmon from the model 
proved beneficial both in terms of cost and sustainability, and negotiating a reduction in the cost of sweet potato could 
lead to a notable improvement in the cost efficiency of the final product. 
  
Lastly, the insights derived from the dual model provided valuable information about the incremental cost of each 
macronutrient, which is vital to produce a more specialized dog food requiring higher levels of proteins or 
carbohydrates. This understanding enables us to anticipate and plan effectively for the impact on the product's pricing. 
  
In conclusion, this project has showcased the efficacy of linear programming in developing nutritional solutions for 
dog foods, capable of being tailored and refined based on cost, nutrition, and sustainability considerations. The model's 
adaptability and its ability to integrate sensitivity and duality considerations ensure the continuous evolution and 
enhancement of our product offerings, meeting the needs of both our customers and their pets. This approach not only 
assures the quality and sustainability of dog food but also highlights our dedication to innovation and excellence in 
the pet food industry.

Abstract 
This project aims to propose a simulation-optimization model for enhancing service efficiency at a coffee shop branch 
located in a business district in Mexico City. Issues related to customer waiting times and service are addressed through 
simulation in Simio software and the analysis of data collected from the coffee shop. The simulation is conducted 
considering three different scenarios based on the Queue Theory approach, encompassing one with real-world data 
(pure), one accounting for rush hours, and another utilizing the Opt-Quest Simio optimizer. This approach allows the 
assessment of the branch's service capacity and proposes improvements in staff distribution. Upon obtaining simulation 
results, the bottleneck is identified at the Checkout Counter, pinpointing areas for improvement to optimize the model. 
The findings indicate that during rush hours, both waiting time and total time within the system significantly increase. 
An optimization of the system is proposed, by varying the number of cashiers and baristas to minimize the average 
total customer time in the branch while increasing customer throughput. The optimal option involves hiring three 
cashiers and three baristas during rush hours, resulting in a 40% reduction in waiting time simulation results.

1. Introduction
Over the years, various studies and research endeavors have been conducted on Starbucks with the aim of 
comprehending its operations and how it has emerged as one of the largest global entities. Additionally, these studies 
have served as foundations for identifying areas of opportunity and addressing them through simulation methods and 
causal predictions. 
The issue of queues and waiting times at Starbucks has been tackled in a study conducted in Indonesia (Rahmatika et 
al., 2021). The methodology involved identifying the main issue, which was the limited number of baristas 
simultaneously taking orders and preparing beverages. The Arena Software was employed to simulate and analyze 
the current system using variables such as service time and the number of customers per day. Proposed scenarios 
(FIFO) were generated by modifying the number of baristas and servers. The results facilitated the development of a

5.4 Verification and Validation Process 
This project was developed in accordance with the simulation methodology outlined by Banks (1998). The 
Verification and Validation (V&V) process is both cyclic and iterative, meaning that for each proposed model, 
corresponding tests were applied and documented (Sargent, 2013; Kelton, 2003; Kellner et al., 1999; Law, 2014). 
Specifically, the model structure and parameterization were reviewed, and through replicas and experiments 
conducted in Simio, the consistency of the times obtained for each scenario was validated. The following are the 
various tests performed: review of programming modules (servers), examination of results and objects’ parameters 
verification (Table 4), validation with real data, and simple comparison tests.

As we see in Table 1 and 2, and Figure 5, based on replication results for both models: Pure Model and Rush Hour 
Model, we used KPIs results and experimentation for 500 replications to determine the Coffee Shop behavior.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the simulation yielded insights into the time customers spend at the Starbucks branch, including both 
at the Checkout Counter and in the Barista Station. It was observed that the waiting time during a rush hour was 
significantly higher compared to a regular demand schedule. Furthermore, it was identified that the bottleneck was 
situated at the Checkout Counter. Leveraging the obtained results and observations, the Opt-Quest optimizer within 
Simio was employed to analyze the behavior of output variables with various combinations of baristas and cashiers, 
and the optimization was compared against the rush hour scenario. Ultimately, simulation provides alternatives and 
proposals to enhance system functionality, thereby meeting the established requirements. As examined in the 
literature, various methodologies exist for analyzing system dynamics. Nevertheless, object-oriented approaches prove 
beneficial, facilitating the uncovering of insights concerning expected queue performance indicators. Similarly, 
simulations carried out using Simio Software enable us to assess bottlenecks based on the corresponding Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs).

On another note, two proposals for future work are suggested: (1) It is proposed to refine the model by incorporating 
actual salaries, introducing a menu with prices, and including a dataset with real sales to obtain results regarding 
profits and profit margins for each optimizer combination. (2) Develop a model by integrating a technological 
component (app) for ordering and payment, thus examining the changes in service and waiting times.

Abstract 
After overcoming the challenges caused by the pandemic, textile companies managed to recover a significant part of 
the pre-crisis market, experiencing a notable increase in their production thanks to the economic revival in Peru. This 
resurgence has intensified competition in the sector. In this context, it has become imperative for companies to increase 
productivity, seeking to maximize production with optimal resources. In order to achieve this goal, Lean 
Manufacturing tools emerge as a powerful and practical solution, especially for small and medium-sized companies. 
These tools have demonstrated significant benefits in several companies worldwide, not only for their feasibility, but 
also for their ability to adapt to different business needs. The main focus of this research is to increase production 
productivity in a company specialized in the manufacture of jackets, located in the city of Huancayo. The procedure 
began with an exhaustive diagnosis of the deficiencies present in the company. This analysis made it possible to 
identify the lean manufacturing tools that would provide greater added value to the process. Among the tools selected 
and their contribution to the research are the 5S method, which reduced by 80.22% the time lost in order and 
cleanliness, on the other hand, the SMED tool contributed a decrease of 2.43% of the average production time of a 
batch of clothing and Kanban, which improved by 17.22% the production time of each jacket. These tools were 
subjected to simulations using Arena software and mathematical models in the Input Analyzer data analyzer, which 
showed an increase in productivity of 20.79%. This comprehensive approach seeks not only to optimize operational 
efficiency but also to ensure that the improvements are sustainable and translate into significant productivity gains.

Abstract 
The tourism forecasting industry is facing challenges in improving its performance. However, this presents an 
opportunity for research and development, especially for developing countries looking to improve their tourism sector. 
The objective of a systematic review was identifying the newest and most used models for forecasting tourism demand. 
Using the PRISMA method and analyzing 40 articles, we concluded that hybrid models are the most effective for 
tourism demand forecasting. Combining a statistical model with a machine learning-based model is particularly 
efficient.

1. Introduction
According to The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), tourists’ arrival worldwide could come near the 80% to 
95% of what it was before the global pandemic for the year 2023 (Massoi, 2023). This being made top priority for 
many countries that depend on tourism. The United Nations (UN) defines tourism, in exception to business trips, as a 
seasonal activity where visitors could take advantage of the recipient’s climate and perform activities that otherwise 
could not be done where they are from (Italian Government et al., 2003). Said activities make big financial 
contributions to the country, getting the attention from investors, generating jobs and affecting other industries such 
as transportation, communication, financial services, etc. (Italian Government et al., 2003). It is important to know 
how to forecast demand because of the help it brings with predictions on performance as well as positioning of 
resources and pricing of the market (Feng et al., 2019a). For this to be achievable, the correct methods of forecasting 
must be identified and utilized, then a proper forecast of demand could be made. The concept of forecasting demand 
implies prediction of future demand from consumers during an established period. Without a deep knowledge of 
demand, businesses could find it harder to make the correct decisions. A forecast of demand is utilized to make annual 
budgets, as well as the planification and programing of production (Diezhandino, 2022). It is a tool that brings you 
the possibility of knowing how much to produce and happens to be vital when planning annual sales on any company 
(ForePlanner, n.d.).  During the year 2022 it came to more than 900 million tourists, wouldn’t hit 65% of the numbers 
before the year 2020 (Massoi, 2023), said data recognizes the importance of the following research. Inside Peru during 
the months of January to June of 2022 the numbers of international tourists reached more than 720 000, that being 
translated to a sum close of $1.2 billion dollars in foreign exchange for inbound tourism; said numbers used to be for

7. Conclusion 
After reviewing the articles, we concluded that a journal such as Forecasting would have the most relevant articles for 
the scope of the research. The number of contributions per year would naturally increase as the industry tries to recover 
from the effects of the pandemic. Similarly, countries heavily impacted by the pandemic would search for new tools 
and resources to improve their performance in the affected sectors. China is a prime example of such a country. 
 
This article analyzed the more frequently used models for forecasting tourism demand within a base of 40 articles. 
The following conclusions in relation to the tools reviewed were reached: statistical models, such as ARIMA, ANN 
and SARIMA, as well as models based on artificial intelligence, such as SVR, RFR and LSTM, happen to be the most 
useful when forecasting tourism demand. Likewise, there is evidence that the models can be improved, if they are 
implemented with a model from the other category, as such being a hybrid model. This partnering of models has been 
proven to be more effective than both categories on their own, achieving a more accurate forecast of the demand. 
 
A few recommendations for future research are the use of a sample bigger than 40 articles, to obtain more accurate 
results as to which models are the most frequently used when forecasting tourism demand. Finally, an important 
recommendation when it comes to analyzing forecasting models, is to consider the inclusion of multiple variables 
such as economic, political and social events. Because if not, the analysis would end up reaching the wrong conclusion.

Abstract 
The present work focuses on the Cell Formation Problem (CFP), which groups machines to get several benefits, 
including productivity improvement, reduced tooling needs, reduced setup time, and reduced manufacturing lead time. 
In modern manufacturing systems, equipment availability is an important requirement, as it ensures a higher 
possibility of utilizing productive resources, which are usually of high value. Therefore, the incorporation of reliability 
aspects into cell formation algorithms becomes necessary. Various researchers currently consider reliability based on 
individual machine failures. However, this overlooks a crucial factor, the systemic approach of clustering, in other 
words, the reliability of the entire production line. Since for the system to function correctly, all participating machines 
must be operational. So far, an approach considering the cell as a production line and taking its reliability as a whole 
into account has not been found. This work proposes an optimization model that incorporates machine reliability, 
considering the equipment as a production line. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, an example is given 
and compared with an existing model. The results show that there is a considerable cost difference between the new 
model and the old model. The latter will allow us to detect uncalculated costs that can be very detrimental to the 
correct formation of the cells.

1. Introduction
The competitiveness in industrial products and services signaled a change in the way manufacturing enterprises are 
designed and managed, as noted by Molina et al. (2005). Properly organizing machines within an industrial plant is 
an inherently complex task and of vital importance for operational success and manufacturing efficiency. The strategic 
arrangement of machines directly influences key factors such as productivity, cycle time, and operating costs. 
However, the wide variety of machines, each with different functions and requirements, along with physical and 
logistical space constraints, poses a significant challenge for engineers and production managers. 
The establishment of manufacturing cells presents itself as a solution to this challenge, aiming to properly organize 
machines within a plant and group them into cohesive units. A manufacturing cell comprises a set of machines selected

resulting in an RPD of 10471%. This value indicates that, on average, the costs of the combinations can exceed the 
model's value by over 10000 times, underscoring the importance of obtaining the minimum (optimal) cost and 
avoiding selecting considerably more expensive options.

Additionally, to reinforce this premise, Figure 5 is presented, which shows the percentage-wise monetary distance of 
the 241920 combinations from the optimal. It is evident that there are numerous opportunities to erroneously select a 
combination and incur excessive costs, highlighting the considerable benefit of applying the model to this decision-
making process.

6. Conclusion 
A successfully developed mathematical model has been proposed to address the challenge of manufacturing cell 
formation, incorporating considerations regarding alternative routes, repair times, and route reliability. To achieve 
this, a mathematical function was formulated that integrates and applies a penalty to repair time, and reliability 
constraints were established to ensure that the routes selected in the model meet certain reliability standards. Model 
validation was conducted using an exhaustive search methodology, employing a case study adapted from the literature, 
where the obtained results were compared with existing data to assess effectiveness and applicability in real-world 
scenarios. 
 
Among the obtained results, it is noteworthy that the model provides a significantly better solution ($6950.86) than 
the overall average of all combinations ($734774.74). Additionally, these results underscore the importance of 
avoiding cost omissions when using other models, which could negatively impact companies relying on incomplete 
results for decision-making. Finally, as a future research direction, applying the model to multiple periods is suggested, 
as certain parameters such as demand and failure and repair rates may change over time and require ongoing 
evaluation.

Abstract 
This document presents a quantitative study on the most effective types of pitches against Ronald Acuña Jr., a 
prominent baseball player, during the year 2020. Through an exhaustive methodology that includes data collection 
and analysis on pitch types, game conditions, and location, the project seeks to offer pitchers an analytical tool to 
improve their in-game decisions. Using the open-source platform Silver Decisions, a decision tree analysis allows the 
study identify patterns and trends in Acuña's at-bat behavior, offering specific strategies to deal with him in the most 
effective manner.

1. Introduction
Ronald Acuña Jr. is a baseball player born in La Guaira, Venezuela. After a whole life of following his father and 
grandfather dream, he made his debut in the Major League Baseball (MLB) in the year 2018, where he became an 
idol for his country. In the year 2023, he emerged as one of the players who most frequently approached the batting 
zone for his team, the Atlanta Braves, as well as one of the most effective, thanks to his strength and running style he 
led the team in total runs, hits, and total bases made. As a result, he became a constant threat to all pitchers in the 
league. However, like any human, there were occasions when his batting fell short, providing the opposing team with 
an opportunity to get back in the game. 
The primary focus of this study is to deeply understand how Acuña interacts with several types of pitches during 
games and verify the impact of these interactions on his overall performance. Specifically, our goal is to analyze the 
percentage of times Acuña successfully connects with each type of throw and the number of bases he advances after 
these contacts. This meticulous analysis is crucial to fully understand the skills and preferences of an elite batter, 
enabling a deeper understanding of his strengths and weaknesses on the field. This, in turn, facilitates the development 
of a training plan for pitchers to maximize their ability to challenge the batter. 
The methodology employed in this project is comprehensive, combining the collection of various statistics such as 
pitch types, game conditions, location in the strike zone, and batting outcomes. This approach goes beyond raw results,

With the information collected from the match presented on Table 3, we can start a comparison between the real 
performances of Ronald Acuña Jr. and the ones we predicted. In this case the first throw was not considerer because 
a pitch mistake led to a base to Acuña without hitting the ball. In the next two turns at bat where Acuña participated, 
there were no other teammates at the field and faced five different types of pitch, but only three ended up on a miss 
by Acuña, one of them was a Changeup throw, a result that matches the decision tree forecast. On the other hand, the 
Fourseam and the Curveball, despite they were not selected by the algorithm, also prove the importance of not being 
repetitive and try to surprise the pitcher to force the mistake. 
 
For the following matchup, Acuña faced one Fourseam, and one Slider with two teammates on the first two bases of 
the field, but only connected on the second one. The results partially match the decision tree, because a Slider pitch is 
not recommended for Acuña as he is very accurate for that throw, however, the Fourseam ball shown a really good 
performance against Acuña, at least in this match.  
 
Finally, the last at bat turn was played with no other Braves player but Acuña on the field. He faced a Cutter ball, one 
of the recommendations of the decision tree that led to a direct out of the batter, a positive ending that shows a good 
performance of the model. Notwithstanding, a further analysis in game could help the model to adjust and improve 
the accuracy of the forecasting. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This project successfully combines quantitative analysis and baseball strategy to enhance our understanding of how 
to face challenging hitters like Ronald Acuña Jr. Through an approach that included significant factors in pitching, 
such as game context, hitter efficiency, and pitch selection. The decision tree compiles all relevant information to 
make the most accurate decisions. 
 
The results showed that, for the larger part of analyzed game situations, the Changeup (CH) pitch is the most effective 
type of pitch against Acuña. This reveals a performance tendency that can be strategically exploited by opposing 
teams. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that the top hitters of the league will recognize the pattern, suggesting 
the possibility of switching between the second or third-best pitch to keep some level of uncertainty for batters and 
continue with an efficient strategy.

The project not only has provided an advanced analytical tool to improve pitchers’ decisions in specific situations 
against Acuña but has also contributed to general acknowledge about dynamics y tactics in professional baseball. This 
quantitative approach highlights the importance of data analysis in sports that has been growing the past few years, 
showing its potential to improve strategy and on-field performance. In addition, the same analysis can be done with 
any other player within the MLB database or anyone with enough information about.

Abstract 
Reinforcement learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm in artificial intelligence, showcasing remarkable 
applications across diverse domains. Simultaneously, simulation has proven to be a crucial tool for constructing 
environments conducive to interactions with agents trained through reinforcement learning algorithms. This synergy 
opens avenues for refining policies within simulation models. While existing research has predominantly harnessed 
reinforcement learning in agent-based and discrete event simulation models, there is a noticeable gap in its application 
within the realm of system dynamics simulation. This simulation paradigm, widely employed in Industrial Engineering 
and Operations Management for decision-making processes, presents a unique set of challenges. This paper explores 
the integration of reinforcement learning techniques into system dynamics models, aiming to address the scarcity of 
applications in this context. By doing so, it seeks to extend the benefits of reinforcement learning to enhance decision-
making processes in industrial and operational settings. The research delves into the nuances of policy exploration 
within the framework of system dynamics, providing insights into novel alternatives for optimizing and improving 
policies. Through this exploration, the paper contributes to the evolving landscape of reinforcement learning 
applications, particularly in the crucial domain of system dynamics simulation.

1. Introduction
The importance of videogames is raising day by day. It is estimated that 3.2 billion people all around de world play 
videogames actively (Wired 2023) due to the evolution of the industry which include mobile game development, 
digital stores and a variety of consoles and computers. Alongside, the streaming industry has experienced a similar 
growth thanks to platforms like Twitch and YouTube. There is a growing opportunity for people to become 
economically successful and renewed. Streamers obtain their income mainly through the usage of donations from the 
audience, subscriptions through the platform, and income received though sponsors earning a commission (Ortega 
2022) . As a streamer delves into their passion for gaming and turn it into their main source of income, they come to 
face additional challenges beyond game addiction. One prominent issue is the risk of sedentary behavior and the health 
problems that come along with it. Physical problems include poor posture, risks related to null movement and eye 
damage due to prolonged exposure to a screen. Mentally, the constant pressure to maintain or increase an audience 
can led to significant levels of stress and anxiety as well as exhaustion and fatigue caused by the lack of clear 
boundaries between work and personal life. Irregular sleep patterns and an imbalance in daily life combined with a 
constants interaction with the online community can expose streamers to a decline in their health, affecting their

As it can be seen, the stress of the Analytic Hierarchy Process did not affect the results of the research, it suggest 
that the streamer should stream aiming to the North America region to maximize his probability of success, even 
though, the global weights indeed changed.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The dream of playing video games for a living has been made possible thanks to technological evolution and platforms 
like Twitch and YouTube, which offer gamers the opportunity to broadcast live and build online communities. On 
this challenging but exciting path to fame and financial stability, the key for many lies in the ability to build and 
maintain an audience. Success in the world of streaming is not limited only to talent in video games, but also to the 
ability to know what steps to follow to be recognized by the video game community. Discipline and the 
implementation of a routine are essential not only to ensure professional growth, but also to mitigate the possible 
negative impacts on health derived from long hours dedicated to video games. 
 
Staying focused on realistic and sustainable goals is essential to avoid burnout and achieve a healthy balance between 
your passion for video games and everyday life. Additionally, developing a strategic plan that identifies and attracts 
the right audience can be instrumental in increasing boldness and, ultimately, continued success in the competitive 
arena. Thus, making a living playing video games not only involves in-game skills, but also a unique combination of 
discipline, organization, and life off the screen. 
 
On the other hand, looking for the right game to be a streamer is essential to achieve this goal. It is the basis to start 
and remain relevant after a while. Studying the people who watch and invest in Twitch is important to find the audience 
to which a streamer's content will be directed. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that there really is a way to live 
from video games without affecting physical or mental health. However, it is necessary to consult a schedule that 
considers the needs of living safely and healthily.

Abstract 
Energy consumption has been the driving factor of civilization. Particularly, electrical energy fuels the world of the 
digital age. At this age, developing nations have been struggling to sustain sufficient energy sources to produce 
electrical power and some were facing imminent scarcity. In the Philippines, the Malampaya power plant - one of the 
major energy source providers - was expected to deplete. Forecasting electricity consumption can provide insights 
that can be used to aid the country in constructing plans and development to secure sufficient power supply. Using the 
multivariate Prophet model, it was forecasted that the total electricity consumption will climb to 152,781.53 GWh. 
Furthermore, residential, commercial, industrial and loss electricity were also expected to escalate to 55,445.46 GWh, 
22,835.22 GWh, 37,130.67 GWh, and 11,126.29 GWh respectively, by the end of 2031.

1. Introduction
For centuries, civilization has evolved through breakthrough inventions and innovations that have changed our way 
of life. The lifestyle in the present day has been incomparable several decades ago. Imagine a world without the 
Internet.  The channel of communication would have been through writing a letter and sending it over to the location 
of the recipient, rather than making a few taps on digital devices and hitting the send button. Furthermore, imagine a 
world where electricity has not been discovered - the electrical energy that is conventionally applied to our daily lives 
- we might be using candles as our source of light at night. Electricity or electrical energy is considered as one of the
pillars of all forms of development. According to Davis (2019), electrical energy has paved the way for different
aspects of advancement such as healthcare, the industrial sector, and human well-being, and continues to play a crucial
role in development. Healthcare, education, business, manufacturing, agriculture, residential areas, etc. will experience 
adverse effects if electricity is absent. Every country, through the efforts of the government and private sector, supplies
electricity to the masses. To address the demand for electricity, numerous countries have now shifted to a blend of
eco-friendly and conventional energy sources to draw out electricity in order to provide a sufficient amount of energy
in sustaining the everyday operations and lives of the masses.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results obtained from the model, the following conclusions were drawn: Established the correlation of 
total, residential, commercial and industrial electricity consumption to an economic factor, specifically real GDP, 
while loss electricity was found to have stronger positive correlation to population than real GDP. Utilizing real GDP 
and population data as additional regressor in forecasting electricity consumption most likely to anticipate increase or 
decrease of electricity consumption. The fluctuating pattern in commercial electricity consumption may be derived 
from the event of COVID-19 Pandemic. After the pandemic, businesses adapted the hybrid and work-from-home 
setup that led to an average annual growth rate of 4.72% in residential electricity consumption for the next several 
years. Hence, total electricity consumption in the Philippines will undoubtedly climb up on incoming years.

Abstract 
Well-organized, clean, ordered work and production environments have remained in focus since the 60s. The Japanese 
5S methodology is a versatile instrument for any organization and allows for creating and maintaining safe, efficient, 
and neat workplaces. Even though, nowadays, the Western world keeps searching for the application ways and 
empirical proof in various companies. In underdeveloped countries, the problem comes due to cultural customs, lack 
of knowledge, and deficient technical capabilities. Accordingly, this paper proposes improving a Bolivian 
telecommunications firm health and safety system by implementing this methodology. The paper shows the design 
and development of a 5S order and cleanliness program followed by establishing monitoring and check tools, technical 
norms, procedures, layout design and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) analysis. The results showed 
visible changes in the operations center, improvements, and benefits such as workstation waste reduction, procedures 
standardization, elimination of time wasting, increase in efficiency, stress reduction, and economic benefits. Order, 
efficiency, and lean frames, need advances for undeveloped countries, and this study shows empirical evidence for 
improvement in this direction.

1. Introduction
Competitiveness and profitability are both critical for sustaining any organization's operations. Amidst the diversity 
of tools that allow performance improvement and overall resource utilization, none is as straightforward and cost-
effective as the 5S. It proves that you don’t need more to make it better. The 5S is known as a flexible tool for creating 
well-organized, clean, and safe work environments (Cichocka, 2018). 
The limited adoption of 5S in developing countries like Bolivia highlights the need for more effective approaches to 
eliminate waste (muda) in their industries (LaDou et al., 2018)). This study demonstrates how the 5S methodology 
can be applied to optimize workplace safety and health at a telecommunications company in Bolivia. 
The research developed a program based on the 5S methodology to enhance workplace safety and health. The practical 
paper approach details a step-by-step process pursued to improve an operations center's safety and health system. It

matrix is a complementary way to control the actions carried out during 5S implementation. The matrix assigns 
participating roles and responsibilities, which can be observed in Table 7. The green tag, as shown in Figure 9, serves 
as a record for a quick check to ensure that the workplace meets cleanliness and order standards. It also acts as an 
incentive for workers to adhere to the 5S principles by keeping their workstations clean and organized.

4.5. Future improvements 
Future improvements will aim to delve deeper into the long-term effects of the 5S methodology, including its potential 
adaptability to other divisions within the company and its impact on employee well-being and work efficiency. In 
simpler terms, this work has set a solid foundation for promoting safety, tidiness, and quality standards in the 
workplace through the 5S methodology. This fosters a culture of excellence and well-being within the 
telecommunications organization, an area that has remained largely unexplored until the realization of this research. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study convincingly shows the effectiveness of a 5S program in improving safety and health systems within a 
telecommunications company. Meticulous implementation of the five key steps led to a significant increase in 
compliance (from 19.6% to 68.2%). This translated to real-world benefits: a substantial reduction in accident rates 
(lost time injuries decreased by 69% and overall injuries by 50%) and a significant drop in injury severity. 
 
The study highlights the value of 5S for small and medium companies. Not only is it cost-effective, but it allows for 
resource optimization by generating income from unused items.  These findings underscore the importance of 
structured methodologies like 5S in creating safe and productive workplaces. The significant return on investment 
(reduced accidents, improved efficiency) makes 5S attractive for diverse industries. 
 
The research offers valuable insights beyond the telecommunications sector. Emphasizing the link between 
occupational health and safety and overall well-being provides a blueprint for improving working conditions across 
various settings. The study demonstrates that seemingly small changes, like visual management and improved 
organization, can yield substantial benefits.  Reduced tool search times and a cleaner environment contribute to safety, 
decrease worker stress, and enhance productivity. 
 
Limitations to consider include the single-site focus and the unexplored link between 5S and deeper productivity gains. 
Future research could explore variations in outcomes across different company facilities and delve deeper into the 
specific impact of improved safety on worker productivity.

Abstract 
As businesses worldwide strive to improve their productivity, companies in underdeveloped countries like Bolivia 
face significant challenges in enhancing their manufacturing capabilities, quality, and competitiveness. To overcome 
these challenges, new technologies and methods must be explored. This paper proposes applying the Factory Physics 
methodology to improve productivity in a Bolivian brick manufacturing firm. In pursuit of this goal, the study analyzed 
the production line using time and motion study techniques, applying Factory Physics principles, and performing 
computer simulations. The analysis revealed that implementing process controls and measures guided by Factory 
Physics significantly improved the manufacturing system's performance, resulting in an increased throughput rate, 
reduced work in process, and decreased cycle time. These findings demonstrate the vast potential and adaptability of 
Factory Physics in significantly enhancing manufacturing systems' performance in underdeveloped countries.

1. Introduction
Many companies prioritize increasing competitiveness by offering high-value products that meet market needs. 
Production efficiency, achieved by minimizing resource usage (materials, time, and personnel), is crucial to this goal. 
It translates to higher profitability, lower operational costs, and reduced waste.  However, companies in developing 
countries like Bolivia often struggle with improvised and reactive work practices (Herbas & Enriquez, 2023). This is 
evident in a lack of standardized processes, disorganized workplaces, and production losses due to downtime and 
bottlenecks (Vela Valqui, 2019). 
Recognizing the importance of productivity improvement, this study analyzed a Bolivian brick production line facing 
performance issues. The Factory Physics methodology provided the framework and tools to implement improvements. 
Various improvement proposals were developed and simulated following a diagnostic assessment of the initial 
production line.  The results strongly suggest that Factory Physics tools hold significant potential for boosting 
productivity and overall performance in Bolivian manufacturing companies.

The utilization of confidence intervals facilitated comparative analysis. The absence of overlap between upper and 
lower limits confirmed a statistically significant enhancement.  
 
Regarding the operators, the results showed a significant increase in their efficiency. The work time increased by 
25.67%, while the transport time increased by 37.79%. Additionally, there was a considerable reduction in waiting 
time and time spent moving to the workstation by 17.04% and 35.76%, respectively. This indicates that the workers 
spent more time on activities that added value to the product, reducing unproductive waiting and leisure time. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study investigated the effectiveness of Factory Physics in improving production systems in developing countries.  
A Bolivian brick manufacturing company served as the case study.  Focusing on a specific production line, researchers 
employed a time study, Factory Physics principles, and computer simulations to develop and validate improvement 
proposals. 
 
Analysis revealed significant inefficiencies.  The line exhibited high CT, excessive WIP, and low TH, all indicators 
of poor productivity.  Furthermore, operator activities included high levels of non-value-adding activities, such as 
waiting, idle, transportation times. Three improvement proposals were formulated:  
• 
Reduction of activities that do not add value to the production process. 
• 
Reduction of idle time of operators in the production line (line balancing). 
• 
Reduction of variability with thermocouples in the burning process (measurement and standardization).  
 
The implemented improvements yielded positive results.  Product flow through the production process was optimized, 
with less waiting time and more dedicated to actual production.  Operator efficiency also improved, reducing waiting, 
idle, and transport times by 17,04% and 35,76%, respectively.  Conversely, working and necessary product transport 
time increased by 25,67% and 37,79%, respectively, indicating a more productive workforce. Moreover, Factory 
Physics metrics also reflected significant improvements and a decrease in variability. TH rose by 501 units per shift, 
CT decreased by 20,93%, and WIP dropped by 10,44%.  These results demonstrate a notable increase in production 
output and efficiency, achieved with minimal resource investment.  
 
This study aligns with the findings of Herbas & Enriquez (2023), highlighting the potential of Factory Physics to 
enhance productivity in developing countries.  The methodology improves understanding of production line dynamics 
and facilitates proposing cost-effective improvements.  Given the resource constraints often faced by companies in 
developing countries, Factory Physics offers a systematic approach to identifying high-impact improvements using 
existing resources.  This research promotes a deeper understanding of Factory Physics as a valuable tool for production 
improvement in these contexts, emphasizing the importance of ""working smarter, not harder"" (Jesus Romero).

Abstract 
Productivity is essential for organizational success, yet manufacturing systems often struggle to optimize resource 
utilization. This challenge is amplified in countries like Bolivia, where resource and technological limitations create 
additional barriers. This study addresses this issue by examining how a Bolivian food company leveraged Factory 
Physics methodology and simulation software to enhance its manufacturing layout and performance. The company 
pursued three goals: machine redistribution, reduced transport operations, and increased production capacity. Results 
from the redesign were compelling, including reduced operator travel distance, optimized machine footprint, 
decreased work-in-progress, shortened cycle times, and a significant boost in production rates. This study offers 
valuable evidence that Factory Physics and simulation tools can be powerful assets for companies seeking to overcome 
productivity challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

1. Introduction
Globally, companies strive to optimize production processes for improved productivity. This key metric reflects how 
efficiently resources are transformed into outputs (Chase and Jacobs, 2014). The goal is to maximize business 
performance by minimizing resource usage and boosting overall efficiency (Sevilla, 2022).  Faster delivery times and 
increased customer satisfaction are natural consequences of enhanced productivity (Drew, 2022).  Like their 
counterparts worldwide, Bolivian companies face this challenge, seeking practical solutions to remain competitive. 
This research addressed a productivity challenge in a Bolivian food company by combining Factory Physics 
methodology with simulation software. This approach offers valuable insights into these tools' effectiveness in 
developing nations like Bolivia, where scarce resources, limited technology, and insufficient training often hinder 
industrial improvement.  The study aimed to analyze how Factory Physics and simulation software could enhance 
production layout and performance. 
The research proposed an optimized plant layout to increase production capacity and productivity. Three suggestions 
were evaluated: (1) machine redistribution, (2) reduced transport operations, and (3) increased production capacity. 
The implemented changes yielded significant results:  a 201.38% production increase, a 58.82% reduction in worker 
travel distances, an 18.54% decrease in space utilization, a 51.54% reduction in work-in-process inventory, and a 
75.11% cycle time reduction.  These outcomes indicate that Factory Physics and simulation software can overcome

In order to estimate the impact of production, we calculated the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). OEE assesses 
the performance of equipment and helps determine if the process is meeting its goals (Muchiri & Pintelon, 2008). We 
also analyzed the efficiency of workers to see if production could be maintained or increased with fewer workers. This 
was determined by calculating the number of products that can be produced by each worker. All of these findings are 
summarized in Table 9.

Table 8 shows the changes in performance, which includes both the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and 
worker efficiency. The improvement across the three model stages led to an overall effectiveness increase, from 76.6% 
and 77.61%, to a final 79.31%. On the other hand, model 3 displayed an improvement of 2.78% compared to the 
current process. Regarding worker efficiency, there is a significant increase from 10.24 to 30.86 products per worker. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research investigated the effectiveness of combining Factory Physics methodology with simulation software for 
improving production processes in developing countries. The study focused on a Bolivian food company, aiming to 
optimize its layout and production efficiency. The initial phase involved a thorough analysis of the existing production 
process, including a time study to establish standard operation times necessary for the simulation model. Three 
improvement suggestions were then formulated using Factory Physics principles and simulated using software. These 
proposals targeted enhancements in both layout and overall process performance. The results convincingly indicate 
that significant improvements can be achieved without resorting to complex methodologies or sophisticated software. 
This is particularly relevant for companies in developing countries like Bolivia, where limited technological resources 
often hinder growth. The study highlights the power of readily accessible tools like Factory Physics and simulation, 
which, when implemented effectively, can yield significant benefits. 
 
A common misconception is that simply increasing production capacity solves all problems.  However, as this research 
demonstrates, achieving true optimization requires a deeper understanding. Factory Physics and simulation provide a 
comprehensive framework for evaluating the entire production process, analyzing the interaction between 
components, and pinpointing areas for improvement.  This holistic approach ensures that interventions address the 
root causes of problems, leading to sustainable improvements. The case study confirms the value of combining Factory 
Physics and simulation to enhance layout and performance in companies located in developing countries. Furthermore, 
it suggests the broader applicability of these tools to analyze and improve not just individual production lines but the 
entire production system. 
 
The study acknowledges limitations. Focusing on a single production line presented an opportunity for in-depth 
analysis, but future research could explore industries with multiple interconnected processes, examining the complex 
interactions between them.

Abstract 
Even though Industry 4.0 has been advancing significantly in the last years, the upgrade of Legacy systems is still a 
reality that needs to be attended to due to their large presence in developing countries. To achieve this goal, this paper 
proposes a continuation of previous research to increase knowledge and improve efficacy of a Node-RED / OPC-UA 
based IIoT automation solution for a Festo FMS Legacy System with S7-300 PLC´s. This paper will focus on scaling 
and adding new stations, as well as improving the existing structure for future upgrades. At the end, the results showed 
a possible scenario to keep using Node-RED and OPC-UA with some reservations as well as future possible work.

Introduction
Introduced in Germany in 2011. The 4th industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, describes the integration of modern 
and complex Technologies, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), Artificial intelligence (AI) amongst others 
bringing a new way to produce. One of the main aspects of Industry 4.0 is the fusion of the real and virtual worlds, 
creating what is now known as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). These systems represent a new approach on production 
management, allowing control e monitoring of all production lines virtually, creating modular and flexible factories. 
Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) also allow the creation of personalized products based on user needs, as well 
as allowing, with the addition of CPS and Digital Twins (DT) for better maintenance programs, production run 
simulations, defect prediction and . (Singh et al., 2021; Teixeira et al., 2016) 
Industry 4.0 brought challenges and opportunities both in the management aspect (Bajic et al., 2021) as in the technical 
aspect (Rikalovic et al., 2022), however the implementation of new technologies is facing several obstacles, with one 
of the most relevant being interoperability (Burns et al., 2019). When studying Legacy Systems, the investment needed 
for upgrading the production lines to Industry 4.0 makes it unpractical (Kutscher et al., 2020; Zielstorff et al., 2023), 
making all the benefits of Industry 4.0 and CPS out of the reach of these segment of industry that is still significant in 
developing countries.

To maintain the same order as seen on the Dashboard of section 4.1, the first 3 digits that refer to the PROFIBUS 
address of each of the stations were added to the names so the order in the UaExpert software4 would match the order 
of the PROFIBUS list. The final namespaces of the new folders can be seen below in Figure 11. It shows the number 
and the description of each namespace. The description is set on the CSV file described in Table 1.

5. Conclusion  
During the execution of this project a better knowledge of Node-RED, OPC-UA, MQTT, Industrial protocols 
(specially PROFIBUS) and its diverse applications were obtained. This is showed by the review of section 2 and the 
advances on the programming from the first research. Several case studies and forum discussions that were not 
included in the references due to redundancies in base content, contributed to enhance the understanding of the 
programming languages. The results showed in sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 are consistent with the objective a) of 
section 1.1 and is considered successfully achieved by the researchers, especially due to the reduction in both file size 
(37%) and nodes (30%). Objective b) of section 1.1 was also considered successfully achieved, as seen on the new 
updated Dashboard in section 4.1 and the folders and variables on OPC-UA in section 4.2. 
 
The new method for creating the variables showed in section 3.1.1 allows for easy maintenance and upgrade if new 
stations are added. It also significantly reduced the number of nodes necessary and the size of the final project file, 
increasing its efficiency. As described in section 4.2, the variables are now divided into stations. This helps greatly in 
the understanding and mapping of the variables for future use as some variables are similar in all stations (For example 
the “On” signal), and with the new folder structure it is easier to select the correct variable. However, for extensive 
and complex projects Node-RED, even though flexible and easy to use, is still in need of maturing, specially in 
documentation and testing procedures. For now, an experimental role for the programming language is what is 
recommended. 
 
Future work in this area will continue, with the integration of semantics DT information as described by Steinmetz et 
al. (2022) and the continuous improvement of the flows as needed.

Abstract 
Every day the industrial sector is constantly advancing in the development of micro, small and medium-sized 
enterprises (MSMEs), which is reflected in the high participation that these companies have in the economy, since 
globally they represent 90 % of companies also generate between 60% and 70% of jobs and are responsible for 
approximately 50% of global GDP. It is for this reason that it is important to keep track of either the application of 
tools that help improve or their performance to meet the desired objectives. 
It should be noted that these institutions have a direct relationship with empirical knowledge, which is why they ignore 
the methods and methodologies for the development of different activities. This is why many entrepreneurs, when 
they are in their beginnings or in search of new horizons to revolutionize the market or the sector, do not take into 
account certain models or management systems and that is where they “venture into a sector without knowing what 
the market needs are; They do not investigate the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors, thus ignoring process 
problems just because the business is running; they do not use resources efficiently; They do not minimize activities 
that do not add value, among others. ” Therefore, organizations must focus on the development of new techniques that 
help them optimize their processes, maintaining product quality and thus achieve lower costs through innovative high-
impact methodologies such as Lean Manufacturing and six sigma.

1. Introduction
MSMEs present a high degree of ignorance of methods and methodologies for the development of the different 
activities necessary for the production process, which is why they venture to seek efficiency and productivity through 
trial and error; For this reason, many errors have been made, which is why the search for alternatives that contribute 
to an improvement and also adapt to the reality of the company begins. 
The implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools can help mitigate productivity problems in MSMEs, since they focus 
on the elimination of waste and the design of optimization of processes and logistical operational systems; such as 
overproduction, waiting times, transportation, rework, inventory, movements, defects and unused knowledge of 
production processes, managing to reduce costs and improve production efficiency. 
In order to identify these problems, it is necessary to carry out detailed monitoring of the critical processes that have 
the greatest impact within organizations, whether in terms of the production and quality of products or services. With 
the objective of analyzing each process for And that is where the processes are analyzed, the goals or objectives are 
defined, solutions are proposed, with the purpose of implementing the solution in this case the tool.

Determination of molts. 
The process begins by identifying the seven seedlings and their productivity factors, developing questions related to 
each of these factors. Then, a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of each question is carried out to give weight to 
the quantitative results and determine which is the change that most affects the company. 
Once the most important change is identified, Lean Manufacturing tool options are offered that can be used to increase 
productivity in relation to that change. These tools can include Kanban techniques, Just-in-Time, Poka-yoke, and 
more. 
 
To carry out the implementation of said management tool, as a research study method, a pilot test was developed 
where the methodology was implemented to identify and address the ""seven seedlings"" or waste, in a production 
process through the application of Lean Manufacturing tools. These seven changes are: overproduction, waiting time, 
transportation, unnecessary processing, excessive inventory, unnecessary movement and defects. 
 
Finally, a final diagnosis is carried out where the questions are answered again after the implementation of the selected 
tool, to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the implemented solution. This methodology is a systematic and 
structured way to identify and address waste in a production process, using Lean Manufacturing tools to increase 
efficiency and reduce costs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
- The implementation of the different engineering tools, and the making of proposals to achieve an improvement, 
will positively impact the SMEs and MSMEs of the city of Popayán, since they will be able to obtain a base 
and different options that they can implement to achieve their goals. objectives and goals. In addition, the 
capacity to produce and deliver their products more efficiently will be developed, bringing each of the 
institutions closer to satisfying the needs of their clients. 
 
- It should be noted that the percentage of micro, small and medium-sized companies in the city is high, so by 
implementing mechanisms that promote an improvement in their production processes, the company will be 
able to remain in the market for a long time. Generating with this a maintenance and reduction of 
unemployment rates and a boost to the Payanesa economy. 
 
- The implementation of engineering tools and the improvement of production processes can be very beneficial 
for SMEs and MSMEs in Popayán, which can help improve the quality of products and services, increase 
efficiency and reduce costs, and contribute to development. economic and the reduction of unemployment in 
the city.

Abstract 
In today’s digital era, online banking has revolutionized the banking industry, offering unparalleled convenience and 
flexibility to customers, thereby advancing financial inclusion. Previously underserved populations, such as those in 
rural areas or lacking transportation access, now enjoy banking services via smartphones. However, the growing 
frequency and complexity of online banking present usability challenges, including limited merchant options and 
technical glitches in payment transactions. Issues like One Time Passwords (OTPs) and service charges particularly 
affect Generation X users, who have witnessed the digital era's emergence. Despite digital advancements, many in 
this demographic struggle with online banking. To tackle this, the study advocates for assessing online banking service 
quality in the Philippines using the SERVQUAL model and Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis to identify 
areas for improvement. Eliminating errors is paramount for enhancing customer satisfaction. Additionally, the study 
seeks to uncover factors influencing customer service quality, providing actionable recommendations for 
improvement.

1. Introduction
In today’s digital era, online banking has emerged as an integral part of the banking industry, providing customers 
with convenience and flexibility (Sambaombe et al., 2021). However, the increasing frequency and complexity of 
cyber attacks have prompted financial institutions to enhance the security and functionality of their online banking 
systems (Kalwar et al., 2021; Iqbal et al., 2023). The necessity for enhancements in online banking systems, including 
more robust authentication protocols, improved data encryption, and better user interfaces, is to ensure the safety and 
confidentiality of customers' financial information while providing a smooth and user-friendly online banking 
experience. The banking industry has experienced significant changes with the rise of online banking, which has made 
it easier for customers to manage their finances remotely (Pham et al., 2022). However, financial institutions must

Abstract 
This article aims to identify the number of publications, authors of the most cited documents, and journals that 
published the most regarding innovation studies in beekeeping. Therefore, the study used 57 articles retrieved from 
the Scopus database by searching for the terms “beekeeping” and “innovation”. The results showed several research 
fields, mainly in tropical countries, highlighting articles from Spain, Mexico, and Brazil. Technological discussion is 
not the main research issue, but social, organizational, economic, and environmental issues. Innovation is the main 
discussion but is spread through various nuances, and technologies have not gained momentum. Thus, the research 
provided a solid basis for future studies and highlighted the importance of international collaboration in research 
related to the topic. However, it is necessary to develop more in-depth and empirical studies for a broader and more 
precise understanding of the complex synergies in applying innovation in agriculture and beekeeping as an economical 
and ecological-friendly activity.

1. Introduction
Innovation is one of the most important factors for any organization's long-term success or a country's economic 
development. Based on the findings of MOORE, J. F. (1993), the systemic view of innovation gained prominence, 
and with this, new terms emerged: business ecosystem, innovation ecosystem, and entrepreneurship ecosystem. This 
presupposes the need to build or strengthen a network (ecosystem) for disseminating knowledge that emerges as 
innovation. 
Innovation is also a central issue in the rural environment and necessary to promote sustainable rural development. 
The exchange of knowledge and practices based on interactions in networks of farmers, communities, rural assistance, 
and other social institutions strengthens cooperation and favors the environment for innovation. 
For a broader study base, it is necessary to prioritize specific approaches, research, or methods to delve deeper into 
issues important to a research group. Thus, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using overview research relating to 
innovation and beekeeping to qualify a set of ongoing research focusing on boosting innovation in beekeeping in the

5. Main Discussions and Conclusion 
Considering the results obtained in the bibliometric analysis, it is possible to see the relevance of developing new 
studies and technologies aimed at innovation in the beekeeping sector. The results obtained throughout this study 
made it possible to identify 57 documents related to the terms under study. 
 
Identifying the countries with the greatest scientific production in this field and analyzing the network of co-citations 
and authorship between authors and institutions helps to identify trends, gaps in the literature, and possibilities for 
collaboration in future research. The results made it possible to identify a predominance of publications in countries 
with a tropical climate, which is suggested to be related to the local climate and the difficulties they may face compared 
to other countries. In addition, the species' biodiversity in these countries' fauna and flora contribute to more research 
to take advantage of these factors for greater production in the beekeeping sector. 
 
The results suggest that using bibliometric analysis to identify characteristics, patterns, and existing products is 
relevant when considering innovation and beekeeping. However, it should be noted that bibliometric analysis is 
insufficient to answer all questions related to the scientific understanding of a field of study, requiring systematic 
reviews to map themes, study methodologies, and emerging issues in each field. 
 
Comparing the results of bibliometric analysis with the previous literature, in general, the literature allows us to 
validate the elements of economic growth, especially for developing countries, as well as the sustainability issues, 
demands for technology development, and a change perception need for boosting the apiculture practice on rural areas 
around the world. Technology issues, such as the main high-tech solutions offered for beekeepers, are not highlighted 
once the scientific discussion encompasses a whole view of the effective adoption of beekeeping in rural areas. Other 
products beyond honey, such as wax, propolis, or even organic honey or geographically originated honey, are not 
addressed, and even discussions regarding economic valuation for beekeeping activities are not well reported. 
 
Production planning and control for beekeeping in other countries are not reported in the scientific literature analyzed, 
which can be understood as a validation for the Brazilian reports that suggested this economic occupation is weakly 
systematized, almost working on an extractivist basis. The demand for more innovation and technology for beekeeping 
is highlighted in the literature analyzed. We detected diverse proposals but no reports on the utilization and impact. 
 
Empirical research is needed to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the complex synergies in any innovation-
related environment. Therefore, it is important that there is more research on the topic and that they carry out a deeper 
analysis to improve the understanding of the role of innovation in promoting economic and sustainable development 
in beekeeping. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance of international collaboration in research related to 
the topic once few coupling and co-citation networks exist. 
 
As a limitation of the study, it is important to highlight that the analyses cannot be generalized, as the sample and 
search were based on one specific database. Additionally, only the most cited authors were analyzed, with prospects 
for future work with the systematic study of the entire database collected in the research.

Abstract 
Nowadays, is crucial to accurately forecast products, especially for a company that imports its goods. Having an 
accurate forecasting enables the company to optimize resource management, increasing productivity and preventing 
overselling or underselling of products. Additionally, establishing a demand-based material planning model is 
essential to ensure that our suppliers meet their service level commitments.  In this research project, Machine Learning 
and Big Data are employed to enhance de forecasting methods of consumer goods company. The data collected from 
the company’s sales over the last four years for “the hair category” has been trained and the Arima method will be 
employed to predict the first 8 months of the year 2023. Furthermore, the Demand Driven Material Requirement Plan 
(DDMRP) is implemented to improve suppliers’ service level. The impact of the proposed model will be evaluated 
using indicators such as Forecast Bias (FB), Forecast Accuracy (FA), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and 
Service Level Agreement (SLA).

1. Introduction
In most cases, forecast research assumes that forecasts are an end in themselves, without considering the subsequent 
stages of calculation needed to transform forecasts into replenishment decisions and decisions that support all the 
processes encompassing the supply chain. (Goltsos et al, 2022) The planner of the company was consulted, and this 
issue was not foreign to the company. His explanation will be used for the case study. The real name of the company 
will be omitted due to confidentiality issue and the present research paper will study the most dominant category of 
the company, the one that provided the highest revenue in the year 2022. In a consumer goods company (CGC) having 
an excessive quantity of products due to underselling can result in product losses, while inventory shortages from 
overselling can lead to a low fill rate for their customers. Either of them, due to excess or lack of inventories, represents 
an opportunity cost for the company. As we continue to gather data with the assistance of the planner, four general 
causes for the imprecision of demand forecasting have emerged. The first is inadequate data management, followed 
by improper handling of inbound logistics, external factors, and lastly, the influence of competition. Furthermore, it

To determine the best model, Input Analyzer, which is part of the Arena program where the simulation was conducted, 
was utilized. Figure 4 shows the SLA result obtained from the best model.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Drawing on the improvements observed in other papers and the companies planner input, we set objectives for our 
investigation to achieve, as indicated in Table 4. It is important to mention that these figures were measured at the 
aggregate level of the entire hair category. However, our research specifically targets one product line. Therefore, 
we will use the improvement percentage as the objective to achieve.

6.Conclusion  
During the investigation, it was possible to identify the main causes of forecast deviation for the hair category in the 
company, with inadequate inbound logistics management being the primary cause. Using the model, better results w 
ere obtained in all studied KPIs, including forecast bias (FB), forecast accuracy (FA), and mean absolute percentage

error (MAPE). However, according to the literature studied, with additional data, it could be possible to combine 
different techniques to achieve an even better result than the one already obtained. Therefore, it is recommended to 
the company to begin storing marketing or promotion data to understand consumer behavior much better. Finally, 
model number four yields the best result for increasing the SU's SLA, thus recommending a lead time of UNIF (19.20) 
days and a Coverage Period Policy of two months. The utilization of machine learning, big data, and DDMRP 
techniques can provide exceptional results to the company by creating a more precise inbound logistics, better demand 
forecasting, and improving the SLA, thus addressing the demand deviation issue.

Abstract 
The article presents the results and discussions of the application of the SERVQUAL model carried out in a company 
dedicated to the maintenance, installation and repair of air conditioning systems (HVAC) in Metropolitan Lima, Peru; 
whose objective for which the research is carried out is to identify the dimension that most impacts with respect to 
quality of service using the SERVQUAL model considering quality of service as the weighted sum of gaps. 91 
companies were surveyed with 3 sections for each, the first of them valued the expectations that customers would 
have, the second the perceptions after receiving the service and in the last they scored the dimension they considered 
most important. The highest rated dimension or with the smallest gap is the tangible dimension with a gap of -0.35, 
the most important dimension according to customers is the reliability dimension with an average percentage of 24.3% 
and the dimension that most negatively influences the service quality index is the reliability dimension with a weighted 
gap of -15.69.

1. Introduction
Currently, to be considered competitive it is necessary to provide goods and / or services that match or exceed the 
expectations that the client has. Managing quality in services is a topic frequently addressed today as a differentiating 
factor for organizations; Because of this, strategies have been carried out so that companies can gain a competitive 
advantage over competitors.

appearance,"" with a gap of -0.44. These data suggest that while tangible elements may be a strength in the HVAC 
maintenance sector, the appearance of personnel may be a significant area for improvement. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study determines the most influential dimensions of the quality offered in a service, by comparing the gaps 
proposed by the SERVQUAL model, which was adapted to the context of the sector. With respect to the above, 
response capacity is not the dimension with the greatest impact; The dimension with the greatest impact is the one 
with reliability, having the highest negative value of the weighted gaps. The dimension with the greatest gap is security 
with a negative value, which means that it is what the company objectively fails the most. The dimension most valued 
by customers is reliability, which is why the worst valued dimension of the company, security, is not the one that most 
negatively impacts the quality offered by the service. Within the security dimension, it is observed that, according to 
the individual score per question, the company's workers do not present sufficient knowledge to react to customer 
questions, generating insecurity in the service provided. Compared to Baffour-Awuah (2018) study, in both cases the 
dimension that has the least positive impact is that of tangibles, which could be an indication of a standard in the 
HVAC maintenance sector, on the other hand, it was found that the tangible dimension is the best qualified, which 
translates into a bad focus and waste of resources in Improve the tangibles of the sector. Both studies highlight the 
importance of reliability and security as critical dimensions in assessing service quality in the HVAC maintenance 
sector. These findings suggest the need for companies in the sector to prioritize improving reliability and security in 
their services to enhance customer satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge in the market. It is suggested to future 
studies aligned with the proposed, the formulation of improvement solutions for the sector and the development of 
key performance indicators focused on the proposed solution.

In the Tangibles dimension, the item with the smallest gap (-0.26) is ""Material elements were visually attractive and 
informative."" This suggests that the respondents perceived the informational materials provided by the company as 
meeting their expectations reasonably well. On the other hand, the item with the largest gap (-0.44) is ""The company's 
personnel had a neat appearance."" This indicates that there was a notable discrepancy between respondents' 
expectations and their perception of the appearance of the company's personnel. This difference could be due to

showed willingness to help you."" This indicates a significant difference between respondents' expectations and their 
perception of the willingness of company personnel to assist them. This difference might stem from variations in the 
responsiveness or helpfulness of personnel across different interactions or situations. 
 
In the Reliability dimension, the item with the smallest gap (-0.63) is ""When you had a problem or complaint, there 
was a sincere interest in solving it."" This suggests that respondents perceived a relatively sincere effort from the 
company in addressing their issues or complaints. However, the item with the largest gap (-0.67) is ""The company's 
personnel performed the service well from the first time."" This indicates a notable difference between respondents' 
expectations and their perception of the initial performance of the service. This difference could be influenced by 
varying standards or experiences with service quality among respondents. 
 
For the Empathy dimension, the item with the smallest gap (-0.58) is ""The company's personnel were friendly to you."" 
This suggests that respondents perceived the company's personnel to be generally friendly, meeting their expectations 
to some extent. Conversely, the item with the largest gap (-0.84) is ""The company has convenient working hours for 
you."" This indicates a substantial difference between respondents' expectations and their perception of the convenience 
of the company's working hours. This difference might be influenced by respondents' varying schedules or preferences 
regarding service availability. 
 
Finally, in the Security dimension, the item with the smallest gap (-0.57) is ""You received quick and efficient service 
from the company's employees."" This suggests that respondents perceived the service delivery by company employees 
to be relatively quick and efficient, aligning well with their expectations. However, the item with the largest gap (-
0.91) is ""The behavior of the company's personnel conveys confidence to you."" This indicates a significant difference 
between respondents' expectations and their perception of the confidence conveyed by company personnel. This 
difference might stem from variations in the demeanor or professionalism of personnel across different interactions 
or contexts. 
 
It was observed that the gap with the greatest deficit was security and the dimension of tangible elements was the best 
scored. However, using the weight of the dimensions, it was observed that the dimension that most negatively 
influenced the quality-of-service index was the reliability dimension, but not the security dimension as seen with 
normal gaps. This is because the reliability dimension has a greater weight for customers, this being the greatest 
weakness of the company's service. On the other hand, according to the weighted gaps, the dimension with the best 
results was the dimension of tangible elements; This being its strong point. 
 
In the current study, it was found that the item with the largest negative gap is item #19, belonging to the security 
dimension, with a gap of -13.49. This aligns with Baffour-Awuah (2018) finding regarding the importance of security 
as a critical dimension in assessing service quality. However, while Baffour-Awuah (2018) study does not provide 
specific information about the performance of the security dimension relative to other dimensions, in the current study 
it is observed that despite the security dimension having the largest gap, it is the reliability dimension that most 
negatively influences the service quality index, with a gap of -15.69, according to the weight assigned by customers. 
 
Additionally, in both studies, the tangible elements dimension yielded the best results in terms of gaps. In the current 
study, the item with the smallest gap in this dimension was ""Material elements were visually attractive and 
informative,"" with a gap of -0.26, while the item with the largest gap was ""The company's personnel had a neat

Abstract 
Due to the complexity of social systems, there is a need to understand and experiment with them. Simulation platforms 
provide a modeled environment where people can conduct controlled experiments and make decisions about a specific 
problem, observing the effects of those decisions on the system. System dynamics offers a tool for the construction of 
these simulation platforms. In this paper, the identification of available simulation platforms in system dynamics was 
performed, along with an analysis of their advantages and challenges. To achieve this, a systematic literature review 
was employed to identify and analyze existing platforms in system dynamics, focusing on their characteristics, 
advantages and challenges. In the results of this literature review, 47 system dynamics simulation platforms were 
found. The advantages of these simulators are manifold: they serve as powerful tools to enhance the understanding of 
complex systems, facilitate experimentation within virtual environments, aid in decision-making processes across 
various domains, and offer the possibility to evaluate strategies or policies aimed at improving the systems involved. 
On the other hand, some of the challenges identified in the literature review include limited data availability for 
constructing these simulators, the prerequisite of initial system knowledge for simulator users, and the difficulty of 
making generalizations regarding the systems analyzed by these platforms. The literature review presented in this 
article will ensure a detailed understanding of the current landscape of simulation platforms, highlighting their 
importance in informed decision making in complex systems.

Abstract 
The Chilean wine industry has evolved over decades, propelling Chile to become the leading exporter in Latin America 
and fourth globally, with revenues exceeding USD 2 billion annually. There are over 130,000 hectares dedicated to 
vine cultivation, yielding an annual wine production of 13 million hectoliters. Moreover, this industry contributes 
0.5% to the GDP and generates over 100,000 direct jobs. However, the decrease in global wine consumption and the 
sustained increase in production costs in Chile have affected the profitability of this industry and have prioritized the 
control and reduction of operational costs. The final filtration of wine is one of the most critical stages within the 
production process, as it ensures the quality and microbiological stability of the wine during the bottling process. This 
stage is characterized by high uncertainty due to the nature, type, and concentration of particles that the wine may 
contain. To evaluate the particle content and its impact, comprehensive indicators are used based on physical analysis 
of samples through filtration tests on a laboratory scale, which requires trained technicians dedicated to conducting 
these analyses. Additionally, the high solids content in the wine during its elaboration only allows these methods to 
be used once the wine is clarified and ready for bottling. This does not allow for early production planning or may 
result in differences in productivity and costs compared to what was planned. This research aims to contribute to 
operational decision-making by using comprehensive indicators in the final wine filtration stage. To achieve this, the 
level of adoption of these methods in the Chilean industry is studied, the importance of their use for decision-makers 
is characterized, and a machine learning model is proposed to estimate their value throughout the production process.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 is characterized by the agility and flexibility that new technologies can provide to production processes 
based on automation and integrating two systems. Despite this, human operators remain essential due to their 
creativity, dynamics, and adaptability, which make them difficult to replace. In this sense, human-robot collaboration 
systems or augmented intelligence technologies emerge as promising approaches by integrating the human and 
technological capabilities of industry 4.0. to achieve superior performance. This panorama motivates research on 
current collaboration systems between humans and machines. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 
scientific research on human-machine collaboration systems in Industry 4.0. For this objective, the Scopus platform 
was used as a database, and the VOSviewer software was used for analysis. Key findings reveal important 
publications, implications, and trends in human-robot collaboration systems. In particular, it was observed that there 
is a growing interest in ergonomic aspects, the safety and well-being of workers, together with technical efficiency. 
Assembly line applications are prominent and leverage human-digital synergy to improve decision-making.

1. Introduction
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), has been characterized by the automation of 
production systems and the use of intelligent technologies in the industry, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big 
Data, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Cloud Computing, and Virtual 
Simulation, which offer organizational gains, agility, and process standardization to companies (Felippes et al. 2022); 
(alamede and Akkari 2020). However, these technologies do not replace the role of the operator in companies, as the 
operator still plays an important role within the industry, mainly due to their decision-making capacity and flexibility 
characteristics not yet reproduced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) (PERUZZINI et al. 2019); (Simoes et al. 2020). 
Nevertheless, it has been evidenced that the implementation of I4.0 technologies in productive environments generates 
more demands in terms of training levels and skills, which consequently requires greater commitment and effort on 
the part of the operators to accompany the changes in workflow and ensure process optimization (Adel 2022); (Flores 
and Xu 2018). Thus, the relationship between humans and new technologies has become the subject of study to

Analyzing the content of these ten publications in more detail is evident in aspects such as ergonomics, human factors, 
and safety in human-robot collaboration. On the other hand, the automation of industrial processes and improving 
operational efficiency are also studied, with a special interest in adaptive learning systems and the continuous 
improvement of human and machine skills. Furthermore, among the list of these ten most cited documents, the 
appearance of ""Gualtieri, Luca"", ""Rauch, Erwin"" and ""Vidoni, Renato"" stands out, who are part of the list of the 10 
most relevant authors according to their number of contributions, which strengthens the findings shown above. In 
addition, this analysis shows us other names to consider as relevant authors since a document's citations can indicate 
the research's importance and quality. 
 
4   Conclusions and Future Research 
This article reviews some indicators of the published literature on human-robot collaboration systems in Industry 
4.0. The study identified important publications on the main implications of these systems, applications, and 
technologies most explored in this regard. It also identified the most used keywords related to the main query terms, 
authors, and relevant countries, through mapping the research of the last six years by the academic world. The 
research provides opportunities to address gaps in research areas in their early stages and highlights trends and major 
contributions to date. In other aspects, it was possible to identify the terms most frequently associated with the search 
keywords in the analyzed research. The groups of keywords suggest significant trends toward the study of ergonomic 
and safety aspects and worker well-being, in addition to technical efficiency, in implementing human-robot 
collaboration systems. Also, these systems seem to be being explored with greater interest for applications on 
assembly lines, thanks to the combination of human and digital capabilities to improve operators' decision-making. 
Future research suggests incorporating other databases into our sample as an additional avenue to guarantee greater 
confidence in the results. Future work could also further explore the trends found in this work.

Abstract 
In the dynamic landscape of modern manufacturing, optimizing supply chain sustainability has emerged as a paramount 
concern for companies seeking to balance profitability with environmental and social responsibility. This multifaceted 
challenge involves processes, stakeholders, and resources required in sourcing, production, and distribution across global 
supply chains. As industries strive to reduce carbon footprints, minimize waste, and maintain ethical standards, the need 
for effective strategies to navigate these complexities becomes increasingly pressing. In this context, our analysis aims to 
explore and evaluate a range of strategies aimed at enhancing supply chain sustainability within the manufacturing sector. 
Through a comprehensive examination of criteria analyzed from the existing literature, we seek to prioritize strategic 
approaches as drivers of operational efficiency while promoting long-term sustainability across the supply chain 
ecosystem. To achieve this goal, we propose a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) procedure to identify the most 
effective strategies for enhancing supply chain sustainability, accounting for trade-offs under the considered criteria. 
Leveraging expert-based insights, our framework aims to represent a flexible procedure for different manufacturing 
contexts, empowering organizations to advancing sustainability goals.

1. Introduction
In the realm of manufacturing, sustainability within supply chain operations stands as a crucial pillar dictating the 
trajectory of industries. Its significance transcends mere operational efficiency, extending into the realms of 
environmental preservation, social equity, and economic resilience. Every link of global supply chains holds the 
potential for profound impact, be it on natural ecosystems, local communities, or the bottom line of business 
organizations. By promoting sustainable practices in supply chain operations, manufacturers take the commitment to 
reducing their ecological footprint, striving to minimize resource depletion, pollution, and carbon emissions inherent in 
traditional industrial practices. Moreover, such initiatives refer to the aspect of social responsibility, including fair labor 
practices, ethical sourcing, and community engagement. The role of sustainability in supply chains arises from 
pragmatic considerations as well, as embracing sustainable practices improves operational efficiency while protecting 
businesses from such risks as those posed by volatile commodity prices, regulatory shifts, and disruptions in the global 
marketplace. Furthermore, in an era where consumer preferences increasingly skew towards environmentally and 
socially conscious products, sustainability emerges as an effective driver of market differentiation and brand loyalty.  
1.1. 
Objectives and structure 
The general goal of this research consists in exploring and evaluating strategies aimed at enhancing supply chain 
sustainability within the manufacturing sector, prioritizing operational efficiency and long-term sustainability. To such 
an aim, we will be pursuing the following intermediate goals. 
•
Conducting an examination of criteria related to supply chain sustainability, drawn from existing literature.
•
Identifying a range of strategies for enhancing supply chain sustainability within the manufacturing sector
considered as effective in literature.

The alternative with associated minimum VIKOR index Q𝑖𝑖 (in our case, S2) represents the most suitable compromise 
solution only if the condition of acceptable advantage and the condition of acceptable stability (Carpitella, 2024) are 
simultaneously met. As this is not the case, both alternatives S2 and S10 (i.e., the alternative ranked second in the Q-
based ranking list) are selected as compromise solutions to be prioritized. In other terms, within the set of considered 
strategies, S2 and S10 represent the best trade-off when simultaneously maximizing criteria of environmental impact, 
social responsibility, economic feasibility, and regulatory compliance. This has interesting practical implications. 
 
• 
S2, renewable energy adoption. Adopting such a strategy offers several advantages to manufacturing 
companies for sustainable supply chain management, such as long-term cost savings, environmental benefits, and 
energy security. The implementation process encompasses conducting thorough energy audits, making strategic 
investments in renewable technologies, forging partnerships with energy providers, educating employees, and 
implementing rigorous performance monitoring mechanisms to ensure enduring success in supply chain sustainability. 
 
• 
S10, continuous improvement and innovation. Adopting such a strategy holds significant promise for 
sustainable supply chain management from manufacturing companies, offering enhanced operational efficiency, 
product quality, and market competitiveness. This approach requires the establishment of a culture of innovation 
throughout the whole organization, implementing systematic processes for continuous improvement, investing in 
research and development, empowering employees to contribute ideas, as well as investing on new technologies. 
Through this strategic focus on innovation and improvement, manufacturing companies can achieve sustained success 
in optimizing their supply chain operations while meeting evolving customer demands and market trends (Figure 1).

Conclusions and Future Research 
In contemporary manufacturing, optimizing supply chain sustainability is paramount for achieving numerous critical 
objectives. Through a thorough analysis of criteria and sustainable strategic alternatives drawn from existing literature, 
this paper proposes an MCDM approach to rank these alternatives by identifying those that predominantly enhance 
operational efficiency across the supply chain ecosystem. To achieve this aim, we employ the VIKOR technique, which

facilitates reaching a final solution based on specified criteria: environmental impact, social responsibility, economic 
feasibility, and regulatory compliance. Findings of this study highlight the potential of renewable energy adoption and 
continuous improvement and innovation for sustainable supply chain management within manufacturing firms, offering 
noticeable enhancements in operational efficiency, product quality, and market competitiveness. The proposed MCDM-
based approach is adaptable to various manufacturing contexts, empowering organizations to pursue sustainability goals 
tailored to their specific needs. It is important to note that results derived from the application of the VIKOR technique 
have been obtained by quantitatively translating subjective evaluations of input provided by an expert in the field. 
Therefore, outcomes may vary depending on different stakeholders. In future research, we aim to broaden the decision-
making panel by including experts from diverse backgrounds to minimize subjectivity in input data. Additionally, 
sensitivity analyses could be implemented by varying criteria weights, or integrating another MCDM approach for more 
precise weight calculation.

Abstract 
Steelpan (or pan) is recognized as Trinidad and Tobago's national musical instrument. The flat portion of a steel drum 
is deformed during the sinking process, producing the bowl for the playing surface. This paper presents a three-
pronged methodology that aims to improve this sinking process. The approach comprised the development of 
procedures identifying sheet deformation properties; examination of dynamic loads carried by hammers onto both 
surface strain and dimple depth; and describing the optimum hammer criteria. This methodology encompasses the 
development of procedures and tools to identify and simulate sheet metal strains and hammer dynamics. Sheet metal 
testing standards were employed in conjunction with a custom-built jig and fixture to measure surface strains. The 
creation of a finite element analysis (FEA) modeling dynamic interactions between hammer and sheet was facilitated 
by a COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. The paper provided sample results for both simulated and experimental tests. 
A sensitivity analysis was recommended to reduce strain offset errors using the Taguchi method. This preliminary 
work to develop a methodology laid the groundwork for evaluating hammer geometry. It encourages exploration with 
diverse materials and impact settings, understanding of the dynamic interplay for improving the quality of the sinking 
process in the pan industry.

1. Introduction
This section provides a contextual foundation for the research, outlining the rational, aims and objectives for setting 
the stage to provoke a revolution to promote the need for an official work standard to manufacture the pan. The 
standard is envisioned to be a cornerstone for preserving the rich cultural heritage embedded in the efforts of the 
historical events leading to continue the great successes of the pan industry. 
1.1 Background 
The pan, recognized as Trinidad and Tobago’s national musical instrument, maintains cultural significance, and has 
sustained the attention of a global audience. The pan industry manufacturing practises comprise a series of adjustable 
steps that depend on the choice of equipment and techniques passed on from the specialists. The pan has customarily 
been produced with newly fabricated mild steel drums but in most cases the industry would use recycled drums.

its appeal to new markets. The establishment of a standardized practice has the potential to bolster the industry’s 
credibility, supporting innovative growth opportunities and a sustainable manufacturing practice in the long term. 
5.3 Economic Analysis 
Potential savings for the pan industry may result from improved production efficiency, reduced waste, and an 
enhanced product. A qualitative analysis of the economics to adopt the proposed methodology shows a potential for 
cost savings at the initial investment and operational stages. It also allows manufacturers to identify areas for 
optimization and cost reduction, thereby maximizing the return on investment and assuring product reliability. For 
example, initial investment costs may include expenses in the procedure to approve a new hammer design. Rather 
than performing physical tests, a simulation alternative lowers research and development costs without compromising 
the lead time to introduce a new hammer to the manufacturing line. Additionally, the methodology promotes industry 
innovations through the exploration of improved hammer and raw materials for the instrument with potential for 
reduced sheet failures, faster production time, safety advancements and an acoustically consistent musical product.  
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
Additional adjustments to the parameters, meshing schemes, and material representations in the simulation will be 
carried out based on the knowledge gathered after the validation stage. To better align the virtual representation with 
the intricate dynamics seen in the real experiment, this effort would strive to use the iterative nature of the optimization 
process. Despite the present restriction of employing just one type of material, future studies aim to establish the strain 
behaviors for different hammer and sheet material alternatives with the hope of adapting new materials to the industry.  
6. Conclusions  
This research intricately navigated the dynamic nuances inherent in the pan formation process, unraveling the complex 
interplay of excitation forces, mass, stiffness, and displacement reactions, embracing both elastic and plastic 
deformations. This methodology attempts to integrate the insights from the pan's formation into a comprehensive 
dynamic framework modeling nonlinear strain behavioral patterns for the evaluation of sinking tools.  
 
Through meticulous simulations, a discernible relationship emerges between the displacement and strain of the blank, 
revealing insights into the dynamic characteristics of the pan manufacturing process. The focus on dimple depth and 
strains provides an understanding that serves as the root of the study's contribution to the standardization of the pan. 
The core of the methodology involves a meticulous examination of the impact of varying hammer diameters on the 
performance of a steel sheet. This investigation yields valuable information crucial for the design and optimization of 
sinking hammers, with a specific aim to achieve desired strain regimes essential in pan sinking. The controlled impact 
forces, coupled with the variations in hammer diameters, generate a dataset for selecting the most suitable hammer 
diameter, offering practical and applicable insights for the pan industry. The methodology as a guide for the pan 
industry should foster a culture for precision and efficiency in crafting pans. The intention through the lens of this 
methodology was to encourage the advancement and continued application of science and engineering in pan.  
 
To enhance the hammer’s performance in terms of diameter, strategic opportunities for improvement can be explored. 
Firstly, a thorough evaluation of the hammer’s design, especially for larger contact diameters, becomes critical. This 
entails refining the shape and composition to mitigate erratic strain reactions observed at a 100 mm diameter. 
Adjustments to the profile or surface modifications may help minimize frictional forces during the hammer’s descent 
onto the blank. Secondly, optimizing impact dynamics would be essential for achieving a smoother and more 
predictable strain response. Fine-tuning weight distribution, surface finish, or impact angles could ensure a more 
uniform strain distribution across the sheet. Lastly, insights from the sensitivity analysis using the Taguchi method 
together with the Analysis of Variance Method can inform targeted enhancements in the hammer design, considering 
factors affecting the variables that significantly influence strain behavior. By systematically adjusting parameters 
based on these insights, the goal would be to achieve a more consistent and efficient sinking process.

Abstract 
The growing trend in the southern hemisphere of incorporating workers with lower educational levels into the informal 
economy has raised concerns, especially in Colombia, where between 50% and 74% of workers lack adequate 
contractual conditions. There is a close relationship between informality and the educational level, with informal 
employment being the one that hosts the largest proportion of people with low levels of education, generating 
conditions of poverty or economic vulnerability, especially in Latin America. The construction sector, vital for GDP 
and employment, attracts workers with little academic training, raising concerns about occupational health, 
occupational risks, and informality. The objective of this article is to present statistics of occupational accidents in the 
formal sector in various regions of the country, through a correlation between accidents in the formal and informal 
sector and to make a statistical inference where the accident rate in the informal sector is established, raising the 
urgency of specific strategies to improve the working conditions of workers in this sector.

1. Introduction
In developing countries, it is common to observe that people's everyday activities often involve risky conditions. For 
example, moving through the streets is often done under conditions that frequently involve breaking traffic rules, 
affecting personal safety. In contrast, in developed countries, compliance with these rules is more evident and observed 
more frequently. Although several factors determine this human behavior, education plays a crucial role in shaping 
actions that reduce risks for individuals. 
Now, in addition to this behavior, there are intrinsic risks associated with carrying out a particular job in the workplace. 
This field, dominated by occupational health, presents significant challenges, some related to the prior knowledge that 
the individual brings, others through collective awareness, and finally those specifically concerning the contracted 
work and the environmental exposure of the worker. While it is true that global interest in the knowledge and 
management of occupational health has increased, the figures for accidents, mortality, and working conditions present 
a challenge to overcome. Therefore, nine years after the formulation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals outlined 
by the United Nations, coupled with post-pandemic conditions and economic setbacks, achieving Goal 8 gains greater 
momentum, addressing the topic of ""Decent Work and Economic Growth"". 
The United Nations conceptualizes decent work as opportunities for all individuals to obtain productive employment 
that generates adequate income, can be carried out in safe conditions, and provides social protection for families, while

Finally, Table 2 presents the current state of the construction sector regarding accidents and mortality since the year 
2019. It can be observed that in terms of accidents, it has been decreasing, ranking No 6. As for mortality, by the year 
2023, it held the 4th position out of approximately 22 in total, reaching values close to those prior to the pandemic. 
However, a larger amount of data is required to establish clear relationships or trends.

6. Conclusion 
The study on occupational health in Colombia’s construction industry sheds light on the formidable challenges 
confronting workers in this sector. Several key conclusions emerge from the analysis. 
 
Firstly, the prevalence of non-standard employment arrangements, particularly in the informal sector, significantly 
impacts the health and safety of workers. Informal workers often lack access to essential safety measures, adequate 
training, and health benefits, accentuating disparities in protection. Effective policy interventions are imperative to 
rectify these inequities and ensure the well-being of all workers. 
 
Secondly, the study underscores the detrimental effects of poor working conditions on the health outcomes of 
construction workers. Factors such as prolonged working hours, physical exertion, and exposure to hazardous

materials contribute to adverse health outcomes. Enhancing working conditions is pivotal not only for mitigating 
health risks but also for enhancing overall productivity and well-being. 
 
Moreover, wage disparities persist between formal and informal sectors, with informal workers receiving lower pay 
and fewer legal protections. Bridging these gaps through targeted policies is essential for promoting equitable 
treatment and safeguarding workers’ rights. 
 
Furthermore, the high incidence of work-related accidents poses a significant challenge in the construction industry. 
Addressing this issue requires robust safety protocols, comprehensive training programs, and stringent enforcement 
mechanisms. Collaboration among government agencies, employers, and workers is paramount to effectively mitigate 
risks and ensure a safer working environment. 
 
Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of balancing economic growth with worker well-being. While 
Colombia’s economic development hinges on the construction sector, prioritizing worker health and safety is 
indispensable for fostering sustainable growth. Policies must strike a delicate balance between economic interests and 
worker protection to uphold both prosperity and welfare. 
 
In summary, targeted interventions, enhanced regulations, and awareness campaigns are imperative to create a safer 
and healthier environment for construction workers in Colombia. By addressing these pressing issues, Colombia can 
nurture a thriving construction industry while safeguarding the welfare of its workforce.

Abstract 
The main objective of this research was to implement an improvement in the maintenance system of a company, to 
reduce these costs and increase the useful life of the machines because they exceed the established budget (9.12% 
compared to the 6% budgeted). To achieve this, a maintenance plan was proposed based on the RCM (Reliability 
Centered Maintenance) methodology, taking a telescopic crane as a sample to demonstrate potential improvements in 
both the crane's performance and the efficiency of the company in general. After the application, maintenance costs 
were reduced from 9.12% to 8%, which represents an improvement of 24.13%. In addition, a significant decrease in 
the average failure rate was observed by 21.54%. Crane availability also improved 19.7%. Finally, the Mean Time 
Between Stops (MTBS) improved by 41.2%, demonstrating that the implementation of the improvement proposal has 
been highly favorable for the company.

1. Introduction
At the beginning of 2022, Peru showed signs that the market is growing. An example of this is that the unemployment 
rate has experienced an improvement, going from 14.5% in 2021 to 8.9% at the beginning of 2022 (INEI 2022). 
Likewise, the construction sector showed growth between January and May of 0.74%, due to an increase in 
construction projects (Vásquez 2022).  To meet this demand for projects, equipment is needed that not all companies 
in the sector necessarily have, which is where the various SMEs offer the rental of heavy machinery.  
Furthermore, it is mentioned that these companies represented more than 99.6% of the total, contributing 27.9% to 
GDP and made up more than 59% of the country's workforce before the pandemic (Gonzales 2021). Is “It is striking 
that the heavy machinery rental service is a business idea that presents very good projections for the following years. 
According to Ramírez (2022), this idea is reinforced due to the global situation, which will limit the supply of new 
equipment, causing companies that wish to continue with their projects to have to rent the type of machinery they 
need”. 
The best way to keep equipment in good condition is by applying methods that ensure its quality, such as a correct 
maintenance system, in addition to the reduction of costs by the interested company. 
The justification of the research is practical, this is because the purpose is to improve the useful life of the machinery 
thanks to a proposal for improvement in the maintenance system considering the data provided by the company and 
applying tools based on the RCM philosophy. (reliability-based maintenance). In addition to improving the 
maintenance system to obtain efficient management to reduce maintenance costs.

a significant reduction in the percentage of use of total sales was achieved, which means that the company recorded 
considerable savings. It should also be considered that the sample unit was a telescopic crane, and the population is 
10 units, which indicates that only with the sample of 10% of the implementation has been reduced, in monetary terms, 
a value of S/74,233.90 soles. 
 
4. Discussion 
The maintenance area has been identified as a critical area within the company, considering the business sector to 
which it belongs. This is inefficient since preventive maintenance is not carried out in accordance with the 
manufacturer's minimum requirements. The main problem of high maintenance costs is poor management of the 
maintenance system since, according to the problems evidenced, such as poor budget allocation, lack of staff training, 
non-compliance with the maintenance management system, it originates because the company It does not monitor, 
control, nor does it have qualified personnel for the documentation of the maintenance system, nor for its control. 
The MTBS and MTBR indicators increased, meaning that the average times between shutdowns and repairs, 
respectively, are higher compared to the previous quarter, indicating a lower number of shutdowns and repairs. In 
addition, from a financial point of view, the company had a positive impact on costs. The use of the maintenance 
budget with respect to total sales was calculated at 8%, which represents a significant improvement, decreasing by 
1.41% compared to the previous year. This reduction in maintenance costs is largely due to the decrease in telescopic 
crane breakdowns. 
 
During the development of this research, some limitations were identified. First, the lack of documentation needed to 
fully implement the RCM methodology was found to be a critical limitation. It is suggested to focus on strengthening 
the collection and organization of important documentation for future research. In addition, the initial state of the 
company's maintenance management was found to be deficient in terms of compliance with the standards set by the 
manufacturer. This limited the performance of the measurements and the analysis of the results. As a suggestion, to 
overcome this limitation, it is advisable to strengthen the maintenance database ensuring that it is updated and 
complete. 
 
Following the results of this work, the effectiveness of the tools used is confirmed by the coincidences observed with 
previous works. A similarity observed in the research of Giuria-Farías. (2022) after the application of a maintenance 
plan based on RCM, they managed to improve this indicator by 20.29%, while in this research an improvement of 
approximately 23.36% is expected. In addition, in the research of Patit. (2022) they use the FMECA tool that allowed 
them to find common failures in their object of study, which is the same as in this work. Thanks to the use of this tool, 
it was possible to generate strategies that allow the correct management of resources, which resulted in an 
improvement in the maintenance costs of both workplaces. Something similar occurs in the work of Keynia. (2022), 
which although they do not mention an exact percentage of improvement, presents improvements in the reliability 
index, which was 7.1% and 5.66% with respect to the indicators used, while in this work the reliability indicator 
improved by 21.54% after the implementation of the improvement proposal. Finally, in the research of Gholami 
(2022), 4 critical aspects for a maintenance system are named. The valuation given in fields such as the cost of the 
RCM methodology is higher than all the others, a fact that agrees with the budget established by the company studying 
this work. The 6% of sales dedicated to equipment maintenance represents a significant amount. The same applies to 
the other areas: safety, added value and flexibility. In these areas, the RCM methodology is also ahead of other 
methodologies, as demonstrated in this application. From the safety point of view, an indicator such as equipment 
reliability increased to 88.75%, the added value and flexibility of the RCM gives the proposed plan the possibility to 
model and improve it over time. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The company investigated had an inefficient maintenance system, with little internal documentation, a basic 
information database, little experience of the operators and inefficient communication between areas and people 
present for the maintenance activity. This was modified after the implementation of the improvement proposal, where 
these situations are reversed through the application of tools such as FMECA and the implementation of new 
documents such as corrective and preventive maintenance records. It has been found that the indicator of Mean Time 
Between Stoppages increased to 200 hours, which indicates that every 200 hours the machine is likely to have a 
maintenance stop, considering the difference with the period 2022 which was 141 hours, which means an increase of 
59 hours.

Finding the most common faults was determined to be critical to the effective operation of the new maintenance 
system. Knowing that the most frequent failures are related to engine starting and hydraulic fluid leaks facilitates the 
prevention and resolution of these equipment problems. This is achieved through the combined use of the FMECA 
tool and the decision diagram, which provide clear guidance for taking appropriate action. 
 
Improvements were identified in the key indicators of the maintenance process. Availability increased by 14.06%, 
reaching a value of 85.42%, which benefits the company since it has more hours available to use the machinery; the 
next indicator that has increased satisfactorily is the MTBS. The MTBR decreased to 29 hours, which indicates that 
repair times have decreased and therefore a greater availability time is obtained. On the other hand, Reliability 
increased by 15.73%, which indicates that the unit is restored to optimal operating conditions once the unit is out of 
service due to a failure in a more efficient manner. It is concluded that the proposed improvement in the maintenance 
system will reduce current costs, bringing them closer to the values that the company established from the beginning. 
Its value went from S/. 480,320 (9.12% of sales) decrease to 8%. Finally, the reduction in monetary terms was 1.41 
% of sales, equivalent to S/. 74,233.9.

Abstract 
Global Peacekeeping Operations are challenging worldwide. There are currently several active operations, which are 
planned, managed and supplied by the existing centers located in Europe. Due to the context always being within a 
humanitarian condition, the challenges encountered in the supply chain can be greater than the conventional logistics 
of the business sector. For this reason, it is necessary to study the permanent and current demands and analyze 
possibilities for improvement in order to have greater efficiency, mainly, in the supply of final destinations. This work 
studies the factors with the highest degree of demand determination in humanitarian logistics, so that the relevance 
and possible location to host an additional warehouse is evaluated, redistributing the current demand, which proposes 
a faster and more efficient supply chain.

Abstract 
The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) necessitates innovative approaches to develop efficient and 
lightweight components. This article presents a comprehensive investigation into the design and structural analysis 
of driveshafts for EVs, with a focus on utilizing Aluminum Alloy 7075 as the primary material. The design process 
prioritized critical factors affecting driveshaft performance, including torque transmission, torsional and shear stress 
considerations and dynamic behavior. A comparative evaluation with Steel SM45C was conducted, considering 
parameters such as equivalent elastic strain, equivalent stress, total deformation and maximum shear stress. The 
results showed that Aluminum Alloy 7075 exhibited higher deformation and stress under applied loads, emphasizing 
the significance of material properties in ensuring structural integrity. Additionally, modal analysis, the natural 
frequencies and mode shapes were investigated for both materials. The findings revealed varying natural 
frequencies, with Steel SM45C displaying slightly lower values in most modes, indicating its potential for better 
resistance to vibration-induced fatigue and resonant frequencies. It is recommendedthat testing should be done to 
validate the findings and experimentation with hybrid materials to optimize weight, strength, and durability. By 
comprehensively examining both static and dynamic behaviours, this research offers vital insights for designing 
driveshafts that meet the unique demands of electric vehicles.

5. Conclusion  
Drive shafts of an electric vehicle using Aluminum Alloy 7075 and Steel SM45C were analysed. The investigation 
comprised static analysis and modal analysis to evaluate the structural and dynamic characteristics of both materials. 
The obtained results provided valuable insights into the behaviour of the driveshafts under various loading and 
vibration conditions. 
 
In the static analysis, the total deformation, equivalent stress, equivalent elastic strain, and maximum shear stress 
were compared between Aluminum Alloy 7075 and Steel SM45C. The results revealed that Aluminum Alloy 7075 
exhibited higher total deformation, equivalent stress, and equivalent elastic strain compared to Steel SM45C. 
However, the maximum shear stress was also higher in Aluminum Alloy 7075. These findings indicate that the 
Aluminum Alloy driveshaft experienced more deformation and stress under the applied loads, potentially affecting 
its overall structural integrity. 
 
Modal analysis was performed to investigate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the driveshaft materials. 
The natural frequencies are crucial indicators of the driveshaft's ability to withstand dynamic loading conditions. 
The results indicated that both materials had different natural frequencies across multiple modes. Steel SM45C 
displayed slightly lower natural frequencies compared to Aluminum Alloy 7075 in most modes. This suggests that 
the Aluminum Alloy 7075 driveshaft might have a better resistance to vibration-induced fatigue and resonant 
frequencies.

Abstract 
The present work seeks to increase the level of illuminance in the district of Santiago de Surco, which is below the 
minimum required by regulations. The methodology used is Lean Six Sigma, which begins with the “Define” phase, 
where data collection was carried out in the five selected Surco zones, it was determined that zones 2 and 3, Jr. 
Combate de Iquique and Jr. Almirante Grau, respectively, are the ones with the lowest lux. In the next phase, 
""Measure"", it was validated that these areas have a lux level lower than the average, which according to regulations 
should be between 5 and 10 lux, identifying that only 47% of the light poles in these areas comply with the rule. In 
the ""Analyze"" phase, the focus was on identifying possible causes that could affect the quality of street lighting. These 
are the height of the pole, the condition of the lighthouse, and the type of light. Thanks to the development of a 
mathematical equation, in the improve and control phases, the potential to increase the average illuminance level has 
been identified, going from an average of 3,107 to 5,370 lux. The projected benefits are estimated at an environmental 
impact of 1,402.33 TCO2 and an annual economic impact of $34,800.00.

1. Introduction
This research work focuses on the analysis of the public lighting service in the different areas of the district of Santiago 
de Surco in Peru, recognizing the importance of the lighting of parks and avenues as a crucial role in the safety and 
welfare of the community.“While official requirements differ around the world the main principles for good street 
lighting are the same; high quality illumination that ensures clear visibility and road safety” (LEDiL n.d.), For this 
reason, here in Peru, there is the Norma Técnica DGE “Alumbrado de Vías Públicas en Zonas de Concesión de 
Distribución”, which establishes standards to guarantee adequate conditions in terms of luminosity and visibility 
(Ministerio de Energía y Minas 2002). This standard was approved by Supreme Decree No. 020-97-EM, which 
establishes the guidelines for the quality control of electrical services, including public lighting (Decreto Supremo N° 
020-97-EM 1997).
The “Defensoría del Pueblo” in Peru, is an autonomous constitutional body that oversees the rights of citizens (La 
República 2021). According to a report by la Defensoría del Pueblo (2015), this district was among those that 
registered a high number of citizen complaints about poor street lighting. We noticed that, despite this situation, the 
authorities had addressed the problems of the other districts with the exception of Santiago de Surco. Therefore, we 
decided to focus the research on this district to evaluate if there has been any improvement in this aspect up to the 
present date. 
In Peru, Luz del Sur S.A.A is the company in charge of distributing energy in more than 60 districts of Metropolitan 
Lima, including the district of Santiago de Surco, which is the focus of study for this research, this company is in 
charge of correct maintenance and operation in the different concession areas seeking to improve the quality of life of 
its clients (Luz del Sur 2023). For this reason, this work is mainly directed at this company in its capacity as responsible

5.3 Carbon offset benefits 
Carbon credits are essentially trading permits that represent the elimination or prevention of the emission of one metric 
ton of carbon dioxide or other equivalent greenhouse gases. According to a technical note issued by the Ministry of 
Economy and Finance - MEF of Peru (2023), the social price of carbon has been established at US $7.17 for each ton 
of CO2 emitted in Peru. This measure allows the costs and benefits associated with reducing or increasing greenhouse 
gas emissions to be taken into account in economic evaluations. However, the IMF proposes a minimum price of 
US$25 per ton of carbon, in order to meet the goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees (Chateau et al. 2022). 
Therefore, it will be this price that we will consider for the calculations. 
 
Based on this information, it is estimated in Table 7 that the monthly benefit from changing from mercury to LED in 
Santiago de Surco is $725, which means an annual benefit of $8,700 and the same analysis applies to sodium lights.

6.Conclusion 
The project “Quality of Public Lighting using Lean Six Sigma” in Surco, Lima, Peru, managed to increase the average 
illuminance of light poles from 3.107 to 5.37 lux, meeting the minimum level required by the standard. Likewise, in 
order to reach the goal defined in the project, results were obtained for each of the 5 phases. In the define phase, it 
was determined that the problem is low lighting on Jirón Combate de Iquique and Jirón Combate de Angamos avenues 
in the Santiago de Surco district. Then, in the Measure phase, it was statistically obtained that the measurements of 
the Lux of the posts that were measured on average is 3.107 which is below the minimum which is between 5 - 10 
lux, according to the Standard, classifying them according to the type of footwear. and collector. In the analyze phase, 
six possible causes were identified, and after statistical tests, the significant ones were: the condition of the lighthouse, 
the type of light and the height of the pole. 
 
For the improve phase, a regression analysis was carried out, eliminating three less significant factors, which are: 
distance between posts (m), tree interference and pastoral condition, obtaining a mathematical equation with an R2 
around 90%, which It allows us to establish the ideal conditions so that the illuminance level in lux improves. 
 
Finally, in the control phase, the comparison of the lighting before and after the project is carried out. The improvement 
is evident because higher lighting levels and less variation in the lighting of all the posts are obtained at the ideal Lux. 
However, a greater environmental impact is evident, so in the last part it is proposed to change to LED lights, 
evidencing the savings in tons of CO2 eq that will be emitted annually, thanks to this comprehensive approach it will 
allow optimizing lighting and will contribute to the improvement general public lighting and the quality of life of 
citizens.

Abstract 
This study aims to identify the significant variables influencing commuters' intention to use the NFC tag payment 
system in the Marikina Heights UV Express Terminal. Using theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM) and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), two key constructs—user constructs and DOI elements—were extracted 
to determine the significant variables affecting commuters' intention toward the NFC tag payment system. This study 
used survey research as the data collection method. It utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling 
(PLS-SEM) as the mode of data analysis to provide the significance and relationships of the identified variables from 
the research framework. The PLS-SEM analysis revealed that Compatibility has the only significant effect on the 
intention to use, with a p-value of 0.032. Furthermore, Observability did not significantly affect the intention to use. 
The model used was fit, with a Standard Root Mean Square Residual value of 0.073 and a Normed Fit Index (NFI) 
value of 0.811. The model is still acceptable, but not good.   With this, further research may add more constructs 
besides the user constructions and DOI elements to improve the current model. Therefore, it is advisable to add 
parameters to the latent variables to enhance the model.  Ultimately, the result of this study would significantly help 
public transportation, ticketing and vending industry, and financial services.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Statement
Being ranked among the worst locations in terms of public transportation, it is evident that Metro Manila's public
transport system is yet to show any promising improvements (Luna 2022). The Marikina Heights UV Express
Terminal continues to rely on its manual cash payment method. Nevertheless, the manual approach to fare collection
in a transportation terminal is deemed less efficient (Rahman et al., 2022) due to the substantial time investment
required for cash collection and handling. Henceforth, the Department of Transportation plans to switch to an
Automated Fare Collection System (AFCS) to improve passenger convenience and security (Dela Cruz 2022).
Furthermore, the efficiency of fare collection system would increase by switching from manual to AFCS, particularly
using Near Field Communication (NFC) Tag Payment System. The adoption of the NFC technology can result in
quicker, more convenient, and faster transactions. NFC payments eliminate the need for physical cash, which lowers

Enhancing transaction speed, as demonstrated by these transportation terminals, would eliminate customer waiting 
time, thus improving the efficiency and overall experience of public commuters. Hence, justifying the need for the 
product.

The findings of this study have significant implications for user behavior regarding NFC tag-based fare collection 
system in the Marikina Heights UV Express Terminal. This study uses an integrated model of Diffusion of Innovation 
(DOI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This study finds that the user constructs (NFC Payment 
Knowledge and Personal Innovativeness) have both significant influence on perceived ease of use (0.000, 0.019) and 
perceived usefulness (0.000, 0.010). This suggests that the better the knowledge of NFC-based payment systems and 
how likely users are to adapt to new technologies, the better their perception of the ease of use and usefulness of the 
system. For the successful adoption of this system, it is recommended to provide the intended users with sufficient 
knowledge on how the system works. However, the results also suggest that neither Perceived Ease of Use nor 
Perceived Usefulness affect a user’s Intention to Use, with significance values of 0.864 and 0.886, respectively. This 
is presumably due to the flexibility of the transportation fare collection system currently present, so intended users 
will think again when deciding to use a payment system, even if they receive negative news about it. This result is 
different from those of previous studies, which always have a positive influence on perceived ease of use, perceived 
usefulness, and intention to use. 
The DOI was also tested against respondents’ intention to use. Among the two elements (Compatibility and 
Observability), only Compatibility had a significant effect on Intention to Use, whereas Observability showed no 
significant effect. This indicates that the Intention to Use is influenced by the Compatibility of the technology with 
user preferences and the current situation. Therefore, it is also recommended to request user input when incorporating 
cashless technologies into public transport. The results also show that the Intention to Use the specified cashless 
technology is not influenced by how users have observed it from being used by others. 
To enhance the existing model, future studies may consider incorporating additional constructs and DOI elements. A 
higher NFI value suggests a better model fit (greater than or equal to 0.9). Therefore, it is recommended that parameters 
be added to the latent variables to improve the model.

Abstract 
Container shipping is one of the important areas in the global logistics industry, where containerisation or the use of 
containers is used as a container that serves to transport goods. It plays an important role in facilitating international 
trade, providing reliable and efficient shipping routes for a wide range of goods, from consumer products to industrial 
raw materials. With the continuous development of technology and infrastructure, container shipping must continue 
to improve in terms of speed, capacity and efficiency. Meanwhile, in loading and unloading activities, employees play 
a big role. Employees are valuable assets for the company, and maintaining their health and safety conditions is key 
to maintaining productivity and operational efficiency. This study aims to identify hazards and potential risks in 
loading and unloading operations at container terminal service company, and implement risk controls to minimise 
hazard identified in order to improve the occupational safety and health of workers. HIRARC method is an approach 
that can be used to identify potential hazards. Implementation of good OHS practices will protect employees from the 
risk of occupational injury, also reduces costs associated with work accidents. Risk control can be used as an 
improvement step. The risk of injury can be minimised by identifying potential hazards and adopting appropriate 
preventive measures, thus creating a safer and healthier working environment for all workers. By implementing OHS, 
employees can avoid the risk of accidents also increase productivity.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is the largest archipelago located in Southeast Asia, crossing two continents, Asia and Australia, and two 
oceans, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Indonesia has a strategic geographical position, which makes it a 
very important maritime country as it is located at the centre of logistics activities, one of which is container shipping. 
Container terminals are places where containers are loaded onto and discharged from containerships and key nodes in 
the sea transportation network (Lu and Yang, 2010). Facilitation of current patterns of global production and trade are 
widely recognised (Bonacich and Wilson, 2008). Container shipping is one of the important areas in the global 
logistics industry, where containerisation or the use of containers is used as a container that serves to transport goods. 
Shipping goods using containers helps transport goods around the world efficiently and safely. The process begins 
with the collection of goods at the port of origin, and then the packing of the goods to be shipped into containers. With 
the continuous development of technology and infrastructure, container shipping must continue to improve in terms 
of speed, capacity and efficiency, which plays an important role in maintaining global connectivity and international 
economic growth.  
Container loading and unloading activities are complex and risky. Apart from the risk of damage to the goods 
transported in the container, there is also the potential for harm to workers. Conventional wisdom suggests that 
arrangements for the safety and health of those who remain in employment are generally improved in comparison

5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the analysis and evaluation, the author provides a contribution in the form of recommendations 
for HSE risk control as an improvement step. It enables container terminal operators to systematically identify 
potential hazards present in their operations, ranging from manual handling of cargo to machinery operation and 
chemical exposure. By pinpointing these hazards, terminal operators can proactively mitigate risks before they escalate 
into accidents or incidents that could harm personnel, damage equipment, or impact the environment. 
 
Implementing recommendations as risk control has the impact of increasing employee safety and health. The risk of 
injury can be minimized by identifying potential hazards and adopting appropriate preventive measures, thereby 
creating a safer and healthier work environment for all workers. Apart from that, work productivity will also increase. 
Proper risk control can also increase productivity in the workplace. By reducing the likelihood of accidents and 
incidents, operators can focus on work activities without the distraction and fear of potential dangers, which can 
improve efficiency and overall performance in the workplace. Ultimately, the purpose of HIRARC in container 
terminal services is to foster a safe working environment, protect personnel, safeguard assets, and minimize the 
environmental footprint of operations.

Abstract 
The surge in demand for online delivery services, driven by the widespread adoption of smartphones and increased 
internet usage over the past decade, has profoundly transformed the e-commerce landscape. Despite the increasing 
demand, late deliveries remain a concern, with 13% of customers indicating they would not make a repeat purchase 
following a delayed delivery (Victor, 2020).  That’s why it is important for the delivery systems to have an optimized 
route and proximity-based assignment. This study focused on developing a web and mobile application delivery 
system called “Onway”, which focuses on optimizing the route, and proximity-based assignment. The system provides 
a friendly interface consistent with customer requirements utilizing tools such as Java, PHP, MySQL, and Laravel. 
The main goal was to gather insights on user experiences with delivery apps. Utilizing the FURPS model, they 
administered a survey with 20 questionnaires to 53 respondents, and it is noteworthy that the results proved to be a 
resounding success. Onway's application owes its success to a dedicated commitment to continuous improvement and 
rigorous testing. This iterative approach plays a crucial role in enhancing the application's effectiveness and efficiency, 
guaranteeing a smooth and optimized delivery experience for users.

Abstract 
The inadequate management of medical waste represents one of the current environmental challenges facing the 
planet, being a major contributor to the emergence of waste in water bodies, soil erosion, and air pollution from 
contaminating gasses. In Peru, although medical waste management is gaining increasing importance and interest as 
a health management issue, information on environmental impact measurement strategies conducted in the country 
remains very limited. Therefore, this work aims to highlight the current constraints of the medical waste management 
system in Peru, identify and select environmental management alternatives, and promote future research. Through a 
qualitative methodological design of research/action type, the Leopold Matrix is utilized to assess the environmental 
impact generated in a hospital in the country, alongside a literature review concerning current environmental 
challenges to propose strategies for mitigating the current environmental effects resulting from these impacts. 
Consequently, alternative technologies are presented, which should be identified as potential solutions and adapted to 
the various regimes and/or limitations of the country.

1. Introduction
Currently, the lack of knowledge about the main environmental impacts caused by hospital waste and its inadequate 
management generates pollutants that are harmful to the environment and increase the severity of their consequences 
over time (Akkajit et al., 2020). Developing countries face resource constraints and scarcity, making effective and 
efficient biomedical waste management impossible and/or disrupted (Shammi et al., 2022). After the emergence of 
COVID-19, the increase in the use and rapid disposal of hospital waste has generated the need to find the optimal way 
to take advantage of technologies for its disposal and treatment, known for having long decomposition periods (Ye et 
al., 2022). According to the World Health Organization (2022), 3 out of 10 health facilities lack a proper system for 
segregating medical waste. In Peru, in the city of Lima, the main public and private hospitals in the country do not 
have information on the effects and impacts of hospital activities on the environment (Bambarén & Alatrista, 2014). 
A problem that, for the authorities and institutions in charge of carrying out or planning the corresponding 
management, limits the inability to draw up environmental action plans. As a result, the country is subject to 
irreversible consequences in terms of quality of life and environmental health.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the findings from these studies underscore the importance of proper medical waste management and 
knowledge on the subject, the direct relation between improper waste disposal and environmental impact and the 
urgency of effective strategies for medical waste disposal or treatment in the actual burgeoning healthcare context. 
Through the examination of existing literature, it becomes evident that replicable environmental strategies can be 
tailored to countries facing development or socio-economic limitations, and that most of the time the applicability of 
established concepts are contingent upon governmental commitment and awareness. The current state of medical 
waste management in Lima, Peru, highlights some infrastructural deficiencies, necessitating enhanced regulatory 
measures and operational protocols to ensure safe handling and disposal. Mitigation proposals and the implementation 
of best practices, including staff training and oversight mechanisms, are imperative to safeguard environmental and 
public health. 
 
Furthermore, the mitigation proposals stated above, provides a pathway for future research, investigation and even a 
light to delimit sustainable and modern medical waste management options. In accomplishing the objectives of the 
research, the results have shed a light on current limitations of medical waste management in Peru, identified medical 
waste management alternatives and laid the groundwork for future research endeavors.

Abstract 
Organizations seek to deploy resources optimally to meet customer demand. In the case of an educational institution 
offering degree programs, student demand for course offerings may be satisfied by deploying faculty resources 
according to a long-term course schedule aka the Typical Course Offering Pattern (TCOP).   In previous work [Madan 
and Gnanendran (2020)], we have proposed a project management approach that views each student’s pathway 
through the program as a “project” requiring completion of a set of tasks (courses) with each task having a specific 
duration (semester) and, possibly, precedence requirements (prerequisites).  To make this problem tractable, the 
approach suggested looking at the problem in the aggregate (i.e., considering cohorts rather than individual students), 
akin to the well-known Sales & Operations Planning model. The scheduling problem is then equivalent to multi-
project management where the institution needs to manage multiple, simultaneous projects with outcomes that are 
measured on the traditional criteria of time and cost.  Here, we propose an extension based on the agile approach to 
project management by using an iterative lifecycle with a cadence of one semester, since the TCOP can be dynamically 
updated at the end of each semester based on the latest information about the progress being made by each cohort with 
regard to time and cost. We propose course add/delete rules that “reward” high-performing cohorts by offering greater 
flexibility in course choice, and “punish” low-performing cohorts by offering fewer course options than were in the 
original TCOP.

Abstract 
The study explores the integration of machine learning techniques (ML) to improve the composting process of organic 
waste, amid the growing global challenge of waste management. A decade-long bibliometric analysis (2013-2022) 
using the Scopus database examined the evolution and impact of ML applications on composting. Their analysis 
identified important contributions to research and emerging trends, highlighting the fundamental role of ML in 
optimizing compost production, a critical solution for managing the growing volumes of organic waste generated 
worldwide. The study revealed how ML models, including artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms, 
revolutionized composting processes by predicting, improving, and monitoring various composting parameters. In 
addition, the paper delved into the geographical distribution of research efforts, highlighting the dominance of 
countries such as China, India and the United States in this area of research. Through the analysis of 180 articles, the 
study not only mapped out the current picture of ML in composting, but also identified gaps and opportunities for 
future research. The results defended the potential of the ML to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of composting operations, thus contributing to more sustainable waste management practices. This work is a 
fundamental resource for both researchers and professionals, with the aim of harnessing the power of the ML in favour 
of the environment.

classification purposes. Support Vector Regression (SVR) functions by determining a hyperplane in an N-dimensional 
space to accurately categorize the data points. The study employed six machine learning models (MLP, RBF, SVR, 
M5P, M5R, and LR) to predict the bioavailability of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in compost-
amended soils. The ML models were evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. The models were 
graded based on their success on the training sets as follows: RBF > M5P > SVR > MLP > M5R > LR. SVR exhibited 
the third-highest performance according to the findings (Fulya et al., 2023).. 
 
Finally, we have the Decision Tree (DT), which is based on a binary partition structure in which decisions can be 
made, represented by a tree in a horizontal shape. This is very similar to a flowchart where each leaf node represents 
an attribute, and each branch represents a result. Although DT is a machine learning (ML) algorithm, it is not the most 
recommended for making predictions in the composting process since using incorrect concepts in the data can cause 
overfitting, time complexity issues, and the partitioning of continuous data shows a tendency towards attributes with 
multiple variables. The source is from Han and Gu's work published in 2009. Decision Tree (DT) is a data-driven 
machine learning paradigm where even little alterations in the data can lead to significant variations in the model's 
outcomes and overall performance. Variables having discrete values are easily separable, but those with continuous 
values present challenges in partitioning when creating decision trees. Thus, the algorithm may produce an inaccurate 
classification or regression model. (Fulya et al., 2023) 
 
6. Conclusions 
The study concluded that Machine Learning (ML) holds significant promise for enhancing the composting process of 
organic waste, addressing the urgent need for improved waste management strategies globally. By conducting a 
comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research from 2013 to 2022, it identified key trends and contributions in the 
field, emphasizing the transformative potential of ML techniques. The analysis highlighted the role of artificial neural 
networks and genetic algorithms in optimizing compost production, demonstrating their capacity to predict, improve, 
and monitor various aspects of the composting process effectively. Moreover, the geographical analysis of research 
efforts revealed a concentration of work in countries like China, India, and the United States, pointing to a global 
interest in leveraging ML for environmental sustainability. 
 
The study mapped the current landscape of ML applications in composting, uncovering both gaps and opportunities 
for future research. It advocated for the integration of ML models to significantly boost the efficiency and effectiveness 
of composting operations, contributing towards more sustainable waste management practices. The findings serve as 
a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, aiming to utilize ML's power for environmental 
sustainability. The study underscores the importance of advancing ML applications in composting to meet the 
challenges of increasing organic waste volumes worldwide.

Abstract 
The Indonesian poultry meat processing industry has grown with a positive trend. In the future, the prospects for this 
industry are expected to grow along with the increase in population and people's income. Therefore, the capacity of 
poultry meat processing factories, such as chicken nuggets and sausages, needs to be increased through an investment 
realization. In realizing an investment plan, a feasibility appraisal needs to be conducted to analyze whether or not the 
investment plan is feasible, especially from a financial aspect. In this study, a financial model has been developed 
using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to calculate financial feasibility indicators of a new poultry meat 
processing factory. The investment plan also considers the risk impact of uncertain factors that may occur in the future. 
The estimated risk impact is calculated using the value-at-risk (VaR) approach with the Monte Carlo simulation. The 
results of this study will has benefit as a benchmark for investors for making decisions on an investment plan.

5. Conclusion 
The results of calculations using a deterministic approach obtained financial feasibility indicators with a positive NPV 
and an IRR greater than the required rate of return or a discount rate of 10.16%. Thus, the investment plan of processed 
foods factory is feasible. Meanwhile, the results of calculations using a probabilistic approach using the VaR approach 
with Monte Carlo simulation provide potential risk impacts of NPV and IRR. NPV and IRR have the potential to 
decrease in value of up to 44.04% and 11.36% respectively from the results of calculations using a deterministic 
approach. Meanwhile, PP has the potential to increase in value of up to 1.82% from the results of calculations using a 
deterministic approach. 
 
The results of this study can be very useful recommendations, especially for investors and other stakeholders as a basis 
for making decisions regarding an investment plan. In further studies, analysis can be developed by developing 
mitigation measures to deal with uncertainty and risk factors in the processed foods factory investment plan. The 
research framework and methodology from this study can also be developed to develop other financial models that 
can be used for investment feasibility appraisal for other planned factory development projects by considering 
uncertainty factors.

 Abstract 
This study aims to identify the influential factors that affect the perceived academic performance of undergraduate 
students experiencing hybrid learning. It investigates the relationships between sleep quality, anxiety, stress, academic 
workload, motivation level, gender, year level, and perceived academic performance using correlation analysis. The 
study employs Kruskal Wallis, Spearman rho correlation, and Mann-Whitney U test to determine the strength and 
significance of these relationships statistically. The study will span six months, focusing on undergraduate students in 
hybrid learning for the academic year 2023-2024 in the National Capital Region. However, potential limitations 
include response bias in self-reported data and the specificity of the study to undergraduate students. Based on the 
data collected from the statistical tool SPSS, it was found that there is a significant correlation between the response 
variable ""Perceived Academic Performance"" and the explanatory variables “Sleep Quality,” ""Anxiety,"" ""Stress,"" 
""Hybrid Mode of Learning,"" “Academic Workload,” Extrinsic Motivation - Identified,"" ""Amotivation,"" and ""Extrinsic 
Motivation - Introjected""“Academic Motivation,” “Year Level.""

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected many facets of daily life, including education. The shift to hybrid 
learning, a combination of in-person and online classes, has impacted students' sleep-wake cycles, leading to increased 
anxiety, stress, and changes in academic performance. Consequently, these changes have profoundly affected students' 
academic performance, demanding a deeper examination of the factors at play (Bowden, 2022; Marques & Braidwood, 
2021; Yassin et al., 2020). While studies suggest hybrid learning can be more effective than traditional methods, it 
also presents unique challenges (Singh et al., 2021).  
Research indicates that post-pandemic hybrid learning is more practical and promising than traditional face-to-face or 
online learning methods (Imran et al., 2023). Studies have shown that while online learning offers flexibility, students

quality, anxiety, and stress scores of students increase (worsens), their perception with their academic performance 
goes lower. On the other hand, the independent variables, time spent in a hybrid learning mode and academic 
motivation, have a strong positive monotonic relationship with perceived academic performance. A weak positive 
monotonic relationship for independent variables of academic workload and year level was obtained compared with 
perceived academic performance. Moreover, the distribution of perceived academic performance has a significant 
difference across the categories of anxiety, stress, hybrid mode of learning,  and year level. The distribution of 
perceived academic performance has no significant difference across the categories of sleep quality and academic 
workload. To conclude, the study's overall results showed the correlation between the independent variables and 
undergraduate college students' perceived academic performance in a hybrid learning mode using SPSS analysis.

Abstract 
In the era of technological dependence and globalization, online banking plays a pivotal role in everyday financial 
transactions. This research offers a comprehensive comparative analysis of online banking services provided by five 
prominent Philippine banks, namely Bank A, Bank B, Bank C, Bank W, and Bank X, and two widely used mobile wallets, 
Bank Y and Bank Z. Focused on customers' preferences in the National Capital Region (NCR), the study employs a 
mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data collected through an online questionnaire with qualitative insights. 
Statistical analysis, specifically the Kruskal-Wallis Test using SPSS, is applied to identify significant differences among 
banks and mobile wallets. The research findings reveal that Bank B is the preferred online banking service, closely 
followed by Bank Z among mobile wallets. The study identifies five critical factors shaping user satisfaction: 
Convenience, Safety & Security, Ease of Use, Trust, and Usefulness. These factors significantly influence the overall 
user experience in online banking. The study emphasizes the urgent need for NCR banks to enhance their online services 
to meet customers continually. The study highlights variations in the performance of different banks, identifying Bank B 
and Bank Z as standout choices for users to use. The study recommends continuous improvement in online banking 
services, emphasizing technology investment, user-friendly interfaces, time-saving features and prioritizing convenience, 
safety, and ease of use. The study suggests broader research areas, including expanding the banks, demographics, and 
analytical tools, to inform financial technology decisions and establish leadership in NCR's digital financial landscape.

Abstract 
The payment sector is the most prominent financial technology in Indonesia. The widespread use of digital payments 
give rise to more than 48 licensed e-wallet systems in Indonesia and lead Bank Indonesia to developed QRIS. QRIS 
displays a QR code that can be used by various Payment System Service Providers. However, it was found that the 
use of QRIS has not been fully accepted. There are still users who have not used QRIS. These include not knowing 
the process, lack of confidence in the security of transactions, feeling more comfortable and easier to use cash, and 
because the infrastructure and environment do not support it. The research was conducted through a questionnaire 
with a purposive sampling method, to see whether there is a demographic correlation with the level of QRIS adoption 
and create user segmentation based on technology acceptance factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived trust, and attitude). The procedure was carried out using CFA 
analysis, cluster analysis, and chi-square test. By carrying out segmentation, it is hoped that it will provide an overview 
of QRIS users based on age, gender, income, occupation, and level of education for QRIS applications in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Technology has entered life over the last few decades and has had a significant impact on life, one of them is the 
financial sector. Digital payments were introduced as a new way to carry out convenient and effective financial 
transactions. Using digital payments can avoid direct contact between individuals, make transactions quicker, more 
secure, lower transaction costs, and eliminate counterfeit currency. In Indonesia, the adoption rate of digital payments 
is quite high. The most reasons why digital payments are increasing rapidly is because they are convenient, fast, real-
time, and users do not need to use cash. Digital payments only require a smartphone and internet access. In 2021, 
Indonesia is in third place as the country with the highest adoption rate in Southeast Asia, namely 95%, below 
Singapore and Malaysia (Statista 2024). The most popular digital payment in Indonesia is E-wallet and currently, 
there are more than 48 licensed e-wallet systems in Indonesia. Because e-wallet service providers have different QR 
codes from each other and this causes merchants to provide many QR codes, Bank Indonesia developed QRIS. 
Unfortunately, it was found that the use of QRIS has not been fully accepted. A survey conducted by The Iconomics 
among 300 public respondents stated that 93% knew about QR and 81 percent were willing to use it, but only 19 
percent had ever used it (Antara 2021). Research in the Jabodetabek area, Indonesia in 2023 stated that 62.9% of 
MSME business owners had not used QRIS, where the age range of respondents was 40-50 years and more than 50 
years. In fact, according to BPS 2024, the population aged 15–64 years, which is the productive age population, is 
186.77 million people, representing 69.28 percent of Indonesia's population. The productive age population has a 
positive and significant influence on Indonesia's economic growth. There are still some people who have not used 
QRIS because they do not know the process, lack confidence in transaction security, feel it is more comfortable and

Therefore, these findings imply that although opinions regarding the use of QRIS are positive, the amount of monthly 
income also influences the frequency of use of QRIS as a payment system. 
 
The third cluster is a group that has a negative perception in the behavior of adopting QRIS as a payment system. 
Apart from that, from the demographic characteristics, even though most of the group has a monthly income range of 
5-10 million (32%) and has a diploma/graduate education (64%), the frequency of using QRIS is the lowest compared 
to the other 3 clusters. The majority of QRIS use frequency in this cluster is once a week (58%). It can be interpreted 
that negative perceptions can influence people in using technology. 
 
Meanwhile, the second segment is the smallest cluster whose observations and perceptions are poor in all attributes 
such as performance expectations, facilitating conditions, perceived effort, social influence, and perceived trust. This 
cluster has the demographic characteristics of working as entrepreneurs (33%) who earn less than 3 million (66.7%). 
This group only uses the QRIS payment system once a week (55%). In this cluster, it can be interpreted that the 
perception of the use of certain technology can be influenced by the level of monthly income of everyone. 
 
7. Limitations and future study 
However, few inherent limitations exist in this paper, which may be considered in the future direction of upcoming 
research. First, this study adopts an online survey restricted to Jakarta and surrounding areas, and which majorly 
educated class. This may restrict the generalizability of the current research outcome. Potential studies may approach 
the rural area survey method which may endow an extensive validation. Next, future research may include other 
inducing adoption behavior variables, which may strengthen the current segmentation model.

Abstract 
In recent decades, Peru has experienced a 2.8% GDP growth, thanks to the gastronomic sector. Engaging in the food 
business has thus become a robust source of income for the country. Despite this, certain companies face internal 
issues related to the stocks managed by restaurants, as their staff lacks the necessary knowledge to handle inventory. 
This results in a 9.7% loss of sales within the sector, while the analyzed company incurs a 17% loss. For this reason, 
this article has developed a solution to this problem in a rotisserie chicken company, which lacks an inventory 
management system. Studies pinpoint the cause of stockouts to a poor estimation of consumer demand. However, this 
study consolidated, in addition to consumer behavior, other factors such as the proper planning of raw material 
purchases, their quality, the level of service provided by the restaurant, and supplier compliance. The results highlight 
the complexity of avoiding stockouts in a restaurant with a substantial clientele and revealed that designing 
procurement processes, understanding consumer behavior, and effectively utilizing available spaces are key aspects 
of successful inventory management. The Value Stream Mapping tool covered 30% of the problem, the inventory 
management system 50%, and Lean Six Sigma methodologies 20%, respectively.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, Peru has developed the gastronomic sector rapidly, increasing its participation in GDP reaching 
2.8%, the sector brings together more than 200 thousand restaurants in the country (Abdelaal and Elshaer, 2020).

making 5s reminders and work instructions. At the end, the shitsuke stage consisted in constant training of 5s. The 
result of this was the reduce of production time in 4.57 min.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The research on the ""Inventory management optimization model in a grilled chicken restaurant applying inventory 
control, EOQ and Lean Manufacturing"" yields important conclusions for the food service sector. Interpretation of the 
data suggests that the proposal is financially viable. Likewise, the Benefit-Cost calculation indicates that the project 
would return 1.25 soles of net benefit for each sole spent, which would reinforce financial viability. The payback period 
is set at 2 years and 16 days, which indicates an effective return on investment. The NPV and IRR suggest that the 
project is profitable, with positive values and the second indicator being much higher than the discount rate. 
Using inventory management methods like EOQ and Lean Manufacturing to increase efficiency and profitability in a 
barbecue chicken restaurant is wise. The data supports the project's ability to generate long-term benefits while 
providing an optimal return on investment. Likewise, the recovery of the investment and the IRR demonstrate the 
financial solidity of the project. These data reinforce the hypothesis that improving inventory management and 
implementing efficient review procedures to avoid stock outages are essential for the long-term performance of 
companies in the food service industry. 
On the other hand, the application of Lean practices has demonstrated significant improvements in workflow during 
restaurant operations. This is due to the reorganization of the spaces in the warehouse, focusing them on activities that 
generate value in the product, and consequently in the sale. Additionally, a notable decrease in work interruptions was 
observed. Consequently, Lean tools have provided substantial value in the management of inputs in the poultry 
warehouse. 
In the case of value flow mapping, workers are now aligned to the same process of purchasing and receiving inputs. 
Thus, resulting in greater alert and monitoring of when the delivery of supplies would be made, and having everything 
ready for their correct reception and allocation in the warehouses. 
Finally, it is concluded that by applying correct inventory management using the demand driven planning methodology, 
stock shortages are not incurred, and in this way no lost sales are generated for the restaurant.

Abstract 
This paper presents a comprehensive strategy designed to support decision-making processes for the procurement of 
aeronautical products and the selection of suppliers, as required by the National Military Aviation Service in 
Colombia. The objectives of this study are threefold: (1) to characterize the relevant actors, characteristics of 
aeronautical products, applicable contractual processes, and external factors within the defense aeronautical ecosystem 
and its internal management systems; (2) to devise a systematic method for selecting aeronautical products for the 
Colombian Air Force, focusing on the potential development within the aeronautical industry; and (3) to establish 
principles for the selection of potential suppliers that aligns with the technical and operational requirements of state 
aviation. The results and discussions highlight the importance of prioritizing aeronautical products for aircraft with 
extended service periods, considering factors such as active production lines, operational performance indicators, and 
availability. Additionally, insights from interviews with technical experts underscore the importance of promoting 
growth within the Colombian aeronautical industry, particularly in the defence sector, by prioritizing less critical 
aeronautical products for local acquisition. Integrating feedback mechanisms, transparency, and long-term planning 
into procurement processes can enhance supplier relationships, promote strategic alignment, and drive sustainable 
development within the departmental aeronautical ecosystem.

1. Introduction
The aviation sector is not only crucial for regional socioeconomic development but also plays a pivotal role in ensuring 
national air superiority, thereby safeguarding a nation's sovereignty and independence. Aligned with Target 9.2 of the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, fostering inclusive and sustainable industrialization includes 
enhancing the aerospace industry's contribution to employment and GDP growth. Colombia, with a strategic vision 
for 2030, has ambitious plans to bolster its aeronautical sector. However, its heavy reliance on aviation parts sourced 
from foreign countries poses significant risks to both the supply chain and the country's sovereignty. This article 
addresses the urgent need for a tailored methodology to strategically select aerospace products and suppliers on a

Weak relationships: Conversely, lower values in the matrix indicate weaker correlations. For example, the 
correlation coefficient between Expert 1 and Expert 4 is 0.195834, suggesting a weak correlation between their 
evaluations. 
• 
Correlation patterns: It is essential to observe if there is any pattern in the matrix. This could indicate similarities 
in how they evaluate the product. 
 
Furthermore, notable differences in correlations between different pairs of experts should be looked for. We must consider 
both the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Kendall coefficient matrix of the Table 6:

Consequently, the statistical evidence allows us to interpretate that: The analysis of expert rankings reveals noteworthy 
relationships among the experts. By averaging experts' assessments, individual biases are minimized, leading to a more 
reliable and robust estimation of the phenomenon being evaluated. This approach can help mitigate the influence of 
discrepancies among experts and obtain a measure that better reflects the consensus. In consequence, it was checked 
Expert heterogeneity, which was examined confirming the background of each one; It was considered the average 
weighting of opinions, to contemplate the purchaser and seller perspective of this case, and finally it was estimated a 
sensitivity analysis (shown in Figure 8.) to understand the result's robustness and identify potential biases or excessive 
influences from specific experts.

6. Conclusion 
The systematic analysis of data allows to conclude that, from the buyer's perspective, it is essential to prioritize 
aeronautical products that ensure long-term operational efficiency, especially for aircraft with extended service times. 
This approach aligns with the manufacturer's interests, promoting the sustained performance of aeronautical assets and 
ensuring continued support despite potential challenges from discontinued manufacturer support. Further, proximity to 
the aeronautical industry is crucial for fostering collaboration, knowledge exchange, and timely responses to operational 
requirements. By prioritizing local suppliers and promoting a strong domestic industry, the defense sector can enhance 
its resilience and reduce dependency on foreign sources. Clear rules, transparency, and legitimacy in the decision-making

method are paramount to maintain trust and credibility within the defense procurement process. This ensures that supplier 
selection is based on objective criteria and ethical considerations, fostering fairness and accountability. Long-term 
planning is essential for ensuring the sustainability and resilience of the aeronautical supply chain. By adopting a strategic 
outlook and considering future operational needs, the defense department can mitigate risks, anticipate challenges, and 
optimize resource allocation effectively. Investing in supplier training programs is critical for fostering strategic 
independence and reducing reliance on external sources. By equipping local suppliers with the necessary skills and 
capabilities, the defense sector can enhance its self-sufficiency, promote innovation, and support the growth of the 
domestic industry. In summary, integrating these themes into the conclusion underscores the importance of strategic 
decision-making, collaboration, and capacity-building initiatives in strengthening the defense department's procurement 
capabilities and advancing the development of the Colombian aeronautical industry.

Abstract 
Considering the implementation of lean methodologies is key to generate a significant change in improving the 
productivity of companies in the textile industry, which are currently affected by the growing competitiveness of the 
sector. This article explains the proposal to increase productivity in the manufacture of t-shirt of a textile SME located 
in Lima - Peru, using Lean Manufacturing tools and promoting a well-balanced assembly line to solve the high 
percentage of defective products and the lack of monitoring and control in the production line. A time study and the 
application of lean tools were carried out to obtain the diagnosis of the current situation and to identify the operations 
with more slack. As a solution, the 5S and Standardized Work methodologies were implemented to achieve a correct 
distribution without unnecessary transports and a standardized inspection methodology. In addition, implementing 
line balancing reduced the number of workstations from 14 to 7 by combining production line operations. The 
improvement proposal was validated in ARENA software through a simulation of the current situation and the 
improvement resulted in a 47.54% increase in productivity.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the textile industry worldwide is going through changes due to globalization and variations in customer 
preferences either for higher quality garments or tastes related to models of the latest fashion designs (Quispe-Roncal 
et al., 2020). Therefore, production in this sector is very demanding, as the garment industry that produces limited 
quantities and demands must quickly adapt to changes in design and new consumer needs (Annamalai et al., 2020). 
As in Peru, since one of the main industrial activities of the manufacturing sector is the manufacture of textiles and 
clothing. This activity provides great employment opportunities at the national level, ""generating around 398 thousand 
direct jobs annually"" (Produce 2021).  
For Peru, SMEs represent 99.64% of the total number of companies in the Textile and Apparel Industry (Produce 
2021). These are characterized by low levels of productivity that, due to their status as SMEs, do not foresee the 
maintenance of their machinery, which causes malfunctioning of them and continuous failures in the production 
process, in the same way, the lack of supervision or quality control of operations and spaces causes reprocesses that 
do not generate value for companies. Therefore, it is necessary and important to solve the production problems that 
many SMEs in the textile and clothing sector are going through to compete in the international market and increase 
the economy of the sector (Quispe et al. 2020). 
According to the above, considering the implementation of lean methodologies is key to generating finished products, 
in the presence of consumer demand, with little or no waste (Annamalai et al. 2020). The Lean philosophy is a 
consolidated alternative, since the potential generated by its correct application must be considered by any

We proceeded to simulate again considering the new number of workstations, obtaining only 7 stations, and 
redesigning the number of machines per operation. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13. Simulation with improvement 
 
In the final scenario, it was determined that the daily production is 63 batches or 1260 T-shirts (Figure 13). 
 
5.4 Validation  
With the implementation of the line balance in the sewing area, it was possible to improve the daily productivity of 
the jobs, going from 854 T-shirts to 1260 T-shirts per day, demonstrating an increase in productivity of 47.54%. This 
is not It is only due to the line balance that it was also thanks to implementing the 5S methodology and standardizing 
the T-shirt inspection process. 
 
On the other hand, an analysis of the current route diagram was carried out and it was possible to bring the packaging 
area closer to the sewing area, reducing the travel distance from 65 m to 55 m. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With respect to the purpose of the case study research, the advantage of implementing the Lean Manufacturing tools: 
5s, Standardized Work and Line Balancing was demonstrated. It was demonstrated that the implementation of 5s helps 
to improve the correct distribution and identification of elements used within the manufacturing process, while

Standardized Work improves the standardized inspection methodology and line balancing improves the number of 
defective items presented in the production processes, as well as the current availability of operators and workstations. 
Regarding the simulation in ARENA 16.1 software implementing the proposed tools to predict the productivity of the 
case study, resulted in the reduction of waiting times between operations and allowing to identify those operations 
within the Workstations that can be united in a single station, order the operations, visualize the most appropriate 
movements, achieving the optimization of resources, reducing wasted time, and demonstrating an increase in daily 
production. This helped the case study in making changes in their production methods, with a higher probability of 
success. This type of study reinforces the application of lean tools such as 5s, work standardization and line balancing 
in SME companies in the Textile Sector. If it is planned to implement the proposal in another SME, it is recommended 
to analyze the specific situation of each one, before attempting to carry out a proposal such as the one presented in 
this research.

Abstract 
In drought-prone African countries like Zimbabwe, the uptake of parametric insurance has been low due to the absence 
of localized models. Guided by the CRISP-DM model, the present study proposes an AI-based approach to drought 
prediction in parametric insurance. The study’s paramount objectives are establishing trigger thresholds for drought 
events, assessing their significance, identifying the most effective machine learning models for drought modeling 
based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and forecasting future drought occurrences and their magnitudes. 
Historical weather data, including temperature and rainfall, are utilized and a range of machine learning models -
neural networks, random forest, and support vector machines are employed for drought prediction. The performance 
of these models is evaluated based on accuracy, reliability, and interpretability, with continuous refinement based on 
feedback from stakeholders. The significance of this research lies in promoting data-driven decisions, incentivizing 
preparedness, enabling risk transfer, facilitating rapid insurance payouts, and enhancing financial stability. With 
accurate drought predictions driving parametric insurance, policyholders can make well-informed choices, adopt 
proactive measures, transfer the risk of drought-related losses, receive swift insurance payouts, and improve their 
financial resilience during drought events.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental science has spurred innovative strategies 
to mitigate natural disasters. Droughts, in particular, pose significant challenges to agriculture, water management, 
and socio-economic stability. Traditional forecasting methods often lack precision and timeliness, hindering effective 
decision-making. However, AI technologies offer promising solutions by enhancing forecasting accuracy and offering

4.3 Proposed Improvements  
The study proposes that drought prediction using modern AI techniques ought to be localised and projected on various 
lead times to enhance accuracy. It is also critical to assess the performance of several models concurrently to establish 
the one best suited for the cause. Parametric insurers may also leverage artificial intelligence and optimise pricing by 
tailoring the SPI classification values to match their preferred thresholds. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Aimed at applying machine learning techniques in drought forecasting for parametric insurance, the study concluded 
that ML models, especially the RF, are efficient in forecasting drought and are effective in managing basis risk in 
parametric insurance. The optimal lead-time may not be consistent with the traditional seasons anticipated in the 
region, an expected disruption due to climate change. Therefore, it is prudent to forecast drought conditions at lower 
lead times like 1 month due to the erratic rainfall patterns being experienced generally. This is in line with Felsche 
and Ludwig (2021)’s findings on the importance of seasonality. With substantial variabilities in the drought 
experiences of different regions, wetter regions are more susceptible to drought than drier regions, necessitating 
region-specific pricing of products and region inclusivity as a risk-pooling tool. Mokhtar et al. (2021) shared similar 
sentiments, highlighting that AI models’ performance would improve when applied using a localized approach. The 
study's results may also be used to establish region-specific underwriting by manipulating SPI value thresholds and 
designing localized products.

Abstract 
HIV and AIDS remain prominent global health concerns and antiretroviral medication (ART) plays a crucial role in 
treating infected individuals, preventing disease progression, and improving overall health outcomes. However, 
missed appointments in ART programs pose significant challenges by causing treatment interruptions, unsuppressed 
viral load, and increased HIV transmission rates. This research employs the CRISP-DM methodology and aims to 
develop a predictive model that effectively reduces missed appointments among people living with HIV. A 
comprehensive analysis of patient data, including demographics, clinical information, and appointment history, was 
conducted to determine the key factors influencing missed appointments. The prediction model was developed using 
decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The study found that decision trees produced the best 
results, having lower square errors and greater R squared. The findings contribute to the advancement of predictive 
analytics in healthcare, particularly in the context of chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDS.

1. Introduction
HIV and AIDS remain a major issue in Zimbabwe, where an estimated 1.3 million people, or 11.58% of the population, 
live with the virus as of 2021 (UNICEF 2023). Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is a critical treatment for individuals 
living with HIV/AIDS, as it helps manage infection, prevent disease progression, and improve overall health 
609",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce missed appointments and improve 
treatment adherence in HIV care settings.  
 
The study findings align with previous research, including Abdulrahman et al. (2019) and Fahey et al. (2022), 
indicating that machine learning techniques, particularly Decision Tree and Random Forest models, are effective in 
predicting missed appointments and improving healthcare outcomes in HIV care. These models’ ability to capture 
complex relationships, handle noise effectively and provide accurate predictions makes it the most suitable choice for 
minimizing missed appointments compared to SVM models. Therefore, implementing the Decision Tree and Random 
Forest model in practice is recommended to optimize appointment scheduling and reduce missed appointments among 
individuals living with HIV. The researcher recommends implementing electronic medical records and utilizing real-
time data analysis with machine learning techniques to obtain district or geography-specific results. These evidence-
based data insights can inform implementation and programming decisions. 
 
7. Future work 
Integration of Real-Time Data: Explore the integration of real-time data streams, such as wearable devices or mobile 
health applications, to provide continuous monitoring of patient behavior and adherence patterns. This could enable 
timely intervention and personalized support to prevent missed appointments. 
 
Personalized Intervention Strategies: Investigate the development of personalized intervention strategies tailored to 
individual patient characteristics and adherence patterns. This could involve adaptive approaches that dynamically 
adjust based on patient responses and feedback. 
 
Longitudinal Analysis: Conduct longitudinal analysis to track changes in predictors of missed appointments over 
time and assess the effectiveness of interventions in mitigating these factors. Long-term monitoring could provide 
insights into patient adherence trajectories and inform proactive intervention strategies.

Abstract 
This document discusses the low productivity and low interest in sustainability in the Peruvian garment industry by 
applying a lean green production model for SMEs (small and medium-sized companies) based on 5S tools and 
standardization of work. A global diagnosis was carried out throughout the company to identify the challenges 
affecting the company's performance, such as defective products, low productivity, and a lack of focus on the impact 
of its activities on the environment. The innovative model proposes a simple and low-cost implementation so that 
SMEs can focus their efforts on becoming sustainable enterprises in the medium and long term. The results obtained 
through the standardization of work showed a significant increase in staff productivity, especially in the sewing area. 
This involved following a structure that significantly impacted operator variation time and identifying unnecessary 
activities within the processes. On the other hand, the 5S audit showed an improvement in organizational efficiency, 
work area cleanliness, and an increase in compliance from 40% to 92%. In conclusion, applying this proposed 
innovative model significantly increases productivity and product quality. Continued monitoring of implementation 
is recommended to maintain stability and to analyze new strategies for growth and sustainability in the sector.

1. Introduction
At present, the textile industry is the fourth most resource-intensive industry, consuming water and raw materials. 
However, less than 1% of the garments produced are recycled to extend their lifespan. In addition, the consumer has 
become increasingly demanding, causing industries to seek ways to meet demand by increasing the pace of fashion 
collections, incurring lower costs for low-quality, polluting materials and paying cheap labor to lower-wage countries 
(Wiegand & Wynn, 2023). Thus, the textile industry has shown significant growth and development worldwide, 
playing a vital role in the economies of many countries.

5. Results and Discussion 
Simulation results showed significant improvements in productivity and process efficiency after the proposed 
standardized work improvement. Productivity increased substantially by 30%, with an average output of 0.132 poles 
per Peruvian sol, compared to 0.102 poles per Peruvian sol previously. In addition, cycle time decreased by 26%, from 
30.04 minutes to 22.15 minutes, through systematic optimizations in drawing, cutting and sewing activities.  The 
implementation also led to a 54% reduction in time spent searching for tools, which contributed significantly to a more 
organized and efficient work environment.  These findings highlight the effectiveness of Lean methodologies and 
standardized work to optimize manufacturing processes and improve overall efficiency in the textile industry. 
 
Also, from the implementation of the Lean Green methodology and its tools in terms of 5s and standardized work, it 
was possible to demonstrate a lower consumption of resources, since part of the focus is on the reduction or 
optimization of resources, making the processes do not generate pollution by wasted resources, which often happens 
to be in garbage containers, in addition to the fast fashion that increases the rotation of garments per season and many 
of these are discarded. 
 
Based on studies conducted by Freitas (de Freitas et al., 2017), Pawria (Prawira et al., 2018), Adikorley (Adikorley et 
al., 2017), y Kumar (Tahiduzzaman et al., 2018), we can highlight the similarity of our results with their findings. In 
Freitas' study, the influence of Lean methodology on organizational sustainability was investigated, revealing a 
positive correlation between Lean tools and the financial pillars of the Triple Bottom Line. Our results support this 
relationship, as we observed a significant improvement in productivity and financial indicators after implementing 5S. 
(Adikorley et al., 2017) In a study on the success of these projects and programs in the textile industry, strategic 
partnerships and a clear vision of this tool were identified as critical success factors. We also recognized the 
importance of discipline in the implementation of 5S and the establishment of a proper storage system to improve 
organization and efficiency in the textile workshop. As for Kumar's study (Hussain et al., 2018), discussed the 
implementation of 5S in manufacturing and the improvement of quality and reduction of defects. Our results align 
with this notion, as we observed a significant reduction in cycle time and an improvement in product quality. The 
results obtained from this article are concrete and consistent with previous studies on the positive influence of the 
application of the 5s and the standardization of work on organizational sustainability. Our results are consistent with 
previous studies on the positive influence of 5S and standardized work on organizational sustainability. This allowed 
us to demonstrate that implementing the tools for a small start-up company with no prior knowledge of lean or 
productivity and limited financial resources can be successful. The importance of applying these tools for 
organizations will significantly improve production, quality and reduce defective products. It is important to mention 
that this study can be used as an efficient basis that, if combined with an ergonomic approach for micro and small 
enterprises, can improve the indicators and provide more information on the literature. 
 
6. Conclusions 
As a general conclusion, it can be stated that implementing Lean methodologies (5s and work standardization) under 
the Green approach in a small company of the garment sector without previous knowledge of lean tools or a defined 
work structure will significantly improve productivity, efficiency, and organization of the production process at a low 
cost and with great acceptance by the employees. The results obtained after implementing the 5S and standardization 
of work through simulation showed a 26% decrease in cycle time, from 30.04 minutes to 22.15 minutes, thus 
improving efficiency and speed in the execution of activities. This led to greater responsiveness to volatile market 
demand. Another highlight of the study was the level of 5S auditing, which showed substantial improvement after 
627","implementation. The application of the 5S principles, focusing on organization, cleanliness and order, contributed to 
a more efficient and safer working environment. Employees benefited from a tidier and cleaner workspace, which 
generated greater employee satisfaction and motivation, especially commitment to their work, as evidenced by their 
internal feedback following the improvements. Key indicators, such as productivity, cycle time and 5S audit level, 
showed substantial improvements. 
Finally, the Green approach improved operational efficiency through reduced cycle time, improved environmental 
sustainability through improved 5S audit level and ensured acceptance by employees, who benefited from a tidier and 
cleaner workspace.

Abstract 
Third party logistics (3PLs) play a vital role in e-commerce transactions as it makes consumer to consumer and 
business to consumer transactions more convenient in the Philippines. Nevertheless, delivery issues and challenges 
persist that lead to frustrations of consumers. For this reason, the study aims to conduct a factor analysis on the last-
mile delivery process of 3PL companies as partner couriers of e-commerce companies in the country’s National 
Capital Region (NCR). Employing a self-administered survey questionnaire and structural equation modeling (SEM), 
the research presses on identifying the relationships among various factors influencing  the number of delivery 
problems. The results of the study indicate that final step failure is the most critical factor in the last-mile delivery 
process. However, fixed assets, delivery performance, quality service, market share, and long term relationships 
significantly impact final step failure that leads to the increase of number of delivery problems as well. The findings 
of the study are recommended to be used to reevaluate last-mile delivery processes to help improve and  maintain 
customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
The last mile process is considered to be the most expensive and time-consuming in the overall delivery process. 
Fareye (2022) emphasized that the last mile process is widely regarded as the most critical aspect in supply chain 
management and argued that 53% of the total shipping costs are accounted for from the last mile process. 
Furthermore,  61% of logistics companies agree that the last mile delivery process is the most inefficient in the 
whole chain of operations (SOTI Inc, 2020). 
In the Philippines, the third party logistics (3PLs) is a booming industry. It is projected that the revenue from the 
3PL industry in the Philippines will reach $4.39 Billion by 2028 with its annual growth rate of 1.91%. (Statista, 
2024). This is influenced by the high demand in e-commerce platforms, wherein logistical support is essential. E-
commerce companies are keen on choosing which logistics companies to partner with as it determines the whole 
ecosystem of the products their users sell and consume. Unfortunately, there are delivery problems or issues that 
still occur evidently. 
Monzon (2023) reported that numerous complaints from e-commerce consumers surged across the Philippines from 
purchases made throughout the year, but most especially in year end sales. Reaching to an extent that local advocacy

6. Conclusion 
The study delves into the intricate factors influencing delivery issues in e-commerce and third-party logistics (3PL) 
companies. Through a comprehensive analysis employing structural equation modeling, the objective of the study was 
achieved by examining various relationships within the delivery process 
 
The e-commerce and logistics industry faces significant challenges related to delivery problems. Key factors such as 
Delivery Performance, Long Term Relationships, Market Share and quality of service, which in turn influences final 
step failures and ultimately impacts the number of delivery problems. Although there are also factors like Incentives, 
inept delivery people, and IT capacity  that show some influence, their impact is relatively smaller. The effect size 
suggests that the impact of the said factors might be comparatively not affecting than other relationships in the model. 
Integrating path analysis and reliability estimation provides a strong foundation for understanding these complex 
relationships, offering valuable insights for future research and decision-making in addressing delivery challenges. 
Moving forward, further exploration and practical application of these findings are essential for making meaningful 
advancements in the field. 
 
To further understand the relationship between each factor, the path analysis of the study shows the relationship in 
various factors that affects the number of delivery problems.  It reveals important relationships, like Market Share 
positively influencing Long Term Relationships and Delivery Performance impacting the quality of service. 
Moreover, the analysis highlights the connections between quality of service, fixed assets, and final step failures that 
lead to the number of delivery problems. The study's reliability tests, including Cronbach Alpha and composite 
reliability, confirm the robustness of key constructs like Market Share, Delivery Performance, and Quality of Service, 
adding credibility to the findings.

Con referencia a lo anterior, los investigadores podrían explorar cómo las diferencias culturales y regulatorias afectan 
la implementación de estrategias de innovación abierta en diferentes países emergentes. Sería particularmente 
interesante estudiar cómo las empresas en economías menos desarrolladas superan barreras institucionales y de 
infraestructura para adoptar la innovación abierta. 
 
Por otra parte, Walter Powell y Kaisa Snellman (2004) discuten cómo las redes de conocimiento, especialmente en 
industrias basadas en el conocimiento como la biotecnología y la tecnología de la información, facilitan la 
transferencia de conocimientos y tecnologías entre organizaciones. La implicación práctica de este hallazgo para los 
entornos innovadores es que los gobiernos y las organizaciones deben invertir en crear y mantener redes de 
conocimiento que puedan apoyar la colaboración y el intercambio de conocimientos. Una posible vía de investigación 
futura para abordar este tema, sería examinar cómo la estructura y la eficacia de las redes de conocimiento varían entre 
diferentes sectores industriales y cómo estas diferencias afectan la innovación y el desarrollo tecnológico en los países 
emergentes. 
 
En cuanto a la cultura de innovación y tolerancia al fracaso, Amy Edmondson (2011) destaca la importancia de una 
cultura organizacional que apoye la experimentación y sea tolerante al fracaso, facilitando así la innovación continua. 
En términos prácticos, esto sugiere que las organizaciones en entornos innovadores deben desarrollar prácticas de 
gestión que celebren el aprendizaje derivado de los errores y los fracasos como parte integral del proceso de 
innovación. Este tema, a futuro, se podría abordar mediante investigaciones aociadasa a políticas y prácticas de 
recursos humanos en diferentes culturas, que influyen en la percepción del fracaso y en la disposición a asumir riesgos 
en la innovación. Además, estudiar el impacto de la tolerancia al fracaso en la capacidad de una empresa para innovar 
en mercados altamente competitivos podría proporcionar elementos valiosos. 
 
6. Conclusiones 
En conclusión, las características de un entorno innovador incluyen adaptabilidad, colaboración, apoyo institucional, 
acceso a recursos, una cultura que acepta el riesgo, y un enfoque en la creatividad y el desarrollo de capacidades. Estos 
elementos se interrelacionan para crear un ecosistema donde la innovación puede florecer, respondiendo efectivamente 
a los desafíos y aprovechando las oportunidades para el desarrollo sostenible y la competitividad en el mercado global. 
Los entornos innovadores promueven la creatividad y el desarrollo de capacidades internas dentro de las 
organizaciones. La formación continua y el desarrollo de habilidades son esenciales para mantener a las 
organizaciones y a sus empleados a la vanguardia de las tendencias tecnológicas y de mercado, permitiéndoles generar 
innovaciones significativas. 
 
El análisis muestra que un entorno innovador trasciende la simple adopción de tecnología; es la manifestación de un 
ecosistema complejo donde la adaptabilidad y la colaboración entre diferentes actores son fundamentales. Las teorías 
y modelos examinados revelan que la innovación florece en un terreno abonado por el conocimiento compartido, el 
apoyo institucional, y una cultura que no solo acepta el riesgo sino que lo celebra como un precursor del progreso. 
 
Por otra parte, las redes de conocimiento emergen como piedras angulares en la estrategia para acortar distancias 
tecnológicas. Las políticas que apoyan estas redes y la infraestructura de innovación han demostrado ser efectivas en 
la promoción de un rápido intercambio tecnológico, ayudando a los países emergentes a escalar en la economía del 
conocimiento. 
 
Así mismo, se apunta hacia la importancia crítica de las políticas públicas enfocadas en la innovación y una 
infraestructura de apoyo que facilita el acceso a recursos. Estos elementos no solo mejoran la capacidad de innovación 
local sino que también atraen talento y capital extranjero, lo que es esencial para la competitividad internacional. 
 
Por último, se concluye que la cultura de la innovación dentro de un país o región es un facilitador clave para la 
absorción y generación de nuevas tecnologías. Al invertir en capital humano y fomentar una mentalidad de innovación 
permanente, los países emergentes pueden acelerar su desarrollo tecnológico y económico, cerrando la brecha con las 
economías desarrolladas. 
 
En general, estas conclusiones reflejan la comprensión actual del dinámico campo de la innovación y ofrecen un marco 
para futuras investigaciones y políticas destinadas a maximizar el potencial innovador de los países emergentes. La

Abstract 
Improving productivity in the animal feed industry is crucial to ensure proper nutrition for animals and the 
quality of meat products, making it a vital sector for food security and the economy. The issue identified in the 
research relates to productivity and efficiency limitations in animal feed plants, caused by inefficient processes, 
waste, and extended changeover times, which affect the profitability and competitiveness of companies in the 
sector. The proposed solution included the implementation of Lean tools such as 5S, Heijunka, and SMED to 
optimize production processes, reduce changeover times, eliminate waste, and enhance operational efficiency 
in animal feed plants. The results of this research showed significant improvements in the productivity of the 
plant studied, with a 35% increase, a 73% reduction in changeover times, a 47% decrease in the production 
cycle time, and a 98% increase in production schedule compliance. These indicators reflect the positive impact 
of implementing Lean tools in the animal feed industry.

Introduction
The implementation of lean manufacturing tools in the food industry has proven to be an effective strategy for 
enhancing productivity and operational efficiency. Particularly in plants manufacturing animal feed, the 
application of Lean Manufacturing methodologies has garnered interest in the pursuit of process optimization. 
These tools, focusing on waste elimination, organizational improvement, and reduction of setup times, have the 
potential to significantly transform operations in such plants. 
Management literature has emphasized the importance of considering contextual factors when implementing 
changes within organizations, as these factors can influence the effectiveness of initiatives (Shah & Ward, 
653","or optimizing resources. This efficiency was evidenced by the increase in production program compliance to 
98%, thereby facilitating an increase in sales plan compliance and optimizing plant capacity, thus reducing 
operational costs. 
 
Table 1 presents the results of the main indicators from the improvement project, showing that all indicators 
experienced an improvement, reflecting an increase in the productivity of the plant under study.

The successful implementation of the 5S methodology has demonstrated significant improvements in quality 
and productivity across various companies. For instance, in a study conducted by Rahman (2010), it was found 
that the implementation of 5S practices in manufacturing companies in Hong Kong led to a successful 
enhancement in product quality and work life. Likewise, Ahuja & Randhawa (2017) reported that the 
implementation of the 5S at Arcelor Mittal, the largest steel company in Poland, as the foundation of the TPM 
initiative, resulted in a labor efficiency increase of up to 150% and a production cost reduction of 30%. On the 
other hand, the application of the SMED methodology has shown significant reductions in setup times for 
production lines. For example, Sahin & Koloğlu (2022) successfully applied the SMED methodology to a group 
of cold profile machines in a metallurgical industry company in Portugal, achieving reductions in setup times. 
Regarding productivity improvement through 5S, Ruiz et al. (2019) mention that the implementation of the 5S 
in a textile company allowed for a reduction in cycle time in the sewing process and an increase in value-adding 
activities by 7%. These studies highlight the effectiveness of the 5S and SMED methodologies in optimizing 
processes and enhancing productivity in various industrial sectors. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Productivity improvements in the animal feed industry through Lean tools are significant. The effectiveness of 
implementing Lean methodologies such as 5S, Heijunka, and SMED in optimizing production processes and 
reducing changeover times in the studied plants stands out. These tools proved to be key in eliminating waste, 
enhancing operational efficiency, and boosting productivity in the animal feed sector. Furthermore, it was 
demonstrated that adapting Lean tools to the specific needs of the food industry resulted in tangible 
improvements in efficiency and competitiveness for the businesses. The reduction of operational costs, resource 
optimization, and improvements in the quality of the final products were notable aspects of applying Lean in 
this particular context. Additionally, the importance of considering contextual factors and adapting Lean 
methodologies to the unique characteristics of the animal feed industry to achieve optimal results is highlighted. 
The combination of Lean approaches with emerging digital technologies offers new opportunities for 
continuous improvement and process optimization in this key sector for food security and the economy. Finally, 
the positive impact of implementing Lean tools in the animal feed industry is underscored, highlighting their 
capacity to drive operational efficiency, reduce costs, improve quality, and strengthen the competitiveness of 
businesses in a highly demanding and competitive environment.

Abstract 
The offshore platform in Field X operates 2 (two) Gas Turbine Compressor units which function to compress gas 
pressure as fuel supply for the Gas Turbine Generator. The running hours of these Gas Turbine Compressor units have 
nearly reached 30,000 hours, prompting the manufacturer to recommend an Engine Exchange to maintain its 
operational reliability. Prior to the approval of the Gas Turbine Compressor engine exchange work plan, an economic 
evaluation and risk identification are required to assess the financial feasibility and identify potential risks that could 
affect the smooth implementation of the work. This study aims to provide comprehensive recommendations on 
economic aspects and risks to the management as a basis for investment decision-making. The research employs the 
Benefit/Cost Analysis method and Risk Register to evaluate the economic and risk levels of the work plan. The 
research findings that the work plan for the engine exchange of the gas turbine compressor on the offshore platform 
in Field X is feasible from an economic and risk perspective, as it has a BCR value > 1 with low to moderate risk and 
low risk level.

The operation activities of oil and gas production in offshore areas require complex infrastructure, including 
continuous and reliable electrical power supply. The production facilities and utilities in these oil and gas fields 
necessitate reliable power sources to ensure smooth operational activities. Hence, offshore oil and gas fields are 
typically equipped with their own power generation facilities. The types of power generation facilities commonly used 
include gas engines, gas turbine generators, and diesel engines. 
The offshore platform at Field X has two gas turbine compressor units, namely GTC-A and GTC-B. Both gas turbine 
compressor units play a vital role in the operational activities at Field X. These gas turbine compressors are responsible 
for compressing the gas pressure produced by the gas platforms at Field X. Subsequently, the compressed gas flows 
through the gas turbine compressor to supply fuel to the gas turbine generators at Field X. Therefore, the reliability 
and optimal performance of the gas turbine compressors are crucial to maintain operational efficiency and minimize 
the risk of downtime or operational disruptions that could result in significant financial and operational losses. 
Given the importance of these two gas turbine compressor units, manufacturers recommend conducting engine 
exchanges at 30,000 operating hours. This recommendation is based on the fact that the operating hours of both gas 
turbine compressor units are approaching 30,000 hours, which is the recommended operating hour limit by the 
manufacturers. The engine exchange involves replacing the gas turbine compressor units that have reached their 
operating hour limit with new units or units that have been remanufactured. The purpose of the engine exchange is to

Figure 5 risk profile matrix after risk treatment 
 
In the risk profile matrix above, it can be observed that risk treatment can reduce the level of risk for each risk event. 
Risk treatment activities can mitigate the causes of risk for each risk event, thereby reducing their probability and 
impact levels. Initially, the engine exchange gas turbine compressor project offshore at Field X had 2 (two) risk events 
with a Moderate to High risk level and 3 (three) risk events with a Moderate to High risk level. After risk treatment, 
these risk levels can be reduced in terms of probability and impact, resulting in the risk level for the engine exchange 
gas turbine compressor project offshore at Field X consisting of 6 (six) risk events with a low to moderate risk level 
and 3 (three) risk events with a low risk level. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Based on the evaluation of economic aspects, the plan for the engine exchange gas turbine compressor at the offshore 
platform in Field X is deemed feasible due to its positive net present value (NPV) of USD 8,130,462, a high rate of 
return with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 74.88%, a relatively short payback period of 2.28 years, and a benefit/cost 
ratio (BCR) of 3.23, indicating that the investment benefits outweigh the costs. The risk identification results show 
that risk events associated with the plan for the engine exchange gas turbine compressor at the offshore platform in 
Field X can be mitigated through risk treatment activities, thereby reducing the risk level to 6 (six) risk events with a 
low to moderate risk level and 3 (three) risk events with a low risk level.

Abstract 
This research aims to investigate the design and manufacturing of composite molds using LTC410 composite mold 
material with the objective to improve the mold manufacturing process in Aerospace industry. The study will delve 
into designing the LTC410 composite mold system, product quality, costs, and manufacturing time by comparison 
with traditional mold. The research methodology comprises a fusion of theoretical analysis and practical 
experimentation of product B which is the prototype product of research. The research will commence by providing 
an overview of aluminum mold manufacturing methods, focusing on production costs and times. Then study with the 
design of a composite mold system by LTC410 being a mold material and SP-165 PU board is the pattern of composite 
mold. The results of the research indicate that in the composite mold design process, mold scaling is unnecessary due 
to the minimal expansion exhibited by LTC410 mold material at the curing temperature of 135 degrees Celsius. 
Conversely, tool scaling is needed when design the pattern mold SP-165 by the calculated mold scale value 
necessitates a value of 0.9978 when applied to the 3D simulation program. Additionally, composite molds demonstrate 
the potential to reduce mold manufacturing time by up to 44% and mold manufacturing costs by up to 46.6%, without 
compromising the company's production processes or the quality of the workpieces, as observed when compared with 
traditional mold.

1. Introduction
The continuous advancements and research going into composite material technologies coupled with composite 
material’s outstanding capabilities over traditional aerospace alloys led to the rapid increase in popularity of composite 
materials in the aerospace industry.  However, as the aerospace industry’s demand for composite component increases, 
so does the demand for more tooling. Tooling and molds represent a large portion of the entire production chain of 
composite components.  Therefore, the tooling and mold’s quality, cost and lead times severely affect the cost of 
production, especially in large volume productions (Peng Hao Wang et al., 2019). Typically, the mold always made 
from aluminum or steel using conventional metal fabrication techniques which that can be time consuming and 
expensive cost to accomplish. Composite mold is the one of alternative tooling solutions by generally refers to a mold 
made from composite materials which can be produced using various mold-making techniques, such as hand lay-up, 
vacuum bagging, resin transfer molding (RTM), or compression molding, among others. By the properties advantage 
of composite material such as Strength-to-Weight Ratio, Design Flexibility, Thermal Insulation etc. let it has garnered 
substantial attention in the aerospace industry to applied composite material to manufacture molds. 
For the described reasons above, the researcher's company intends to undertake a study composite mold with the 
objective of reduced both the time and cost associated with mold production. The research methodology comprises a

4.4 Discussion 
This research endeavor has encompassed a comprehensive exploration of various applications utilizing composite 
molds. The outcomes of this investigation align with the research objectives. Specifically, the composite mold's 
capacity to yield workpiece quality remains on par with that of traditional molds. The composite mold demonstrates 
a notable advantage in terms of shorter production times and lower costs compared to traditional counterparts. Despite 
the overall satisfactory test results, it is imperative to acknowledge certain limitations encountered during the research 
process. Notably, limitations in the availability of raw materials constrained the sample size for the dimensional 
stability tests outlined in Section 4.2. Due to the elevated cost of producing these specimens, the study was restricted 
to analyzing only 10 specimens, which may not fully adhere to statistical principles. Composite mold durability test 
does not provide in this research by the research limitations as well. However, this limited sample size does provide 
foundational insights for evaluating the performance characteristics of composite molds.  Furthermore, it is important 
to note a potential area of concern regarding design validation discrepancies, particularly when transitioning from 
prototype B to larger-scale parts. Such discrepancies highlight the complexity of scaling up designs and warrant further 
investigation in future research endeavors. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Base on the data provided, it is evident that composite molds can maintain equivalent production quality compared to 
traditional molds while offering significant advantages in terms of production time and cost efficiency. Specifically, 
the study reveals that composite molds exhibit a remarkable reduction in mold production time by 38.98% and a 
substantial cost saving of 44.24% when compared to traditional molds. These findings underscore the operational 
benefits and cost-effectiveness associated with adopting composite molds in manufacturing operations. Moreover, one 
notable advantage highlighted in the study is the reproducibility of composite molds. Unlike traditional molds, 
composite molds can be easily reproduced if the master plug remains in good condition. This capability eliminates the 
need to invest in new raw materials for each reproduction, further reducing production costs and enhancing resource 
utilization. The study highlights that for the same budget allocated to mold production, manufacturers have the 
potential to produce two composite molds in contrast to only one aluminum mold. This dual capacity for composite 
molds translates into increased production output, reduced waiting times, and enhanced manufacturing efficiency.

Abstract 
Sustainable supply chains are a crucial strategy adopted by companies to improve their environmental, social, and 
economic results in response to market demands. Digital transformation introduces a new paradigm in the industry, 
reconfiguring manufacturing, products, services, and supply chains themselves. While sustainable supply chains and 
digital transformation in supply chains are gaining prominence, it is still unclear how digital transformation can 
effectively support sustainable supply chains. While the Smart Supply Chain (SSC) approach aims to improve 
productivity, quality, and flexibility, sustainable supply chains seek to establish trust and transparency in their 
sustainable processes by integrating environmental responsibility in a competitive way. The purpose of this thesis is 
to explore how digital transformation can effectively strengthen sustainable supply chains. To achieve this objective, 
the thesis combines quantitative and qualitative methods.   The research involved a survey of 473 manufacturing 
companies to elucidate how SSC can contribute to sustainability in supply chains, in terms of both environmental and 
financial results. To complement this focus, a qualitative research study was conducted through a multiple case study 
approach, which focused on leading companies in the manufacturing sector that have implemented sustainable 
practices. The thesis results indicate that the SSC approach effectively promotes the development of sustainable supply 
chains, enabling the intelligent and sustainable creation of long-term value. It promotes the adoption of sustainable 
practices in supply chains to reduce carbon footprints and create carbon-neutral networks. Additionally, it aims to 
develop partnerships between different actors in the chain to reduce inequalities and promote economic growth.

Abstract 
Nowadays, ergonomics is implementing new methodologies across various sectors, including workplaces, production 
facilities, and common areas, in order to maximize productivity. This research focuses on conducting an ergonomic 
analysis using RULA and REBA techniques in a bakery business to reduce the development of musculoskeletal 
disorders. After conducting a systematic literature review to understand the evolution of ergonomics in organizational 
settings, the analysis was performed using Ergonautas website, where data were recorded to assess the risk levels of 
activities. A diagnosis of the company was carried out, focusing on the workstations that are part of the production 
process, in which several opportunities for improvement were found. Through the Nordic questionnaire, it was 
possible to identify the main discomforts of the operators, which are hands (100%), followed by the elbow (85.71%), 
and lastly, the shoulders (71.43%). The production activities posing ergonomic risks are mixing, cutting, and baking. 
This was identified using the REBA and RULA techniques, which indicate that mixing represents a high risk, followed 
by cutting, which has a medium risk, as well as baking. In the case of mixing, it is recommended to intervene at the 
station as soon as possible.

1. Introduction
To promote the growth of the bakery sector, companies must carefully analyze their processes to improve them and, 
consequently, remain competitive in the market. Bakeries and other flour-based food production companies are 
exposed to risks either due to the nature of the activities performed or the design of their machines (Vásconez and 
Jama, 2022).  
Musculoskeletal disorders are a group of preventable disorders that affect nerves, tendons, and muscles (Yazdanirad 
et al., 2022). The main ergonomic risks in the bakery industry include lifting heavy objects, repetitive activities,

5. Conclusion 
Through posture diagnosis using REBA and RULA, it was determined that the postures adopted by operators during 
the production process are harmful. The bending angle of the operators is inadequate for the type of work performed 
(mixing, cutting, and baking). Production activities posing an ergonomic risk are mixing, cutting, and baking. This 
was identified using the REBA and RULA techniques, which indicate that mixing poses a high risk, followed by 
cutting with a medium risk, similar to baking. In the case of mixing, it is recommended to intervene at the station as 
soon as possible. 
 
Anthropometric data of the operators were obtained, allowing for a proposal for improvement considering the results 
of REBA and RULA. Thus, if the improvement proposal is implemented, it could prevent the development of 
musculoskeletal disorders as each station adapts to the anthropometric measurements of the operators. 
Through the Nordic questionnaire, the main ailments of operators during the production process were identified, which 
are hands (100%), followed by the elbow (85.71%), and lastly the shoulders (71.43%). 
Among the limitations for future research are the time and cost of implementing ergonomic designs in the machines, 
since specialized labor is required to guarantee correct installation. Also, data collection during the production process 
can affect worker performance. Research could be conducted on the effectiveness of worker ergonomics training to 
improve work practices, increase productivity, and reduce the cost of personal injury. 
The application of REBA, RULA, and the Nordic questionnaire allowed us to recognize the discomfort of the operators 
and, consequently, identify activities with a higher ergonomic risk. These techniques can be applied in SMEs from 
different sectors in order to counteract discomfort and improve the ergonomic conditions of the activities they present.

Abstract 
In a VUCA environment, marked by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, developing a resilient 
Manufacturing Strategy (MS) is fundamental for adapting and transforming adversities into opportunities, ensuring 
long-term competitiveness and sustainability. This study identifies key strategies and enablers for developing a 
resilient MS. This study employed a systematic five-stage literature review, using SCOPUS and WoS for data 
collection and VosViewer® and Atlas.ti® for bibliometric and content analysis, respectively. Conducted in March 
2024, the process narrowed down from 1,144 articles to 232 for in-depth examination, focusing on identifying research 
opportunities. Post-2020, there has been a significant increase in the academic focus on Manufacturing Strategy (MS) 
and its resilience, identifying critical research areas such as the development of resilient theoretical frameworks and 
the enhancement of strategic resilience in manufacturing. This analysis underscores the importance of agility and 
proactiveness in manufacturing systems, emphasising the necessity of incorporating uncertainty into strategic 
decision-making. Furthermore, the pivotal role of technological innovation, particularly through the adoption of 
Industry 4.0 technologies, in strengthening organisational resilience is highlighted. Findings were categorised into 
resilience approaches, components thereof, and MS-specific resilience, offering a structured and in-depth view of the 
field and promoting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates strategic management, advanced technology, and the 
analysis of cultural and organisational dynamics. This comprehensive view is essential for designing resilient 
manufacturing systems in the face of global volatility, setting a research precedent for future explorations in resilient 
and adaptive manufacturing practices.

Abstract 
The study highlights a theoretical problem concerning the need for more emphasis on sustainability in Smart Supply 
Chain research, primarily due to challenges in integrating the two domains. Smart Supply Chain prioritizes 
productivity, quality, and flexibility, while sustainability focuses on sustainable development encompassing 
economic, social, and environmental aspects. Recognizing this discrepancy, the study aimed to identify prevalent 
concepts at the intersection of sustainability and Smart Supply Chain. To achieve this objective, the researchers 
employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and LDA Mallet to analyze recently published articles in this area. The 
LDA Mallet results revealed distinct research directions that can be pursued. These research lines offer valuable 
insights for academic exploration and practical implementation in the supply chains. They can inform the development 
of new projects and serve as a foundation for frameworks and roadmaps promoting sustainable digital development, 
technological innovation, and sustainability within smart supply chains.

1. Introduction
The concept of Industry 4.0 was introduced in 2011 at the Hannover Messe fair in Germany (Liao et al., 2017)and had 
been transforming the industry worldwide. The concept includes aspects of digital transformation and digital 
technologies in the industrial environment for better operational management. The concept of Industry 4.0 brought a 
new vision to supply chains, and companies began to make them more digital and intelligent. Based on this, the 
concept of Smart Supply Chain was developed. The smart supply chain concept includes aspects of digital 
transformation and digital technologies in the industrial environment for better operational management (Frank et al.,

maximize the robustness and accuracy of decision-making, and other data can be combined to understand the future 
direction of smart sustainable supply chain development, thereby improving decision-making. Combining other 
secondary data can generate new insights based on the results presented in this work. This is essential for the 
theoretical-practical development of smart supply chain and sustainability in the coming years. In the future, other 
data can be used to develop new knowledge, research lines, and practical applications in industries.

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to use the ""Lean Manufacturing"" methodology to increase productivity in the 
production area of a company in the bakery sector. For the analysis, one shift (morning shift) of the two daily 
production shifts was considered. The problem in the bakery is the lack of follow-up in each process performed by 
the baker. This results in a greater use of resources, generating higher costs for the company. It also limits the 
response to higher production demands. The current productivity of the company is 63.56%. The VSM was used to 
analyze the current state of the bakery, the different variables and main factors involved in bread production. Of the 
different tools of the Lean Manufacturing methodology, the SMED tool was chosen because it is one of the best 
working tools that help reduce the changeover time and configuration of a product or batch. In this case, will be 
applied to reduce the time of any process by more than 30%. The time of each process was calculated with the use of 
a stopwatch. After applying the methodology, a  new VSM and a production design model were designed, resulting 
in a productivity increase of 80.23%.

Introduction
Bread is the main food for millions of people in Peru, of which French bread represents 50% of the income from its 
sale. In Peru, 35 kilograms of bread are consumed per capita and thanks to the operation of bakeries. Two hundred 
thousand people  are employed and  involved in the entire production chain. In recent years, the Peruvian bakery 
sector has been in constant growth, defying all kinds of difficulties. This sector is quite dynamic and diverse because 
there is a diversity  of breads, from traditional to sweet breads and cakes and variants. In addition, because there is 
good competition among bakeries, bakery chains and supermarkets. The innovation of bakers through the 
improvement of their production techniques and using local ingredients that provide quality food. As a result, 
consumer demand has been increasing. It is worth noting that the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on the bakery 
sector was significant because it generated an increase in the purchase of bread for home consumption and at the 
same time helped to strengthen biosecurity elements and offer home delivery services. Nowadays companies in the 
bakery sector are starting to use agile methodologies in order to improve their processes and therefore be more 
productive, as is the case of the present work. The mypes that are in this sector are characterized by their traditional 
nature to make bread and are reluctant to change because they do not have knowledge of agile methodologies and 
are not trained by professionals with knowledge of process improvement.  In relation to the last point, another 
important factor is the investment in time and resources since it is necessary to train all staff and reorganize existing 
processes.

H1 = The time to place ingredients in the mixer does not fit a Beta distribution. 
 
Chi square Test = (P-value>0.05). The p-value =0.0557, therefore, is greater than 0.05 and according to this test, 
the data fit a beta distribution. 
 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test = (P-value>0.05). The p-value >0.15, therefore, is greater than 0.05 and according to 
this test, the data fit a beta distribution. 
 
 
Conclusion: The null hypothesis is not rejected and the duration time to verify kneading conforms to a Beta   
distribution. 1.38 + 0.24 * BETA (1.55, 1.75) 
 
6. Conclusion 
After the application of the SMED tool in the following work, the following conclusions were obtained: 
It is feasible to use Lean Manufacturing methodology to improve bakery productivity. 
 
It is demonstrated that the use of the SMED tool reduces the processing time per shift by 98.53 minutes, making it 
an acceptable practice for reducing food productions times.  As a consequence, labour and electricity costs are reduced. 
Through the application of the SMED tool, an increase in the man-hour unit of the work performed by the operator on 
bread production is evidenced. It is possible to make an additional car of bread as long as there is an additional 
consumption public to the one that exists the bakery. 
 
It is essential to have protective equipment throughout the production of bread, because there are processes in which 
without 
the 
use 
of 
these 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
perform 
them. 
Another contribution was to be able to provide flexibility to adapt to changes in demand, respecting the time limits. 
In 
this 
way 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
obtain 
an 
immediate 
response 
to 
any 
new 
situation.   
The impact of the following scientific article will be of help to many small and medium sized companies in the 
bakery sector to improve their bread production processes because the research is focused on this target audience 
that do not have the necessary resources to acquire more modern machines and have limited budgets for personnel. 
From the following research, the use of the baker's man-hour and machine-hour estimation unit of the machines will 
be optimized, thus decreasing the bread production time, labor and electricity costs. In addition, this model will be 
able to meet variations in customer demand without affecting the productivity of the bakery. To take advantage of 
the work presented, it is important to collect the exact time taken by each baker in a bread production shift and 
validate it through automation and event simulation software. In this way, the application of any Lean Manufacturing 
tool will have more accurate results, for the desired improvements. It is important to always receive feedback from 
the customer to know their experience in the service provided if it meets the expectations and thus identify areas for 
improvement and process readjustments.

Abstract 
The gastronomic sector frames a conglomerate of companies that offer food and beverages of various natures and 
with which the food riches of a region are described, so normally the companies that make it up are part of the tourist 
product offered, this context, in the case of Colombia and especially Cartagena, is currently faced with a number of 
challenges such as: Financial (New Taxes, Wage Increases for the Workforce), New Consumer Trends, Digital 
Transformation, Climate Change, Innovation, among other aspects that lead to the establishment of mechanisms that 
allow for competitive and sustained adaptation to them. Therefore, this work aims to identify, through a systematic 
review supported by the Gavilan model, the operational practices (TOC, Lean Services, Six Sigma) that have been 
developed and implemented in the global gastronomic context in the last 10 (2014 – 2024) years, with the purpose 
of establishing a clear roadmap to strengthen the operations management of these service systems in the Cartagena 
context.

Strategies: 
training campaigns on the use and contributions of the model's methodologies; Carry out a contextualized diagnosis 
in the company and adapt the new management model to the company. 
 
Resources: 
Monetary capital is needed for training campaigns and implementation of the management model, as well as tools to 
carry out the contextualized diagnosis such as servqual to evaluate the customers' perception of the services, QFD to 
translate the voice of the customer into requirements, VSM to evaluate the state of the processes and propose 
improvement, Ishikawa diagram to determine causes of problems in the system and process maps to identify the 
problems involved in the company's activity. 
 
Deadlines: 
It is proposed to implement the model in companies in the gastronomic sector in one year, dividing each stage by 
quarters, but for the global analysis of the implementation of the management model in the gastronomic context, a 
time horizon of 5 years is proposed, starting from 2025 to 20230. 
 
Parties involved: 
This strategy involves the company's staff, trainers and e-mails.

3. Conclusions 
For this research, a time horizon of the last 10 years was proposed, fragmented by a before, during its post-COVID-
19 period, where the research of interest was linked to answering the question of how the philosophy of continuous 
improvement has been implemented hand in hand with six sigma, lean service and TOC in economic services in order 
to generate quality services, that ensure their permanence in the market. 
 
60 documents were identified using the Google Scholar and Elsevier databases, with a decimeter percentage found of 
80% and 20% respectively. The methodologies of six sigma, lean service have been the most explored and used by 
researchers in the gastronomic sector, since being more related to the direct customer experience they are more 
attractive for quality problems in customer service, of these Six sigma was found in 42% of the research and lean 
services in 51%.  This is very different from the theory of constraints of which only 7% of the identified research 
makes use of OCD to solve a problem, i.e. it is still new in the context of Servuccion. 
 
From the analysis of the synthesis of the research, we can conclude that the sector has been marked by three stages, 
before, during and after COVID-19, and that is why we can identify opportunities for strengthening it; Previously, 
753","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
 
 
research was framed in customer satisfaction, translating expectations through the analysis of surveys applied in 
establishments without taking into account the fact that there is an internal process and that when analyzed it can 
provide opportunities for improvement, this is because having such a high degree of contact with the customer makes 
internal problems secondary in the process; during COVID-19, Without the concern of having the customer so close, 
the doors are opened to the analysis of internal processes, applying mostly lean service methodologies to optimize 
resources, and when they open the doors to the public again, the research is once again directed towards the 
expectations and perceptions of the customer in companies, that is, this becomes a priority. 
 
On the other hand, the most used operational practices during the last 10 years have been lean service and six sigma, 
with TOC being the least used in research, with 7% of application in the gastronomic sector; This opens up a potential 
field to explore since the problem of inflation is facing the increase in the cost of acquiring raw materials, one of the 
biggest challenges is to reduce operating costs that are probably linked to restrictions in the system and in this way 
the idea of maintaining prices in the market by increasing throughput significantly in businesses in the gastronomic 
sector could continue to be supported. To this end, we believe that the implementation of a management model 
designed with the principles and bases of the methodologies that we have addressed in this research is optimal, 
executed through a roadmap that can be applied to companies in the sector in the city of Cartagena.

Abstract 
The Logistics Services Sector encompasses a conglomerate of companies dedicated to the supply, storage, distribution, 
marketing, preparation of goods or other resources required by various business sectors to materialize their value 
proposition. In the case of Colombia, and given the global dynamics that digital culture has brought with it, new 
challenges have been taken on in this context in the way logistics is done in the country: reference systems that displace 
the freight table, changes in the paradigm of the freight transport operation and a solid information base that supports 
decision-making, among other aspects that lead to the establishment of mechanisms that allow them to adapt 
competitively and sustainably to them. Therefore, this paper aims to identify, through a systematic review supported 
by the Gavilan model, the operational practices (TOC, Lean Services, Six Sigma) that have been developed and 
implemented in the context of logistics services companies in the last 5 (2018 – 2023) years, with the purpose of 
establishing a clear roadmap to strengthen the operations management and competitiveness of these companies in the 
Cartagena context.

6. Conclusions  
In this systematic review, the objectives set at the beginning of the study were met. The operational practices 
implemented in logistics services companies in the Cartagena context during the last five years (2018-2023) were 
identified and analyzed, with the purpose of establishing a roadmap to strengthen operations management and 
competitiveness in this sector. 
 
The findings of this research highlight the importance of operational practices, such as Theory of Constraints (TOC), 
Lean Services, and Six Sigma, in improving the efficiency and quality of logistics services. Through the systematic 
review supported by the Gavilán model, it was evidenced that these practices have generated positive impacts in the 
reduction of delivery times, the increase in efficiency in warehouses, the decrease in transport costs and the improvement 
in the quality of service in various areas of logistics companies.  including profitability, quality and productivity. The 
unique contribution of this research lies in its comprehensive approach to understanding and evaluating operational 
practices in the specific context of logistics service companies in Cartagena. By using the Gavilán model, an adequate 
structuring of the information collected was achieved, which allowed the identification of patterns in the adoption of 
operational practices, focus on continuous improvement, use of technology, organizational culture to give trends and 
areas for improvement in a clear and organized way to companies in the logistics sector. 
 
In addition, this research provides a solid basis for strategic decision-making in the logistics sector. The 
recommendations derived from this study, such as the strengthening of the Six Sigma methodology, TOC, Lean service 
and the implementation of ICT that offer logistics service companies in Cartagena a clear path towards continuous 
improvement and competitiveness in a dynamic and challenging business environment.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to characterize the management of operations in the service systems of the hotel sector in 
Cartagena de Indias. Servicing, understood as the manufacture of services, together with approaches such as Lean 
Service and six sigma focused on eliminating waste and improving efficiency in service processes, is a topic of interest. 
When reviewing the existing literature on operational management in hotels, it is observed that several authors have 
addressed this topic through studies or analyses. However, little attention has been paid to research on how these 
approaches, successful in the area of manufacturing, can be effectively implemented in service manufacturing. For 
the preparation of this document, we chose to use a qualitative research methodology applying the Gavilan model, 
which will allow us to offer a clearer and more precise vision of what is in the subject in the time horizon of the last 
5 years (2014 – 2024). The expected results seek to determine the extent to which these improvement approaches are 
being implemented in operations management in the hospitality sector, providing valuable insights into areas of

6. Conclusions 
The growing relevance of research on the implementation of 4.0 technologies in the hospitality sector highlights a 
significant shift in operational focus. In this context, studies are underway to understand the psychosocial impact that 
could arise from relying on services provided by robots. This reflection underscores the need for broader, more ethical 
considerations in human interaction with technology within the hospitality industry. 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has left a deep mark on the tourism industry, radically transforming the way we travel and 
how services are managed in the hospitality sector. However, despite the unprecedented challenges faced by tourism 
during the health crisis, current data shows renewed interest and increased importance attached to the act of travel. 
According to (Expendia, 2023), 46% of travelers consider travel to be more important now than before the pandemic, 
a trend even more pronounced among Millennials (52%) and Gen Z (50%). This evidence suggests that while Covid-
19 has marked a significant milestone in the history of tourism, it has also triggered a shift in perception in the value 
and relevance of exploring the world and enjoying new experiences. Adapting to this new traveler mindset will require 
continued innovation and attention to changing market expectations, but it also presents exciting opportunities to 
revitalize and reinvent the tourism industry in the post-pandemic future. 
 
Hotel management systems (PMS) are indispensable tools for the efficient operation of hotels, ranging from 
reservation management to data analysis for strategic decision-making. Its importance lies in its ability to improve 
service quality, increase customer satisfaction, and maximize profitability. (Calderón Fajardo & Para-González, 2022) 
By facilitating resource management, understanding guest preferences, and adapting nimbly to market demands, PMSs 
become crucial strategic advantages in a competitive environment such as the hotel industry. Their implementation 
and effective use not only simplify the daily tasks of staff, but also support long-term planning and sustainable growth 
of hotels. 
 
In the regulatory framework of the hotel sector, there are various provisions that regulate fundamental aspects for the 
operation of the tourism industry. From the implementation of measures to promote sustainable tourism to the 
regulation of taxes and parafiscal contributions, these regulations reflect the concern for the balanced development of 
the sector.

Abstract 
The education sector is one of the most important sectors of society, as it is responsible for the comprehensive training 
of future generations, developing the necessary skills for people’s personal and professional growth. An educated 
workforce drives a country’s innovation, productivity, and economic and social growth, is essential for human 
progress, economic development, and the promotion of just and sustainable societies.  Due to the fact that new global 
scenarios have been presented, social organizations have been forced to undertake prompt transformations, education 
is no stranger to this phenomenon of change, for this and many reasons the educational system has been faced with 
various challenges to give appropriate and precise responses to the new needs for this 21st century.  Under this 
framework, the present work aims to carry out a systemic review of the literature, supported by the Gavilan model 
and with the aim of establishing practices that from scientific research have been systematized around the management

5. Conclusions 
The low quality of education, evidenced by poor results in standardized tests, the increase in school dropouts and 
persistent absenteeism, is attributed to inefficiency in educational processes. This inefficiency arises from the lack of 
optimization of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and the poor implementation of educational technology, 
highlighting the urgent need to improve these aspects to ensure a more effective and equitable education system. 
 Lean Service, Six Sigma and Theory of Constraints offer effective tools and methodologies to identify and solve 
problems of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction in the educational field. Through the application of these 
methodologies, it is possible to optimize processes, reduce waste and improve the quality of the educational service. 
In addition, educational data analysis plays a critical role in providing detailed insights into student achievement, 
allowing for the identification of areas for improvement and make informed strategic decisions for the development 
and continuous improvement of the education system. 
 
 Addressing educational issues requires an interdisciplinary approach that involves the collaboration of experts in 
various areas such as education, engineering, economics, public policy, and other relevant disciplines. This synergy 
of knowledge and perspectives makes it possible to develop comprehensive solutions that effectively address the 
complex challenges faced by the education system, thus promoting a holistic approach to the continuous and 
sustainable improvement of education. 
 
 Investment in quality education is critical for Colombia's development, as improving the quality of education is crucial 
for the well-being of citizens and the country's progress. Public policies that promote equity in access to quality 
education are required, as investing in education is an investment in Colombia's future, thus ensuring sustainable

Abstract 
Automating and integrating V2X communication infrastructure, connected vehicles, and Vulnerable Road Users 
(VRU) is critical to enhancing the interaction process to detect, categorize, and predict patterns and behaviors to 
decrease fatal accidents for VRUs. Multiple challenges are unsolved to address efficiencies in understanding potential 
risky behaviors from VRUs and connected vehicles. Ample possibilities to expand research exist in different domains, 
under the data perspective, modeling behaviors, increasing accuracy during all the interactions, and considering other 
exogenous variables, such as crime rate or environmental conditions. Despite technological advances, recent literature 
highlights rising traffic casualties related to vulnerable road users (VRU), such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, 
and animals. Therefore, designing a robust, resilient, and reliable system for end-to-end VRU protection is critical. 
Unsupervised and Deep Learning were combined as techniques to predict VRU injury risk levels. A proposed 
framework and the “V2X-VRU Dashboard” App Visualization are developed. Our project considered data gathered 
from multiple sources in real-time. There were two primary sources: 1) New York City DOT and 2) the NYC Open 
Data for Motor Vehicle Collisions – Person gathered during 2021. Our study shows a combined methodology of neural 
network-based PCA to ingest real-time data (offline), process, and classify the risk levels of fatalities. It is an empirical 
and straightforward method to define the principal components of neural network-based PCA.

Abstract 
One of the challenges faced by manufacturers of modular furniture is the occurrence of missing parts in products 
delivered to customers. Inefficiency in the packaging department poses significant issues affecting productivity, costs, 
customer satisfaction, and perceived quality. To tackle these challenges and minimize missing parts while improving 
processing times, a series of improvement measures is proposed based on Lean Manufacturing principles, utilizing 
tools such as Poka-Yoke and standardized work. Following the engineering design methodology, the proposals 
underwent validation through simulation using Flexsim software. The results enabled an increase in units dispatched 
from the packaging department and a reduction in the percentage of missing parts, ultimately leading to decreased 
costs associated with returns and replacements.

Lean Manufacturing, Simulation, Productivity, Packing process 
1. Introduction
In the current business context, marked by its dynamism and fierce competitiveness, operational efficiency is a 
fundamental pillar for achieving success and full customer satisfaction. In this scenario, the packaging area plays a 
crucial role in the productive chain of the modular furniture manufacturing company, on which this work is based, 
exerting a direct influence on service quality and company productivity. Santos Ramírez, A.V. (2021), developed 
previous work analyzing methods and times applied to the modular furniture packaging process in this company to 
establish proposals for improvement in the process, focused on process times.  
The central purpose of this project is to formulate a strategic improvement proposal to enhance the efficiency of the 
company's packaging process. To achieve this goal, key tools such as process standardization and Lean Manufacturing 
tools like Poka-Yoke are employed to reduce waste, as well as validation tools such as simulation using the FlexSim 
program to verify the effectiveness of the proposals. The primary goal is to increase the units produced by the 
packaging area, as well as to reduce the quality waste faced by the company.

Abstract 
There is a lack of research that identifies the driver factors of food waste along the Supply Chain in cities in Indonesian, 
not only in households but also supermarkets and restaurants. This study aims to identify the driving factors of food 
waste in cities in Indonesian, especially the cities of Surabaya and Sidoarjo.  Based on the SIPOC framework (Supplier, 
Input, Process, Output, and Customer), literature review, and interviews using the Delphi method with 5 experts, as 
well as using system dynamics, the driving factors of food waste in cities in Indonesian have been determined. The 
significant driver factors of food waste in supermarkets and restaurants are (1) inventory planning, (2) warehousing 
facilities, (3) market access, (4) food standards, (5) communication and collaboration, (6) demand fluctuation, (7) 
processing methods and packaging designs, and (8) cold storage and other facilities. Significant driver factors of food 
waste in household include (1) awareness of the amount of food wasted, (2) a culture of wasting food, and (3) control 
over for food supply at home.

Introduction
Food waste has become an important issue, as seen from the development of research that occurred from 2002 to now 
in 2023, where the numbers are increasing (Cahyana, Vanany and Arvitrida, 2019). The increase in the number of articles 
obtained from Scopus.com data can be seen in Figure 1. The definition of food waste can be seen from various 
perspectives, so different institutions and organisations can use different definitions of food waste  ((Dou, Toth and 
Westendorf, 2018) (Russ and Schnappinger, 2006)). Food waste can be seen by its type, how it is formed, and where it 
comes from (Ravindran and Jaiswal, 2016). In poor and developing countries, most food is wasted in the production 
and processing process due to inefficient. Meanwhile, in developed countries, more food is wasted from the 
consumption side, and each individual can waste about 100 kg of food per year (Liu et al., 2013). This research uses 
the definition that food waste is food of good quality that can be consumed by humans, but for some reason is not 
consumed or utilised. Area of food waste according to Betz (Betz et al., 2015) and Liu (Liu et al., 2013) occur during 
distribution and sales in retail, food service, and when consumed, thus using urban areas because almost all players 
are in urban areas ((Parfitt, Barthel and Macnaughton, 2010)(Ravindran and Jaiswal, 2016)).

increase, this makes the amount of food waste even higher and the goal of food stewardship to realise the SDG goals 
in 2030 will never be achieved. Policy makers in urban food waste management must consider the total food processed 
and served, which has implications not only for the community but also for players. With this model, policy makers 
can solve environmental problems. However, the proposed model is still under construction and there are still several 
opportunities to extend the study obtained here. Validation and determination of suitable scenarios and the best 
scenarios to improve food security will be conducted in the next stage of research. In addition, the addition of new 
variables, collection of historical data from other cities, and optimisation with the new SD model structure are further 
research directions in this paper.

Abstract 
The use of green hydrogen is rapidly transforming the energy market, opening new markets and business models while 
positively impacting the creation of sustainable supply chains. This eco-friendly alternative offers numerous 
advantages, such as reducing carbon footprint, increasing social and knowledge engagement, and providing new 
revenue streams for energy companies. As a result, many countries are debating how to integrate green hydrogen as a 
new renewable energy source into their national energy mix. Despite these debates, there is still uncertainty about how 
sustainable supply chains can optimize the availability of green hydrogen to customers. To tack-le this issue, a 
literature review will be carried out using natural language processing. The study aims to identify the current state of 
research at the intersection of green hydrogen and supply chains by leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
algorithm. The study will shed light on renewable energy development in emerging countries, generating novel 
insights for future research in the field. The study's results will help companies make in-formed decisions about their 
investments in sustainable hydrogen supply chains.

1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been a global movement towards transitioning from fossil fuel-based energy systems to 
renewable energy systems, marking a significant stride in the countries collective commitment to a sustainable and 
environ-mentally friendly future. However, despite the numerous advantages of renewable energy, such as cleanliness, 
renewability, and lower maintenance requirements, widespread adoption still faces challenges. As indicated by Seo et 
al. (2023), one of the key obstacles lies in the intermittent nature of renewable energy, which can be mitigated through 
the utilization of energy storage systems. Among these systems, hydrogen shows particular promise (Raeesi et al. 
826","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
to emerge as suppliers of green hydrogen compared to others, it is vital to consider how supply chains should adapt to 
facilitate the distribution of this product. Additionally, fostering collaborative dynamics between customers and 
suppliers becomes crucial for ensuring a fair and sustainable distribution of hydrogen (Eicke and De Blasio 2022); 
From this perspective, it is crucial to establish a connection between the development of new hydrogen chains and the 
evolution of flexible and intelligent supply chains, as well as sustainable and intelligent supply chains (Enrique et al. 
2022; Laura V. Lerman et al. 2022; Laura Visintainer Lerman et al. 2023). This will provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the potential for the hydrogen chain to become more sustainable and flexible over time. 
 
New research area: The growth of research in green hydrogen is creating a research area focused on it, which can 
generate a lot of innovation in the area, because research in green hydrogen has received many public and private 
incentives. It has become a priority in several regions and countries. For example, a lot of research is focusing on 
different aspects of green hydrogen: the flexible model of green hydrogen as an energy provider, green hydrogen 
policies, impact of green hydrogen on net-zero and new energy supply chains. The new research also examines the 
economic development of specific regions with the objective of creating employment opportunities, increasing 
income, and enhancing the quality of life. 
 
Application in Industry: The transport sector has traditionally received the primary focus in green hydrogen studies. 
However, it is crucial to expand research efforts to explore other sectors, such as the steel industry or buildings, which 
possess distinct demand characteristics and distribution requirements. These sectors hold significant potential and 
warrant further investigation in the future (Sgarbossa et al., 2023). 
 
The versatility of green hydrogen enables its application across various domains, including power generation, energy 
storage, and transportation, among others. With regard to the field of transportation, the utilization of renewable 
energy, including green hydrogen, represents a potential solution for the electrification of the global public 
transportation fleet (Leichter et al. 2022). Ongoing research is actively exploring its potential for industrial use, 
prompting many industries to forge partnerships with universities to achieve more refined outcomes. Businesses play 
a pivotal role in driving the development of renewable energies, including green hydrogen. When companies discover 
practical applications for its utilization, it becomes easier for them to invest in this area. 
Furthermore, the global energy crisis has compelled companies to seek ways to reduce their dependence on traditional 
grids. As a result, many businesses have discovered multiple applications for green hydrogen, as it offers a reliable 
alternative. The need to decrease reliance on centralized power networks has spurred the demand for new forms of 
energy, particularly clean sources, to ensure uninterrupted processes. 
 
Renewable energy economy: The renewable energy economy has undergone significant changes in recent years, 
largely influenced by the Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011. Currently, green hydrogen plays a crucial role in 
facilitating the transition to a renewable energy economy due to its production using renewable energy sources. The 
production of green hydrogen not only contributes to the advancement of renewable energy systems but also fosters 
the growth of the renewable energy economy. By introducing a distinct form of investment into the market, green 
hydrogen helps reduce costs associated with clean energy generation. Consequently, green hydrogen can be seen as 
an integral component of the renewable energy economy, offering new avenues for research, and enabling the 
provision of clean and safe energy to underserved regions and developing countries. 
 
7. Conclusion 
By analyzing the potential and addressing the challenges involved in developing a green hydrogen supply chain, it is 
possible to contribute to creating a more environmentally friendly and sustainable energy future. In that sense this 
study identified eight key topics that contribute to the understanding of this field. These topics encompass various 
aspects, including hydrogen cost and storage, transportation, distribution, renewable energy economy, energy 
generation, in-dust rial applications, and environmental impact. 
We have observed that while there is immense promise in green hydrogen, certain barriers such as high production 
costs, limited infrastructure, and complexities in the supply chain must be addressed to achieve its full potential. 
However, as technology advances and the costs associated with renewable energy and electrolysis decrease, the 
production and utilization of green hydrogen are expected to increase significantly. 
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in studies focusing on finding new and optimized distribution 
methods for green hydrogen. While these studies contribute valuable insights to the field, it is crucial to also emphasize 
the importance of investigating green hydrogen supply chain management and developing new supply chain models.

By addressing these areas, we can enhance the overall effectiveness and viability of green hydrogen as a clean energy 
solution. Continued research and collaboration in these domains will play a pivotal role in driving the successful 
implementation of green hydrogen technologies and fostering a sustainable and decarbonized future. 
Overall, this literature review has shed light on the current state of research in the field of green hydrogen supply 
chains and identified key areas for further exploration. By addressing the identified topics and building upon existing 
knowledge, we can pave the way for a robust, efficient, and environmentally friendly green hydrogen supply chain 
that contributes to a sustainable future. 
 
Moreover, the utilization and acceptance of each type of hydrogen will rely on factors such as local energy resources, 
infrastructure availability, and policy backing. Therefore, future studies that consider specific contexts are crucial to 
comprehend the true potential of hydrogen. Furthermore, it is imperative to con-duct studies that examine the roles of 
governments, industries, and research institutions in coordinating efforts, establishing new policies, and fostering 
innovation. These studies are essential in understanding how these stakeholders can contribute to the development and 
advancement of the green hydrogen supply chain. Coordinated efforts among these stakeholders are crucial for 
overcoming challenges and realizing the full potential of the green hydrogen supply chain. It is through these collective 
actions that we can foster a sustainable and resilient energy future. 
 
Furthermore, the article advances Sustainable Development Goal 7 of clean and affordable energy, thereby facilitating 
the achievement of universal, reliable, modern, and affordable access to energy services and the investment in energy 
sources that have low carbon emissions. With the insight of the article, one can gain a more comprehensive 
understanding of the global energy transformation.

Abstract 
Competency-based teaching and learning are gaining popularity in engineering education as it offers opportunities to 
develop crucial skills like teamwork, and problem-solving. In the field of engineering, environmental responsibility 
and sustainability are essential skills that professionals must possess. Consequently, this research aims to explore how 
pedagogical practices and assessment methods in sustainability-related courses can be aligned with competency-based 
teaching. A case study was conducted with an industrial engineering undergraduate program participation in a 
Modernization of Undergraduate Education Program. The selected competency for evaluation was ""acting with 
environmental responsibility"" as it is increasingly valued by companies worldwide when hiring engineering 
professionals. A method was developed to assess the integration of pedagogical practices and assessment methods 
with competency-based learning, to develop competencies in sustainability. This method was used during a workshop 
with nine professionals. The workshop resulted in the development of rubrics for the sustainability competency. These 
rubrics were tailored to address the learning needs of students throughout the course. Additionally, the workshop 
identified the key teaching practices and assessment methods that should be employed in these sustainability-focused 
courses. By implementing this research, engineering courses can ensure that students are actively developing the 
necessary skills and competencies in environmental responsibility and sustainability.

1. Introduction
Competency-based learning (CBL) presents a paradigm shift in the educational approach, as opposed to the long-used 
content-based learning (Sullivan and Downey 2015). CBL, on the other hand, introduced a new vision and alternative 
for the development of competencies in students, as it focuses on the development of students' skills and knowledge 
so that they are best prepared for the market (Gervais 2016). In this sense, the central idea of CBL is that students 
have their own pace of progression and learning and that they are evaluated based on their ability to demonstrate 
competence. Therefore, CBL uses new innovative methodologies and puts the student as the center of learning, 
resulting in a better professional and personal development for students in universities (Daugherty et al. 2016). 
CBL is an innovation in the traditional educational approach because, unlike traditional teaching, student assessments 
are made using other methods than tests. For example, students may be evaluated based on their ability to complete 
tasks, present assignments (communication) (Gruppen 2012) or solve problems rather than on their memorization of 
information (Nodine and Johnstone 2015). When using CBL, it is critical to change the assessment techniques used 
so that competence development can be clearly measured. Furthermore, at CBL, innovative teaching practices (i.e. 
project-based learning, flipped classroom, culturally inclusive teaching) are used (Stock and Kohl 2018), whereas in

observed at three different performance levels. Also, no differences in pedagogical practices and assessment methods 
were detected in the first two performance levels in relation to the three domains proposed by Bloom's taxonomy. 
However, at the advanced level, there was an attempt to create separate assessment methods relating to the three 
domains. Finally, few pedagogical practices and assessment methods were used as well as the incorporation of 
technology. There is a tendency to use more practices that was not observed in this study. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Engineering education centered on sustainable development is a growing topic in the literature. However, professors 
and students have found it difficult at times to integrate engineering knowledge with sustainable development. As a 
result, it is critical to structure both competencies and courses in engineering education with a focus on sustainable 
development. The integration of competences with learning outcomes, pedagogical practices, and assessment methods 
assists professors in rethinking how to correctly teach sustainability concepts and what form of assessment is best. 
Because sustainability is a complex topic involving several pillars, classes involving these systems are required. The 
findings of this article may aid in the development of more sustainable classes in engineering programs, broadening 
the scope of action in the field of engineering education. The article's findings can be applied to fields other than 
industrial engineering. In addition, in future research, focus groups can be used with students who are participating in 
disciplines to understand what they are learning and how they are evolving. Future research could also investigate 
whether there is a difference in the pedagogical practices and assessment methods utilized by courses that emphasize 
sustainability versus those that do not.  Also, future studies can categorize pedagogical practices and assessment 
methods according to performance levels and the three domains of Bloom's taxonomy to assist instructors in 
implementing them in their courses.  
 
Acting with Environmental Responsibility is a fundamental part of sustainability, as it brings the environmental vision 
of sustainability. Companies and individuals who practice environmental responsibility are contributing to broader 
sustainability goals, particularly the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda, helping to protect the 
environment for future generations while meeting the needs of the present. In short, environmental responsibility is a 
specific action within the broader context of sustainability that needs to be taught in engineering classes so that future 
professionals can apply the concepts in their work. Therefore, it is important to analyze, based on the teaching and 
practice of this competence, which new pedagogical practices and assessment methods should be implemented to 
contribute to the environmental vision of sustainability.

Abstract 
This research aims to optimize the CAPEX purchasing process in a large polymetallic mining company, 
evaluating the problems and bottlenecks present in this process. The methodology presented focuses on the 
exhaustive collection of quantitative and qualitative data, as well as on the implementation of strategies based 
on Lean methodologies such as Just in Time and Muda. As a result, there is a significant reduction in delivery 
times for purchase orders, as well as an improvement in efficiency and overall process performance, validated 
by statistical analysis and simulations in ARENA software. The conclusion is that the implementation of the 
Just in Time and Muda strategies has proven to be effective in optimizing the CAPEX purchasing process, with 
positive impacts on operational efficiency and reduction of times with a 95% confidence level. It is 
recommended to continue exploring the potential of the Just in Time methodology in international environments 
and to monitor the improvements implemented in the long term.

1. Introduction
Mining in Peru plays a crucial role in its economic dynamics, being an important engine of growth. In recent 
years, its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has reached 10% of the national total, showing 
exponential growth (Simon et al., 2023). This is not surprising considering that Peru is one of the main producers 
of minerals in the world. In addition, in 2023, mining accounted for 62% of the country’s exports (Coayla et 
al., 2024). This is due to the diversity of minerals extracted in the country, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc and 
others. These minerals are not only fundamental to the national economy, but also play a crucial role in the 
global commodity market (Rodríguez & Álvarez, 2023).

When analyzing the above figures, it is observed that the difference between the indicators of the new 
purchasing process and the original model is different from zero. That is, the active time, waiting time, total 
time and bidding time show lower values in all replications compared to the original model. Based on the 
confidence tests carried out on these results, it is concluded with 95% confidence that the proposed purchasing 
model presents significant and effective changes in terms of optimizing time and resources. 
 
6. Conclusions
From the results obtained, it was concluded that the implementation of strategies based on Lean methodologies, 
such as Just in Time and Muda, has proven effective in optimizing the CAPEX purchasing process in the mining 
company. A significant reduction in purchase order delivery times was achieved, as well as an improvement in 
efficiency and overall process performance validated by the Output Analyzer and compared to a Two-Sample-
T test with a 95% confidence level. 
 
Therefore, a clear validation was obtained of the positive impact of the proposed improvements of the active, 
857","waiting, total and bidding time, both in terms of time optimization and in the operational efficiency of the 
purchasing process. Simulation results and statistical analysis support the effectiveness of the implementation 
of Just in Time and Muda strategies in optimizing workflow and reducing procurement time. 
 
Future research recommends continuing to explore the potential of the Just in Time methodology for optimizing 
the procurement process, especially in international environments and in sectors with large operations. In 
addition, it is suggested to monitor the implementation of the proposed improvements over the long term in 
order to assess their continued impact and make additional adjustments if necessary.

Abstract 
This study targets enhancing profitability in a Peruvian construction company through the integration of Total 
Productive Maintenance (TPM), Lean Manufacturing and Human Resources Management tools. Historically, the 
construction sector in Peru has faced challenges such as material shortages, labor inefficiencies, and operational 
disruptions due to socio-political unrest, contributing to a profitability decline. This research responds to these 
challenges by proposing a model that applies Lean tools—Just-In-Time for material procurement efficiency, Total 
Productive Maintenance and Autonomous Maintenance for improved machinery reliability, and Standard Work and 
One-Point-Lesson for labor productivity. Additionally, a human resources strategy was designed to address the 
inadequate management and training of labor forces. The implementation of this model significantly improved 
operational outcomes, as evidenced by four key performance indicators: Profitability increased from 3.8% to the 
targeted 8%, Machinery availability enhanced, reducing downtime and operational delays, Maintenance compliance 
achieved 100%, and Labor productivity increased by 79%, demonstrating a substantial reduction in labor-related 
inefficiencies. These results underline the effectiveness of combining TPM y Lean Manufacturing principles with 
strategic human resources management to tackle the root causes of inefficiency in construction operations, positioning 
the model as a benchmark for similar companies in culturally and geographically analogous settings.

1. Introduction
The construction industry, which generates a total of USD 10.7 trillion globally, stands out as one of the most 
significant sectors in economic terms (Deloitte, 2023). It is important to note that, in 2021, the sector recovered to pre-
pandemic levels. This growth is attributed, in part, to growth expectations driven by population increase (Eberhardt et 
860",,"Finally, improving the construction processes in the field by reducing the delivery cycle time, implementing standard 
works, and creating a new area of human capital guaranteed the company's sustainability and profitability.

Abstract 
Ride-hailing services (RHS) have become prevalent among the masses in recent years in the Philippines. It has altered 
the transportation landscape, particularly for the University of Santo Tomas (UST). This abstract delves into the 
assessment of customer satisfaction with the service quality of RHS, which is crucial for the success of these services 
in the long term. Therefore, the current study aims to understand better the complexities of factors that affect customer 
satisfaction and intentions towards app-based ride-hailing services through the findings of a questionnaire study at the 
University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines. The collected data from 401 respondents were analyzed using a 
Structural model equation and Cronbach's Alpha with the service quality constructed. Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) revealed that overall satisfaction positively impacts User's intentions to continue using services in the future. 
The SEM further explained that overall satisfaction with the services mediates the relationship between service quality 
attributes, including service & system attributes, service attraction attributes, network design attributes, and service 
reliability & professionalism attributes, and commuters' intentions to continue using in the future. Further 
improvements in the quality attributes of app-based ride-hailing services would enhance the customer's overall 
satisfaction and intentions to continue using these services.

1. Introduction
The landscape of public transportation in the Philippines has witnessed significant evolution over the years, marked 
by the emergence of innovative ride-hailing services alongside traditional modes of transport like jeepneys, tricycles, 
and buses. Since the establishment of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in 1987, 
regulations have aimed to maintain fairness in fares, ensure discounts for specific groups, and uphold safety standards 
(Rooks, 2023). However, the advent of ride-hailing services, particularly with the introduction of GrabCar in 2013, 
has brought about transformative changes in the industry. The motivation behind this research stems from the need to 
comprehensively understand the impact of ride-hailing services on the transportation ecosystem in the Philippines. 
While these services offer unprecedented convenience and efficiency for commuters, they also present a range of 
challenges and concerns. Issues such as fare transparency, safety, driver professionalism, and customer satisfaction 
have surfaced, necessitating a thorough examination of the factors shaping the adoption and growth of ride-hailing 
applications. The rapid growth of ride-hailing applications like GrabCar has altered the dynamics of public 
transportation, leading to changes in commuter behavior and preferences (7 years of Grab in Southeast Asia: Grab 
announces significant milestones across its super app services, 2019). Understanding the extent of this impact is

Figure 4. Reliability analysis of Surbey questionnaire. 
 
The survey questionnaire (Figure 4) is reliable based on the values of Cronbach’s alpha for each characteristic, 
which ranges from 0.3351 to 0.620. The values were considered reliable based on a study by Adhika (2017). The 
scoring for Cronbach’s alpha was adjusted considering the small number of items in some subcategories since a 
smaller number of items can result in a lower alpha value (Denrick & Tavakol, 2011). The overall Cronbach’s Alpha 
for the whole questionnaire is 0.9115. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study investigated ride-hailing services' multifaceted realm regarding passenger satisfaction and intentions, 
focusing on engineering students from the University of Santo Tomas, employing defined objectives, systematic data 
collection, and advanced statistical analyses. Insights gleaned provide a comprehensive view of user demographics, 
preferences, and satisfaction dynamics within urban mobility. Primary pursuits included elucidating the demographic 
profile of ride-hailing users and exploring factors influencing user satisfaction, drawing responses from 401 
participants through a detailed survey, and enabling meticulous examination of user characteristics and preferences.  
 
Predominant representation of primarily young adults aged 18-23, gender balance, and varied income levels 
underscored the study's inclusivity, while Manila and Quezon City's prominence showcased the widespread usage and 
accessibility of ride-hailing services. Users exhibited positive sentiments towards driver professionalism, user-
friendliness, and vehicle options, with a resounding willingness to recommend these services, fostering potential 
organic growth.  Valuable insights into latent constructs such as Performance, Service, Professionalism, and Intention 
to Continue were provided, affirmed through robust factor loadings, composite reliability, and convergent validity, 
unraveling dynamics shaping user satisfaction and intent to persist in using ride-hailing services.  
 
Despite overall satisfaction and intention to continue showing no significant impact on desired outcomes, mediation 
analysis highlighted the crucial role of customer satisfaction and intent to continue in mediating the impact of service 
attributes on desired outcomes. The study contributes to urban mobility's evolving landscape, providing stakeholders 
with actionable insights for enhancing service quality and user satisfaction in the ride-hailing industry.

Abstract 
Plastic bottle caps play a crucial role in sealing and preserving the contents of beverage containers, ensuring freshness 
and preventing leakage. This paper aims to optimize manufacturing processes at Plastic Bottle Caps Manufacturing 
Company to meet production objectives. Challenges include meeting daily demand quotas, boosting productivity, and 
refining layout processes of secondary processes by eliminating delays and downtime, employing tools like Time and 
Motion study, ProModel simulation, and DMAIC techniques. Ishikawa diagrams identify root causes and concentrate 
on the 6M's: Method, Machine, Manpower, Measurement, Material, and Money, while Pareto diagrams prioritize 
areas for improvement to alleviate bottlenecks. Proposing a U-shaped sequential layout enhances quality checking 
procedures, weighing processes, and increases worker productivity through reduced manpower allocation, machine 
monitoring, and improvement. It results in a 3.14-minute reduction in production time, eliminating 17.60 meters of 
unnecessary travel and reducing delay and waste time by 17.82%, surpassing the study's 4% improvement objective 
with a 15% allowance factor. Production increases to 33 cycles, yielding approximately 33,000 caps per day, 
representing an 18.18% productivity rate increase from 27 cycles. These improvements surpass the study's goals, 
meeting the daily quota and increasing productivity by 10%. The study recommends further modern approaches and 
methodologies to sustain effectiveness.

1. Introduction
Packaging is essential in maintaining the quality of liquids. However, inspecting the bottle alone is insufficient; no 
matter how nicely the rest of the package is made, it will be useless if the cap is defective. As a result, the client feels 
negatively about the brand and might shop around for future necessities (Seo, 2023). Plastic Bottle Caps 
Manufacturing Company is one of the largest plastics producers in the Philippines, because of the market's vast reach 
and the strong demand for plastic necessities, a large number of yields must be produced daily in every product 
manufactured by the company, this includes processes to meet the company's quota. Complying with manufacturing 
orders on time entails assigning workstations, laborers, and raw materials. The company can't predict how many 
workers and materials will be required to finish an order by the deadline if it doesn't have a good production plan (SA, 
2021). One product the company manufactures is a bottle cap for a well-known brand used in washing; by giving 
clients a reliable and high-quality supply of these products, the company prioritizes their contentment. This brand is 
always in demand because it is an essential part of daily life and is used for packaging liquid chemicals sold in grocery 
stores nationwide and abroad.

The study suggested an efficient plant layout, a proposed layout that follows a sequential process. This layout saves 
3.14 minutes on the total time production within the secondary process. It also saves 17.60 meters in terms of 
unnecessary distance traveled. This was only made possible by monitoring and removing production delays, which 
led to significant time and motion savings that were carried out as well in the study through the use of process motion 
symbols, flow process charts, and operation process charts, which represent the processes, demonstrate a step-by-step 
process, and identify specific procedures. Based on the savings from the present and proposed standard time of 14.48 
minutes, the production reduces waste time and delays by 17.82% for the proposed process. This is more than 12% of 
the proposed objective of the study. Additionally, the number of bottle caps produced has increased from the present 
27 cycles, which yield only around 27,000 pieces, to 33 cycles from the proposed process, which yields about 33,000 
caps daily. This indicates that the input and output of bottle caps are now equal. Considering everything, the production 
of bottle caps has increased its productivity rate from 81.82% using the present process to 18.18%, much exceeding 
the original 10% improvement goal. If the study's recommendations and findings are implemented, the productivity 
rate can reach 100% and meet the company’s quota for the plastic bottle cap secondary process.

Abstract 
The garment industry plays a crucial role in the economy’s overall growth by manufacturing the quality of clothes being 
sold worldwide. But despite playing a crucial role in economic growth, the industry experiences idle Times that affects 
productivity. The goal of this study is to identify the factors that cause delays and  propose an optimized facility layout that 
helps enhance the productivity and efficiency of the whole production. Moreover, this study offers a comprehensive 
analysis of the impact of facility layout on manufacturing productivity, specifically on garment manufacturing production 
of two-way colored shirts. Additionally, this study uses qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, including the 
time and motion study (T.M.S.) method and ProModel Simulation software, to analyze the production process. This paper 
observed and interviewed workers at garment manufacturing companies and validated the present and proposed facility 
layout for garment manufacturing companies using ProModel Simulation software. After simulating, the study indicates 
that the proposed production layout significantly increased production capacity, elevating the hourly production rate by 
4.62 times. This means there is a significant increase in the production efficiency and output of garment manufacturing, 
with the ability to produce 231 shirts within an eight-hour shift compared to the previous 50 shirts. Future research of this 
study will consider other layouts theory approaches such as U-shaped layout and Cellular layout.  This paper presents the 
crucial role of strategic facility layout planning in manufacturing processes, offers valuable insights for similar industries 
aiming to enhance their manufacturing productivity, and demonstrates the potential for substantial improvements in 
operational efficiency and output through layout optimization.

1.Introduction
The manufacturing industry plays a crucial role in boosting economies and employment opportunities. Notably, the garment 
industry is prominent in the economy's overall growth. Facility layout planning is a critical component of any company's 
operation strategies. It shapes the production systems and is essential for efficient operations (Perez-Gosendea et al., 2020). 
An efficient layout can result in idle Time and high production costs, positively impacting overall performance. In the 
sewing industry, optimizing the facility layout is crucial to enhance productivity and efficiency. It can reduce idle Time 
and improve overall performance by thoroughly arranging workstations and machines. 
Consequently, garment manufacturing must have a properly designed facility layout to enhance productivity and efficiency. 
The garment manufacturing company is a sewing business that manufactures quality clothes for different customers and 
sells them across malls nationwide. Since its inception in 2016, it has expanded, opening branches in Angono, Rizal,

current layout. Additionally, the average Time spent in the system and operation decreased in the proposed layout, 
indicating enhanced efficiency and productivity. 
Moreover, to calculate the productivity increase, the study has determined the difference in the number of shirts produced 
per hour before and after the proposed layout. Before the change, garment manufacturing could produce 50 shirts in 8 
hours, and its hourly production rate was 6.25 shirts per hour. In the proposed layout change, garment manufacturing can 
produce 231 shirts in 8 hours, and its hourly production rate is 29.375 shirts per hour. To find the productivity increase, we 
can calculate the ratio of your proposed hourly production rate to the current rate of 4.62. Therefore, the productivity 
increase is 4.62 fold. 
The results of this study highlight the importance of optimizing facility layouts in manufacturing processes to achieve 
higher productivity levels. By implementing changes based on these findings, garment manufacturing can facilitate 
improvement in its operations, reduce production time, and increase output significantly. This paper provides valuable 
insights for similar industries looking to enhance their manufacturing processes through strategic facility layout 
improvements. Thus, the findings are a foundation for further enhancements and optimizations within garment 
manufacturing production processes, ultimately contributing to increased company competitiveness, output, and 
profitability.

Abstract 
The work is a case study in a wooden pallet factory that experienced issues with standardizing the cutting of its logs. 
Since logs serve as the base material for assembling the product, the lack of standardization in this process led to 
wasted materials and increased stock levels. Consequently, the research was conducted within the company's sawmill 
sector to enhance the efficiency of the process, standardize it, minimize waste, and align production with customer 
demand. To achieve this goal, data were collected from the factory floor, and concepts such as cutting problems, 
production planning and control, operational research, and linear programming were utilized, alongside tools such as 
solver software and Microsoft Excel. Following data collection, analysis, and tool implementation, control and 
standardization were successfully achieved.

1. Introduction
The wooden pallet industry plays a vital role in logistics, facilitating the transportation and movement of goods across 
various sectors such as food, automotive, textile, retail, chemical, and pharmaceutical. Despite its ease of use, pallet 
manufacturing can become complex and result in material waste, increased costs, and inventory levels if not properly 
planned. To avoid waste related to raw material usage, ensure product quality, and manage costs effectively, it's 
necessary to standardize and control the process of cutting wood logs for pallet construction. 
Given this, the current market is seeking even more qualified companies and professionals aligned with total product 
efficiency, aiming for process optimization, standardization, cost reduction, waste minimization, and ultimately, profit 
increase. For efficient production processes, it's crucial to have a team with knowledge in Operational Research (OR), 
providing critical and in-depth analysis to identify possible flaws, improvements, and maximize results. 
OR is a systematic and quantitative approach to solving complex problems, within which lies Linear Programming 
(LP), a mathematical technique used for process optimization across various sectors like logistics, finance, healthcare, 
manufacturing, and energy. LP solutions are often found through computational algorithms, making it one of the most 
utilized methods in OR. 
The application of OR, along with LP, focuses on optimization, simulation, decision analysis, risk assessment, and 
mathematical modeling of processes, contributing to cost reduction, productivity enhancement, and product/service 
quality improvement. 
As an interdisciplinary subject, OR utilizes mathematical techniques including linear programming, statistics, and 
data analysis to model and analyze complex systems, identifying efficient and effective solutions tailored to each 
organization's specific problems.

Figure 4 represents how this cutting will occur, so the 2.40-meter log enters the sawmill to start the cutting process, 
where it is transformed into two 1200 cm joists, then the machine responsible for the cutting process cuts each joist 
into 7 slats, totaling 14 slats to proceed to the pallet assembly.

Therefore, it was necessary to create a visual template that the collaborator could use to understand how this cut will 
be made. In this case, the example of this pattern would be seen as depicted in Figure 5, where the front cutting model 
should have a thickness of 17 mm, a width of 85 mm, and a length of 1200 mm. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Cutting Pattern Template 
 
Given the results, it was necessary to monitor the implementation of the cutting pattern in the company as well as 
testing with various demands to ensure there were no errors in issuing the cutting patterns. An improvement in 
understanding of the process was observed due to the feedback received from the collaborator, as before this pattern 
model, there was no perception of the possible combinations that could be made with the 2.40-meter log. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This work aims to demonstrate the use of operations research in a small business, in order to prove the efficiency of 
linear programming in solving cutting problems, bringing improvement and cost reduction to the process. With the 
use of Microsoft Excel through the Solver tool in the application of the cutting problem, it can be said that it was a 
positive contribution with low investment costs for the company and for process improvement.

The objective of the work was achieved through the implementation of a cutting pattern to reduce raw material losses 
through linear programming. This was possible with the cutting patterns created with combinations of rips and 
constraints. Therefore, linear programming is an efficient optimization tool if well applied in the company. 
This work was important for studies, as it was possible to apply the methodology, which provided experience in the 
field of operations research and with real application in practice in the pallet company. Despite the restrictions on 
using real company data, the study was completed. 
Finally, for future studies, it was observed that it would be important to create a cutting pattern for the other log sizes 
used in the process, as well as to automate the visual templates with CAD with drawings and rip sizes.

Abstract 
Creating regional value chains and infrastructure is essential for the advancement Africa Free Trade Agreement 
(AFCTA) and BRICS strategic objectives, this   takes into perspective the preferential trade agreements, 
leveraging of investment leading to sustainable industrialization and economic growth. The potential to achieve 
the mentioned scenario is feasible taking into consideration the abundance of primary mineral resources in the 
continent accompanied by common market with a population of 1.2 billion and a GDP of $ 2.3 trillion Creamer 
(2021);  accompanying this approach is the emphasizing  manufactured value added products and graduating 
away from export of primary products to tertiary as this will result in a high level of competitiveness and export 
driven economies impacting positively on nations balance of payments. This further complemented and 
advanced by African countries such as South Africa since 2010 and recently Ethiopia being members of BRICS; 
this forms part of emerging markets represents 42% of the world population and account for over 31% of the 
world's GDP. For economic and industrial policy around matters of preferential and free trade to transpire as 
well as sustainable industrialization entailing competitiveness, export driven economy, improved enterprise 
supply development, improved local content, employment creation and growth in sectors and economy it is 
essential that the Purchase Power Parity embraced by the International Comparisons Programme in integrated in 
the AFCTA and BRICS strategy towards regional value chains, as it objectively analyses the subject matter of 
free and preferential trade between nations leading to fairness and comparative advantage.

1.Introduction
The Africa Free Trade Agreement and BRICS are key strategic partnerships for the African continent 
considering investment and export promotion, of which require the continents ability to be competitive and 
create regional value chains , from continental focus with AFCTA as a strategic role player, the following 
indicators are vital,  population of 1,2 billion and a GPD of $ 2.3 trillion, to complement this at a greater global 
sphere,  the BRICS economic zone is inclusive of countries South Africa and Ethiopia and forms part of an 
emerging market representing 42% of the world population and 31% of the world’s GDP.  Considering the GDP 
and population and the strategic economic and industrial partnerships the continent has forged there is potential 
for the continent to advance an industrial and economic hub perpetuating into an export driven economy, 
provided the focus on import minimization strategies, as well as evidence based industrial development 
strategies.  
This will entail there is supporting critical infrastructure to enable the unlocking of economic potential, as well 
as industrial policies focusing on enabling trade policies, export promotion, and  advancement of localization , 
import minimization strategies, advancing attraction of FDI and DDI through various incentives for 
manufacturing and industrialization, re-vitalization of industrial hubs, and advancement of special economic 
zones and all other complementing and enabling incentives for a climate conducive towards sustainable 
industrialization.

continent as well as imports within the regions and imports external to the region. In terms of the data 
representation, there is a clear  demonstration that Africa also lags behind much of the world in terms of the 
integration of its regional economic communities, including the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS), the East African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the  
Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU/UMA) (Table 
1). This indeed reflects the need for the creation of regional value chains whereby unbundling of factories across 
international borders so that individual tasks are performed in different countries, which enjoy competitive 
advantage in a specific activity.

5. Conclusion 
Clearly the inception and conceptualization of AFCTA and participation in BRICS  is a step in the right 
direction for the African continent, more so taking into cognizant the projected benefits to be realized in terms of 
the improvement in the standard of living whereby 30 million people will be removed out of abject poverty by 
2035, furthermore on the trade side of the equation removal of trade barriers as well as implementation of  
regional economic integration regional income to rise by $ 450 billion, exports rise by 81% within the continent 
and 19% for non-African countries, and finally manufacturing being the largest contributor towards exports $ 
560 billion increase to be realized.  Furthermore, participation in BRICS a right directive if utilized optimally; 
considering that this forms part of emerging markets represents 42% of the world population and account for 
over 31% of the world's GDP.  This initiative to be realized however requires an emergent change in terms of 
industries and sector approach towards productivity and competitiveness; sound productivity and quality 
enhancement tools such as competitive excellence, quick response philosophy and joint improvement tools 
relating to the final manufactured goods for consumption have to be incorporated into the regional 
manufacturing value chains; integral to this is robust rail, telecommunication, road and ports infrastructure 
supported by incentives such as the special economic zone and other economic and industrial economic 
incentives for attracting domestic and foreign direct investment.

Abstract 
Predictive maintenance shows significant impact in managing and controlling the utility systems of commercial 
buildings. Here in this paper, the predictive maintenance that is in line with Industry 4.0/ Quality 4.0 is applied. The 
chilled water system is highlighted in this research and the main goal is to reach out the most occurred faults in one 
of the chilled water system, which is cooling tower. An engineering management framework was used through three 
parts, set up, machine learning, and quality control. Having said machine learning, decision tree algorithm is used in 
this research and prediction model showed high prediction accuracy. During an empirical period, the most occurred 
faults were malfunctioning blowdown system, over current, and low water basin level.

1. Introduction and Research Objective
Nowadays, the commercial buildings are filling most of the countries’ grounds. The owners of these buildings are 
obviously spending a lot of efforts in establishing polices and strategies to maintain the same. One of these strategies 
is the operation and maintenance, and this research is addressing the predictive maintenance that in line with Industry 
4.0 and Quality 4.0. Predictive maintenance is defined a managerial way that is optimising the availability of a 
particular equipment, machine, or system (Kullu and Cinar 2022). Having said a particular system, chilled water 
system is addressed here in this paper. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning

5. Conclusion 
This paper utilized a managerial framework of predictive maintenance 4.0 for chilled water system in commercial 
buildings. A particular chilled water system was chosen for an empirical study. The component is the cooling tower, 
and the goal of the study is to identify the most occurred faults during the associated period. The framework contains 
three parts, which are set up, machine learning, and quality control. The main objective of the set-up part is the data 
collection, and the main objective of the machine learning part is the training the prediction model and testing it, while 
the main objective of the quality control part is to evaluate the prediction model and to make sure the performance is 
acceptable.  
 
Having said machine learning, decision tree algorithm has been used in this paper and one the universities in Riyadh 
city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has been chosen to implement the empirical study. The prediction accuracy for the 
prediction model is high, which is 99.60 percent, and the prediction model showed an outstanding performance in 
predicting the faults and accordingly in finding the most occurred faults, which are obviously having a negative impact 
on the cooling tower performance. The most occurred faults during the said empirical period were malfunctioning 
blowdown system, over current, and low water basin level. By looking at the literature, it can be seen that no research 
has focused on these faults and the future research agenda can be in this part, so the researchers are advised to do 
further research on these three faults.

Abstract 
The paper aims to investigate the application of ISO 9001:2015 principles in non-accredited Textile and clothing 
production SMEs in Soweto. Given the increasing competition in the clothing sector, there's a continual need for 
innovative processes to enhance business performance and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and service. This 
research specifically delves into the context of Soweto Textile and clothing production SMEs, exploring how the 
adoption of ISO 9001:2015 principles can serve as a quality management system to enhance customer satisfaction. 
The paper underscores the potential for ISO 9001:2015 principles to positively impact the performance of Textile and 
clothing production SMEs in Soweto, while also highlighting the need for financial support to overcome barriers to 
accreditation. It contributes to the understanding of quality management practices in township-based businesses and 
offers recommendations for enhancing their competitiveness and sustainability. Random sample technique was used 
in this research to collect the relevant data. The findings of the questionnaire show that 61% of respondents never 
conduct quality audits in their organizations, followed by 34% of respondents who rarely conduct quality audits.  The 
remaining 5% of respondents indicated that there were only occasional quality audits conducted. Township SMEs will 
benefit from applying ISO 9001:2015 in their businesses, as the application of ISO 9001:2015 principles will 
contribute to improving the Township SMEs systems by providing operations, which can enhance the overall business 
performance of township-based SMEs. Due to lack of financial ability for Township SMEs to fund the application of 
ISO 9001:2015, the Township SMEs will need to acquire funding for the accreditation of ISO 9001:2015, SMEs can 
apply for funding via government funding entities such as the Department of Small Business Development, by 
leveraging government funding opportunities and support services, Township SMEs can overcome financial barriers 
and access the resources needed to implement ISO 9001:2015 principles, ultimately improving their business 
performance and competitiveness.

6. Discussion
Based on the findings of the study, it is evident that many non-accredited Textile and Clothing production SMEs in 
Soweto township face significant challenges, particularly regarding financial constraints and limited managerial 
capacity. These challenges hinder their ability to afford the implementation or accreditation of ISO 9001:2015 
standards, which could potentially improve their performance and competitiveness in the market. 
Given the economic and social context in which these SMEs operate, it is recommended that further research be 
conducted to explore how ISO 9001:2015 principles can be applied effectively to minimize operational costs without 
compromising product or service quality. This research should focus on developing strategies and frameworks tailored 
to the specific needs and constraints of Soweto Textile and Clothing production SMEs. 
Additionally, there is a need for interventions and support mechanisms targeted at addressing the underlying 
challenges faced by these SMEs, such as access to finance, capacity building in entrepreneurship and management 
skills, and assistance in meeting financial targets. Collaborative efforts involving government agencies, industry 
associations, and development organizations could help create enabling environments and provide necessary support 
for the growth and sustainability of Textile and Clothing production SMEs in Soweto Township. 
Recommendations 
The recommendation for further research on how ISO 9001:2015 can be applied as a Quality Management tool to 
improve business performance and Customer competitive advantage while minimize operational costs for Soweto 
Textile and Clothing SMEs without compromising product or service quality is indeed pertinent. Implementing ISO 
9001:2015 principles can offer several potential benefits to the Soweto textile and clothing SMEs. 
The research identified the below potential areas for further research and exploring: 
Process Optimization: Investigate how the implementation of ISO 9001:2015 can help streamline production 
processes within Soweto Textile and Clothing SMEs. This could involve identifying and eliminating non-value-added 
activities, reducing waste, and improving overall efficiency. 
Resource Management: Explore strategies for optimizing resource utilization within SMEs, such as better utilization 
of existing equipment and facilities, optimizing inventory management practices, and identifying opportunities for 
cost savings in procurement processes. 
Training and Capacity Building: Investigate the role of employee training and capacity building in ensuring 
effective implementation of ISO 9001:2015 standards. This could include training programs aimed at enhancing 
employees' understanding of quality management principles and their role in driving continuous improvement within 
the organization. 
Supplier Management: Examine how SMEs can leverage ISO 9001:2015 requirements related to supplier 
management to build stronger relationships with suppliers, negotiate favorable terms, and ensure the quality and 
reliability of inputs and materials. 
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to assess the potential financial implications 
of implementing ISO 9001:2015 standards for Soweto Textile and Clothing SMEs. This could involve comparing the 
upfront costs of implementation against the potential long-term savings and benefits associated with improved quality, 
reduced rework, and enhanced customer satisfaction. 
By conducting further research in these areas, policymakers, industry stakeholders, and SMEs themselves can gain 
valuable insights into how ISO 9001:2015 can be effectively leveraged to minimize operational costs while 
maintaining high standards of quality in product and service delivery. 
7. Conclusion
The study was intended to look at the application of the ISO 9001:2015 principles and how it can influence the 
performance of a business in non-accredited Soweto Textile and Clothing production SMEs. The researcher observed 
948","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
that most textile and clothing  manufactures SMEs based in Soweto township  lack adequate resources These 
businesses often operate in constrained environments such as backyard rooms and garages with limited space. 
Additionally, they commonly utilize standard household sewing machines, such as Fenci multi-sewing machines, 
which may not be suited for industrial production demands. The researcher further observed the potential challenge 
faced by SMEs in Soweto Township in meeting the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 standards regarding resource 
management. Lack of proper infrastructure and equipment impacted ton the efficiency and quality of production 
processes, further affecting the overall competitiveness and sustainability of Soweto textile and clothing production. 
Addressing these resource constraints may require interventions such as access to funding, technical assistance, or 
infrastructure development initiatives tailored to the needs of SMEs in Soweto.
