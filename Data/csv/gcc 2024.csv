Abstract 
Sultan Qaboos University Hospital was established in 1990 as a teaching hospital as part of Sultan Qaboos University 
and connected to the medical school at the beginning and the nursing school thereafter. In 2024, the hospital was 
separated to be under a new entity called 'University Medical City'. The hospital started its initial accreditation journey 
in 2003 with a start to establish a quality assurance office, and hence, since then, the administration has gone to the 
ISO 9001 Quality Management System (QMS). The hospital was the first public organization that was certified by 
ISO QMS in Oman. In 2012, another transformation was initiated at a higher level by contracting with the Canadian 
Healthcare Accreditation (ACI) to date. In this paper, the authors will compare the three phases of the of the journey: 
before accreditation, during ISO QMS accreditation, and ACI accreditation, which created an advanced transformation 
in the quality management implementation within the hospital. The comparison will focus on five domains: patient 
outcomes, patient safety, quality of care, operational efficiency, and staff performance and satisfaction. Results may 
help decision-makers assess the effectiveness of the external accreditation body to improve the quality of healthcare 
in Oman, as a new national accreditation standard is going to be established soon.

Abstract 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are vital metrics used to measure the efficiency, effectiveness, and success of 
organizational processes. In the domains of quality, reliability, and maintenance, KPIs are crucial for performance 
assessment and management, particularly within the healthcare sector which has initiated in Sultan Qaboos 
University Hospital (SQUH) as one of data driven decision making and to improve the quality and safety of care. 
Quality KPIs in hospitals measure the extent to which healthcare services meet patient expectations. Common 
quality KPIs include patient satisfaction rate, readmission rates, and infection rates. For example, SQUH patient 
satisfaction scores and clinical outcomes to enhance care quality. Implementing quality KPIs provides actionable 
data to refine processes and improve patient care. Six Sigma methodologies, heavily reliant on quality KPIs, 
significantly reduce defects and improve process capability. However, reliability KPIs in hospitals focus on 
consistent performance of systems and processes to track critical medical equipment performance, ensuring 
minimal downtime. These indicators are crucial for predicting performance and improving system design. In 
addition, maintenance KPIs in hospitals evaluate the effectiveness of maintenance activities. For instances, key 
metrics include equipment availability, and preventive maintenance compliance. Effective use of maintenance 
KPIs leads to significant cost savings and operational improvements.In general, KPIs in quality, reliability, and 
maintenance are essential for hospitals striving for operational excellence. The author in this paper will highlight 
the efficiency of implementing and integrating these KPIs, where hospitals can meet patient expectations, maintain 
reliable operations, and optimize maintenance activities, ensuring long-term success within healthcare facilities.

Abstract 
Process reengineering is an important technique for enhancing productivity and efficiency in production lines. The 
purpose of this study is to demonstrate the practicality of implementing reengineering techniques in a factory in Saudi 
Arabia that specializes in the production of diverse painting goods. These products are subsequently distributed to 
warehouses located throughout different cities in the country. The plant encounters challenges that result in delays in 
certain orders and reduced profitability, namely due to lead time. To tackle these issues, a green re-engineering 
methodology based on simulation is proposed to enhance the factory's performance in terms of both economic and 
environmental aspects. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in the production rate and daily profit by 
approximately 35.67% and 32.88%, respectively, after the implementation of the new design in comparison to the 
current system.

1. Introduction
The green reengineering method is used to implement modifications to processes, involving the transformation of the 
main operations and enhancing them from both an economic and environmental standpoint. It refers to a form of 
process re-engineering that involves a thorough overhaul of the fundamental and auxiliary elements of operations in 
order to expedite the achievement of environmental sustainability objectives for economic entities. This approach is 
regarded as a novel perspective on enhancing performance and its techniques for improving productivity, efficiency, 
and effectiveness. Furthermore, it helps to mitigate environmental issues and achieve efficient resource and energy 
utilization. The objective of the term ""green"" is to convert industrial processes into environmentally friendly processes, 
with the goal of enhancing both productivity and the working environment for employees. The proposed technique 
for green process reengineering primarily relies on a systematic and results-oriented approach implemented within the 
economic entity. For the successful implementation of green process reengineering, it is essential to adhere to the 
following steps: (1) Evaluation of processes that exhibit green process characteristics; (2) Integration of product-
related processes with environmental aspects; (3) Implementing green reengineering processes; (4) Design and 
implement training courses and change management strategies; and (5) Monitoring performance and enhancing 
processes. 
The concept of reengineering can be implemented in various ways and areas. Reengineering projects are distinguished 
by the diverse range of methodologies employed by researchers. (Nguyen and Do, 2016) described a methodology for 
transforming a traditional production model into a more efficient and simplified model. A case study was done to 
examine the implementation of lean concepts in the re-engineering process of an electronics manufacturing line.

4. Conclusion
This paper proposes a green re-engineering methodology based on simulation to enhance the factory's performance in 
terms of both economic and environmental aspects. The main problem in the selected factory is the lengthy process 
of filling the tank with materials for the mixing procedure, resulting in a detrimental impact on production efficiency 
and financial gains. To solve this problem, we proposed a solution, which involves using large bags. This approach 
minimizes time waste and enhances productivity. By implementing this alternative, the factory can expand its 
operations, increase the number of production machines, and consequently increase the quantity of materials produced. 
The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in the production rate and daily profit by approximately 35.67% 
and 32.88%, respectively, after the implementation of the new solution in comparison to the current system.

Abstract 
The pharmaceutical sector in Latin America, particularly in Peru, has seen significant growth, with small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) playing a crucial role in the supply of essential medications and health products. Despite 
their importance, these SMEs face considerable challenges, particularly in inventory management and logistics, which 
have not been sufficiently addressed in existing research. The sector urgently needs solutions to issues such as 
inadequate storage systems, inefficient inventory management, and the high incidence of product obsolescence, which 
directly impact the efficiency and competitiveness of these companies. This study proposed a Lean Storage Model 
specifically designed for pharmaceutical marketing SMEs in Peru, incorporating Lean Manufacturing tools such as 
5S, standardized work, and Kanban. The model was applied in a case study of a Peruvian SME, leading to measurable 
improvements, including a 47% reduction in picking process time, a 41% decrease in product obsolescence, and a 
10.78% increase in service level, aligning it with industry standards. These results highlight the model's potential to 
enhance operational efficiency, reduce waste, and improve overall competitiveness in the pharmaceutical sector. The 
study's findings contribute to the academic discourse on Lean Manufacturing in SMEs and provide a practical 
framework for similar companies facing comparable challenges. Further research is encouraged to explore additional 
Lean tools and their application in other sectors.

1. Introduction
The importance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that market pharmaceutical products is 
fundamental in the global context, especially in Latin America and Peru. These companies not only significantly 
contribute to the local economy but also play a crucial role in providing medications and health products to the 
population. In Latin America, SMEs represent approximately 99% of all companies and generate around 60% of 
employment, highlighting their importance in the economic and social development of the region (OECD, 2020). In 
Peru, the pharmaceutical sector has shown consistent growth, with an increase in the demand for pharmaceutical 
products that has led SMEs to adapt and evolve to meet market needs (Ministry of Health, 2021). This growth is vital, 
as SMEs not only provide essential products but also foster innovation and competition in the sector, resulting in better 
prices and quality for consumers (Burgos, 2019). However, despite their relevance, SMEs face numerous challenges 
that can affect their ability to operate efficiently and effectively in the market (Cruz & López, 2020).

6. Conclusions 
The key findings of this research demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing a Lean storage model in a small 
pharmaceutical trading company in Peru. The application of tools such as standardized work, the 5S methodology, 
and the Kanban system significantly reduced operational times and improved inventory management efficiency. 
Specifically, a 47% reduction in picking time, a 41% decrease in product obsolescence, and a 10.78% increase in 
service level, meeting industry standards, were observed. These results confirm that integrating Lean Manufacturing 
principles can generate substantial improvements in the competitiveness and sustainability of SMEs in the 
pharmaceutical sector. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to the knowledge and practice of inventory management in 
SMEs, a sector that often lacks specific studies. By addressing critical issues such as inefficiency in storage processes 
and the high rate of product obsolescence, this research provides a framework to optimize operations, improve service 
quality, and increase profitability. Additionally, it reinforces the idea that SMEs, despite their resource limitations, 
can significantly benefit from adopting Lean methodologies, enabling them to compete more effectively in a highly 
regulated and competitive market. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are numerous and significant. Firstly, this study expands the application of Lean 
Manufacturing in a sector that has been historically underexamined. Implementing the Lean model in a pharmaceutical 
SME not only improves operational efficiency but also provides an adaptable framework that can be used by other 
companies in similar contexts. Moreover, the results offer empirical evidence that Lean methodologies can be 
successfully adapted and applied in SMEs, overcoming the specific challenges of such organizations. This study also 
suggests that adopting tools like Kanban and 5S can improve not only internal efficiency but also customer satisfaction 
and market positioning. 
 
Regarding final observations and suggestions for further study, this work highlights the need for continued research 
into the application of Lean tools in SMEs within highly regulated sectors, such as the pharmaceutical industry. It is 
suggested that future studies explore the integration of emerging technologies, such as automation and the Internet of 
Things (IoT), to further enhance the efficiency and accuracy of inventory management and storage processes. 
Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate the long-term impact of Lean model implementation on the 
sustainability and growth of SMEs, as well as their ability to adapt to changes in demand and market regulations. This 
call to action encourages researchers to delve deeper into the application of Lean methodologies in SMEs and explore 
new directions that could contribute to the development of innovative and effective solutions in operations 
management.

Abstract 
The construction sector in Peru significantly contributes to economic development, with SMEs playing a vital role. 
However, these enterprises often face inefficient inventory management, leading to increased costs and material waste. 
This study proposes a Lean-based inventory management model tailored for construction SMEs to address these 
challenges. The model integrates tools such as the 5S methodology, demand forecasting, and optimized inventory 
policies to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. Implementation results demonstrated a 10% reduction in 
average inventory levels and a 40% decrease in defective product rates, indicating substantial operational 
improvements and cost savings. This research contributes to existing literature by providing a practical framework for 
inventory optimization in construction SMEs and underscores the socioeconomic benefits of adopting Lean practices. 
The study advocates for broader application and further exploration of Lean methodologies within the construction 
industry to promote sustainable operational excellence.

1. Introduction
The significance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction sector in Latin America, 
particularly in Peru, cannot be overstated. These enterprises constitute a vital part of the economic fabric of the region, 
contributing significantly to both economic growth and social development. Recent data indicates that SMEs account 
for approximately 90% of businesses in Latin America, generating around 60% of employment and contributing to 
50% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (World Bank, 2020). In Peru, the construction sector serves as one of the 
primary engines of the economy, where SMEs play a crucial role by providing jobs and fostering investment in 
infrastructure (Ministerio de la Producción, 2021). The ability of these enterprises to adapt and respond to market 
demands is essential for sustainable economic growth in the region (OECD, 2021). However, despite their importance, 
SMEs in the construction sector face significant challenges that hinder their potential, highlighting the need for 
effective research and intervention strategies to address these issues. 
One of the most critical challenges faced by SMEs in the construction sector is the inadequate management of 
inventory for construction materials. This situation leads to low inventory turnover, which in turn results in stockouts

Abstract 
Optimization of ambulance scheduling is a crucial factor in improving emergency responses to preserve lives. The 
present study introduces a novel methodology for ambulance scheduling, which incorporates the Internet of Things 
(IoT) to enhance resource utilization and reduce response times in emergency medical services. We have devised a 
dual-level program model consisting of two sub-models. The first sub-model is designed to allocate ambulances to 
different districts based on geographic and traffic data. The second sub-model is responsible for determining the order 
of visit priorities within each district, aiming to minimize the overall time required to respond to a case. Substantial 
enhancements in responsiveness and resource utilization were observed in comparison to traditional approaches. The 
present system, which is enabled by the IoT, exhibits real-time adaptability in crisis management. We present results 
that demonstrate the revolutionary capacity of IoT applications in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and offer 
practical insights for healthcare organization managers.

Abstract 
Material and energy resources of the world are dwindling, coupled with rapid environmental and ecological 
degradation. Renewability and sustainability have become critical issues. Sustainable engineering involves enhancing 
the design of products, systems, and services to achieve superior environmental and social performance while ensuring 
economic feasibility. The challenge lies in transforming this broad concept into a robust educational framework with 
well-defined methods, tools, and metrics for integration into engineering curricula and professional practice. To 
incorporate sustainability into their curricula, some institutions have experimented with problem-based and project-
based learning (PPBL) as a tool. The premise is that use of PPBL promotes cooperative learning, critical thinking, 
systemic reasoning, creativity, and societal awareness, all key aspects of sustainability. However, developing a 
practical curriculum presents challenges, including establishing suitable physical learning environments, revising 
instructional methods and assessment norms, ensuring foundational PPBL knowledge for educators and students, 
securing institutional support, and more. One specific challenge is deciding whether to create a dedicated course on 
sustainable engineering or to integrate modules on environmental engineering, green engineering, pollution 
prevention, waste minimization, and design for the environment within existing courses. The first section of this paper 
introduces key issues in sustainable development and engineering, the intersection of sustainable, renewable, and 
recyclable concepts, education for sustainable development, and pedagogy for sustainability. The second section 
outlines the ongoing efforts to incorporate sustainability content in the Mechanical Engineering program at our 
university, detailing a roadmap for curriculum development and providing examples from courses in the Applied 
Mechanics and Design, and Materials and Manufacturing streams. The final section touches upon significant 
challenges in sustainability education, including the practice of sustainability in academia, policy-making challenges, 
content overload, cultural considerations, and the nuanced distinction between environmental protection and 
sustainability.

1. Introduction
As awareness of dwindling material and energy resources grows, the principles of renewability and sustainability are 
gaining prominence [Dincer 2000]. Sustainable engineering emphasizes designing products, systems, and services to 
enhance environmental and social performance while ensuring economic viability. The challenge lies in transforming 
this broad, abstract concept into a structured educational framework with clear methodologies, tools, and metrics for 
integration into engineering curricula and professional practice (Qamar and Al Kindi 2020). 
Sustainability involves environmental, economic, and social dimensions, aiming to enable long-term coexistence 
between humans and nature while ensuring prosperity for future generations (Gagnon et al 2009). The interplay 
between these dimensions addresses critical challenges such as pollution prevention, economic growth, societal equity,

2.1 Institutional Practices 
The best way to teach sustainability is to practice it. However, many academic institutions operate contrary to its 
principles. New labs and research centers, established with significant time, effort, and cost, often decline in 
effectiveness when key faculty leave. Equipment is procured at great expense, but staff are not adequately trained, and 
maintenance contracts are overlooked. Poor succession planning for faculty and staff further compounds these issues. 
Without embedding sustainability into institutional culture, teaching it effectively becomes a challenge. 
 
2.2 Policy Constraints 
ABET criteria for accrediting engineering programs outline Student Outcomes (SO) as the knowledge, skills, and 
behaviors students should acquire by graduation (ABET 2023). Previously, SO (c) included sustainability explicitly, 
requiring students to design within realistic constraints like economic, environmental, and social factors. In the latest 
revision, SO (2) emphasizes designing solutions considering public health, safety, welfare, and global and economic 
factors but omits sustainability. Addressing all outcomes requires significant adjustments to course objectives, content, 
delivery, and assessment, often facing resistance from stakeholders (Alam et al 2021; Qamar et al 2016). Without 
explicit inclusion in ABET criteria, integrating sustainability into engineering education becomes even more 
challenging. 
 
2.3 Content Overload 
In engineering, the undergraduate degree is typically the professional qualification, leaving the curriculum already 
packed. Adding new courses requires significant restructuring, which is why the Center for Sustainable Engineering, 
a consortium of five U.S. universities, advocates integrating sustainability modules into existing courses rather than 
creating new ones. This approach is also used in revising the Mechanical Engineering program at our university, 
though incorporating substantial new content into existing courses remains a significant challenge. 
 
2.4 Cultural Resistance 
Much of the sustainability literature and many environmental movements often display an anti-technology bias, which 
can deter engineers and faculty from engaging with sustainable engineering (Allenby et al 2009). To address this, 
focused efforts are needed at international, national, and local levels to shape policies and public sentiment that support 
sustainable engineering and its effective education. 
 
2.5 Environmental Protection and Sustainability 
Ambiguity can be caused by treating environmental protection and sustainability as similar issues [Malik and 
Grohmann 2012]. Many engineering programs now include modules or courses on topics like green engineering, 
industrial ecology, pollution prevention, and design for the environment (DFE), all of which align with sustainable 
engineering (SE). However, integrating SE into education involves addressing social and cultural issues, requiring 
shifts in attitudes and professional conduct. While environmental issues are more easily defined and quantified, 
making them suitable for engineering frameworks, social and cultural preferences are harder to navigate. It remains 
unclear who (governments, consumers, stakeholders, or activists) should define these preferences. Unlike 
environmental skills already embedded in engineering education, the competencies needed to address complex social 
and cultural dynamics are less defined and rarely included in curricula.  
 
3. Conclusions  
This paper explores the importance of integrating sustainability into engineering curricula and the methods for doing 
so. It begins with an introduction to sustainable development and its connection to sustainable engineering, clarifying 
the differences between the terms sustainable, renewable, and recyclable. The core discussion focuses on ""education 
for sustainable development"" and ""pedagogy for sustainability education."" Efforts to incorporate sustainability into 
the mechanical engineering program at our university are outlined, including a curriculum roadmap and examples 
from two courses: Product Design and Engineering Materials. The paper concludes by addressing key challenges in 
sustainability education, such as academic practices, policy issues, curriculum overload, cultural barriers, and the 
distinction between environmental protection and sustainability.

Abstract 
The healthcare SME sector in Latin America, particularly in Peru, plays a crucial role in providing primary care 
services. However, these enterprises face significant operational challenges, including inefficiencies in patient care 
processes and reliance on manual records. This research addressed these challenges by proposing a Lean Service-
based model aimed at optimizing operational efficiency and improving the quality of care. The implementation of 
Lean tools such as 5S, standardized work, and Kaizen led to a 39.3% reduction in consultation waiting times and a 
33.3% increase in productivity. These findings highlight the model's effectiveness in enhancing both operational 
efficiency and patient satisfaction. The study's academic and socio-economic impact is profound, offering a replicable 
model for healthcare SMEs to improve service delivery. Further research is encouraged to explore the integration of 
emerging technologies to sustain and amplify these improvements across the healthcare sector.

1. Introduction
The significance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the healthcare sector is undeniable, both 
globally and in specific contexts such as Latin America and Peru. On a global scale, SMEs represent a substantial 
portion of healthcare delivery, providing essential services that are crucial for public health and community well-
being. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), SMEs are fundamental in ensuring access to quality 
healthcare services, particularly in areas where larger hospitals are either unavailable or inaccessible (World Health 
Organization, 2020). In Latin America, this sector faces unique challenges, including the need to adapt to a constantly 
changing environment and the pressure to enhance the quality of care (Burgos et al., 2021). In Peru, healthcare SMEs 
play a critical role in primary care, contributing to universal health coverage and equitable access to health services 
(Ministerio de Salud del Perú, 2019). However, despite their importance, these enterprises often operate under adverse 
conditions, limiting their capacity to provide quality and efficient care. 
The production problems faced by healthcare SMEs are varied and complex. One of the primary challenges is the 
deficiency in patient care times, which often results in prolonged waiting periods (González et al., 2022). This situation 
is exacerbated by non-standardized care processes, leading to disorganization in clinics and appointment management

6. Conclusions 
The study conducted on the implementation of Lean Service tools in healthcare SMEs in Peru has identified and 
addressed several inefficiencies in the operational processes of these organizations. The main findings indicate that 
applying Lean methodologies, such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), the 5S methodology, standardized work, and 
Kaizen, significantly contributed to reducing waiting times, improving productivity, and optimizing patient flow. 
Specifically, there was a 39.3% reduction in waiting time for a consultation, a 97.6% decrease in time spent on 
reviewing medical histories, and a 33.3% increase in productivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed 
model in enhancing operational efficiency and service quality in these institutions. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to understanding and practically applying Lean tools in a sector 
traditionally resistant to significant changes in its operational processes. The study not only demonstrated that it is 
possible to adapt these methodologies, originally designed for manufacturing, to the healthcare services context, but 
it also highlighted the need for a systematic and disciplined approach to achieving sustainable improvements. The 
structured approach based on Lean Service not only enabled greater efficiency in resource management but also 
fostered a culture of continuous improvement among staff, which is essential for the long-term sustainability of the 
implemented improvements. 
 
In terms of contributions to the field of study, this research provides a comprehensive operational model that can be 
replicated and adapted in other healthcare SMEs, both within the Peruvian context and in similar settings in Latin 
America. The successful implementation of Lean tools in this study offers practical guidance for other researchers and 
professionals in the sector looking to improve operational efficiency and service quality in resource-limited 
environments. Additionally, by focusing on key areas such as reducing waiting times and standardizing work, this 
study lays the groundwork for future research exploring the adaptation of other continuous improvement tools in the 
healthcare sector. 
 
Finally, observations and suggestions for future studies are offered. The current research focused on a specific case 
study within the Peruvian context, so one of the key recommendations is to replicate this study in different types of 
healthcare SMEs across various geographic regions to further validate and refine the proposed model. Additionally, it 
would be valuable to investigate the long-term impact of the implemented improvements in terms of financial 
sustainability and patient satisfaction, which would require long-term follow-up. Moreover, exploring the integration 
of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, could offer new perspectives for further 
optimizing processes in healthcare SMEs.

Abstract 
In this study, we explore the impact of a system administrator's risk preference on the process of selecting the optimal 
maintenance policy for systems that experience continuous-time Markovian deterioration and may encounter non-
self-announcing failures. Our focus lies in the comparative evaluation of various maintenance strategies. The decision 
maker periodically inspects the system at designated decision epochs, identifying its current state as good, poor, or 
failed. Based on this assessment, the decision maker chooses an available action, such as doing nothing, repairing, or 
replacing the system. When the system fails, the failure may go undetected until the next inspection epoch. The 
primary objective is minimizing the expected long-run cost rate, encompassing various cost components, including 
inspection, downtime, and maintenance expenses. Through simulation examples, we analyze the effect of various cost 
parameters on the optimum inspection period and policy using the mean-variance approach, demonstrating a practical 
application in the process. By examining the system administrator's risk preference, we aim to shed light on its 
influence on optimal policy selection, thereby providing valuable insights for effective maintenance decision-making 
in scenarios involving continuous-time Markovian deterioration and non-self-announcing failures.

1. Introduction
Failures are natural events and are expected in any production system or machinery. There are several reasons for 
system failures and the most common are from configuration errors, human errors, security breaches, environmental 
factors, compatibility issues and physical degradation. Maintenance activities play a pivotal role in ensuring the 
continued availability, reliability, and optimal performance of production or structural systems that are susceptible to 
gradual deterioration due to aging and extensive usage. These systems are inherently prone to wear and tear over time,

time, the optimal policy shifts to Policy Π4 in most cases. Since this is a simulation study, results are not theoretically 
valid, and the inferences should be taken with extra care; however, one conclusion that we can draw from Figure 2(a) 
is that the expected duration of major repair is more critical to determination of the optimal decision between major 
repair and replacement actions in State 3 than the risk-return trade-off parameter. 
 
Figure 2(b) depicts the final two-way sensitivity analysis, where we simulated the impact of ratio 𝜆𝜆12/𝜆𝜆13 against the 
unit downtime cost 𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑, where 𝜆𝜆12 represents the rate of system transition from State 1 to State 2, and 𝜆𝜆13 from State 1 
to State 3. Like in the majority of our previous analyses, trade-off is only between Policies Π3 and Π4 with Π3 appearing 
dominant in most cases except when 𝜆𝜆12is small compared to 𝜆𝜆13. A small ratio between 𝜆𝜆12 and 𝜆𝜆13 implies a much 
likely system behavior to fail when in State 1; therefore, a switch from Π3 to Π4 can only be explained by the system 
administrator's heightened sensitivity to downtime. As downtime costs increase, we also observe that the system 
administrator adopts Policy Π4 more frequently.  
 
5. Conclusion  
This paper employs simulation techniques to examine five distinct maintenance policies for a three-state system 
exhibiting non-self-announcing failures. We model the expected downtime and incorporated it into each maintenance 
strategy for such a system, where transitions among states are governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. Utilizing 
renewal theory, we estimate the best inspection interval with the aim of minimizing the long-term average disutility 
of system operations’ cost. We analyze the implications of our model and assess the sensitivity of our results to 
variations in model parameters, including the risk preference of the system administrator. The main conclusions 
derived from this sensitivity analysis are as follows: 
1) The optimal maintenance policy and inspection frequency are determined by the trade-off between 
minimizing downtime and maintenance/replacement costs. Shorter inspection intervals are favored when 
downtime costs are high to mitigate the impact of downtime despite increased inspection frequency. 
However, discerning clear trends in inspection frequency across varying replacement costs is challenging 
due to inherent simulation uncertainties. 
2) The best maintenance policy choice is influenced by the interplay between the system manager's risk 
preference and the unit cost of downtime. More risk-averse managers favor policies that minimize downtime 
duration despite higher maintenance costs while risk-seeking managers opt for cheaper but longer repair 
options when downtime costs are low. As downtime costs escalate, policies prioritizing swifter interventions 
gain precedence across varying risk attitudes. 
3) The meantime between major maintenance activities exhibits a transition point where policies favoring 
economical major repairs give way to swifter replacement actions as that time increases to mitigate escalating 
downtime costs. A region of uncertainty exists around this transition point, where optimal policies oscillate 
depending on risk preferences. A more precise theory-based analysis is needed to clarify this uncertainty. 
4) When the transition from the initial state to the intermediate degraded state is infrequent, catastrophic failures 
become more prevalent, necessitating a policy that prioritizes swift replacements to minimize downtime 
impact. Conversely, policies favoring economical major repairs dominate when this transition is more 
frequent. As downtime costs escalate, policies emphasizing faster interventions gain precedence, particularly 
when the transition to the degraded state also increases in frequency. 
5) While exhibiting similar trends, a notable decrease arises in the inspection intervals compared to prior work 
by Keleş et al. (2017), potentially attributable to the contrasting risk attitudes of the system administrators 
considered. Specifically, the present case's heightened risk aversion and downtime sensitivity likely 
contribute to the observed variation. However, the compounded impact of combining these risk factors 
remains unclear, presenting an avenue for further investigative efforts. 
 
The proposed model can be extended to encompass systems with additional states and maintenance policies, thereby 
enhancing its applicability to a broader range of scenarios. Furthermore, incorporating supplementary variables can 
facilitate the representation of more realistic operational environments, better capturing the intricacies and 
complexities inherent in real-world systems. However, it is advisable to implement automated data analysis techniques 
and optimization algorithms to mitigate the computational burden associated with such expansions and streamline the 
overall simulation process. These computational tools can efficiently identify and optimize the relevant simulation 
parameters, thereby reducing the overall simulation time and expediting the data analysis phase. Consequently, 
integrating automated methodologies can significantly enhance the model's versatility, accuracy, and computational 
efficiency, ultimately contributing to more robust and insightful analyses.

Abstract 
Retraction is a necessary method for correcting scientific texts and informing audiences about significant errors in 
scientific publications. In this context, the aim of the current study is to examine the characteristics of retracted 
publications in the robotics field indexed in the Web of Science. Using a quantitative approach and scientometric 
methods, some publication features were discussed such as publication trends of retracted documents based on the 
year, and common document types, funding agencies, and the most productive publishers and journals. Additionally, 
the significance of the relationship between the number of retracted documents and the bibliometric indices of each 
journal was measured using the Pearson test. According to the results obtained from 359 retracted publications in 
robotics, it is clear that in 2022, the highest number of retractions are seen. Moreover, a high percentage of documents 
funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China have been retracted. Top publishers, such as Hindawi 
Publishing Group, IEEE, and Sage, along with Applied Bionics and Biomechanics journal have the highest number 
of retracted documents in robotics. Additionally, the results indicate that the number of retracted documents in a 
journal has not significant relationship with journals bibliometric indicators. Most of these documents are published 
as journal articles. Therefore, based on the findings of this research, it is necessary for science policymakers to 
continue investigating other aspects of retracted documents in the field of robotics while preventing the publication of 
false or misleading data to avoid similar cases in the future.

1. Introduction
Any research is considered scientific if it systematically follows a specific and precise methodology and is sure of the 
validity and reliability of all the different stages of the research. In some cases of scientific publication, actions or 
interventions that hinder or weaken one or more of these vital and systematic stages of scientific methodology are 
considered research misconduct (Kosygin et al. 2023). This is despite the fact that the scientific community is 
responsible for self- examination and correcting itself in scientific texts to avoid ‘false science’ (2017). Therefore, 
science is self-correcting, as the literature in various fields can correct itself through rigorous examination of 
incomplete research. One of the most important mechanisms of self-correction is the retraction of incomplete or 
flawed scientific publications (Steen et al. 2016). Researchers agree that retractions serve as a warning to readers about 
publication errors, whether intentional or unintentional (Vuong et al. 2020; & Shepperd & Yousefi 2023). This can 
happen for a number of reasons, but generally it indicates that the research is not considered a reliable reference for 
citation in the scientific literature (Shepperd & Yousefi 2023). Consequently, the number and frequency of retracted 
publications can be seen as a significant indicator of the overall quality of a scientific field (Steen et al. 2016).

A scientific map of retracted documents was visualized based on the collected data, using an overlay type to illustrate 
the co-occurrence of keywords in retracted WoS publications during the specified time period. In the map generated 
by the graph theory, each node represents a keyword, and the lines between them indicate the relationship between 
these keywords. The size of the nodes, which is also referred to as the node weight, is calculated based on the frequency 
of occurrence of the keywords in publications. The more frequent the keyword, the greater its weight and size. Figure 
2 shows the map resulting from the overlay visualization of the field of retracted publications in the robotics field.

As illustrated in Figure 2, 13 keywords emerge within the network of retracted publications in the robotics field 
indexed in WoS, which demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of research in robotics. Conversely, the network as 
a whole does not exhibit an isolated state, and discrete issues have not emerged. Rather, issues are somewhat related 
and demonstrate density and centrality . 
 
6. Conclusion  
The study of retracted documents is of particular importance in science and research. In this regard, the present 
research is part of the research conducted by researchers at various levels regarding the influence and spillover of false 
science in the direction of scientific progress. In particular, studying and identifying the characteristics of these cases 
in the field of robotics can lead to ensuring the quality and credibility of scientific research and results in information 
technology and intelligence studies by maintaining public confidence, preventing the publication of false information, 
and strengthening research ethics.

In any case, it would be prudent for the robotics scientific community and those responsible for formulating policy in 
this field to consider the potential implications of this upward trend of retracted documents over the long term and to 
prioritize the implementation of effective countermeasures to reduce the number of such documents. It is therefore 
important to improve plagiarism software, strengthen the skills of publishers, editors, authors, and peer reviewers 
involved in robotics, with the aim of publishing original content and of recognizing examples of retraction and 
compliance with the guidelines of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). A complete evaluation of the 
publications before publication, the creation of a completely blind peer review procedure, and the prioritization of 
scientific research, as essential components of scientific communication, are significant results. Further research could 
examine the interval between publication and retraction, the relationship between this interval and the number of 
citations, and investigate the reasons for documents with high citations. 
 
It is also important for science policy to pay attention to the role of funding agencies in shaping scientific research and 
maintaining its integrity in their selection. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to them when allocating funds to 
high-priority research areas, supporting researchers, and influencing scientific research in robotics. 
 
Also, publishers in robotics need to strengthen their views in content evaluation to publish valid documents. On the 
other hand, to address this issue, organizations such as the Committee on Ethics in Publishing, the World Association 
of Medical Editors (WAME), and the STM Integrity Hub can directly monitor the activities of these publishers to 
reduce the amount of retraction (Behera et al. 2024). 
 
On the other hand, the identification of other active actors such as authors, countries, institutions in the publication of 
robotics retracted publications indexed in the databases such as WoS, IEEE, Scopus, etc. and the visualization of 
scientific collaboration between them is another dimension of the retracted publications characteristics in robotics that 
was not paid in this research due to limitations, and it deserves more consideration in future researches. Furthermore, 
it is suggested that a special policy regarding the occurrence of research misconduct in journals should be considered 
by editors, considering that nearly 90% of retractions in robotics are in type of articles. The reasons for retractions in 
robotics to inform the researchers involved and to prevent the repetition of such misconduct is another research 
suggestion. Because it seems that knowing the reasons for retractions of publications can prevent researchers from 
engaging in cases that cause retractions. 
 
In short, based on the findings of this study, it is better for journal editors, publishers, and scientific institutions active 
in robotics to take the initiative because the instances introduced in this research should be reviewed and emphasized 
because they are some of the most important obstacles to scientific progress. Also, it is better for robotic scientific 
policy makers to help in the analysis and pathology of this phenomenon.

Abstract 
The construction sector, particularly SMEs in Latin America, faces critical challenges in material planning and supply 
chain management, leading to inefficiencies. This study proposes a Lean Manufacturing-based procurement model 
tailored to these SMEs, integrating Kanban, Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), and 5S methodologies to optimize 
material flow and space utilization. The model resulted in a 58% reduction in inventory levels, a 22% decrease in 
material handling time, and a 20% reduction in operational costs, yielding an annual saving of $265,055. The research 
significantly contributes to the academic understanding of Lean applications in SMEs, offering a practical framework 
for enhancing efficiency and competitiveness in the construction industry. The study underscores the necessity of 
adopting Lean principles to improve operational performance. Future research should explore the model's applicability 
across various sectors to further validate its impact and extend its benefits.

1. Introduction
The construction sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plays a pivotal role in the global 
economy, contributing significantly to job creation and economic development. In Latin America, SMEs in 
construction are responsible for a substantial portion of employment, with estimates suggesting that they account for 
approximately 70% of jobs in the industry (González-Díaz & Becerra-Pérez, 2021). This trend is particularly 
pronounced in Peru, where SMEs represent around 90% of all construction firms, underscoring their critical 
importance in driving economic growth and social development (Cardona & López, 2015). The construction sector is 
not only a vital component of the economy but also a key player in addressing infrastructure deficits and improving 
living standards across the region (Estrada et al., 2020). However, despite their significance, these enterprises often 
face numerous challenges that hinder their operational efficiency and competitiveness. 
One of the most pressing issues confronting SMEs in the construction sector is the inefficiency in material planning 
and supply chain management. Poor procurement practices, inadequate inventory control, and ineffective supplier 
management lead to material wastage and project delays, ultimately affecting profitability (Peralta-Jiménez & Tonon-
Ordóñez, 2022). Research indicates that a significant percentage of construction materials are lost due to

translated not only into direct cost savings but also enhanced productivity, allowing the company to allocate resources 
more effectively and improve its overall competitiveness in the construction sector. 
 
The comprehensive Lean transformation implemented by the construction company through the integration of 
Kanban, Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), and 5S has demonstrated the profound impact that well-executed Lean 
tools can have on operational efficiency and economic performance. The success of this case study highlights the 
importance of a holistic approach to Lean implementation, where tools are not just applied in isolation but are 
integrated to address various facets of operational inefficiency. The result is a significant improvement in efficiency, 
cost savings, and overall operational excellence, providing a strong foundation for the company’s future growth and 
competitiveness in the construction industry.

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the research indicate that the implementation of the Lean Manufacturing-based procurement 
management model, incorporating Kanban, Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), and 5S tools, resulted in significant 
improvements in the operational efficiency of construction SMEs. Efficiency increased from 78% to 92%, downtime 
was reduced by 58.88%, and cycle time decreased by 23.32%, leading to a positive economic impact, with an annual 
cost saving of 58.87% in operational expenses. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed model in 
addressing critical inefficiencies in inventory management and material handling, common challenges in the 
construction sector. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs in the construction 
sector, particularly in contexts such as Latin America, where these companies face significant supply chain 
management challenges. The study not only addresses a critical gap in the existing literature, which often focuses on 
large enterprises, but also provides a practical and applicable approach to improving operational efficiency in resource-
limited companies. By demonstrating how the implementation of Lean tools can lead to substantial improvements, 
this research offers a valuable framework for future interventions in the sector. 
 
The contributions of this study to the field of industrial engineering are manifold. Firstly, it provides empirical 
evidence on the effectiveness of Lean tools in a specific context, expanding knowledge on their applicability in 
construction SMEs. Secondly, the study highlights the importance of an integrated approach, where multiple Lean 
tools are implemented complementarily to address different aspects of supply chain management. This holistic 
approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens the sustainability of the implemented processes. 
Additionally, the study offers guidance for the implementation of these tools in resource-limited environments, which 
is highly relevant for other SMEs in similar sectors. 
 
Finally, the research suggests several observations and recommendations for future studies. While the results obtained 
are promising, further research is recommended to explore the applicability of this model in other industrial sectors 
and different geographical regions. It is also suggested to investigate the long-term impact of implementing these Lean

tools to assess the sustainability of the observed benefits. Additionally, it would be valuable to explore how digitization 
and the use of advanced technologies can complement and further enhance the results obtained through the 
implementation of Lean Manufacturing in procurement and supply chain management. These future research 
directions could not only strengthen the findings of this study but also expand its applicability and relevance in an 
ever-evolving industrial environment.

Abstract 
The fast-food industry, particularly in Latin America and Peru, has grown rapidly due to urbanization and rising 
middle-class demand. However, this sector faces critical supply chain challenges, including inefficiencies in demand 
forecasting, supplier selection, and process standardization. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a 
comprehensive supply management model integrating Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP), the Kraljic Matrix, and 
advanced demand forecasting techniques. The model was tested in a case study of a fast-food franchise in Lima, 
resulting in a 13.95% improvement in the Fill Rate, a 15.85% increase in OTIF, and a 25.49% reduction in cycle time. 
These outcomes highlight the model's potential to significantly enhance operational efficiency and customer 
satisfaction. This study provides valuable insights for both academia and industry, promoting further exploration of 
integrated supply chain management practices in fast-food operations.

1. Introduction
The fast-food restaurant industry has gained significant relevance in the global context, particularly in Latin America 
and Peru. This sector not only represents an important part of the economy but has also become a cultural phenomenon 
that reflects changes in eating habits and social dynamics. According to a study, the fast-food market in Latin America 
has grown at an accelerated pace, driven by urbanization and the rise of the middle class, which seeks more accessible 
and quick food options (González & López, 2020). In Peru, the growth of this sector has been remarkable, with an 
increase in the opening of international franchises and the emergence of local chains offering a variety of gastronomic 
options (Martínez & Torres, 2021). This boom not only generates employment but also fosters innovation in service 
and customer experience, making fast-food restaurants a fundamental pillar of the local economy (Rojas, 2019). 
However, despite its growth, the sector faces significant challenges, particularly regarding the supply chain 
management of supplies. Inefficiencies in the supply chain can result in a low service level, affecting customer 
satisfaction and business profitability. A study indicates that many fast-food restaurants suffer from poor demand 
forecasting, leading to a lack of available products during critical moments (Fernández & Pérez, 2022). Furthermore,

6. Conclusions 
The research conducted in this study provided significant insights into the implementation of a supply management 
model tailored to the fast-food industry. The primary findings indicated a marked improvement in key performance 
metrics following the integration of advanced methodologies such as Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP), demand 
forecasting, and the Kraljic Matrix. Specifically, the Fill Rate increased by 13.95%, the On Time in Full (OTIF) rate 
improved by 15.85%, and the cycle time was reduced by 25.49%. These improvements underscore the effectiveness 
of the proposed model in addressing the inefficiencies prevalent in the supply chain management of fast-food 
restaurants. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to the operational efficiency and strategic management of 
supply chains within the fast-food sector. Given the highly competitive nature of the industry, where customer 
satisfaction is closely tied to service levels and product availability, the study offers a valuable framework for fast-
food companies aiming to enhance their supply chain performance. The application of S&OP methodologies, 
combined with demand forecasting and strategic supplier management, provides a robust approach to synchronizing 
supply chain activities with market demand, thereby minimizing disruptions and optimizing resource allocation. 
 
The contributions of this research extend beyond the immediate context of fast-food operations. By integrating 
established tools like the Kraljic Matrix with advanced forecasting techniques, the study bridges a critical gap in the 
existing literature on supply chain management for fast-food companies. It offers a replicable model that can be 
adapted by other sectors facing similar challenges in managing supply chain complexities. Additionally, the research 
highlights the role of process standardization in reducing variability and ensuring consistent service quality, a principle 
that is widely applicable across various industries. 
 
In conclusion, this study has laid a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in the field of supply 
chain management. The successful implementation of the proposed model in the case study demonstrates its potential 
for broader application in the fast-food industry and beyond. However, further research is recommended to explore 
the long-term impacts of these methodologies on operational sustainability and profitability. Additionally, future 
studies could investigate the integration of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
into the S&OP framework to further enhance the accuracy of demand forecasts and the efficiency of supply chain 
operations. This continued exploration will be crucial for maintaining competitiveness and achieving operational 
excellence in a rapidly evolving market environment.

Abstract 
The Peruvian textile sector, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), faces significant 
challenges, including overproduction and inefficient inventory management. These issues are compounded by 
inadequate demand forecasting and delayed deliveries, which hinder the competitiveness of these enterprises in a 
globalized market. To address these urgent challenges, this research proposes a Lean-based operations management 
model tailored specifically for textile SMEs. The model integrates Just-In-Time (JIT), Kanban, leveled production, 
and RFID technology to optimize inventory control and align production with market demand. Key findings from the 
implementation reveal a substantial reduction in overproduction by 89.66% and a decrease in wrong deliveries by 
75%, indicating the model's effectiveness in enhancing operational efficiency. The study's impact extends beyond 
operational improvements, contributing to the broader literature on Lean Manufacturing in SMEs and offering 
practical solutions for the sustainable development of the textile industry in Peru. This research underscores the need 
for continuous innovation in operational strategies and encourages further exploration of Lean tools to address the 
evolving challenges in textile manufacturing.

1. Introduction
The textile industry, particularly the sector of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plays a pivotal role in the 
global economy, especially in developing regions such as Latin America and Peru. These enterprises not only 
contribute significantly to the textile production but also generate employment opportunities and foster innovation 
within the sector. According to a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO), SMEs account for 
approximately 70% of total employment in developing countries, highlighting their importance in economic 
development (ILO, 2019). In Peru, the textile sector is one of the oldest industries, deeply rooted in the cultural and 
economic fabric of the nation. Despite its historical significance, the textile SMEs in Peru face numerous challenges 
that hinder their ability to compete effectively in an increasingly globalized market (World Bank, 2020). The 
importance of this sector extends beyond economic contributions; it also encompasses the ability to adapt to changing 
market demands, which is vital for the sustainability and growth of these enterprises. 
However, the production processes of textile SMEs are fraught with challenges that impede their operational efficiency 
and overall competitiveness. One of the most pressing issues is the phenomenon of overproduction, which often stems 
from inadequate demand forecasting. This misalignment between production and market demand can lead to increased 
operational costs and the accumulation of unsold inventory, adversely affecting the financial viability of these 
enterprises. Furthermore, delays in product delivery represent another critical challenge, primarily due to poor 
organization and classification of finished products. Inefficient inventory management and logistics can result in 
significant delays, which not only diminish customer satisfaction but also tarnish the reputation of the business. The

5. Results 
In Table 1, the key results from the validation of the proposed Lean operations management model are presented. The 
overproduction percentage was significantly reduced from 29% to 3%, representing an improvement of 89.66%. 
Additionally, the wrong delivery percentage decreased from 24% to 6%, achieving a reduction of 75%. These results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in addressing the inefficiencies identified in the operational process.

6. Conclusions 
The study demonstrated that the implementation of the Lean Manufacturing model in textile SMEs led to substantial 
improvements in operational performance. Specifically, overproduction was reduced by 89.66%, significantly 
lowering the costs associated with excess inventory. Additionally, the model improved the accuracy of demand 
forecasting, which resulted in a 75% reduction in the percentage of wrong deliveries, enhancing both inventory 
management and customer satisfaction. These results underscore the model's effectiveness in aligning production with 
actual market demand, thereby minimizing waste and increasing the overall efficiency of the operations. This research 
is crucial as it provides a robust framework for addressing the challenges faced by textile SMEs, particularly in 
inventory management and production efficiency. The significant reduction in overproduction and wrong deliveries 
illustrates how Lean tools, such as Kanban, Just-In-Time (JIT), and RFID technology, can transform traditional 
production processes into more agile and responsive systems. This transformation is essential for textile SMEs 
operating in highly competitive markets, where the ability to adapt quickly to market fluctuations is critical for 
maintaining profitability and ensuring long-term sustainability. 
 
The contributions of this research to the field of industrial engineering are noteworthy, particularly in applying Lean 
Manufacturing principles to SMEs within the textile sector. The study provided empirical evidence that Lean tools, 
when implemented effectively, can lead to significant enhancements in operational performance even within resource-
constrained environments. Furthermore, the research highlighted the importance of continuous improvement and 
employee engagement in sustaining the gains achieved through Lean implementation. This underscores the need for 
ongoing training and involvement of all personnel in the Lean transformation process, which is vital for the long-term 
success of such initiatives. 
 
In conclusion, while the Lean Manufacturing model demonstrated significant efficacy in the case study, further 
research is necessary to validate its applicability in other sectors and regions. Future studies should explore the 
adaptation of the model to different operational contexts and cultures, as well as examine the long-term impact of 
Lean implementation on business performance. Additionally, there is a compelling need to investigate the integration 
of advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), into the Lean framework. 
These technologies could further enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness, offering new avenues for 
innovation and improvement in the textile industry and beyond.

Abstract 
Ever since Kantorovich and Dantzig’s pioneering work in linear programming, solution methods for linear 
programs have evolved considerably. However, formulation of linear programs has remained largely manual, relying 
heavily on analysts’ expertise. This study aims to explore the possibility of automating problem formulation process 
using Large Language Models (LLMs). To test LLMs usefulness for linear programming problem formulation, we 
craft linear programming problem narratives such that we systematically vary problem sizes, problem complexity 
and linguistic complexity of the narratives. We perform these analyses for various types of optimization problems, 
including production planning problems, advertising problems, network flow problems, scheduling problems, 
blending problems and multi period investment problems. In doing so, we test LLMs ability to handle lower and 
upper bound constraints, flow balancing constraints, if-then logic constraints, blending (proportional) constraints, 
assignment constraints, and time dependency constraints. By varying linguistic complexity and problem sizes 
(number of decision variables and constraints) for the above-mentioned problems, we test each problem narrative 
across four LLMs: GPT- 3.5, GPT-4.0, Gemini, and Gemini Advanced. Our results indicate LLMs are more likely 
to formulate production planning problems correctly, whereas they often fail to formulate scheduling and 
transportation problems. Our results also indicate that LLMs are more likely to produce a correct formulation when 
narrative’s linguistic complexity is low. For problem types where LLMs fail to provide correct formulations, we 
observed errors such as incorrect coefficient assignment, switched coefficient assignment, missing objective 
functions, missing constraints, and others.

Abstract 
Image denoising is a critical task in the field of computer vision. This paper introduces the UDiNet architecture, a 
dilated variant of the U-Net, specifically designed to address image denoising challenges. We present a novel 
dataset comprising book sheet images to rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed method. 
Experimental results demonstrate that UDiNet significantly enhances the performance of established Optical 
Character Recognition (OCR) systems, such as Tesseract and Genome. The model effectively mitigates severe noise 
while preserving essential structural details of English characters. This capability positions UDiNet as a valuable 
preprocessing technique for various applications, including classification, detection, and OCR tasks. To promote 
further research in this domain, we have made the code and trained models publicly accessible.

1. Introduction
Image noise reduction is yet an open problem in computer vision that focuses on emboldening the quality and detail 
of images, to make them more suitable for subsequent tasks such as classification, detection, segmentation, 
generation, etc. However, challenges in image denoising include accurately modeling complex noises relative to the 
environment, preserving important image details while reducing noise, and developing methods that can effectively 
eliminate or suppress diverse noise groups (Ilesanmi and Ilesanmi 2021). 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specific type of deep learning model that aims to process and extract 
features of matrices (Taye 2023). The convolutional layers typically combine with pooling layers, normalizer 
layers, dropout layers, fully connected layers, etc. Convolutional layers apply a set of learnable filters to the input 
image, where each filter extracts a specific feature like edges, shapes, or textures. By sliding the filters across the 
image and computing dot products, convolutional layers produce feature maps that capture the responses of the filters 
at different spatial locations. This allows CNNs to efficiently learn features independent of their position on the 
image grid (Dhillon and Verma 2020). 
Dilated convolutions are a variation of regular convolutional operations that create spaces or holes within the filter. 
This design allows the filter to encompass a larger receptive field, thereby facilitating the capture of multi-scale 
contextual information without increasing the number of parameters (Wang et al. 2019). In a dilated convolution, 
the filter is applied over an area larger than its spatial dimensions by selectively skipping input values, with the 
spacing defined by the dilation rate. By stacking dilated convolutions with varying dilation rates, the network can 
effectively aggregate features from multiple scales, which is particularly advantageous for dense prediction tasks 
such as image denoising.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study addresses the ongoing challenges in image noise reduction, a critical problem in computer 
vision that impacts various downstream tasks. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
and incorporating advanced techniques such as dilated convolutions, we have developed a novel approach to tackle 
the complexities of image denoising. The use of dilated convolutions allows our model to capture multi-scale 
contextual information efficiently, enhancing its ability to handle complex noise patterns without significantly 
increasing computational overhead. This research not only contributes to the field of image denoising for OCR but 
also has potential implications for improving the performance of subsequent computer vision tasks.

deliver long-term value. 
 
3.4 Validation  
Stakeholder feedback was gathered through a structured process involving both surveys and interviews with key 
project stakeholders, including project managers, contractors, and senior management within PDO. This feedback was 
crucial for validating the proposed engineering management strategies. To ensure robustness, statistical hypothesis 
tests were employed alongside qualitative insights to confirm the effectiveness of the strategies. 
 
Quantitative data from the surveys provided strong evidence of the strategies' impact. For instance, stakeholders 
reported significantly higher satisfaction ratings with communication practices and resource allocation after the 
implementation of the proposed strategies. A paired t-test was conducted to compare satisfaction levels before and 
after the implementation, revealing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05). This statistical validation 
confirmed that the observed improvements were not due to random chance but were a direct result of the proposed 
strategies. 
 
Additionally, qualitative insights from interviews reinforced the survey findings. Stakeholders consistently reported 
specific improvements in project efficiency and collaboration, attributing these gains to the adoption of the new 
management strategies. These qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis, which highlighted 
recurring themes of enhanced communication, better resource management, and increased project success rates. 
The combination of statistical tests and qualitative analysis provided a comprehensive validation of the proposed 
strategies, ensuring that the recommendations were not only theoretically sound but also practically effective and 
aligned with the needs and expectations of PDO’s stakeholders. This rigorous validation process underscores the 
reliability of the findings and the applicability of the strategies in real-world scenarios. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This research has successfully met all objectives, providing a comprehensive analysis of the critical factors influencing 
project success within Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) construction projects. The study identified a strong linear 
relationship between project constraints (cost, scope, and time) and performance factors (quality, client satisfaction, 
and benefit realization), highlighting the essential role of effective constraint management in achieving high project 
performance. This relationship underscores the need for robust engineering management strategies that include 
thorough planning, optimal resource allocation, and continuous project monitoring to navigate the complexities of 
construction projects and ensure successful outcomes.  
 
A unique contribution of this research is its focus on enhancing resource competency through targeted training and 
development, which equips project teams to manage challenges more effectively. Additionally, the study emphasizes 
the importance of tailored contract management practices that align with project objectives and stakeholder 
expectations, thereby mitigating risks and fostering a unified approach toward project goals. The research also 
advocates for continuous learning from industry best practices and innovation in project management approaches. 
The implications for PDO are profound: adopting the recommended strategies will not only improve adherence to 
project constraints but also enhance overall project performance and stakeholder satisfaction. This study also paves 
the way for future research in advancing project management methodologies, particularly through the integration of 
hybrid approaches that combine Agile flexibility with Waterfall structure, ensuring sustained organizational growth 
and successful project outcomes.

Abstract 
The objective of the work reported in this article is to assess the maintenance strategy of a refractory industry and 
recommend superior strategy that can possibly enhance the efficiency. In the beginning, a qualitative approach is used 
to gather first-hand information through observation and discussion. Additionally, a quantitative approach is employed 
to collect information on machine breakdown frequency and downtime. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) has 
been used to prioritize breakdown causes and plan interventions to minimize the likelihood of the breakdown and 
reduce their effect. An attempt has been made to highlight the importance of switching from corrective maintenance 
to preventive maintenance, The company can minimize the occurrence of machine breakdown, reduce the downtime, 
and enhance the overall equipment efficiency by treating the root causes and prioritizing routine inspection and 
preventative maintenance. The Pareto analysis shows that coolant failure is approximately 80% of the 80/20 rule, 
meaning that it is the most significant reason for the machine breakdown. A 53% original equipment effectiveness 
(OEE) shows that the machine is operating with low quality, availability, and performance. From the analyzed data it 
recommended that the company implement the preventive maintenance strategy so that it can optimize its maintenance 
procedures, reduce machine breakdown, and to ensure long term success in its operation.

• Throughout its lifecycle, the system collects data, analyses maintenance outcomes, and refines its predictive 
models and maintenance strategies. 
 
Integrating Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) with IoT design is a game-changing strategy to improving 
preventative maintenance operations. This integrated system provides a comprehensive and proactive solution for 
addressing equipment reliability and minimizing downtime by seamlessly combining data collection through IoT 
sensors, real-time data analysis, early warning systems, failure mode prediction, root cause analysis, and intelligent 
maintenance action scheduling. Furthermore, because the continuous improvement loop ensures that maintenance 
plans evolve and adapt over time, this technique is a valuable tool for enhancing operational efficiency and equipment 
reliability in a variety of industrial contexts. Finally, the RCM- IoT integration not only detects and mitigates possible 
failures, but it also drives continuous improvement, resulting in more dependable and cost-effective maintenance 
operations. 
 
Solution 3: Implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)  
a) Autonomous maintenance: The operators of machine tools should be trained to perform daily inspections and 
basic maintenance tasks, such as checking coolant levels and checking for leaks in coolant. Operators should 
be empowered to report any abnormalities or issues as soon as possible. 
b) Planned maintenance: Make sure maintenance tools and spare parts are readily available. 
c) Quality maintenance: The coolant system should be audited and quality checks are conducted on a regular 
basis to verify the effectiveness of coolant system maintenance and if leaks are present. Ensure that the 
coolant is clean and in good condition, so contamination is prevented. 
d) Training and skill development: Training of the maintenance teams on coolant system maintenance 
procedures, including the proper techniques for detecting and addressing leaks in the coolant system, as well 
as providing training to all personnel involved with the system on the TPM principles. 
e) Continuous improvement: Maintain a culture of continuous improvement where employees are encouraged 
to identify and address issues in a proactive manner. Use regular meetings to review maintenance procedures 
and make refinements as needed based on feedback and data analysis to improve the procedures. 
f) 
Through the implementation of TPM principles and procedures, the organization can transition from reactive, 
corrective maintenance to a proactive one, reducing the risk of machine breakdowns and improving overall 
equipment reliability and efficiency. 
 
5. Conclusions 
This article has presented a case study where the maintenance strategy employed by a refractory company has been 
assessed. Through implementing industrial engineering tools like cause-and-effect diagram, 5 Whys, Pareto analysis, 
and FMEA, we have identified several causes of machine breakdown. It has been found that unskilled operators and 
improper maintenance strategies have resulted in frequent machine breakdown as well as reduced OEE down to 53%. 
The Pareto analysis showed that coolant failure is the biggest contributor to machine breakdown, emphasizing a shift 
from corrective to preventive maintenance. To address these issues, some solutions have been proposed. From the 
proposed solutions, it is evident that adopting to preventive and data-driven maintenance strategy is important for the 
company to enhance equipment reliability, reduce breakdown, and downtime, and ultimately improve the overall 
operational efficiency. Through implementing the solutions, the company can optimize its maintenance procedures, 
minimize the occurrence of a machine breakdown, and ensure long-term success in its operation.

Abstract 
Stewardship is defined as the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care. It is about 
doing the right thing even when no one is watching. Stewardship encompasses many day-to-day activities; it is not 
just about financial reporting only. Every employee act as a steward as they manage the day-to-day affairs. In daily 
work, employees are faced with tough decisions, to follow complex or considered irrational policies and procedures. 
Employees are caught between a rock and a hard place to choose whether to get the job done the right way or take the 
short cut. Sadly, where safety and quality are involved, any miss or error could result in huge financial loss, sometimes 
even life. This paper studies the stewardship approach, in the case of a manufacturing industry, when executing tasks 
that affect safety and quality systems, to eliminate safety risks and eradicate quality related losses. It also seeks to 
demonstrate that stewardship is the cornerstone for business success. A case study and observation exercise were 
completed using task analysis technique. The results of the tasks studied are shared. The findings presented that 
violation of stewardship principles has severe consequences to safety and quality systems. The study concluded by 
implementing the stewardship plan to maintain high stewardship controls in safety and quality management systems.

1. Introduction
Stewardship when integrated into every business activity, delivers sustainable results, protects both the employee and 
the business. The employee has a set of guidelines to follow, helping them from violating company procedures, whilst 
the business is protected from losses. The golden rules for stewardship are as follows- the proper 'tone from the top' 
is essential in creating an effective control environment; good controls are both effective and efficient; understand that 
controls break down over time due to change in the components of the system and complacency. Under stewardship, 
the actions taken by management to ensure that operations are effective and efficient; there are proper controls in place 
to provide guidelines for attaining business goals and targets; reliable and accurate data is recorded and reported with 
internal and external stakeholders; the business is compliant with all the necessary and applicable laws and regulations. 
Doing the right thing when executing tasks that affect safety and quality is very crucial. Both areas require a high level 
of attention to details, care, accuracy, and integrity. Stewardship discipline improves operational efficiency and 
protects business from various risks. The concept of Stewardship lies in the fact that it excels to achieve both personal

5. Conclusions 
Over the past couple of years, we have seen increased allegations of misrepresentation of data, failure to follow own 
procedures and poor stewardship examples making headlines. In some cases, product was recalled from the market 
causing business crisis. In this study, strengthening stewardship through the stewardship plan, prevented further 
potential business losses. The loss of $4,575,000 over four years is averaged annually at $1,143,750. Year 2023 at 
only two events at a cost of $15,000 is significantly the lowest at <1% compared to the previous years’ average.  
 
The stewardship plan contributed hugely towards this cultural change. The company stock grew by >10 points. 
Investors gained confidence and the business gained credibility. The learning is that stewardship, quality, and safety 
operate under the same principles and operating systems, with stewardship as the core value. Establishing working 
systems will avoid violations. Automating transactions will protect employees from temptation to take short cuts and 
eliminate room for errors. It was also discovered that there are employees who always behave right, strive to do what 
is right to protect the business from risks. These employees’ values are aligned with that of the business and such 
behaviours is identified already at hiring stage. There is a clear relationship between stewardship approach and 
effective management of safety and quality systems. Lack of stewardship has an impact on overall business results, 
profitability, and productivity. Good stewardship increases morale and motivation. High morale and motivation have 
a direct relationship with all other business measures. Morale is used to measure engagement metrices within the 
organization. High morale organizations tend to be productive. Happy employees are very productive, competitive, 
committed to their work and determined to succeed in their jobs. Creating an environment where each employee can 
contribute and perform at such high level keeps the entire organization engaged and ensures continuously improving 
business results. The organization achieved and improved its results in a systemic and sustainable way. Employees 
are continuously identifying risk elimination ideas in their area of work. They ensure losses are highlighted to their 
leaders and addressed. Employees are showing high level of ownership, treating the business and its assets as their 
own.

Abstract 
The hydrogen supply chain plays a crucial role in producing and utilizing hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. It is a 
complex and evolving system that requires coordination among various stakeholders, including governments, 
industries, and researchers, to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability. This project considers the problem of 
designing the hydrogen supply chain network with a case study in Oman. The primary objective of having a hydrogen 
supply chain network and designing it effectively is to create a system that optimizes the configuration and the flow of 
hydrogen and reduces related costs such as production and transportation costs. To achieve that, a complex planning 
challenge emerges when there is a need to align the production of green hydrogen with its consumption. The design 
problem at hand requires precision consideration of critical factors, encompassing the strategic determination of the 
quantity and placement of production facilities, the delineation of optimal routes for the pipeline network, and the 
formulation to construction schedule. The outcomes of this project are objective to offer valuable insights into the 
viability of hydrogen energy production in Oman, clarification whether it presents a beneficial prospect for the nation. 
Moreover, the findings will guide the formulation of strategies to maximize the potential benefits derived from the 
implementation of hydrogen energy infrastructure within the Oman context. A mixed integer linear programing 
formulation was developed to solve the problem.  The model is implemented by IBM ILOG CPLEX OPL. The model 
included candidate locations for production; synthetic data was used to validate and understand the model.  The 
research examines several scenarios involving candidate locations for production and transportation facilities. It 
critically evaluates transportation logistics, including pipeline and trucking options, to ensure efficient distribution 
while minimizing operational and capital costs.

1. Introduction
Oil and gas exports, which in recent years have made up about 60% of all export revenue, are the economic backbone 
of Oman. In 2022, Oman claimed that it would generate significantly more domestic hydrogen using green electricity 
and would reach net zero by 2050. The nation is ideally placed to create substantial amounts of renewable hydrogen 
and hydrogen-based fuels like ammonia due to its high-quality renewable resources. The infrastructure for fossil fuels 
may be utilized or changed over to low-emission fuels, and Oman has a lot of land that can be used for large-scale 
projects. Oman can generate and export renewable hydrogen and ammonia at a price that is competitive by the end of 
this decade while also boosting the share of renewable energy in its power grid (IEA 2023).  
This study intends to examine Oman's strategic strategy for using green hydrogen, which will be based on the nation's 
priorities, resources available, and the objectives set by the government and important stakeholders. The project's 
scope will also cover the generation, storage, distribution, and use of green hydrogen in a variety of sectors.  
This study intends to shed light on Oman's adoption of green hydrogen technology and the potential and difficulties it 
faces, ultimately promoting a more robust and sustainable energy future. A variety of variables, including personal

subjected to various chemical processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanation, or other catalytic 
reactions. These processes convert hydrogen and CO2 into synthetic hydrocarbons, including synthetic 
gasoline, diesel, or aviation fuels. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Future work in the study of the utilization of green hydrogen in Oman should be guided by the same approach that 
takes into account economic, environmental, and social considerations while aligning with Oman's broader energy 
and sustainability goals. All current research limitations must be avoided as much as possible and more collaboration 
among government entities, academia, industry stakeholders, and international partners will be essential for the 
successful development of Oman's green hydrogen study. A need for a comprehensive study of green hydrogen 
policies globally that involves a thorough analysis and assessment of government policies, regulations, and incentives 
in various countries and regions. To match the green growing hydrogen sector and learn from others as policies and 
incentives is one of the primary driving factors for green H2. Research more on utilizing green hydrogen in the 
production of synthetic fuels involves exploring the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of using green hydrogen as a 
key feedstock for the synthesis of various synthetic fuels. These synthetic fuels can include synthetic gasoline, diesel, 
aviation fuels, and more. Prioritizing customer needs in the utilization of green hydrogen is paramount for its 
successful integration into our energy landscape. By tailoring solutions to meet customer demands, ensuring 
affordability, safety, and reliability, and advocating for supportive policies, green hydrogen can become a cornerstone 
of a sustainable and environmentally responsible energy future. In doing so, we can meet the expectations and 
aspirations of customers while mitigating the impact of climate change.

Abstract 
Goal number 2 of the United Nations aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote 
sustainable agriculture. However, the rapid increase in the world population has placed enormous pressure on food 
networks. This paper aims to evaluate the application of supply chain strategies (SCSs) to improve the food supply 
chain (FSC) performance and food security. Template analysis was utilized to evaluate interviews carried out with 
FSC practitioners to establish the SCSs that drive FSC performance and sustainability in Oman. Results established 
that the key SCSs that facilitate FSC performance and food security are enhancing local production, sustainable 
practices, right demand management, and improving logistics and infrastructure. Findings suggest that the challenges 
facing FSC can be mitigated and/or managed using established SCSs. The findings and the recommendations will 
support FSC professionals and policymakers to improve and overcome the challenges facing their networks by 
implementing the suggested SCSs to improve performance and sustainability. The study extends previous literature 
by proposing SCSs that drive FSC performance in the context of Oman, which if carefully designed and implemented 
could support FSC practitioners, policymakers, consumers, and food security.

1. Introduction
As a key component of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger, food security 
is an essential component of human existence (Hasnan et al. 2022). Thus, the food supply chain (FSC) is critical for 
human survival. The FSC is a complex network that includes several participants, including traditional, micro, small, 
medium, and large processors, demanding fundamental human effort and technological advancements (Hasnan et al. 
2022). The increase in the global population heightened the demand for food, leading to complexities in the FSC 
which led to the growth of innovative approaches (Bourlakis et al. 2004). Managing FSC is much more challenging 
than other supply chains due to food's perishable nature (Singh et al. 2018). FSC has a significant effect on economic 
growth, including employment generation (Yakovleva et al. 2012). 
The Omani government is actively pursuing initiatives to improve the performance of its food industry due to its 
excellent geographic location on the Arabian Peninsula. Oman is a leading country in fish exportation in the Gulf 
Corporation Council (GCC) area to over 56 countries, which contributes to the national economy (Al-Busaidi et al. 
2016). The nation is also well-known for date production, with nearly 7.8 million palm trees which have a significant 
role in maximizing the performance of the food industry and in increasing the national income. Oman was ranked as 
one of the leading countries in date production in 2006 (Mbaga et al. 2013). The Omani government is constantly 
making efforts to improve its FSC performance by implementing measures like quality control and food safety

Abstract 
India is the second largest consumer of Gold in the world and gold purchase is interwined in India culture and is 
driven by weddings, festivals and other important family and societal occasions. But in India, price discovery is 
less transparent and structured compared to global trading centers like London OTC, US COMEX and Shanghai 
Future Market (SHFE), which have their own gold exchanges. Due to the absence of a formal gold exchange, 
unlike in London, US and Shanghai, gold prices in India are determined by local demand and supply dynamics 
and also deviate from international price of gold. The consumers in India base their decision to buy gold based on 
domestic local prices of gold. Thus, it is important for investors, traders, researchers and policy makers to 
understand the significant factors determining gold price premium/discount in India which reflects the interaction 
between domestic demand for Gold and international prices. The present study is aimed to throw light on same. 
The study aims to uncover some of the important determinants of India's Gold price premium and discount. Does 
India's gold price premium or discount hold seasonal anomalies? Our answer is yes. This is the first attempt, and 
no studies consider India's gold price premium and discount and seasonal anomalies. Hence, the proposed 
research tries to document an important pattern of India's gold price premium and discount that can help to 
formulate policies that affect gold import. Further, we find day-of- the-week effects; month-of-the-year effects, 
quarter-of-the-year effects, and Festive anomalies: like Makar Sankranti; Akshay Tritiya; Dussehra and 
Diwali(Dhanteras(Entire Dipawali period)); Pitru-Paksha. Our empirical results indicate that India's gold price 
premium and discount hold seasonal anomalies. In the day of the week effects, Wednesday seems to be apparent 
for the highest discount, and month of the year effects, September reported the most considerable discount, and 
October, November, and December seem to be traded with premium. The stream of literature which considers 
seasonal anomalies specifically for Indian gold market although being second largest in the world is sparse. 
Indian gold future market is influenced by seasonality by comparison using two methods, one is ARIMA/Garch 
modeling methods and another is standard variance transformation method. They found that the variance 
transformation approach yields superior point forecast values, whereas the ARIMA/GARCH modelling 
technique produces shorter forecast intervals. Our study tries to extant literature on seasonal anomalies by 
investigating seasonal anomalies for premium and discount for gold prices in India. To our best of knowledge no 
such study has been done earlier. The study aims to uncover some of the important determinants of India's gold 
price premium or discount. Our research questions: (i) Does policy uncertainty affects Gold price 
premium/discount? (ii) Does India's Gold price premium/discount hold some seasonal anomalies? Hence, the 
proposed study tries to document important pattern of p/d that can help to formulate policies that affect the gold 
import. Seasonal anomalies: (i) day-of-the-week effects (ii) month-of- the-year effects (ii) quarter of the year 
effects; Festive anomalies: Makar Sankranti ; Akshay Tritiya; Dussehra and Diwali(Dhanteras(Entire Dipawali 
period));Pitru-Paksha (10 to 25 September).

Abstract 
Robotics integration in the food and beverage sector has accelerated, particularly in response to the need for efficient 
and frictionless service. The design and development of a robotic system for preparing and serving hot beverages—
with an emphasis on coffee and tea options—is presented in this study. The robot was built with a robust acrylic frame 
and an Arduino microcontroller. It has infrared (IR) sensors and color tracking to identify obstructions, follow 
predetermined routes, and improve navigation accuracy. Using an automated ingredient handling and heating system, 
the robot makes drinks while maintaining hygienic requirements and constant quality. Users can choose their preferred 
beverages and direct the robot to certain areas via the smartphone device, which offers a user-friendly interface. 
According to experimental results, the robot's beverage quality, efficiency, and service time are on par with hand 
preparation, indicating that it might be used in dynamic settings like cafés or workplaces. This study offers important 
new information about robotics applications in the food and beverage industry, especially with regard to sensor-based 
navigation and mobile application interfaces. Limitations and future research possibilities are explored, including the 
possibility of increasing sensor accuracy and beverage selections to boost system performance and user happiness.

4.1 Limitation 
The beverage-serving robot project was successful, but had several limitations. The color tracking sensor's accuracy 
was limited, and the limited menu of beverages could have been improved by incorporating additional beverage 
preparation mechanisms. The robot's speed and efficiency were slow, requiring considerable time for beverage 
preparation. However, the project demonstrated the potential for integrating robotics and automation into the food and 
beverage service industry. To improve the robot's performance, more advanced sensors and components could be 
incorporated, such as a higher-quality color tracking sensor and more powerful motors. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, a sensor-driven robotic system is used to automate beverage service in a novel way. The robot exhibits 
efficient, independent operation in a regulated setting by utilizing an Arduino-based controller and ultrasonic sensors 
for navigation. The design opens the door for better customer service applications in the hospitality industry by 
meeting the main goals of accuracy, effectiveness, and dependability in beverage delivery. The feasibility of low-cost 
robotic systems in service industries is demonstrated by the combination of modular hardware and straightforward 
programming, which enables smooth integration into environments that have historically relied on manual labor. By 
improving sensory capabilities and integrating machine learning algorithms to enhance pathfinding, obstacle 
avoidance, and operational scalability, future versions can build upon this basic work. This study adds to the expanding 
subject of service robotics by demonstrating how accessible and reasonably priced technology can convert repetitive 
service jobs into efficient, automated procedures.

Abstract 
Energy supply chain participants recognise the benefits of hydrogen energy (H2-e) in accelerating the energy 
transition. However, concerns remain regarding the financial viability of H2-e supply chain operations. The 
application of supply chain finance (SCF) in renewable energy (RE) networks has received significant attention as 
stakeholders perceive its benefits in improving liquidity, financial performance, and competitiveness. Despite the 
increasing volume of SCF-related studies on RE networks, there is a dearth of articles that extensively review extant 
literature to identify SCF capabilities suitable for H2-e networks, build a holistic framework of hydrogen energy 
supply chain finance (H2-e-SCF) to guide practitioners and future research agenda. A state-of-the-art systematic 
literature review (SLR) was conducted on 66 candidate articles between 2008 to 2023, which were analysed using 
template analysis to identify the existing research trends and explore key themes to build a framework for H2-e-SCF. 
Results revealed the desire for alternative energy, research efforts, financial considerations, policies, environmental 
sustainability, RE technologies, and energy SCF initiatives are the key factors that require SCF strategies in H2-e 
networks. The first framework of H2-e-SCF is developed as a guide for selecting and deploying SCF initiatives for 
improved value, competitiveness, and sustainability in H2-e networks. A framework of H2-e-SCF was developed 
using established methodological foundations as a guide to energy supply chain practitioners, researchers, and 
policymakers. The results emphasise the need to embrace SCF initiatives in H2-e networks to fast-track energy 
transition, address energy security, and improve sustainability.

1. Introduction
The global population, presently at 7.8 billion, is estimated to rise to 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 (UN 
2024). This significant increase in the global population has led to a surge in energy demand, necessitating a paradigm 
shift towards renewable energy (RE) deployment to facilitate sustainability (Makki et al. 2022). Consequently, with 
regulations and heightened public awareness regarding environmental issues, manufacturers are compelled to adopt 
eco-friendly innovations to enhance their sustainability (Cui et al. 2020). As countries across the globe commit to 
climate targets and strive to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change, the pressing need to embrace sustainable 
energy alternatives has become increasingly crucial. Since the onset of the 21st century, RE sources have emerged as 
the key to a greener and more sustainable world (Agaton et al. 2022). Hydrogen energy (H2-e) as one of the 
environmentally friendly sources of energy is regarded as the energy of the future (Harichandan and Kar 2023).  
Despite advancements in H2-e technology and the importance of decarbonisation and energy security, progress toward 
the global climate goals remains insufficient. As of 2020 RE sources constituted merely 19.1% of energy consumption, 
indicating a transition slower than desired (UN 2020). The H2-e supply chain faces economic challenges, including

Abstract 
This paper presents an Optimization System designed to streamline factory layout planning while considering 
safety standards such as OSHA, and ISO, as well as sustainability standards. The system takes inputs such as 
available space, industry type, machine specifications (including production rates), and expected demand to 
generate an optimized layout. The goal is to minimize unused space, environmental impacts, and waste while 
maximizing safety. It also integrates lighting design of the factory to ensure compliance with safety regulations. 
The system relies on mathematical modeling and Operations Research techniques - specifically linear 
programming-, reducing the need for external consultants and adding significant value for businesses establishing 
new factories while the integration of AI and simulation techniques is envisioned for future enhancements. Based 
on the scenario provided in this paper, this system increases space utilization by up to 80%, depending on the 
input space, machine type, and machine sizes. Based on a comprehensive review of previous research in facilities 
planning, which identified a knowledge gap in integrating safety and environmental considerations into the design 
process, we expect this system to develop a comprehensive and integrated framework for facilities planning.

made, challenges remain in improving space utilization, increasing efficiency, enhancing safety and 
sustainability. This study aims to address these challenges by developing an integrated system that improves 
factory layout and increases productivity, while adhering to ISO and OSHA safety standards. The study seeks to 
create an optimization system that produces efficient layouts based on inputs such as available space, industry 
type, machinery specifications, and expected demand. This system is based on safety standards and works to 
improve space utilization and reduce reliance on external consultants. By using operations research and 
mathematical modeling techniques, the study provides valuable insights into achieving an optimal factory layout

This model does not have a feasible solution since the constraint of the used space to be less than or equal to the 
available space is not satisfied and the demand of 6500 tons per year cannot be met by the available resources. 
Working hours per day can be increased to meet expected demand (Overtime). 
 
5.2. Numerical and Graphical results of Lumen Method for lighting: 
For the lighting part, we used the Lumen Method to calculate the number of lamps that should be installed for the 
given space of the factory, and we got the following result (Table 8):

Figure 14 shows the lighting design and spaces between lamps that ensure uniformity in illumination overall the 
factory. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
To enhance the system's efficiency, two key improvements are suggested. First, implementing advanced AI 
algorithms for real-time data analysis will allow the system to adapt to changing production needs and optimize 
layout configurations accordingly. Second, creating a virtual environment using simulation techniques will enable 
stakeholders to test different layout scenarios before implementation, reducing risks and facilitating informed 
decision-making. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research introduces an optimization system for factory space utilization that prioritizes safety standards 
(OSHA, ISO) and sustainability. By minimizing unused space and environmental impact while enhancing safety, 
the system integrates effective lighting design to ensure compliance with regulations. It reduces the need for 
external consultants, offering significant value to businesses. The findings suggest potential space utilization 
increases of up to 80%, depending on various factors. This study fills a gap in the literature by addressing safety 
and environmental aspects in facility design, contributing to a comprehensive framework that benefits businesses 
and stakeholders.

Abstract 
This paper looks at the problems faced by cities that are built mainly for cars. While having roads and parking lots 
makes driving easier, it also causes big issues like traffic jams, more fuel use, and more pollution. These problems 
cost cities a lot of money because they have to spend a lot to keep up the roads and parking spaces. At the same time, 
other ways of getting around, like walking, biking, or taking the bus, are often not well-developed, which makes it 
hard for people to stop using cars. The paper suggests that cities need to focus on better transportation options that can 
save money, improve people's health, and make cities better places to live.

Abstract 
This research investigates the critical challenges faced by various industries in sustaining profitability amidst 
escalating process defects. Despite enhancements in management systems aimed at quality improvement, numerous 
sectors continue to confront issues stemming from outdated machinery, ineffective processes, and inadequate 
employee training. Conventional methods, such as enhanced quality control and workforce training, have often 
resulted in increased production costs without substantial reductions in defects, highlighting the necessity for a more 
effective approach. This study employs Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to pinpoint the significant variables 
contributing to quality variance in the weaving process. The findings indicate that width and length are primary factors, 
accounting for over 45.22% of quality variance, while thread type contributes 23.06%. Additionally, factors such as 
the thickness of metallic threads and weight per unit have lesser impacts. This analysis empowers industries to 
concentrate their optimization efforts strategically, thereby fostering enhanced quality and overall profitability.

1. Introduction
According to (Adedeji et al. 2023), defects in processes pose important problems for industries around the world. 
Despite innovations in modern management systems aiming to reduce these defects, many industries continued to face 
persistent quality challenges (Yaprak and Vergili 2023). This implies that simply adopting new technologies or 
management strategies is inadequate, effective implementation and organizational change toward quality monitoring 
and improvement are required (Reda and Dvivedi 2022). The situation is particularly serious in Indonesia's weaving 
industry, where traditional management practices are prominent (Feri, Sudarmiatin, and Mukhlis 2022). The industry's 
capacity to adapt to new quality management principles has been hampered by its reliance on antiquated approaches 
(Pratiwi and Dachyar 2020). 
Furthermore, the weaving industry encounters particular difficulties due to a lack of effective statistical techniques for 
data collection and analysis (Tripathi and Gupta 2021; Zonnenshain and Kenett 2020)(Tripathi and Gupta 2021). This 
capability gap means that many industries lack the knowledge and experience required to identify and prevent defects 
consistently (Psomas, Fotopoulos, and Kafetzopoulos 2011). Resource constraints and a general lack of quality 
management skills drive these industries to prioritize order fulfillment and rapid delivery, often at the expense of 
overall product quality (Addis, Dvivedi, and Beshah 2019; Kang and Bhatti 2019). As a consequence, there is an

that even smaller contributions can play a significant role in the overall optimization strategy, ensuring a complete 
approach to increasing quality and performance.

4. Discussion and Conclusions  
Today, industrial have significant challenges that some industries worldwide must address to maintain profitability. 
While there are improvements in management systems designed to minimize these defects, many industries still face 
these quality issues. In the beginning, industry increase in process defects has concerned, prompting industry to 
investigate the root causes more seriously. These defects are often caused by various factors, including outdated 
machinery, inefficient workflows, and inadequate employee training. Although some strategies have been attempted, 
such as improving quality control measures and improving workforce development, many have led to increased 
production costs without corresponding improvements in defect rates. Consequently, the need for a more targeted and 
effective approach is urgent. 
 
To address these quality challenges, this research employs analysis of variance (ANOVA), a robust statistical method. 
Industries have applied ANOVA to identify key factors that contribute to variance in quality in the weaving process. 
This analysis allows for the comparison of different variables to determine which have the most significant impact on 
process results. Industries have checked the critical variables and materials that are related to defect rates, which are 
essential to develop targeted results. Understanding these relationships is vital to implement effective strategies that 
improve quality and reduce defects. 
 
The findings indicate that width and length contribute more than 45.22% to the variance in quality outcomes, 
establishing them as crucial areas for optimization. Improving these variables can increase performance and defect 
reduction efforts. Additionally, the type of thread accounts for 23.06% of the quality variance, further emphasizing its

importance in the weaving process. Other factors, such as the thickness of metallic threads and weight per unit, while 
contributing smaller percentages, remain significant and should not be neglected. This detailed analysis enables 
industries to focus on optimization efforts, ensuring a comprehensive approach to improving profitability.

Abstract 
The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new horizons 
in industrial engineering and operations management. This paper explores the integration of Generative AI and 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) within industrial settings, focusing on both practical applications and 
theoretical advancements. We examine how these technologies can optimize operations, improve decision-making, 
and address complex industrial challenges. On the application front, we discuss case studies where Generative AI and 
RAG have been deployed to enhance supply chain management, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. 
For instance, LLMs can analyze vast amounts of operational data to generate insights on production bottlenecks, while 
RAG can augment these models by incorporating real-time data retrieval, ensuring up-to-date and contextually 
relevant outputs. From a theoretical perspective, we delve into the challenges of adapting LLMs to industrial contexts, 
such as handling domain-specific jargon, ensuring data privacy, and maintaining model robustness. We also explore 
advancements in model architectures and training methodologies that enhance the applicability of Generative AI in 
operations management. Finally, we address the ethical and practical considerations of deploying these technologies, 
including data security and workforce implications. By bridging the gap between theoretical research and industrial 
applications, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential of Generative AI and RAG in 
revolutionizing industrial engineering and operations management.

sectors such as healthcare, energy, and construction. Exploring domain-specific adaptations and the potential barriers 
to implementing AI-driven decision support in different industrial contexts would be a valuable extension of this 
research. Moreover, the scalability of Generative AI models needs further investigation. Industries with highly 
variable production lines or those experiencing rapid changes in demand might require more scalable solutions to 
ensure that AI-generated insights remain accurate and useful. Developing adaptive learning techniques that enable 
models to adjust to rapidly changing operational environments without requiring extensive retraining could further 
enhance the applicability of Generative AI in industry. 
 
6.6 Integration with Industry 4.0 Technologies   
The findings of this research also highlight the potential synergies between Generative AI and other Industry 4.0 
technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and advanced robotics. IoT can serve as an invaluable 
source of real-time data that feeds into RAG models, enhancing the contextual accuracy of generated insights. 
Blockchain technology could be leveraged to ensure data integrity and security, particularly in supply chain 
applications where trust and transparency are paramount. Robotics, integrated with AI-driven insights, could further 
automate production processes, leading to enhanced efficiency and reduced human intervention in hazardous tasks. 
Future research should focus on how these technologies can be integrated into a cohesive ecosystem that not only 
automates but also intelligently manages industrial operations. Exploring frameworks that allow seamless 
communication between different Industry 4.0 components could provide a blueprint for the future of industrial 
operations—a future where AI-driven decision-making, real-time data retrieval, and automated physical execution are 
harmonized. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This research has demonstrated the transformative potential of Generative AI and RAG in enhancing industrial 
operations management. By integrating advanced AI models with real-time data retrieval, significant improvements 
in operational efficiency, predictive maintenance, and decision support were achieved. The study contributes to the 
state of the art by extending the application of Generative AI beyond traditional domains into the realm of industrial 
operations. The findings have significant implications for industries aiming to optimize processes, reduce downtime, 
and improve overall productivity. The ability of AI to dynamically adapt to real-time data represents a paradigm shift 
in how industrial processes are managed. 
 
Generative AI also plays a pivotal role in augmenting human capabilities, particularly in decision-making scenarios 
where the complexity of operations exceeds the capacity for manual analysis. This study illustrates how the synergy 
between AI and human operators can create an environment that not only enhances operational efficiency but also 
empowers workers by reducing manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic activities. The insights 
generated through real-time RAG mechanisms can guide decision-makers to make informed choices that align 
operational activities with overarching business objectives, ultimately resulting in sustainable productivity gains. 
Despite the promising results, this research has certain limitations. The reliance on specific datasets may limit the 
generalizability of the findings across different industrial sectors. Future research should focus on expanding the scope 
by including diverse datasets and exploring the applicability of Generative AI across a wider range of industrial 
processes. Moreover, addressing the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and developing more explainable 
AI models will be crucial for the broader adoption of these technologies. 
 
The current study also highlights the importance of computational efficiency, especially for SMEs. Addressing these 
computational challenges through model compression techniques, edge AI deployment, and the use of more efficient 
hardware accelerators could pave the way for more inclusive adoption of AI technologies in industry. Additionally, 
examining the integration of AI with emerging Industry 4.0 technologies such as blockchain for enhanced data security 
and IoT for richer data contexts represents an exciting direction for future research. 
 
Ultimately, the integration of Generative AI and RAG offers a novel approach to addressing long-standing challenges 
in industrial operations management. By improving efficiency, reducing maintenance needs, and providing real-time 
decision support, AI has the potential to revolutionize the industry. The contributions of this research not only advance 
academic knowledge but also offer practical insights for industry practitioners aiming to harness the power of AI in 
their operations. The deployment of Generative AI in industrial operations represents a significant leap towards 
intelligent automation, wherein AI systems not only optimize existing processes but also provide the agility required 
to navigate the uncertainties inherent in complex industrial ecosystems. The findings underscore the value of a

Abstract 
This research investigates the relationship between industrial innovation inputs and outputs in Saudi Arabia, focusing 
on the country's alignment with Vision 2030. Despite significant investments in research and development, Saudi 
Arabia's industrial innovation performance has declined, revealing a gap between innovation inputs and outputs. Using 
data from the Global Innovation Index (GII) and employing Pearson correlation analysis, this study examines the 
correlation between crucial input indicators such as Operation Stability, Environmental Performance, and Market 
Capitalization and output indicators like Labor Productivity Growth and High-tech Manufacturing over 12 years. The 
findings indicate a moderate positive correlation (0.530) between innovation input and output on a national level, with 
a stronger correlation (0.837) in the industrial sector. Key challenges, including business instability and environmental 
issues, were identified as significant barriers to maximizing innovation outputs. The study highlights the need for 
targeted policies to enhance business stability, environmental sustainability, and industrial diversification. These 
improvements are crucial to optimizing industrial innovation performance, achieving Vision 2030 objectives, and 
enhancing Saudi Arabia's global innovation ranking.

Abstract 
A pillar of renewable energy technology, horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) provide a dependable and well-
established method of capturing wind energy. It is more important than ever to maximize the efficiency and 
dependability of HAWTs as the market for renewable energy sources grows. Through modal analysis, this study 
attempts to explore the complex dynamics of HAWT blades with the ultimate goal of optimizing design parameters 
to increase turbine longevity and overall efficiency. The research uses a thorough methodology that combines 
statistical optimization techniques with sophisticated computational modeling tools. The research process includes 
utilizing SolidWorks to meticulously create realistic 3D models that accurately replicate the geometry of HAWT 
blades. ANSYS Workbench is then used to perform modal frequency analysis, allowing for a thorough investigation 
of natural frequencies and mode shapes. The impacts of changing design parameters on the modal behavior of HAWT 
blades are then systematically analyzed using statistical optimization techniques made easier by Minitab software. 
Nine trials are carried out using a Taguchi experimental design approach, each changing factors including the pole’s 
diameter, height, and the span of the turbine blades. The study reveals complex correlations between these design 
elements and modal behavior by computing the first four modal frequencies for every experiment. The experimental 
data main effect graphs offer important insights into how parameter adjustments affect modal frequencies. Important 
conclusions from the study include the detection of patterns such as the proportionate increase with turbine blade span 
and the linear drop-in modal frequency with increasing pole height. Furthermore, the study shows that different modes 
experience distinct effects on modal frequencies due to the diameter of the pole, emphasizing the significance of taking 
into account a variety of characteristics while optimizing HAWT blade design. This research adds to a better 
knowledge of HAWT blade dynamics through rigorous experimentation and analysis, and it provides useful guidance 
for improving design parameters to improve turbine performance and dependability. This work lays the groundwork 
for improvements in wind energy technology, which will ultimately accelerate the shift to a more sustainable energy 
future, by utilizing sophisticated computer modeling and statistical optimization techniques.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, a substantial addition to the field of wind energy technology has been made by the research on modal 
analysis of HAWT blades. A thorough analysis of the vibrational behavior and structural dynamics of HAWT 
components has provided important new information about how to optimize design parameters for improved 
dependability and performance. This study has illuminated the complex links between design parameters and modal 
frequencies by utilizing sophisticated approaches like statistical optimization, 3D modeling, and FEA. This has opened 
the door to more robust and efficient wind turbine designs. The results of this study highlight how crucial modal 
analysis is to comprehending how HAWT blades dynamically react to different operating circumstances. A drop in 
frequency with increasing pole height and a positive association with blade span and pole diameter are two examples 
of the observed patterns in modal frequencies that demonstrate how design parameters affect structural stiffness and 
mass distribution. The design of HAWT configurations to reduce fatigue failure, decrease structural vibrations, and 
maximize energy output is greatly aided by these findings. Combining statistical optimization approaches provides a 
methodical way to find the best design parameters that result in better performance attributes. To satisfy the need to 
produce renewable energy while guaranteeing operational dependability and lifespan, engineers can improve wind 
turbine designs by utilizing the synergies between theoretical calculations, numerical simulations, and experimental 
validations. With ramifications for the design, use, and upkeep of HAWTs in both onshore and offshore applications, 
this research marks a noteworthy advancement in wind energy technology. This work adds to the continuing efforts 
to harness the enormous potential of wind energy as a sustainable and environmentally friendly power source by 
bridging the knowledge gap between theory and actual application. The knowledge gathered from this study will be 
vital in influencing wind turbine technology going forward and hastening the shift to a greener, more sustainable 
energy environment as the world continues its shift to renewable energy.

Abstract 
The Sultanate of Oman intends to diversify its energy production by transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable energy 
sources, hence reducing dependence on crude oil and natural gas. Hydrogen energy is considered a promising solution 
to switch from conventional to the renewable energy sources, as it has the potential of reducing the intermittency in 
renewable energy supply and hence could contribute toward deep decarbonisation to meet the Paris Agreement. The 
country is investing in the fields of wind energy, solar PV, and biogas plants under the policy of Oman Vision 2040, 
targeting 39% renewable energy share by 2040. Hydrogen economy can enable Oman to achieve its net zero emission 
goals. This target can, however, be successfully achieved when there are well-articulated national policies, appropriate 
technological development, skilled manpower, and capacity at the local institutional level. This article examines the 
prospects for hydrogen energy in Oman by looking at the country's renewable resource potential, investment 
opportunities, and related policies. It evaluates Oman's current condition in terms of renewable energy potential, 
continuing activities, and institutional capabilities.

Introduction
The drastic change in climate conditions due to excess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has urged to explore clean, 
efficient and sustainable energy supply system. Renewable energy sources i.e., solar, geothermal, wind is replacing 
traditional energy source (fossil fuels). However, the intermittency of some of the renewable energy restricts its full 
utilization. To overcome the intermittency problem, a relatively new form of renewable energy (hydrogen) is being 
explored for its potential and is expected to achieve a deep decarbonisation. Major countries around the globe aim to 
reduce the global GHG emissions and limit the temperature rise to 2°C to meet Paris Agreement (Zarate, 2015). To 
achieve this, Oman intends to diversify the production of energy by transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy 
with renewable energy like wind, solar and hydrogen. Driven by Oman Vision 2040, Oman is currently investing in 
diverse renewable projects, including windfarms, solar PV, and biogas plants. With the ambition to reach up to 39% 
of renewable energy share in 2040, embarking on a novel hydrogen economy will offer a long-term opportunity for 
Oman to achieve its national net zero emission goals (Amoatey et al., 2022). The prospect of sustainable hydrogen

Figure 6. Green Hydrogen energy production master plans of Oman for the year 2030–2050. 
 
The region that is presently obtaining multiple parcels of land may contribute to the attainment of the 2030 objective 
(ADF, 2019). According to this master plan, the projected hydrogen production levels are expected to increase by 
more than 300% in 2040, and 700% in 2050 from the 2030 levels, depending on the strength of foreign investment 
companies and local funding capacities. Interestingly, the entire hydrogen production plan will require only 30% of 
the available hydrogen lands to achieve.  
 
2. Conclusions 
Due to the gradual depletion and high production cost of crude oil reserves, Oman looks for diversification from an 
oil-based economy to a sustainable hydrogen economy. This paper has discussed solar and wind energy resources and 
other possible resources such as natural gas and crude oil to supply green hydrogen economy demands in Oman. It 
also discussed the ongoing green hydrogen projects, strategic national hydrogen production plans, and different clean 
energy hydrogen policies and institutional capacities in Oman. Oman stands to achieve remarkable progress towards 
a sustainable hydrogen economy by 2050. In fact, it has secured multi-billion US$ investments in green hydrogen 
within the last three years and currently is auctioning hydrogen energy lands. Also, Oman has established hydrogen 
research and training institutions and enacted a robust hydrogen policy on land allocation of clean hydrogen to the 
developers. There are disadvantages concerning the use of electrolysis technology in Oman for the production of green 
hydrogen, given that these require highly demanded freshwater and may involve very difficult operational conditions. 
Moreover, Thermochemical cycles could leverage the country’s abundant solar energy and industrial flare gas as heat 
sources. These methods have a few advantages over conventional electrolysis, in the form of utilizing waste heat and 
renewable energy, increasing the energy efficiency, and reducing operational costs. They also help with water scarcity 
having an integrated desalination process. Oman will be able to further diversify its hydrogen production pathways 
and optimize its local resources with thermochemical cycles, allowing the country to emerge as a leader in sustainable 
energy as per the Vision 2040. National policies in the future must articulate these concerns and find ways to reduce 
potential socio-economic and environmental impacts. Further, it is worth investing in research programs for the 
development of local cost-effective electrolysers suitable for the Omani climate. However, the exploration of new and 
renewable pathways for hydrogen production (thermochemical route) must be taken into consideration due to its 
reliance on renewable energy (solar, wind, industrial waste heat).

Abstract 
The global demand for energy consumption is rising at an alarming rate. This increase is driven by economic growth, 
population expansion, and escalating temperatures due to climate change. Cooling energy demand is projected to rise 
by 275% globally by 2050, with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region being one of the most affected. In 
Kuwait, buildings account for approximately 90% of electricity consumption, and air conditioning alone constitutes 
over 70% of this usage during peak summer months. Kuwait’s electricity demand is expected to reach 30,000 MW by 
2030, primarily driven by cooling needs. With a population reliant on fossil fuel-based energy, there is an urgent need 
to find sustainable solutions that can mitigate this rising demand. This paper investigates the use of phase change 
materials (PCMs) to improve thermal comfort. Two portable cabins were constructed in Kuwait, one equipped with 
PCMs and the other serving as a control. The study evaluates the combined impact of PCM integration on perceived 
indoor thermal index, humidity, and air quality during the month of March 2023. Results show that PCM application 
reduced indoor temperature peaks by 3.31°C on average and stabilized humidity fluctuations by 10%. Moreover, daily 
particulate matter (PM 2.5) concentrations were reduced by 6.12 µg/m³, indicating an improvement in air quality. 
These findings suggest that PCMs offer a promising passive cooling solution that can enhance thermal comfort, 
improve indoor air quality, and the potential to reduce energy consumption in hot climates like Kuwait.

4.8 Dissolved Oxygen (DO) 
 Levels were initially measured at 16.2 mg/L. Following the addition of CdS NPs, a notable decline in DO was 
observed. For Sample 1, DO decreased from 13.3 mg/L on Day 0 to 3.9 mg/L on Day 5. Sample 2's DO levels dropped 
from 10 mg/L to 2.7 mg/L, while Sample 3 experienced a reduction from 4.8 mg/L to 1.6 mg/L. The significant 
decrease in DO levels suggests that the microbial activity associated with the decomposition of organic matter was 
influenced by the presence of CdS NPs, leading to increased oxygen consumption (Figure 8). 
 
Figure 8. Effect of CdS nanoparticles on Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels in domestic water. 
 
The results indicate that the addition of CdS NPs effectively reduced TOC, TC, and Ic levels in domestic wastewater, 
demonstrating their potential as a treatment method for improving water quality. The observed decrease in DO levels 
highlights the impact of CdS NPs on microbial activity, which is crucial for the biodegradation of organic pollutants. 
These findings support the use of CdS NPs in wastewater treatment processes, contributing to environmental 
sustainability and the reduction of organic contaminants in water bodies. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study successfully demonstrated the efficacy of cadmium sulphide nanoparticles (CdS NPs) in enhancing the 
quality of domestic wastewater through the reduction of key parameters such as Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total 
Carbon (TC), Inorganic Carbon (Ic), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO). The results indicated a significant decrease in TOC 
and TC levels following the addition of varying dosages of CdS NPs, highlighting their effectiveness in removing 
organic contaminants from wastewater. 
 
The analysis revealed that the highest reduction in TOC and TC occurred with the application of 1.5g of CdS NPs, 
underscoring the relationship between nanoparticle dosage and pollutant removal efficiency. Additionally, the 
observed decline in DO levels suggests that microbial activity was significantly influenced by the presence of CdS 
NPs, leading to increased oxygen consumption as organic matter was decomposed. 
 
Overall, the findings of this study support the potential application of CdS NPs as a sustainable and effective method 
for wastewater treatment. Their ability to reduce organic and inorganic carbon levels while promoting microbial

degradation processes positions them as a viable alternative to conventional treatment methods. However, it is 
important to note that while the treated water may meet certain safety standards for non-potable uses, the presence of 
CdS NPs necessitates caution regarding its suitability for human consumption. Future research should focus on 
optimizing CdS NP dosages and exploring their long-term environmental impacts to ensure safe and effective 
wastewater treatment solutions.

Abstract 
Ensuring road safety is significantly influenced by driver behavior and the driving environment, which are significant 
factors in the prevention of traffic accidents. While plenty of research has been performed about driving behavior in 
developed nations, a significant gap exists in comprehending the role of road design and infrastructure in developing 
countries like Saudi Arabia. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing a high-frequency accident hotspot on 
the Tabuk University Bridge along King Fahd Road. A survey was conducted focusing on the role of human, 
operational, and infrastructural factors contributing to recurring accidents to identify potential root causes of frequent 
accidents. Using a combination of police reports, historical accident data, and traffic simulation collected from survey 
data, this study examined the bridge's design, vehicular speed criteria, and traffic flow patterns. The analysis of survey 
results reveals that design flaws, particularly the narrowing of lanes and inadequate merging areas, exacerbate accident 
risks, especially during peak hours. Based on the output, three solutions were proposed, with the expansion of the 
bridge and reallocation of lane widths showing the most promising performance in reducing accident occurrences. 
The paper aims to assess modern approaches and practices in bridge design at crucial urban areas within the city. The 
findings of this research contribute to the development of targeted interventions for enhancing road safety in Saudi 
Arabia's rapidly evolving urban environments.

1. Introduction
Road safety has been a persistent social and economic issue in Saudi Arabia over the last several decades. The 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has witnessed an alarming rise in both the number and severity of road traffic accidents, 
leading to high rates of injuries and fatalities. According to Mansuri et al. (2015), the consequences of such accidents 
not only impact public health but also strain the nation's economy. Despite concerted efforts by lawmakers and 
transportation authorities to reduce accident rates through policy changes and awareness campaigns, Saudi Arabia 
remains one of the countries with the highest rates of road traffic accidents, ranking among the top 10 globally, as 
reported by analyzed by (Kamh et al., 2024). 
Various factors contribute to this high accident rate. Human behavior is a significant driver of road accidents, with 
aggressive driving, speeding, distracted driving (particularly the use of mobile phones), and driving under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs being some of the key causes (Alhazmi et al., 2022; Ramisetty-Mikler & Almakadma, 
2016). However, human factors alone do not fully explain the accident statistics. Infrastructure deficiencies—such as 
poor road design, inadequate signage, and insufficient safety standards—also play a crucial role in increasing the

require an expansion of the study to include them, as the changes made were not included in the data collected in this 
study. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
The study outcomes can be summarized in the following points: 
• 
All accidents occurred in the same location and of the same type and coincided with the beginning of the peak 
period, indicating a link between the volume of traffic and the engineering design of the site due to the accident. 
• 
The accident occurs as a result of cars suddenly slowing down, with a speeding car behind them, not leaving 
enough distance, which causes the collision, and with the lack of sufficient sight distances for oncoming cars due 
to the vertical curve of the bridge, successive collisions occur. 
• 
The traffic volume study showed that drivers prefer to drive in the middle lane, and avoid the right and left lanes; 
the reason is due to what was mentioned in the previous point. 
• 
The study of speeds showed that there is a difference in the distribution of speeds in the two directions of 
movement, as they tend to be higher in the direction under study (the direction to the university) compared to the 
opposite direction during off-peak periods. 
• 
The operating speed on the bridge house for the direction under study is estimated to be about 95 km/h, which is 
higher than the permissible values, indicating the need to take action to adjust the speeds in the direction under 
study. 
Finally, three scenarios for solutions were evaluated. The first one is to expand the bridge house, increase the width 
of the left lane, and remove the overhang so that the house becomes four lanes, like the bridge house in the opposite 
direction. The second proposal is to re-plan the bridge so that it becomes two lanes. The third solution is to close the 
bridge and divert traffic to the service road. The simulation and analysis program for the three scenarios showed that 
the first scenario was the best, followed by the second scenario and that the third scenario was not preferred at all and 
would cause serious traffic problems. In spite of this, it is imperative to recognize certain limitations of the study. The 
research insufficiently takes into account human behavior and its potential significant impact on the accidents that 
occurred. Therefore, distractions must be examined to achieve a comprehensive grasp of the underlying reasons.

Abstract 
Seaports are a major influencer on a country overall economy. Saudi Arabia is located at the pass ways between the 
East and the West. More than 90% of shipments are transported by ships. Many manufacturers assemble their products 
in locations that are connecting shipping routes. This study aims to replace Jebel Ali port by Saudi Arabian ports while 
trying to minimize the total fuel consumption for a set of container vessels routes. The Transshipment problem was 
solved through Tora Optimization Software. The solution showed the importance of routing the container vessels 
through Jeddah Islamic Port, being located to open routes (on the way between the Red sea and the Mediterranean Sea) 
not like ports located in the Arab sea (dead end) and the need for double turns. The results where simulated and 
animated via Arena Rockwell Software. The results shows the need to re-innovate and expand Jeddah Islamic Port. 
Jeddah Islamic Port has to be marketed through the available crude oil Refinery to motivate the routing of ships through 
it by lowering the HFO Prices.

1. Introduction
The maritime sector is a key asset for the world economy, but the sector is primarily supplied with Heavy Fuel Oil 
(Prussi 2021). The main mode of transport for global trade is sea shipping: around 90% of traded goods are carried over 
the waves. In a study that have compared four types of maritime vessels based on their Total Operational Cost. The 
results showed that a Feeder vessel with Fast Speed and a Large Capacity Fuel Costs equals 43% of the total operational 
cost (Colling 2020) (Figure 1).

The analysis of the data shows that at any time, the expected number of container vessels waiting in the process is 
equal to 2.5 vessels, a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 6 vessels.  The estimated total time spent by a container 
vessel at SAJED port equals to 48.79 hours with a minimum value of 12.59 hours up to 98 hours. The expected service 
time of loading and unloading activities equals to 33.93 hours, while, the waiting time is expected to be 14.85 hours 
before starting routing the vessel from the arrival station.  The results also show that the loading and unloading activities 
may take 12.59 hours (Min.) and a (max. of 98 hours). The total service time at Terminal 1 is equal to 613.37 hours 
and the total service time for Terminal 2 is 574.52 hours.  The expected number of serviced vessels at Terminal 1 
equals to 18 container vessels and 17 container vessels at Terminal 2. The utilization of Terminal 1 equals to 
86.74% and 82.51% for Terminal 2.  
 
As of the simulation model results, the Average time spent by a container a vessel at SAJED port equals to 48.79 hours, 
of which 14.86 hours waiting for service, and 33.93 hours for service time. While comparing the results to the 
benchmark (Jebel Ali Port) and Ports in UAE, according to Statistical analysis, the average time spent in UAE Ports 
is 1 day. The total spent time of 1 day at Jebel Ali port is half the time spent by a Container vessel in SAJED Port.

The service time in Jeddah port (𝑊𝑊𝑝𝑝) = 33.93 hours and is greater than (𝑊𝑊𝑠𝑠) Jebel Ali =24 hours. This shows the need 
for re-innovating the port in Jeddah, with a double sized expansion. 
 
4. Results, Conclusions and Recommendations 
4.1 Conclusions 
This paper stated that the main problem is that due to economic competition among countries and that the sea ports are 
a key factor in the economic growth, and that due to closing of some seaports due to bad economic conditions, this 
paper tries to motivate the transshipment of container vessels through Saudi Arabian  ports instead of “Jebel Ali port"" 
(One of the 10 most transit ports).  This study tries to reduce fuel costs using the transshipment model.  
 
Fuel consumption is proportional to the speed of the container vessel. This paper aims to reduce the fuel consumption 
and re-scheduling traffic at Jebel Ali port to Saudi Arabian ports and try to simulate the results.  The modeling and 
scheduling process of applying the transit model to the Saudi sea ports was tested. The modeled transit network has 
been simplified into a transportation network in which seaports are interconnected by direct point-to-point connections. 
The model's objective function is to minimize total fuel burned (MJ) for transporting model container vessels through 
a simplified route network, the solution of which determines the number of container vessels. 
 
The simulation results shows that the total time spent in Jeddah port by a container vessel is 48.79 hours and it is 
considered slow double the time spent by a container vessel in Jebel Ali port. To summarize, Seaports are under a high 
competition due to its importance in the overall economy. Many seaports are under bankruptcy due to negative 
performance. Industrial Revolution is based on many factors including the availability of a port that is active on the 
routes of shipping companies. Since then, this paper has developed a hub and spoke optimization model that routes the 
traffic through Saudi ports rather than Jebel Ali port (one of the top 10 transit points in the world). 
 
4.2 Recommendations and Future Study 
This paper recommends the following: 
1- Motivating the container vessels to connect through Jeddah Islamic Port by offering a lower HFO rates.  
2- Allowing industrial and manufacturing firms to be located beside the port, to allow the assembly of units and 
re-export the assembled materials. 
3- Supporting the national shipping industry by routing their container vessels through SAJED port. 
4- Expanding the SAJED sea port. 
5- Re-innovating SAJED port. 
6- Benchmarking the Japanese sea ports, which is considered the fastest ports in the world?

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to examine and analyze the factors influencing students' choices of private universities in 
Saudi Arabia which include reputation, availability of academic programs, career opportunities, tuition fees, 
information sources and advertising, infrastructure and facilities, university location, student life programs, and family 
and friends' recommendations. The research uses primary data through a survey of 253 students at universities and high 
schools. Data were analyzed using multiple regression on Eviews software. The results of this study indicate that six 
factors have significant impact on the student's decision to choose a particular private university. The research revealed 
distinct decision making patterns among students based on age and gender. Younger students pay particular attention 
to university tuition fees, university facilities and the opinions of their family and friends. Undergraduates prioritize 
career prospects, tuition fees, and university reputation. In contrast, graduate students focus more on university 
infrastructure. Universities are advised to enhance their reputation by investing in infrastructure, improving the quality 
of teaching and research. This improvement can positively impact word of mouth reputation, which holds significant 
influence in the decision-making process, particularly when it comes to recommendations from family members and 
friends. This research contributes to the research on higher education in the Saudi context and provide practical 
implications for university administrators and policymakers.

1. Introduction
The Saudi Vision 2030, launched in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is an ambitious initiative aimed 
at transforming Saudi Arabia's future. A key objective is to diversify the economy and enhance citizens' quality of 
life, with a significant focus on advancing the education sector (Mohiuddin et al., 2023). In the United Nations (UN) 
Development Program's 2022 report, Saudi Arabia rose to the 35th position among 191 countries, a notable 
improvement from its previous rank of 40th (“UN Report Recognizes Progress Made in Saudi Education”, 2022). 
Additionally, the Global Competitiveness Report 2022 ranked Saudi Arabia third in total public expenditure on

identified factors. Additionally, it may uncover further factors within the specific context of Saudi Arabia, offering a 
more comprehensive understanding of the entire decision making process for students enrolling in private universities. 
 
5. Recommendations 
The study recommends offering valuable suggestions to the university administration for enhancing their appeal to 
potential students. Key factors influencing students' decision-making include university reputation, infrastructure, 
tuition costs, and the impact of peer and family opinions. Recognizing these priorities, universities should strategically 
highlight the quality of education and modern infrastructure to attract prospective students. Affordability is also 
essential, prompting administrations to plan providing a reasonable cost to alleviate students' financial concerns. 
 
Furthermore, creating a positive word-of-mouth reputation and maintaining a robust social media presence are key 
strategies for universities to increase their visibility and appeal. It is noteworthy that universities should look to carve 
a legacy among people through good teaching, research and community service which ultimately will lead to 
enrollment of diverse groups of students and a wide network of alumni groups. In summary, by focusing on these key 
factors, universities can better position themselves to attract a diverse pool of students and enhance their overall 
competitiveness in the education sector.

Abstract 
This study explores the potential of transforming Makkah into an intelligent city by integrating LoRa (long-range) 
technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance urban management and sustainability. The research is 
motivated by the need to address Makkah's unique challenges, particularly during the Hajj season, when the city 
experiences a significant influx of pilgrims. The study reviews the applicability of international standards, specifically 
the ITU-T Y.4903/L.1603 framework, and assesses the necessary technologies to implement these standards in 
Makkah effectively. A comprehensive framework is proposed focusing on deploying a network of IoT sensors across 
the city to monitor environmental and infrastructural parameters such as air quality, waste management, and water 
flow. These sensors will provide real-time data, enabling city officials to make informed decisions, optimize resource 
management, and respond swiftly to emerging issues. The study also emphasizes the importance of installing adequate 
LoRa gateways to ensure network stability, particularly in Makkah's mountainous terrain. The findings suggest that 
while Makkah has yet to fully implement smart city technologies, there is significant potential to expand these 
initiatives. Adopting the proposed framework and technologies will align Makkah with global intelligent city 
standards and set a precedent for other regional cities. The successful implementation of this strategy will enhance 
Makkah's competitiveness, sustainability, and resilience, contributing to the broader goals of Saudi Arabia's Vision 
2030.

Abstract 
The primary objective of the project was to digitalize the Corrosion Management (CM) system within the Asset 
Performance Management (APM) platform for oil and gas facilities, both offshore and onshore. The aim was to 
enhance process efficiency by reducing human intervention and error, and to provide a more robust and comprehensive 
data management system. The scope included the implementation of a new digital CM platform that integrates all 
recorded CM data, enabling direct and comprehensive analysis through predefined KPIs. This system is intended to 
monitor and evaluate the performance of corrosion controls continuously. The new CM solution was implemented on 
a digital platform that includes handheld devices programmed to interface with the existing computerized maintenance 
management system (SAP). Technicians use these devices to collect data directly from barcoded equipment at specific 
TAG locations. This method allows for immediate data entry and upload into the APM software, reducing the need 
for manual data recording and entry. The platform utilizes a series of check sheet templates that list necessary 
indicators, ensuring that all relevant data is captured accurately and consistently. The following are the categories of 
KPI used to ensure CM performance for Oil and Gas Facilities: Internal Corrosion Management: these KPIs defines 
the internal corrosion information and ensure reporting on timely manner, and External Corrosion: these KPIs defines 
the external corrosion information related to Cathodic Protection and Coating. The digitalization of the CM system 
has resulted in significant cost savings, approximately 127K USD annually, by reducing time spent on-site by 
contractors and staff, and minimizing paperwork. The reduction in manual data entry has also decreased the likelihood 
of errors compared to traditional paper-based methods. Furthermore, the system has improved the tracking of pending 
issues and concerns arising from site findings, facilitating more timely and effective responses. This digital CM 
solution is unique in its integration of handheld devices with existing maintenance systems, which has not been

Deep Learning Model-based Reinforcement Learning for 
Joint Distribution and Route Planning in the Supply Chain

awaje@kku.edu.sa 
Abstract 
With the increasing real-time demand in the internet era, especially dynamic requests for last-mile delivery, route 
planning is becoming more computationally expensive than ever before. Many supply chains (SCs) choose the joint 
distribution of multiple depots to reduce transportation costs and delivery times. However, providing real-time and 
high-quality solutions for such complex routing problems remains challenging. Current solution methods like 
mathematical programming and heuristics suffer from scalability issues and long computation times. In contrast, 
artificial intelligence, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), provides a general-purpose framework for 
sequential decision-making that has produced good results for many challenging real-life problems. However, 
applying DRL to route multiple vehicles is nontrivial, as the joint distribution requires an effective method that 
facilitates collaboration and communication among all agents while they carry out the delivery mission. In this 
research, a collaborative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach is proposed for routing 
multiple vehicles in the SC. The proposed MADRL model leverages the power of two frameworks, deep learning and 
reinforcement learning, to generate routing policies for all agents in real time. Experimental results show the ability 
of the proposed learning model to obtain fast and quality solutions for complex delivery problems. Furthermore, the 
generalization ability of MADRL is also validated by testing the well-trained model on different scale problems.

Abstract 
Date palm fibers (DPFs) are among the most prevalent natural fibers globally, yet significant quantities of date palm 
biomass waste are produced annually without adequate utilization. This biomass presents an opportunity to create 
cost-effective, eco-friendly materials that support industrial sustainability. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the 
performance variability of DPFs subjected to water treatment. The research focuses on the statistical analysis and 
mechanical properties of Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera) long fibers, specifically from Midrib, sourced from three 
distinct locations in Oman. The fibers are extracted from Date Palm Midrib (DPM), with fiber approximately 25 cm 
in length. Water treatments are applied: hot water. The study involves the variance in DPFs across different 
extraction locations and fiber types. Mechanical testing is conducted in accordance with ASTM standards to 
determine the tensile strengths of the treated and untreated fibers. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
is used to examine the microstructure of the fibers before and after treatment. The results of this research will assist to 
optimize the treatment processes, identify the most effective fiber types, and evaluate the impact of different 
locations in Oman on fiber performance.

Abstract 
This study aims to analyze the impact of severe weather on supply chains in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia, in order to 
develop a solution, by examining the weather patterns, road maintenance reports, vehicle traffic data, and customer 
survey results. Key findings reveal that the customers satisfaction rate was 67.7%, 38.7% of customers experienced 
delivery delays and 11% received damaged goods, with infrastructure issues, road closures and poor visibility 
beingprimary causes. Based on the findings, a conceptual framework is proposed for a real-time supply chain system 
aimed at mitigating these challenges. The system integrates dynamic routing algorithms, participatory hazard 
reporting, and predictive analytics to address logistical inefficiencies. Real-time weather and traffic data are processed 
to optimize delivery routes, while hazard reports submitted by drivers enhance situational awareness. Predictive 
analytics utilizes historical data to anticipate disruptions, enabling proactive decision-making. The system is designed 
to adapt to Jazan’s unique conditions but can be extended to other regions and user groups to improve driving 
efficiency during severe weather. While the system remains untested, its conceptual design addresses key logistical 
challenges highlighted by the data analysis. The study contributes to the field of supply chain resilience by presenting 
a scalable and adaptive framework that leverages real-time data, participatory inputs, and predictive tools to enhance 
operational efficiency. Future work will focus on prototype development and testing to evaluate its practical 
effectiveness and scalability.

1. Introduction
Supply chain resilience is a critical component of logistics field, huge companies and researchers increase the focus 
on promoting and adopting it. In unstable conditions its need is much more than the stable environment. Jazan, a 
region in southwestern Saudi Arabia, constitutes a suitable case study for these fluctuations. Jazan has fluctuating 
severe weather which makes it valuable case to test the effectiveness of available systems to risk management and 
increase resilience. With King Abdullah Economic City and the Port of Jazan, the region is one of the key industrial 
hubs in the country. Jazan boasts diverse geographical features, including islands, valleys, plains, and mountains, 
despite being one of the smallest regions in the Kingdom by area. These geographical characteristics present 
significant challenges to the efficiency of transportation and distribution operations.

However, implementing this framework will require collaboration between logistics providers, municipal authorities, 
and technology developers. Future studies should focus on piloting the system to validate its effectiveness and refine 
its features based on practical feedback. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The analysis of the challenges highlighted the significant disruptions caused by adverse weather, including delivery 
delays, product damage, and customer dissatisfaction. Through the evaluation of weather patterns, road maintenance 
reports, vehicle movement data, and customer surveys, the study identified key challenges facing transportation and 
logistics services, such as infrastructure issues, roads closure, and poor visibility. The statistical data shows a 
significant increase in reports of road-related issues during severe weather, coupled with the constant traffic in the 
region and the inconsistency of its weather patterns. These data-driven insights formed the foundation for designing a 
solution tailored to the unique conditions in Jazan.  
 
Furthermore, the research lays a strong foundation for future testing and development. While the proposed framework 
remains conceptual, it provides a scalable and adaptable model that can be refined for implementation and expanded 
to other regions or user groups.  
 
This study makes a unique contribution to the field of supply chain management by studying Jazan region challenges 
and presenting an integrative approach that combines real-time data, predictive analytics, and participatory reporting.

Abstract 
The Peruvian textile sector faces significant challenges, especially in optimizing operational efficiency in SMEs. 
These companies are key pillars in the economy, generating employment and contributing to GDP, but they suffer 
from production inefficiencies caused by inappropriate work designs and unproductive time. These problems limit 
their competitiveness in the global market and require urgent solutions. The research conducted sought to address 
these limitations by implementing Lean Manufacturing tools and an ergonomic approach, improving both productivity 
and working conditions. The findings showed that integrating these methodologies increased production efficiency by 
122%, reducing cycle times and improving operational consistency. Also achieved a reduction in batch defects and 
unscheduled breaks, which strengthened overall performance. The impact of this research is twofold: at academic 
level, it contributes to the development of models adapted to textile SMEs, and at socio-economic level, it promotes 
sustainability in a key sector of the Peruvian economy. Further research is needed on the scalability of these solutions 
in similar industries and to explore integration of digital tools to further optimize processes.

1. Introduction
The small and medium-sized textile industry (SMEs) plays a crucial role in the global economy, especially in regions 
such as Latin America and Peru. This sector is not only a driver of employment, but also contributes significantly to 
the gross domestic product (GDP) of these countries. In Latin America, textile SMEs account for approximately 70% 
of total output in the sector, underlining their importance in generating income and employment (Deepthi & Bansal, 
2022). In Peru, the textile industry has historically been a pillar of the economy, with a long tradition dating back to 
pre-Columbian civilizations. Textile production in Peru not only covers the manufacture of garments, but also the 
elaboration of high-quality products that are exported to international markets, which highlights the relevance of this 
sector in foreign trade (Vasconcelos et al., 2022). However, despite their importance, textile SMEs face numerous 
challenges that limit their growth and competitiveness in an increasingly demanding global market (Shahzad et al., 
2020).

industries and company sizes. The research provides a clear blueprint for similar companies facing operational 
inefficiencies and emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement and worker-centric approaches in industrial 
settings. 
 
The research's final observations suggest that while the implemented solutions significantly improved operational 
efficiency, there are still areas that warrant further investigation. For instance, the long-term sustainability of the 
ergonomic improvements should be monitored, particularly as production volumes increase. Future studies could 
explore the integration of digital tools, such as Industry 4.0 technologies, to further optimize production processes and 
enhance real-time monitoring of both efficiency and worker health. Moreover, the scalability of the proposed solutions 
in larger textile operations should be studied to evaluate their effectiveness across different company sizes. The 
findings from this study provide a solid foundation for future research aimed at refining and expanding the application 
of Lean and ergonomic principles in diverse manufacturing environments..

Abstract 
Multi-material 3D printing could be seen as a major step forward in manufacturing, as it is capable of making 
components with complex geometries and with the whole range of mechanical characteristics at the same time. In this 
project, an attempt was made to understand the viability of MMTAMMP for using in developing complex mechanical 
parts through the study of effects of layer thickness, infill density, and material selection on stress, strain, and weight. 
The study focused on three widely used materials: It has been used in Poly Lactic Acid (PLA), Acrylonitrile Butadiene 
Styrene (ABS), and Nylon. Through simulations done in MATLAB, the research established the extent to which 
various parameters of printing affect the mechanical characteristics and performance of the parts that are being printed. 
What the analysis showed me is that the most significant aspect of the structure, the layers, and the infill, is the ability 
to control how thick each layer should be and how dense they should be on the inside in order to achieve the best 
strength to flexibility to weight ratio. The values of stress and strain were proved to depend on the kind of the material 
and the conditions of printing, indicating the necessity of proper choice of the parameters. The outcome shows that to 
create performant parts for definite industries it is possible to fine-tune multi-material 3D printing. This research offers 
a useful framework for interdisciplinary research in the field of multi-material additive manufacturing, and practical 
knowledge on how these methods may be applied for continuing improvement of several contemporary production 
techniques.  
Keywords 
Multi-material 3D printing, PLA, ABS, Nylon, layer thickness, infill density, stress analysis, strain analysis, weight 
optimization, MATLAB simulation, additive manufacturing, mechanical properties. 
1. Introduction
There is a relatively new technique called Additive manufacturing, often referred to as 3D printing, which has changed 
the course of manufacturing industry and brought innovations in the way of making complex and fashion elements 
with stunning accuracy. Of these developments, it is possible to distinguish the multi-material 3D printing which 
enables the usage of the multiple materials in one part and during one build, which improves the utility of the resulting 
parts. This capability is highly used in mechanics where components need different characteristics such as high 
strength, flexibility and durability which cannot be met by one material type. The research proposal is titled as 
“Exploration of advanced multi material 3D printing methods for complex components for mechanical systems part 
manufacturing with an idea of realizing the potential of these techniques in manufacturing advanced mechanical parts 
for modern systems. 
The main aim of the project is to investigate and assess the feasibility of FDM, SLA, and SLS type multi-material 3D 
printing technologies for creating mechanical parts. The research will be centered on the modeling of the mechanical 
response of PLA, ABS, and Nylon materials and their variation as a result of changes in the printing parameters. In 
this project, MATLAB will be used from the design model itself to the end of the simulation where the effects of layer

The study also points towards the need for weight control in multi-material 3D printing especially in the light of the 
Nylon material that was the heaviest in the experiments carried out. Weight is directly proportional to the layer 
thickness and density and this, in turn, means that while weight can be bested while changing these properties, it is 
not easy to alter them while making sure that the structure of the component won’t be affected. The comparison of 
materials’ density shows how crucial is the decision of which material is better for the specific application when it is 
targeted at lightweighting, mechanical strength, or both. 
 
However, one gets a holistic view of the relationship between stress, strain, and weight once narrated in a scatter plot 
respecting to PLA material. This indicates that the optimal conditions, which yield the best results in various aspects 
of 3DP are often the worst results in other aspects, and it may be concluded that the optimization of 3DP involves the 
simultaneous consideration of several factors. The trends observed in the line plot for ABS stress versus infill density 
make it even clearer that there is a need to maintain infrastructure of the infill since while increasing the density 
strengthens the material it also puts extra strain on material that may cause failure in case it is not well managed. 
Overall, these papers develop important information to the progress of multi-material 3D printing and offer an exciting 
section for further study and exploration of enabling the maximum potential of this innovative industrial technology.   
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the investigation of multi-material 3D printing to create intricate mechanical parts has given experience 
to the authors regarding the dependence between material permutation, printing parameters, and the resultant 
mechanical properties of the created parts. The things which are laid out in the research deal with PLA, ABS, and 
Nylon and explain how the layer thickness has to be determined together with the infill density and proper combination 
of the material that will allow for a suitable balance of strength, flexibility, and weight. The simulations done with 
MATLAB showed that each of the material has its strength and their characteristics are highly sensitive to the print 
settings. Stress and strain show how much attention must be paid to the choice of parameters, as excessive internal 
stresses, or strain weaknesses, for example, can be especially prevalent at material interfaces. Further, the role of 
weight control in multi-material printing has been highlighted in the study where amendments in layer thickness and 
infill density lead to significant variations even in the component weight. Therefore, the findings of the present study 
can improve the knowledge of how multi-material 3D printing can be used to produce parts with enhanced 
performance for industrial applications. Some of the conclusions made in this study are valuable for enhancing the 
efficiency of iterative 3D prints, and the findings made in the course of this study open up avenues for further research 
on novel material pairings and even higher levels of 3D printing. In totality, this research suggests that multi-material 
3D printing has a great capability to change or enhance the current manufacturing capacity, due to flexibility provided 
by this technology, on condition that its design and process improvement are well planned.

Abstract 
People who are blind face significant difficulties in engaging with their surroundings, as they are unable to visually 
see their world. However, they compensate for this limitation by relying on their remaining senses. The importance 
of having one's independence in today's highly interconnected society is beyond debate. People who are blind or have 
other visual impairments face the most significant challenges in their attempts to participate in social activities. They 
have difficulties identifying people and objects and receiving proper information. Those impaired people face 
significant challenges and increased risks when engaging in routine activities such as navigating around barriers, 
crossing the street, or taking public transit. Therefore, the objective of this study is to design and manufacture an 
intelligence system that allows blind and visually impaired people to navigate with ease using advanced technology. 
The proposed smart system consists of eyeglasses with cameras to identify people and a hand-held device with 
multiple sensors to detect nearby obstacles. This device works together to provide real-time assistance to help blind

Abstract 
This paper proposes the integration of the adjustability concept when designing for humans into an existing body-
powered prosthetic hand especially designed for the Symbrachydactyly abnormality population. Adjustability would 
accommodate a range of changes in hand size resulting from hand growth, especially at early stages of age. This 
accommodation would reduce frequent prosthetic hand changes and associated burdens. The proposed design is based 
on splitting the palm of an existing design by e-NABLE and using three connecting pieces of three different sizes to 
join the split palm. The connecting pieces sizes are based on the sizing guide by Unlimbited Phoenix to allow for 
changing the prosthetic hand size. The developed design must be inspected for functionality and comfort, while 
satisfying adjustability requirements due to hand size increases. The integration of adjustability into the design of a 
body-powered prosthetic hand for the Symbrachydactyly population would characterize a significant advancement in 
personalized prosthetic solutions. The proposed design exemplifies a thoughtful engineering solution tailored to meet 
the unique needs of its users. This research emphasizes the importance of user-centered design in prosthetic 
development, paving the way for more adaptable and sustainable solutions that empower individuals with limb 
differences to lead more active and fulfilling lives.

1. Introduction
Congenital upper limb anomalies are prevalent worldwide.  Additionally, around 2 million people worldwide live with 
upper limb amputations due to various causes such as accidents, diseases, and military conflicts. According to the 
World Health Organization, approximately 1 in 1,000 babies are born with hand deformities. Such a prevalence 
emphasizes the need for advanced prosthetics. The human hand is one of the most significant and complex human 
organs and functionally essential for work and leisure. It functionally interfaces with the surrounding environment 
more than any other anatomical unit. Full or partial loss of functionality of a hand or both hands reduces the capability 
of performing work and other daily activities, leading to lower quality of life and job loss. 
One type of partial hand functionality loss is called brachydactyly which is a birth defect resulting in short fingers. A 
subgroup of those with this defect have what is called Symbrachydactyly. This is a rare congenital hand condition 
with a morbidity of 1 out of 32,000 births. This condition is where the hand fingers are abnormally short and conjoined. 
Symbrachydactyly has three levels of severity: 1) short finger symbrachydactyly, 2) monodactylous/bidactylous 
symbrachydactyly, and 3) adactylous/peromelic symbrachydactyly. 
Scientists in the field of prosthetics have been actively developing substitutes for lost hands. These substitutes can 
substitute functionally and cosmetically original natural hands. Those substitutes may restore some natural hands’

Having developed the adjustable design, it should be examined for functionality and comfort as the original design. 
In addition, it should satisfy the adjustability requirements due to the increase in hand size. As part of the testing 
methodology, objective and subjective assessment should be undertaken to validate that the proposed design is 
functional as expected.  
 
3. Conclusion  
The integration of adjustability into the design of a body-powered prosthetic hand for the Symbrachydactyly 
population would characterize a significant advancement in personalized prosthetic solutions. By accommodating 
variations in hand size that occur during critical growth phases, this innovative approach would alleviate the logistical 
and emotional burdens associated with frequent prosthetic changes. The proposed design exemplifies a thoughtful 
engineering solution tailored to meet the unique needs of its users. Future work should focus on rigorous testing to 
ensure that the design meets essential functionality and comfort standards while fulfilling its adjustability 
requirements. This research emphasizes the importance of user-centered design in prosthetic development, paving the 
way for more adaptable and sustainable solutions that empower individuals with limb differences to lead more active 
and fulfilling lives. Ultimately, the success of this initiative could serve as a proposal for future prosthetic designs

the oil and gas industry, with a focus of a leading oil and gas company in Oman as a case study. The applied technique 
is an in-depth structured interview for eleven participants with the use of thematic analysis. The main themes were 
generated from the interviews are IT Technical Issues, Unstructured and Unclear Onboarding, Crating Digital Platform 
for Onboarding, Creating a Standardized Checklist, Employee Onboarding Program at the selected organization as a 
case study, Employee Onboarding Experience, Best Toolset and Enablers for Effective Onboarding Process, 
Importance of Data-oriented Techniques, Key Factors for Effective LSS Project. Most of the recent joiners agreed 
that they have faced IT and technical issues during their onboarding process and had challenges of the unstructured 
onboarding processes that impacted on their satisfaction. The opportunities they have initiated are by creating a digital 
platform specialized for the onboarding process as well as creating a standardized checklist for the new hires across 
the organization. Notable lack of research was noticed regarding employee onboarding processes in the context of oil 
and gas sector in Oman. Additionally, although the adaption of Lean Methodology in leading companies in the oil and 
gas industry in Oman, several new employees were observed are encountering onboarding challenges impacting their 
productivity and performance. The significance of this research is mainly for four stakeholders, including: Employees, 
oil and gas companies, government and its national strategies, and academia.

1. Introduction
Oil and gas sector is a dynamic industry and plays a vital role of the world’s countries economy and their GDP, 
especially Sultanate of Oman (Alshubiri, Tawfik, & Jamil, 2020). According to Al Aufi (2024), gas and oil accounted 
of 72 percent of the country’s GDP (Al Aufi ,2024). Additionally, the oil and gas sector is one of the heaviest industries 
when it comes to strict safety rules and work regulations. Thus, it is crucial to adapt best practices to ensure high 
efficiency and productivity. 
According to Meyer and Allen (1988), one of the important factors that plays a big role in raising the productivity of 
oil and gas organizations is adapting effective strategies in employee onboarding processes.  Enhancing these 
processes can lead to improving the quality of employee’s satisfaction, productivity, confidence, and increase 
performance (Meyer & Allen, 1988). Employees’ onboarding defined as “A process through which new employees 
move from being organizational outsiders to becoming organizational insiders” (T. N. Bauer & Erdogan, 2011b). It is 
important to equip the newcomers to the oil and gas industry with the right tools, material, provide them with training 
session and involve them with ongoing coaching process (Caldwell & Peters, 2018).

new hire at the organization. Lastly, is the Customers, who will receive the outputs from this whole process. This is a 
useful tool that would help the onboarding specialists to clearly define the onboarding process including the key 
stakeholders, important tools to be readily available and all the steps.  
 
6. Conclusion 
All in all, this research deeply investigates challenges and opportunities for onboarding processes of oil and gas new 
hires. The results indicate that most of newcomers are struggling with IT technical issues and issues related to 
unstructured onboarding including difficulties in understanding the governance and the culture of their respective 
departments, as The selected organization for the case study is currently going into new organizational structure. From 
the opportunity’s aspect, new joiners suggested to create specialized digital tools for the newcomers that helps them 
to speed their onboarding process, in addition to create a standardized checklist across the organization.  
 
For the second research question, there were multiple onboarding process’s best practices investigated though deep 
analysis such as, creating automated platform with the use of tech-solutions, building informal peer-to-peer 
communities using social media and utilizing Employee Journey Mapping tool to visualize the whole journey and 
encourage further discussions on the enhancement of onboarding processes. By utilizing these tools, employee 
satisfaction will increase, they will easily get integrated into the organization, and ultimately, increased their 
productivity.

Abstract 
This work aimed to assess an industrial workspace’ sustainability and employees’ well-being. A comprehensive 
approach was adopted, including data collection, field audits, and detailed measurements of indoor environmental 
quality—focusing on thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort, and indoor air quality. Employee feedback was also 
gathered through surveys to provide subjective assessments of office conditions. The results revealed the need for 
adjustments to improve thermal comfort, where thermostat settings and airflow required modification. Visual comfort 
was generally satisfactory, though task lighting was recommended in selected zones. Acoustic discomfort was 
identified as a major issue across the office, necessitating noise awareness initiatives and using sound-absorbing 
materials. Furthermore, indoor air quality concerns were raised in several zones, with recommendations including a 
fresh air ventilator, occupant density reduction, and rigorous maintenance implementation to prevent air contaminants. 
Energy performance assessments conducted between October and November 2022 identified substantial opportunities 
for energy conservation. Recommendations included installing timers for air conditioning systems, lighting, and office 
equipment, along with optimizing chiller and pump operation schedules. Implementing these measures could result in 
annual energy savings of 152,282 kWh, cost savings of 4240 OMR, and a reduction of 163.8 tons of CO2 emissions. 
Additional recommendations include establishing a sustainability team, installing separate utility meters for more 
accurate monitoring, and deploying photovoltaic systems for energy generation. These strategies aim to enhance the 
office’s sustainability without compromising occupant well-being, aligning with both current and future office design 
goals.

Abstract 
Preventive Maintenance (PM) is an important activity that uses the systematic inspection, detection, diagnosis and 
correction before the incipient failures occurrence in order to keep equipment in a satisfactory operational state. The 
study focused on the processing plant that run continuously under harsh operation conditions based on the relief valves 
data. This paper developed a model to improve the preventive maintenance performance. The model developed based 
on availability and maintainability to measure PM performance. The model tested by two scenarios in order to 
determine the probability of failure at normal operation. The first of scenario was associated with the system failed 
for corrective maintenance. The second scenario was associated with the system down for preventive maintenance. 
The findings showed that the model provided information as the most significant characteristic to prolong the life time 
of equipment / system and improve preventive maintenance performance. Therefore, the study concluded that 
improvement of preventive maintenance performance for any processing plant has become essential to reduce the 
probability of failure resulting from corrective maintenance and improve the reliability of system. The model could 
support for any processing plant in terms of the maintenance cost effectiveness, the production losses and the system 
sustainability.

1. Introduction
Preventive maintenance (PM) is an important activity for any processing plant run under the harsh operation 
conditions. PM normally accounts a significant contribution to keep facilities in a satisfactory operational state. There 
are many objectives of performing PM, which include an increase in the life time of equipment, increase in the 
productivity, decrease in the production losses due to the totally shutdown resulting from the overall maintenance, 
reduction in the maintenance cost and mitigation in the risk. In addition, PM can contribute in improving the reliability 
of certain equipment or the system performance.

5. Conclusions  
The PM activities has become an essential to achieve sustainability for any a processing plant run continuously under 
operational harsh conditions to avoid implementation of the CM resulting from the unexpected failures, which can 
cause the effects on the assets, safety, and the environment. In this paper, Makrov model used as an effective tool to 
determine the optimum time of the PM activities of system. This will save time and efforts spent to return the RVs to 
the normal operation conditions. The system may undergo to the CM activities when the Pf is higher than Pd. This 
means that the CM activities manages based on the policy ""run-to-failure"". Therefore, the PM activities should be 
executed once every 600 days to avoid the fluctuation of operation risk after the predetermined period. In general,

when the Pd equal or more than the Pf, it indicates that the RVs in a need to perform the PM activities at a certain 
time. The results of the improvement of PM performance using Markov model showed that can be ensured also the 
decrease of production losses and maintenance costs due to the RVs maintenance to an acceptable level and enhanced 
the reliability of system. The proposed study can be applied to the critical equipment that cannot be maintained during 
the normal operation state of unit/system at any an industrial environment. Consequently, a suggestion for future 
research is the implementation of the Markov model on the rotating critical equipment that cannot be maintained 
during the normal operation state applications, it is necessary to determine the model parameters of a particular system 
and to take the components cost into account based on the real data of maintenance records in order to lead to a 
sustainable refinement for all critical equipment using Markov model.

Abstract 
This paper examines the integration of rotor sail technology on the Sohar Max, a large ore carrier operated by Asyad 
Shipping, as part of Oman’s broader sustainability goals outlined in Vision 2040. The research focuses on evaluating 
the impact of rotor sails on fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and operational challenges within Oman’s maritime 
sector. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative data from fuel consumption and emissions 
reports with qualitative insights from key industry stakeholders. Results show that the adoption of rotor sails can lead 
to significant fuel savings—up to 30%—and substantial reductions in carbon emissions, making it a promising 
solution for enhancing the environmental performance of the maritime industry. However, high upfront costs, the need 
for structural modifications, and crew training requirements present challenges that must be addressed for successful 
implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on wind-assisted propulsion and offers 
practical recommendations for integrating rotor sail technology into Oman’s shipping fleet.

• 
Technological Refinements: The current rotor sail system is effective, but technological improvements, such 
as the development of an automated sail adjustment system, could further enhance its flexibility and 
performance. These refinements could allow the rotor sails to adjust automatically to changing wind 
directions and intensities, further increasing fuel savings and reducing the need for manual intervention. 
• 
Maintenance Scheduling: One area of potential cost savings lies in the development of a more efficient 
maintenance schedule for the rotor sails. By implementing a predictive maintenance system that monitors the 
condition of the sails in real-time, Asyad Shipping could reduce downtime and maintenance costs, potentially 
extending the lifespan of the sails by 15-20%. This would further reduce operational costs and improve ROI. 
• 
Electrical upgrades, including the installation of additional Air Circuit Breaker (ACB) on the vessel’s main 
switchboard, are necessary to manage the additional electrical load from the rotor sails. These modifications, 
along with the addition of cable tubes on deck, allow for proper integration of the rotor sails into the vessel’s 
electrical systems. 
• 
Safety systems have also been upgraded, including the addition of a firefighting system dedicated to the rotor 
sails. This was a critical modification, as the original design did not include fire protection, raising safety 
concerns that have since been addressed through the installation of this system. 
• 
Mooring modifications were made to accommodate the size and position of the rotor sails. Additional 
bollards and rollers were installed to ensure safe mooring operations. This step was essential, considering 
that the rotor sails are positioned on the port side of the vessel, potentially interfering with standard mooring 
procedures. 
• 
Wind Route Optimization: Optimizing routes to take advantage of prevailing wind conditions could further 
enhance fuel savings. By using wind forecasting tools, routes could be dynamically adjusted to maximize 
wind-assisted propulsion, leading to an additional 5-15% reduction in fuel consumption depending on voyage 
length and wind conditions (van der Kolk et al. 2019). 
 
5.4 Validation 
To validate the results, comparative data were gathered from similar vessels using rotor sail technology, such as the 
M/V Afros and the TR Lady, both of which reported fuel savings in the range of 10-12.5%. The results from the Sohar 
Max, showing savings of 20-30%, were found to be consistent with these vessels but exceeded expectations due to 
optimal wind conditions and longer voyage routes. 
 
A statistical hypothesis test using a paired t-test was conducted to validate the differences in fuel consumption and 
emissions before and after the installation of rotor sails. The p-value of 0.03 indicates that the observed differences 
are statistically significant, confirming that rotor sails have had a measurable impact on fuel efficiency and emissions 
reduction on the Sohar Max. Additionally, the validation process involved cross-referencing the Sohar Max data with 
other industry reports to ensure that the results were not an anomaly and reflected broader industry trends. 
 
The validation of these results confirms the reliability of rotor sails as a sustainable technology for the maritime sector, 
supporting Asyad Shipping’s long-term strategy for reducing its environmental footprint and achieving compliance 
with international maritime regulations. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
This research has successfully achieved its primary objective of evaluating the effectiveness of rotor sail technology 
in enhancing the sustainability and operational efficiency of the Sohar Max, an ore carrier operated by Asyad Shipping. 
Through a comprehensive mixed-methods approach, the study has demonstrated that rotor sails offer substantial 
benefits in terms of fuel savings, emissions reduction, and economic feasibility, making them a promising solution for 
sustainable maritime operations in Oman. This research also highlights the necessary structural and operational 
adjustments, such as hull reinforcement and electrical system modifications, required to safely implement rotor sail 
technology. These improvements are critical not only for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the vessel but 
also for maximizing the environmental benefits of the technology. 
 
The specific objectives of the research were met as follows: 
 
• 
Operational Efficiency Improvements: The study found a 25-30% reduction in fuel consumption on the  
Sohar Max, clearly demonstrating that rotor sails significantly enhance operational efficiency. This aligns 
with the research objective to assess the impact of rotor sails on fuel consumption.

• 
Environmental Benefits: A substantial 25% reduction in CO2 and NOx emissions was observed, contributing 
to international regulatory compliance and Oman’s Vision 2040 sustainability goals. This fulfils the objective 
of evaluating environmental improvements through rotor sails. 
• 
Economic Viability: A detailed cost-benefit analysis revealed that the return on investment (ROI) for rotor 
sails could be realized within 10-15 years, making them a financially viable solution. The reduction in fuel 
costs further supports the economic case for broader adoption of this technology. 
• 
Operational Challenges: The research identified key challenges, such as crew training and maintenance 
requirements, while also proposing potential improvements to optimize rotor sail performance. This meets 
the objective of identifying and addressing operational hurdles associated with rotor sail implementation. 
• 
Recommendations for Wider Implementation: Based on the findings, the study provides actionable 
recommendations for optimizing rotor sail technology in Oman’s maritime sector, supporting broader 
sustainability goals and compliance with international maritime standards. 
 
The unique contribution of this research lies in its specific focus on Oman’s shipping industry, providing critical 
insights into the application of rotor sail technology in a Middle Eastern context. While most previous studies have 
focused on European waters, this research addresses a gap by evaluating rotor sails in the Arabian Sea, where wind 
conditions and regulatory environments differ significantly. Furthermore, the use of the Sohar Max as a case study 
offers valuable data for other vessels in Oman’s fleet, highlighting the scalability and adaptability of rotor sails for 
long-haul routes in the region. 
 
Future research could focus on the long-term performance of rotor sails under different environmental conditions, 
including the effects of wear, extreme weather, and maintenance costs. Additionally, studies could explore the 
integration of rotor sails with other green technologies like air lubrication and solar panels to maximize emissions 
reduction. The impact on ship manoeuvrability is another area for future investigation, particularly how rotor sails 
affect docking, emergency stops, and navigation in congested ports. Further research should also assess the economic 
feasibility of rotor sails across various vessel types and routes to understand the broader potential for cost savings and 
emissions reduction. 
 
Given evolving environmental regulations, research should evaluate how rotor sails can ensure compliance with 
stricter emissions standards, and whether policy incentives might encourage adoption. The level of crew training and 
the role of automation in rotor sail operation are additional areas to examine for efficiency improvements. A life cycle 
analysis of rotor sail technology would provide a comprehensive assessment of its environmental impact from 
manufacturing to decommissioning. Lastly, exploring the retrofitting of older vessels with rotor sails could offer 
insights into extending the lifespan of existing fleets while meeting sustainability goals. 
 
In conclusion, this research contributes to both the global discourse on sustainable shipping and Oman’s national 
objectives, demonstrating that rotor sails are not only a viable solution for reducing environmental impact but also an 
economically sound investment for the future of maritime transportation. By addressing the unique challenges and 
opportunities of rotor sails in Oman, this study lays the groundwork for further innovation and adoption of wind-
assisted propulsion technologies across the region.

Abstract 
The sustainability of the hydrogen economy within Oman is achieved through a multi-criteria decision-making 
(MCDM) approach that targets the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The methodology involves five major 
criteria, that are localization potential, technical feasibility, energy security, environmental impact, and economic 
impact. It ensures a detailed analysis of the strategic options of Oman for the development of hydrogen. Three 
alternatives have been considered gradual development, a balanced approach, and rapid scaling. The assessment 
of each of the strategies has been done against the given criterion to identify the best path forward. Energy security 
and economic impact have been given more priority in the analysis, showing the strategic focus of Oman on the 
improvement of energy independence and economic diversification. The results show that the balanced approach, 
involving different assertive targets of growth along with the growth of the supporting ecosystem, is the most 
sustainable method for the hydrogen economy of Oman. This approach ensures economic development while 
boosting technical advancements and sustainability in the long run. However, rapid scaling has been ranked at the 
second position, showing some support for an aggressive strategy, targeted at the capitalization on rising 
opportunities of the global hydrogen market. On contrary to this, the gradual development approach has got the 
lowest ranking, showing the preference of stakeholders to have a fast development. The research targets the 
significance of following an adaptable and nuanced strategy balancing rapid economic development with 
localization objectives of the country, technical feasibility, and environmental sustainability.

development with ecosystem development. This is in alignment with the “Oman Green Hydrogen Strategy May 
2024”, targeting both wider industrial growth and production targets. However, the second-ranking of the Rapid 
Scaling approach (0.394) shows support for an aggressive strategy of expansion. The Gradual Development 
approach has got lower rank of 0.195, which shows that stakeholders are at risk of moving slowly within the 
changing industry. These results imply that the current balanced strategy of Oman is in alignment with the 
sustainability considerations. However, the ranking of the Rapid Scaling approach shows the opportunities to 
speed up the growth in specific areas, specifically where Oman has competitive benefits. 
 
4.6 Proposed Improvements  
Moving forward, policymakers and industry leaders should consider: 
• 
Regularly reassessing the balance between rapid scaling and ecosystem development as the global 
hydrogen market evolves. 
• 
Investing heavily in technical capabilities and localization efforts to improve long-term sustainability. 
• 
Identifying specific areas where rapid scaling could provide significant economic or strategic advantages. 
• 
Continuing to monitor and mitigate environmental impacts to ensure long-term sustainability. 
This AHP analysis provides a structured framework for decision-making, but it should be complemented with 
ongoing market research, stakeholder consultations, and flexibility to adapt to the changing global energy 
landscape. 
 
5 Conclusion  
The AHP analysis shows that such criteria have been given more priority which is important for the hydrogen 
economy of Oman, with energy security (0.217) and economic impact (0.274). This shows the strategic objective 
of Oman to decrease its dependency on oil while keeping its future secure. The lower ranking of 0.191 on the 
environmental impact shows that while there are some major environmental concerns, still security and economic 
factors are more alarming for Oman. The criterion of technical feasibility got a weight of 0.100 which is the lowest 
one, mainly because of the expectation that technological challenges can be handled with the maturity of industry. 
Among the strategic alternatives, the balanced approach scored 0.428, the most suitable one. It was followed by 
the rapid scaling option which is 0.392 and then the gradual development strategy to be 0180. It shows that it did 
not make advancements that were required in the advancing industry. The analysis facilitates the current strategy 
of Oman but shows that there can be opportunities to speed up the development, without making any compromise 
on the long-term objectives of sustainability.

Abstract 
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are strategic maneuvers that have long been intertwined with the hospitality sector, 
involving the asset consolidation among hotel groups through various partnerships. While extensive research has 
focused on applying data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess hotel efficiency, the application of DEA to hotel 
M&A has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce an inverse DEA (IDEA)-based methodology to evaluate 
optimal gains from pairwise consolidations among hotels. This approach effectively identifies all productive post-
merger hotels, i.e., those mergers with substantial potential for generating resource gains. The relevance of our 
proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study of 58 hotels in the Sultanate of Oman. A particularly 
striking finding is that some productive post-merger combinations implicate only strongly efficient hotels. 
Individually, these hotels do not require savings, yet when merged, they exhibit significant savings potential, 
demonstrating that sustainable resource management can be achieved through strategic consolidations. Specifically, 
our results show that potential post-merger gains can reach 82.81% in bed capacity, 82.44% in room count, 87.91% 
in workforce size, and 86.75% in employee salaries. These figures are over four times the savings required for 
individual inefficient hotels. These insights underscore the potential of mergers not only within hospitality but across 
various resource-intensive industries to drive sustainable development by enhancing operational efficiency, reducing 
resource consumption, and informing policy that supports sustainable practices through strategic partnerships.

Abstract 
Conventional methods for testing non-structural concrete properties, particularly compressive strength, are often 
hindered by inefficiencies, variability, and time-consuming processes. These approaches require extensive manual 
labor and physical testing, contributing to significant resource consumption and waste. In response to growing 
demands for more sustainable construction practices, this study introduces advanced machine learning models to 
predict concrete properties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By employing Decision Trees, Artificial Neural 
Networks, and Random Forest Regressors, predictive models were trained on a large, diverse dataset of concrete 
mixes. These models optimize the prediction of compressive strength, reducing the time and cost associated with 
traditional testing techniques while improving the precision of predictions. Furthermore, the integration of machine 
learning reduces material waste by predicting optimal concrete compositions, minimizing the use of raw materials like 
cement, a major contributor to global CO₂ emissions. A web-based tool was developed to allow civil engineers and 
construction professionals to input concrete compositions and receive real-time strength predictions, ensuring better 
quality control, resource efficiency, and environmental sustainability in construction projects. This innovative 
approach highlights the potential of machine learning not only to enhance the accuracy and speed of concrete testing 
but also to reduce the environmental impact of construction activities. Ultimately, this project contributes to more 
sustainable and cost-effective solutions for the construction industry.

Abstract 
Oman aspires to source up to 39% of its power grid from renewable energy by 2040. One way to meet this target is to 
electrify off-grid locations like Al Hallaniyat island. This study aims to assess the viability of implementing a hybrid 
system of renewable energy technologies with the existing diesel generators from technical and economic perspectives. 
It navigates the assessment by analyzing actual load data of Al Hallaniyat Island and by determining the optimum 
renewable energy technologies to be used, which are found to be a solar PV system and an onshore wind turbine. Both 
technologies are integrated with a battery system and the existing diesel generators to deliver 2,413,220 kWh yearly. 
HOMER Pro software is used to design the most beneficial hybrid system. The simulation recommends power 
capacities of 398 kW for the solar system, 580 kW for the wind turbine, 900 kWh for the battery system, and 600 kW 
for the diesel generators. The hybrid system lowers the dependency on diesel consumption by approximately 73%, 
achieving over 79% of renewable energy penetration. With a capital cost of $1.17M and annual operation cost of 
$193,103, the proposed system offers a net present cost of $ 3.99M, payback period of just 4.3 years, and most 
importantly competitive levelized cost of energy of 0.113 $/kWh. In addition, this hybrid system significantly reduces 
the annual greenhouse gases emissions from 2,124,292 kg CO2e to only 580,678 kg CO2e. Overall, the study 
demonstrates the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of such hybrid systems.

Abstract 
A contemporary business concept that has become popular is cloud computing (CC), which gives consumers unlimited 
access to virtual resources. This paradigm provides facilities for virtual machines (VMs) and data centers. 
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is one of the several service models. The secret to improving data center efficiency 
and lowering energy usage is the effective use and administration of the resources offered by these services. Because 
of the variety and computational complexity of this activity, effective task scheduling—which moves cloud jobs onto 
virtual machines (VMs)—is essential. To enhance this process, meta-heuristic techniques are frequently applied. This 
research offers a new adaptive elitism-based genetic algorithm (AGA-E), which integrates elitism with conditional 
parameter adjustment to increase convergence speed and solution quality. The conditional parameter tuning technique 
constantly modifies the algorithm's parameters in response to population diversity and fitness levels, whereas the elitist 
method maintains the best-performing solution over successive generations. The results of the proposed algorithm 
were compared with traditional approaches, including Min-Min, Max-Min, Adaptive Incremental GA (AIGA), and 
Standard GA (SGA). Experimental evaluations conducted on Amazon EC2 demonstrated that the proposed approach 
outperforms these existing methods regarding task completion time, resource utilization, and convergence

5. Conclusion  
During task scheduling in a cloud environment, time consumption is directly related to financial cost to users and 
energy consumption. Therefore, proper resource allocation is imperative to reduce the makespan in processing task 
batches. GA and other biologically motivated techniques, which effectively solve NP-complete problems, often suffer 
from slow convergence when applied to high-dimensional data. To face these difficulties, an AGA-E technique is 
proposed for large-scale task scheduling in cloud environments, reducing the makespan and computational time. The 
method adopts a conditional approach to selecting and tuning parameters, which allows efficient and optimal 
allocation to multiple tasks with low computational overhead. The task scheduling problem is framed as an objective 
optimization challenge, in which the number of tasks defines the complexity of the problem. Experiments show that 
AGA-E outperforms traditional scheduling methods such as Min-Min, Max-Min, AIGA, and SGA in sophisticated 
large task volumes and provides more efficient solutions in less computational time.  
 
Future research will seek to develop an advanced mathematical model to understand the complexities of task 
scheduling on IaaS platforms, incorporating task dependencies and dynamic variations. In addition, a detailed study 
of AGA-E will examine other objectives, such as energy consumption and resource utilization, as well as multi-
objective optimization scenarios.

Abstract 
Any country's economy depends on effective logistics to maintain the seamless flow of information and products that 
support commerce and development. This paper aims to review the related literature to identify the research gaps and 
potential research directions in this area which helps to formulate a logistics problem at the national level. This 
research explores the macro and microeconomic factors that affect a country to shape a nation’s logistics environment 
through the use of systems dynamics modeling (SDM). The study combines macro factors like GDP, FDI and 
infrastructure development with micro factors like inventory management practices, warehouse capacity and 
transportation costs. This study will allow decision-makers to make valuable decisions in logistic investments and 
policymaking.

1. Introduction
1.1 Importance of Logistics for a Country
Efficient transportation of products is the keystone of every healthy economy (Pyra,2024). A country's logistics system 
functions as the unseen engine driving commerce, industry, and eventually prosperity from raw materials to completed
goods regulations, infrastructure development, and communication networks (Lee et al., 2017). Transport sector
companies' financial conditions are affected by shifts in macroeconomic indices including GDP, PMI, and IFO indexes 
(Wilimowska et al., 2020).
Retailers' investment choices are influenced by (Pyra, 2024; Zhu et al., 2024). Well-oiled logistics are even more 
important in today's networked world when just-in-time production and global supply chains rule. Transportation 
delays or storage problems may cause a chain reaction that affects anything from consumer pricing to a country's 
economic competitiveness. 
In many different industries, the significance of logistical operations has been increasing. To increase a 
country’s productivity and competitiveness, logistics helps to improve current production and distribution processes 
with the same resources via management strategies (Martí et al., 2014). The transport system, which links many 
operations, is an essential component of the logistics chain. A third of the expenditures associated with logistics are 
related to transportation, and the transportation system significantly impacts the effectiveness of the logistics system. 
From manufacture to delivery to the end user and back, shipping is required at every stage of the manufacturing 
process. Indeed, the most advantage may only be obtained by carefully combining each item (Xuan et al., 2023).

Abstract 
 
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in disaster search and rescue operations has become increasingly 
prevalent due to their potential to quickly and effectively search for missing persons using onboard sensors and 
cameras. This study addresses the problem of routing a UAV to search a designated area following an emergency call 
reporting a missing person. The objective is to minimize the expected time to locate the individual. To achieve this, 
the search area is divided into grids, each representing the area the UAV can scan in a single pass from a specific 
altitude. Each grid is assigned a probability of containing the target based on geographic features such as mountains, 
roads, plains, and the last known location of the missing person. We developed a mathematical programming 
formulation for the problem, which was implemented in IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. However, our tests 
revealed that solving the problem using this method was not feasible within reasonable time limits due to the problem's 
size and its exponential growth as the target region expands. Consequently, we developed several alternative 
construction algorithms. The solutions obtained from these algorithms were further improved using a tabu search 
algorithm. These algorithms were evaluated across various test instances for solution quality and computational 
efficiency. The results demonstrate that the developed algorithms significantly reduced the time required to solve the 
problem and improved the effectiveness of UAVs in disaster search and rescue missions. Additionally, we conducted 
a case study in Oman focused on locating individuals missing while hiking. This study presents a novel and practical 
approach for UAV routing in search and rescue operations and provides a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become essential for handling tasks such as Question-Answering 
(QA). This is particularly true in domains that require high accuracy, like legal document analysis. This study evaluates 
the performance of the ELECTRA model in QA tasks by testing it on both Wikipedia-based and legal contract datasets, 
including the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD). An adversarial attack known as a universal adversarial 
trigger was then introduced. This trigger is designed to test the robustness of the ELECTRA model by introducing 
small perturbations that aim to confuse the model into making incorrect predictions. Our results show that the 
adversarial trigger reduces the model’s performance by more than 10% on the well-known SQuAD dataset. This drop 
in accuracy highlights the vulnerability of the model to adversarial manipulation. On the legal contract dataset, 
specifically CUAD, we achieved a performance improvement of over 12% after fine-tuning the model with targeted 
optimizations. These optimizations included adjusting the model’s hyperparameters and modifying the dataset to 
reduce ambiguity in question phrasing. These findings indicate that while ELECTRA performs well on general 
datasets, it struggles with the intricacies of legal texts. However, with specific optimizations and adjustments, the 
model can become more effective in legal document analysis.

5.4 Comparative Performance Across CUAD Variants 
Using Case 3 modification, the model was then tested on Filtered CUAD and CUAD QA, two variants of the CUAD 
dataset. The Filtered CUAD dataset excludes older contracts and focuses on more recent legal agreements, while 
CUAD QA simplifies the questions to match the labels directly. As shown in Table 4, the model’s performance on 
modified versions of these datasets improved on the original variants, though the gains were not as dramatic as those 
seen on the original CUAD dataset. The Filtered CUAD dataset yielded an EM score of 51.7% and an F1 score of 
62.7%, an improvement over the original CUAD dataset. This is likely due to the removal of outdated contract formats, 
which simplified the task for the model.

The CUAD QA dataset, which simplifies the questions by reducing them to the form of labels, resulted in the lowest 
initial performance. The EM score was 18.3% and the F1 score was 28.1%. However, after applying the lowercasing 
modifications, the scores improved slightly to 20.0% for EM and 29.6% for F1. This suggests that the simplified question 
format in CUAD QA does not significantly help the model without additional improvements, such as better case matching 
and tokenization strategies. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Work 
In this study, the performance of the ELECTRA model was evaluated on several Question-Answering (QA) datasets, 
including both general-purpose datasets like SQuAD and domain-specific legal contract datasets like CUAD. The 
results highlighted the model’s ability to handle standard QA tasks effectively but also revealed significant challenges 
when it was applied to legal documents. The performance on the CUAD dataset demonstrated the complexities 
involved in analyzing real-world legal contracts, where the model achieved an Exact Match (EM) score of 30.8% and 
an F1 score of 44.2%. A universal adversarial trigger was introduced to further stress-test the model, which resulted 
in a performance degradation of approximately 10% on the SQuAD dataset. This underscores the model’s 
vulnerability to adversarial inputs, which exploit weaknesses in its token selection process. Several improvements 
were explored to enhance the model’s accuracy. Notably, lowercasing all input text led to significant improvements, 
522","Proceedings of the 2nd GCC International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

with a 20% increase in the EM score and a 12.2% increase in the F1 score on the CUAD dataset. This suggests that 
case mismatches between the training and testing data were a substantial source of error. Despite these gains, the 
model continued to struggle with complex legal language, especially in cases involving ambiguous phrasing or long, 
detailed clauses. The analysis of the model’s performance on various CUAD variants, including Filtered CUAD and 
CUAD QA, revealed that simplifying the input data and standardizing the case could partially mitigate these issues. 
However, even with these modifications, the model’s accuracy remains far from perfect, particularly in the legal 
domain, where the stakes for accuracy are high. Future work should focus on adaptive tokenization approaches, 
domain-specific fine-tuning, embedding-level adversarial defenses, and improving adversarial robustness. 
Additionally, expanding the dataset and enhancing model interpretability could help improve accuracy in legal 
contexts, making the model more reliable for high-stakes applications such as contract review.

Abstract 
The United Nations' sustainability goals have emerged as a crucial roadmap for monitoring decarbonization efforts. 
Oman's strategic focus lies in the realm of hydrogen, particularly Green Hydrogen, which harnesses renewable energy 
sources like solar and wind. Projections suggest that in the coming years, Oman could become one of the world's 
major hydrogen exporters, given its ample potential for harnessing high-quality renewable energy and its expansive 
land resources. The primary objective of this research is to scrutinize the social and socio-economic implications 
across the entire life cycle of Green Hydrogen in Oman, using the Social Life Cycle Assessment tool (SLCA). The 
SLCA comprises four primary phases: Goal and Scope, Inventory Analysis, Social Impact Assessment, and 
Interpretation Analysis. In the initial phase, the assessment's goals were delineated. Subsequently, an inventory 
analysis was conducted, systematically modeling the process of hydrogen production and identifying input and output 
inventory components. To assess social impacts, a combination of literature analysis and questionnaires was employed 
to generate a matrix encompassing all the social considerations relevant to the Green Hydrogen life cycle in Oman. 
This matrix, in turn, facilitated the final phase of Interpretation Analysis, where the identification of critical social 
factors requiring attention. The findings of this study underscore the efficacy of the SLCA as an essential tool for 
assessing the Green Hydrogen life cycle in Oman. Yet, it is crucial to acknowledge that various challenges still need 
to be addressed to advance the cause of sustainable hydrogen development in the region.

and knowledge level. For future studies, the conducted framework for SLCA that has been developed in this study 
can be used in order to understand the Social Impact on the Green Hydrogen life cycle in Oman after having a live 
project, and infrastructure in the country. This way one can visualize the acceptance of the public, and local community 
safety concerns, transportation, and storage; therefore, an easy assessment could be conducted in order to find out the 
social sustainability concerns that the government and companies have to improve.

Abstract 
The aim of the study was to determine the influence of Date Seeds (DS) and Date Seed Ash (DSA) in partial 
replacement with Fine Aggregate (FA) and Coarse Aggregate (CA) in concrete. Various concrete mix proportions 
were prepared by replacing a portion of FA and CA with DS and DSA in varying proportions. The study provides the 
insights into the slump test, temperature and compressive strength of concrete using DS and DSA. The value of slump 
test with 2% and 3% DSA replacement with Fine Aggregate (FA) gets 3 cm and zero value respectively. Compared 
to 11 cm for standard plain concrete. The value of slump test with 1% and 2% DS replacement with Coarse Aggregate 
(CA) found 9 cm and 8 cm respectively. The temperature for plain concrete, with DS and DSA was in the range of 
27.5 ℃ to 29.6 ℃. The compressive strength of the standard cube was tested 14.56 N/mm2 after 7 days. However, 
with 2% and 3% DSA replacement, the strength observed 18.44 N/mm2 and 17 N/mm2 respectively. After the 28 days 
of curing, the compressive strength of standard cube reached 27.11 N/mm2 while with 2% and 3% DSA replacement, 
it measured 19.40 N/mm2 and 18.33 N/mm2 respectively. The outcome of this research has significant implications 
for sustainable construction practice, more efficient and optimize mixing designs in the middle east.

Introduction
Concrete is the second-most-used building material. One of its main components is cement; its production, which 
dissipates large amounts of fossil fuels, generates approximately 7% of global CO2 emissions, contributing negatively

5.1 Compressive strength of concrete using Destructive Test (DT) and Non-Destructive Test (NDT) 
after 7 days of curing with 2% and 3% DSA replacement 
 
Figure 5 illustrates the outcomes of Destructive and a Non-Distractive Test (NDT) conducted at 7 days of curing for 
both standard concrete and concrete with DSA replacement over all cubes. These results exhibit variation due to the 
presence of sugar in DSA, which absorbs water from the mixture, thereby reducing the concrete’s hardness. A recent 
study by K.W. Tahnoon et al. (2023) studied the impact of sugar on concrete in Oman’s climate and found that sugar 
acts as a strong retarder, effectively controlling the setting time when combined with increased gypsum levels and a 
fixed sugar content. Another study from Saudi Arabia indicated that adding up to 0.1% sugar by weight of cement had 
minimal effect on the 28-day compressive strength. However, compressive strength notably decreased when sugar 
content exceeded 0.1%. Thus, the recommended range for sugar addition is between 0.05% and 0.1%. Interestingly, 
a slight strength increase was observed with 0.25% sugar, though more visible cracking occurred, sparking ongoing 
discussions about the effects of higher sugar dosages on strength. The compressive strength of standard concrete 
assessed using DT was observed 14.56 N/mm2. In contrast, the compressive strength for 2% and 3% DSA replacement 
with FA was observed 18.44 N/mm2 and 17 N/mm2 respectively. Using NDT, the compressive strength of standard 
concrete was determined 19.21 N/mm2.while for 2% and 3% DSA replacement, it was observed 14.65 N/mm2 and 
12.95 N/mm2 respectively. The DT result observed higher strength compared to plain concrete whereas NDT reflects 
lower strength of concrete.

5.2 Compressive strength of concrete using Destructive Test (DT) and Non-Destructive Test (NDT) 
at 28 days of curing with 2% and 3% DSA replacement: 
The compressive strength of concrete containing 2% DSA replacement with FA was measured 19.4 N/mm2 using DT 
and increased to 24.95 N/mm2 with NDT. Similarly, for concrete with 3% DSA replacement with FA, the compressive 
strength was observed at 18.33 N/mm2 with DT and 22 N/mm2 with NDT. The finding demonstrates a notable decrease 
in compressive strength measured by DT as the percentage of DSA changes from 2% to 3%. Furthermore, it was 
observed that these strengths are lower than plain concrete.  
 
6. Conclusions 
In the conclusion, the uses of Date seeds (DS), Date Seed Ash (DSA) showed the promising results in terms of the 
workability of concrete. Slump tests results reveal a direct correlation between DS and DSA content and increased 
slump value. The minor variations observed in temperature characteristics suggest that the incorporation of DS and

DSA did not significantly affect the temperature of concrete. However, it was observed that concrete containing DS 
failed during curing tests due to water absorption by seeds. Additionally, the research results indicate mixing of the 
DSA in partial replacement of FA increase concrete strength after 7 days with 2% DSA. But after 28 days it was 
observed that the compressive strength decreased when mixed with 3% DSA. These findings underscore the need for 
further research into optimized concrete mixing designs incorporating Date Seed Ash (DSA) to improve construction 
practices and structural design.

Abstract 
The healthcare sector, particularly in hospitals, faces significant challenges in maintaining indoor air quality (IAQ) 
due to smoke emissions from various sources such as sterilization processes and medical waste disposal. In Saudi 
Arabia, where the number of hospitals is rapidly growing, smoke emissions present a threat to patients, workers, and 
visitors, potentially aggravating health conditions. This research aims to design a Smart Safety System for assessing 
and improving smoke emissions in hospitals by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies. The system continuously monitors CO2 levels, a proxy for IAQ, and adjusts ventilation to mitigate 
pollution. Simulation and modeling via SolidWorks 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of this system using two 
scenarios. The first where CO2>1000ppm and the second where CO2>2000ppm. The results show that having CO2 
emission control system using IOT greatly enhances the IAQ. This innovation promises enhanced safety and a 
healthier work environment in Saudi hospitals.

Abstract 
The oil and gas sector is transforming rapidly, driven by global energy demand and the need to address climate change. 
Effective maintenance management is critical for ensuring asset reliability and operational safety in this sector, where 
predictive and proactive strategies replace traditional reactive maintenance practices. This paper introduces a 
comprehensive maintenance management health framework designed to enhance oil and gas industry maintenance 
practices. The proposed framework includes six essential stages: asset registration, maintenance strategy selection, 
capability promotion, maintenance implementation, reporting, and continuous improvement. A key innovation of the 
framework is using a Health Index (HI), which provides a quantitative and scalable assessment of maintenance 
management health. This index and its subindices are a benchmarking tool, enabling organizations to compare their 
performance with industry standards, proactively prevent equipment failures, and minimize downtime. The framework 
also incorporates modern techniques such as condition monitoring, AI, and digital twins to optimize maintenance 
efficiency and sustainability. A case study conducted in a gas processing plant with over 10,000 assets demonstrates 
the practical application of the HI, revealing trends in maintenance health over time and highlighting areas for 
improvement. The findings underscore the value of the HI in guiding decision-making, improving asset management, 
and supporting predictive maintenance practices. Furthermore, the study outlines how to integrate predictive methods, 
optimizing scheduling and planning for maintenance activities, ultimately boosting asset performance and reducing 
operational disruptions. This framework offers a structured and dynamic approach to maintenance management, 
promoting continuous improvement and operational excellence in the oil and gas sector.

Abstract 
Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and terahertz (THz) communication networks are proven to continue to help shape 
the advancement of the Sixth generation wireless communication. Next technology enables very high-speed data 
transfer and vastly increases communications network capacity. Motivated by these advancements, this work is aimed 
at investigating them. In this paper, the feasibility of flying -IRS in THz communication paradigms for revolutionizing 
wireless services, particularly in remote areas is explored. This paper introduces the Fly-IRS algorithm as a new 
approach to regulate the choice of user devices, IRS phase shifts, and UAV positions. The Fly-IRS algorithm is 
designed to improve data rates, increase network capacity, and minimize disruptive services that have a detrimental 
effect on users. To perform an optimal user classification, the method integrates Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement 
Learning ( MADRL) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize both the IRS phase configurations and paths. 
The simulations show that the Fly-IRS algorithm improves offered data rates by 10% compared to the MADRL. 
Therefore, these results emphasize the role of THz communication and IRS technology in the development of future 
wireless network generations.

The PSO-MADRL emerges as a highly effective approach, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both 
throughput and service quality compared to other contemporary reinforcement learning-based algorithms. 
6. Conclusion and Future Work 
This research shows that the proposed PSO-MADRL improves data transmission rates and service quality in Fly-IRS-
aided THz communication systems. The results show that increasing the number of RIS elements improves data 
performance significantly, with the PSO-MADRL achieving a 10% increase in throughput over the MADRL method. 
This improvement is primarily due to the optimized placement and configuration of RIS elements, which results in 
better signal reflection and data transmission efficiency. 
 
The PSO-MADRL consistently outperforms other configurations in terms of quality of service (QoS) and total data 
rate, reaching an impressive 300 Gbps when the user count reaches 60. It excels at managing user interference and 
optimizing resource allocation, making it a top contender in complex communication environments. From this 
research, it is evident that the PSO-MADRL framework can enhance the data transmission rates and services of the 
THz-aided Fly-IRS communication system. Several potential research areas can be investigated based on these 
findings to improve the framework's capabilities and adapt it to future scenarios.

 Material handling is an important part of the facility, as the material handling process selection follows the selection 
of manufacturing processes and selecting the workstations. Material handling is the process of moving material to the 
right place, at the right time, in the right amount, in the right sequence, and in the right position and conditions 
(Stephens & Meyers, 2013). The process of material handling includes movement, storage, control, protection of 
materials and the products through manufacturing, distribution, consumption, and disposal processes. Material 
handling plays a vital role in enhancing the efficiency, reducing costs, optimizing operations within the facility. 
According to The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), material handling equipment is defined as the 
art and science including the packaging, movement, and storage (Tompkins et al. 2010).

5. Conclusion  
This research has gone deep on the various aspects of MHS, exploring their classification, selection methodologies, 
and modeling techniques. The literature review highlights the critical role of efficient material handling in optimizing 
facility operational costs. However, there is still a room for exploration, especially in the field of digitalization or lean 
manufacturing practices regarding the science of material handling.  
 
To sum up, the main objective of this research is to review various aspects of material handling (MH) systems, 
including the classification and identification of material handling equipment (MHE), comparing selection 
methodologies and techniques, and identifying available modeling techniques. A comprehensive literature review was 
conducted, and several findings were gathered, as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. These findings led to the initialization 
of the framework presented in Table1, which can guide future research by defining the problem, identifying MHS 
objectives, proposing MHS solutions, evaluating, testing, finalizing, and standardizing. The future research can focus 
on integrating digital technologies such as digital twin, AI, or advanced optimization tools to improve the efficiency 
of MHS. Researches can develop brilliant solutions for real-time monitoring, and supply chain optimization. Future 
research can contribute to the enhancement of MHS and their positive impact on industrial operations.

Abstract 
This study integrates unsupervised learning algorithms and fuzzy inference systems to improve decision-making in 
the oil and gas industry. The first part examines the application of clustering algorithms, such as K-means, Fuzzy C-
means, and Hierarchical clustering, to well classification. Effective well classification is crucial for optimizing 
reservoir management and operational efficiency. Each algorithm’s performance is evaluated based on reservoir 
characteristics, well settings, and operational variables. K-means offers simplicity, hierarchical clustering provides 
structural insights, and fuzzy C-means facilitates soft clustering. These models are shown to enhance operational 
workflows and decision-making in the energy sector. The second part addresses the challenge of selecting candidate 
wells for extended shut-ins using fuzzy logic. Shut-ins, driven by economic or environmental factors, require a 
systematic approach for decision-making. A fuzzy expert system was developed using Python to select optimal wells 
for shut-in based on net present value (NPV). The system first clusters wells by performance and then recommends

Abstract 
A Nickel-based super alloy Incoloy 800 is suitable for aerospace engines and nuclear reactor applications due to its 
high strength and corrosion resistance properties.  Many researchers have done an optimization of process parameters 
with a single objective response like hardness or metal removal rate etc., In this paper, Ytterbium Fiber Laser Welding 
(FLW) process parameters namely laser power, duty cycle, welding speed, and frequency were optimized to obtain 
optimum weld bead geometry, full depth of penetration, hardness, and tensile strength by Central Composite design 
of Response Surface Methodology to join Incoloy 800 plates of 2mm thickness.  The second order empirical 
relationships were developed to predict the weld bead characteristics like bead width, depth of penetration, weld zone 
area, hardness, and tensile strength.  The developed empirical relationships were used to predict the weld bead 
characteristics with acceptable accuracy.  This paper discusses the direct and indirect interaction effect of FLW 
parameters on weld bead geometry, hardness & tensile strength.  The microstructure of the weld bead is studied using 
an Optical Microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM).

4.4 Comparative Analysis:  
This section will compare the three systems based on the period from the initial generation point to the nominal 
generation point. The analysis will focus on key performance indicators such as efficiency, output stability, and 
response time. By examining these metrics, we can identify the strengths and weaknesses of each system in terms of 
their operational capabilities. The least efficient method is water dam generators, which require approximately one 
minute to achieve nominal output levels. This is followed by hydrogen generators, which can reach nominal output 
within a similar timeframe. The most efficient system is graviticity. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
Moreover, the comparative analysis of the three energy storage systems (gravitricity, hydrogen production, and loop 
water dams) indicates that gravitic systems exhibit the highest efficiency and quickest response times, making them 
particularly well-suited for addressing instantaneous demand fluctuations. Hydrogen generators also demonstrate 
notable efficiencies but may require more time to stabilize compared to gravitricity. In contrast, loop water dam 
systems, while effective, are less responsive and may introduce delays in meeting peak demand.  
 
The inherent variability of solar and wind electricity production—affected by cloud cover, atmospheric conditions, 
and transient shading—poses significant challenges for grid stability, necessitating effective energy storage solutions. 
The current study demonstrates that neither gravitricity nor hydrogen generation nor water dams alone can sufficiently 
mitigate abrupt cessations in energy output from both wind and solar farms. Although these advanced storage methods 
offer valuable means of energy management, their response times may be insufficient during periods of rapid 
fluctuations in generation. 
 
Thus, the investigation of advanced battery systems and pumped hydro storage presents a promising opportunity. 
These technologies can effectively capture excess energy produced during peak sunlight hours and discharge it during 
periods of low generation. The findings suggest that while large battery systems may struggle to address sudden rapid 
drops in power supply, integrating online uninterruptible power supplies could provide a viable solution. 
 
This study emphasizes the urgent need for continuous development and integration of advanced energy storage 
technologies to support the transition to a low-carbon energy future. The interdependencies of these systems call for 
interdisciplinary approaches that consider technological, economic, and environmental implications to achieve a 
balanced renewable energy mix in Oman. 
 
6. Future Works 
Future research should: 
• 
Prioritize comprehensive mathematical modeling of energy generation and storage systems in Oman to 
facilitate simulation of various operational scenarios. 
• 
Incorporate online storage-generator systems into modeling to examine operational efficiency, mechanical 
dynamics, electrical characteristics, and economic implications. 
• 
Analyze the interplay between different systems to optimize integration strategies and enhance grid 
performance.

Abstract 
This study presents the hydrogen production potential using wind energy harnessed in the Sultanate of Oman. An 
analysis of 14 different locations throughout the Sultanate with prospective wind energy abundance was conducted to 
determine the economic feasibility and overall potential for wind-to-hydrogen production. Key metrics assessed 
included Capacity Factor, Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), CO2 emission reductions, annual weight of Green 
Hydrogen produced, and the associated Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH). The results indicate that significant 
potential exists for green hydrogen production in Oman, providing pathways for sustainable energy development and 
addressing the global demand for clean energy.

Abstract 
Aluminum is a lightweight, durable metal known for its corrosion resistance and high conductivity, making it essential 
for industries such as construction, aerospace, and automotive. Production of aluminum and its alloys is a major 
industry in Oman and the Gulf region, and worldwide. Aluminum smelting is the process of extracting pure aluminum 
from its oxide, typically using the Hall–Héroult process, where alumina is dissolved in molten cryolite and 
electrolyzed to produce aluminum metal. The anode plant utilizes the Söderberg method to produce anodes for the 
reduction line. A critical component in the anode is the clad, also called the Electric Transition Joint (ETJ). The clad 
connects the upper part of the stem (made of aluminum) to the lower part, known as the bracket (made of steel). The 
middle section of the clad contains titanium, which is explosion-welded on one side and MIG-welded on the other, 
creating a bond between the upper and lower parts. Some regional smelting plants have reported repeated failures in 
the anode Clad, which are characterized by elongation or bending. These defects could be caused by uneven stress 
distribution, high temperatures, and high electrical currents. Clad failure resulting in a tilt of more than 16° in the stem 
can lead to smelting process failure. In one regional plant, there has been a significant increase in clad failures in 
recent years, despite no reports of such failures in earlier years. The main aims of this study were to investigate the 
clad failure problem in aluminum smelters, identify the main causes, and recommend appropriate solutions. Various 
methods were used to investigate the clad failure, including visual inspection, X-ray inspection, chemical composition 
testing, welding strength testing, tensile testing, shear testing, and finite element analysis (FEA). The primary causes 
of clad failure were identified as lack of fusion, lack of penetration, and porosity in the welded joints, as revealed 
through visual and X-ray inspections of sectioned samples. FEA of different sections of the Clad, considering the 
welding layer under mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads, showed that with proper welding quality, the assembly 
can handle all applied loads without failure. To prevent future issues, it is recommended that welders possess advanced 
skills (proper licensing and MIG welding experience), welding parameters (such as current, welding speed, and 
shielding gas) be tightly controlled, and environmental factors (like dust and humidity) be minimized.

1. Introduction
Aluminum is a vital material used in various industries, from construction and aerospace to consumer goods (Qamar 
et al 2011; Qamar et al 2004). Because of its light weight, corrosion resistance, and versatility, aluminum has been 
dubbed the Metal of the Millenium (Qamar 2018, Qamar 2009). The Hall–Héroult process is the most widely used 
method for aluminum production, converting alumina into pure aluminum via electrolysis. The process involves 
multiple stages, including the reduction line, where anodes are essential components. These anodes rely on the clad 
or Electric Transition Joint (ETJ) to connect the aluminum upper stem to the steel lower bracket, allowing for electrical 
conductivity and structural integrity (NobelClad 2018; Lorentsen 2014).

3. Results 
Some of the more significant results from this study are summarized below. 
 
3.1 Visual and X-Ray Inspection Results 
The visual inspections revealed significant deformation in the aluminum portion of the clad, including elongation and 
bending. X-ray inspections confirmed the presence of welding defects, such as porosity and lack of fusion, which were 
found to be the primary contributors to clad failure. 
 
3.2 Tensile and Shear Test Results 
The tensile tests showed that the aluminum clad was able to withstand a maximum load of 250 MPa before failure. 
However, under high temperatures and electrical currents, the material's strength decreased significantly. The shear 
tests indicated weak bonding at the welding joints, particularly in areas with poor penetration and lack of fusion. 
 
3.3 Finite Element Analysis Results 
The FEA simulations revealed that uneven stress distribution and thermal expansion were major factors contributing 
to clad failure. Under high thermal and electrical loads, the clad exhibited significant elongation and deformation, 
particularly in areas with welding defects. The simulation also demonstrated that, with proper welding and material 
quality, the clad could withstand the operational stresses without failure (Dania et al., 2022). 
 
 4. Discussion 
The results of this study indicate that clad failure in aluminum smelters is primarily caused by poor welding quality 
and material degradation under high thermal and electrical loads. The presence of welding defects, such as porosity 
and lack of fusion, weakens the clad and makes it more susceptible to failure. Additionally, the high temperatures and 
electrical currents experienced during the smelting process exacerbate these defects, leading to premature failure 
(NobelClad, 2018). To address these issues, the following measures are recommended. 
 
4.1 Improving Welding Techniques 
Welders should be well trained and properly certified in MIG welding to ensure sufficient fusion and penetration. 
Welding parameters, such as current, speed, and gas flow, should be strictly controlled to minimize defects (Amir et 
al., 2014). 
 
4.2 Enhancing Material Quality 
The use of higher-quality materials with better resistance to thermal and electrical stresses can improve the clad’s 
longevity. For example, alloys with higher Mg content may offer improved hardness and resistance to deformation 
(Dania et al., 2022). 
 
4.3 More Stringent Quality Control 
Regular inspections of the clad assembly during and after production, including X-ray and tensile tests, can help 
identify defects early and prevent their propagation during operation. 
 
5. Conclusions 
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of clad failure in aluminum smelters, highlighting the critical role that 
welding quality and material selection play in the longevity of the clad. Through experimental analysis and FEA 
simulations, the study identifies the key causes of failure and proposes practical solutions to mitigate future 
occurrences. It was found that the main causes of clad failure were lack of fusion, insufficient penetration, and porosity 
in the welded joints, as confirmed by visual and X-ray inspections of sectioned samples. Finite Element Analysis 
(FEA) of various clad sections, accounting for mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads on the welding layer, 
demonstrated that with high-quality welding, the assembly can withstand all applied loads without failure. 
Improvement in welding techniques and welder qualifications, enhancement of material quality of clad and related 
materials, and more stress on preventive quality control are some of the major recommendations. Implementing these 
recommendations will improve production efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall reliability of 
aluminum smelting operations.

Abstract 
This research aims to redesign a medical warehouse's material handling system (MHS) by applying Data Envelopment 
Analysis (DEA). Less research was done to select the appropriate material handling system for medical warehouses. 
The MHS in the Sultan Qaboos University medical warehouse is evaluated through the material handling equipment 
(MHE) currently used over different warehouse sections. A list of MHE types most relevant to the ongoing warehouse 
operations are selected for further evaluation.  A market investigation is conducted for each MHE type to determine 
the specifications of the alternative MHE models offered by different manufacturers and vendors. The data collected 
for alternative commercial MHE models are employed to rank each list of MHE types separately. In the next stage, the 
best MHE are ranked using the benchmarking power. The MHS is built as a result of possible combinations of selected 
commercial MHE models for the required MHE types.

Power Conversion

Abstract 
This work presents an alternative approach to generating power using a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) based flare to 
power conversion model. The model utilizes pre-existing unit operating modules and other AspenPlusTM features such 
as a mixer, cooler, reactor, and heat exchanger. Validation of this model was performed by comparing results with the 
published data available in open literature. Results were obtained for induced voltage and sensitivity analyses of major 
operating parameters, such as operating temperature, operating pressure, and utilization factor (Uf) was performed 
using the developed model. The results and sensitivity analysis show the overall cell electrical voltage of 818 mV 
obtained at 1050℃ and Uf at 0.85. 
1. Introduction
The world's energy requirement has grown significantly. According to the survey, there will be a big leap in global 
energy consumption from 549 quadrillion BTU to 629 quadrillion BTU between years 2020 and year 2040; it is 
projected that this rise will continue steadily until approximately 815 quadrillion BTU by the end of year 2040 (U.S. 
Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2016).  Figure 1 displays that the majority of the increase in energy usage 
took place after the industrial revolution.

Effect of overall utilization factor (Uf) and current density (Ic) 
The utilization factor of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) has a direct impact on its output and efficiency. According 
to the simulation results, the overall voltage of the SOFC decreases as the utilization factor increases. It can be seen 
in the Figure 6 that a high utilization factor can result in a more efficient use of the fuel. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Variation of induced voltage (Vc) with the change in Utilization factor (Uf) 
 
4. Conclusions and Future work 
The simulation in current research work utilizes existing AspenPlusTM functions and unit operation models to allow 
for thorough thermodynamic and parametric analysis of SOFC operations. It can also be expanded to study the entire 
process, including both the SOFC stack and the auxiliary component of the plant.  
 
The model was calibrated with published data. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the cell's electrical voltage reaches a 
maximum value of 818 mV at 1050℃ and Uf  at 0.85. Also, cell electrical voltage increased from 746 to 822 mV as 
operating pressure increased from 1 to 10 atm.  
 
However, the accuracy and flexibility of the model are limited by the methods and correlations used to calculate cell 
voltage, which rely heavily on semi-empirical relationships. To address this limitation, ongoing efforts are focused on 
developing a model grounded in fundamental phenomena rather than empirical relationships. This updated model is 
currently in development, with plans to refine the correlations based on its outputs.

Abstract 
In today's competitive business climate, sustaining liquidity and fostering development depend on efficient working 
capital management. This article examines the connection between supply chain management (SCM) and working 
capital, illustrating how SCM techniques may augment operational efficiency and financial stability, thereby enhancing 
overall organizational performance. Despite the substantial literature on supply chain management, a notable 
deficiency persists in the integration of financial flows, which are essential for optimum supply chain operations. A 
case study of a Saudi Arabian petrochemical firm demonstrates that strategic supply chain management may recover 
almost 93% of working capital, alleviating the effects of operational interruptions. By prioritizing client requirements 
and managing inventories with sophisticated technologies such as big data and machine learning, organizations may 
markedly improve their financial stability and maintain a competitive advantage in a changing market. Future study 
should further examine the interaction between these approaches and their relevance across diverse supply chain 
environments. Overall, the study highlights the positive relationship between financial performance and operational 
factors, particularly within the petrochemical and energy sectors in Saudi Arabia, supporting that effective SCM can 
play a pivotal role in financial success.

1. Introduction
The research on supply chain management (SCM) has historically emphasized the coordination of material and 
information flows (Gavirneni et al. 1999; Lee and Whang 1992). Nonetheless, there is a significant deficiency in the 
focus on the incorporation of financial flows inside supply chain management frameworks. This control is crucial, as 
financial factors are vital for efficient supply chain operations. Although certain researchers have initiated efforts to 
fill this gap, their contributions remain constrained. Cohen and Mallik (1998) examine models that include exchange 
rates and pricing, highlighting the influence of the financial climate on supply chains. Buzacott and Zhang (2004) 
analyse inventory management with asset-based finance, indicating that financial instruments are essential for 
optimizing supply chains. Conceptual investigations, signified by Hofmann (2005), have presented the notion of supply 
chain finance, advocating for the integration of financial strategies into supply chain management techniques. Supply 
Chain Finance constitutes the financing sector of a commercial bank, providing working capital management for 
significant corporate clients and accelerated payment solutions for suppliers (V. Popa, 2013).  
Moreover, investigations of supply chain risks by Jüttner (2005), Peck (2005), and Tang (2006) underscore the impact 
of financial uncertainty on supply chain resilience and decision-making processes. Notwithstanding these 
contributions, a significant portion of the current literature remains concentrated on operational performance, 
frequently neglecting the financial limitations that may hinder supply chain efficacy (Axsäter and Rosling, 1993;

Abstract 
Conventional prediction methods, whether derived from deep learning or statistical techniques, typically demand 
significant manual intervention, making full process automation challenging. This study investigates the comparative 
robustness of traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and automated machine learning (AutoML) 
techniques, specifically TPOT, in predicting stock market behavior. By conducting experiments on the Moroccan 
stock market, the results demonstrate that AutoML approaches not only enhance prediction accuracy but also simplify 
the modeling process, making advanced prediction techniques more accessible and effective in dynamic financial 
markets.

1. Introduction
Predicting stock market’s price fluctuations represents a core challenge in the financial field given its strategic 
importance for researchers but also for investors and regulators.  Conventional statistical techniques and fundamental 
machine learning approaches frequently find it challenging to address the intricate and ever-changing characteristics 
of financial markets. In this context, Deep Learning, especially LSTM networks, has proven to be an effective 
instrument with respect to their capacity to capture temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns in time-series data.
LSTM models, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are explicitly designed to address and mitigate the issues 
of gradient vanishing and exploding, common in standard RNNs. This capability makes LSTMs ideally suited for 
modeling sequences and financial time series, which are characterized by long-term dependencies and periodic 
volatility. Despite their advantages, the design and tuning of LSTM networks require significant expertise and are 
computationally intensive, involving extensive trial-and-error to identify optimal configurations.   
Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) constitutes a promising approach to address the above mentioned challenges. 
AutoML seeks to streamline the complete process of implementing machine learning solutions in order to address 
practical challenges. Through the automation of model selection, composition and parameterization, AutoML 
significantly speeds up the model development process. Moreover, it makes available to non-specialists advanced 
machine learning techniques. 
The potential of AutoML to improve LSTM models for stock market’s price prediction is notably intriguing, as it may 
result in an improved accuracy in forecasts and more effective decision-making resources for investors and analysts 
navigating volatile markets.

dense layers, the first with 25 units and the final output layer with a single unit to predict the target variable. This 
architecture was chosen due to LSTM’s capability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.  
 
The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. Adam was 
selected due to its adapted learning rate often results in accelerated convergence and improved efficiency in practice. 
The model experienced training for 5 epochs, utilizing a batch size of 1. The relatively small number of epochs was 
chosen to prevent overfitting, given the model’s complexity and the potential for the LSTM to memorize the training 
data if trained for too long.  
 
In parallel to the LSTM model, an AutoML approach was employed using TPOT, a tool that automates the process of 
model selection and hyperparameter tuning. TPOT uses genetic programming to explore a wide range of machine 
learning pipelines and configurations, optimizing for the best performance (Kaftantzis et al. 2024). The TPOT model 
was trained on the same training data, but instead of using sequences as in the LSTM model, the data was reshaped 
into a flat format suitable for traditional machine learning models.  
 
The TPOT process involved 5 generations with a population size of 20, meaning that TPOT explored 20 different 
models in each generation, iteratively improving the models over 5 iterations. The final model chosen by TPOT was 
the one that minimized the mean squared error on the validation set. This approach allows TPOT to discover 
potentially better-performing models that might not be immediately apparent through manual tuning.  
 
At the conclusion of training process, predictions were produced on the test set for further investigation. The 
predictions were then inverse processed using the scaler to revert them to the original data scale, facilitating a direct 
comparison with the actual results. The models' performance was assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE), a 
prevalent statistic in regression tasks that quantifies the average amount of the discrepancy between predicted and 
actual values.  
 
Figure 2 plots a clear visual comparison of how closely each model’s predictions aligned with the true data points. 
The LSTM model’s predictions, shown in orange, generally followed the trend of the actual values but exhibited some 
lag during rapid market changes. The TPOT model’s predictions, shown in green, appeared to track closer to the actual 
values, particularly during periods of high volatility.  
 
The comparative analysis of the two models revealed several key insights. Firstly, both models demonstrated a strong 
ability to capture the overall trend in the financial time series data, indicating that both LSTM and TPOT are viable 
options for this type of forecasting. However, there were notable differences in performance, particularly in how each 
model handled periods of rapid market change.  
 
The LSTM model, despite its sophistication and ability to capture long-term dependencies, struggled slightly during 
periods of high volatility. This is likely due to the inherent difficulty of predicting sudden market shifts, which are 
often influenced by factors outside the scope of the data provided. In contrast, the TPOT option, by optimizing over a 
broader range of potential models and hyperparameters, was able to produce predictions that were more responsive to 
these changes. This suggests that the AutoML approach was effective in identifying a model configuration that better 
captured the dynamics of the financial market.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the comparative forecasts of the LSTM and TPOT-optimized models, emphasizing market 
volatility over training epochs. This investigation evaluates the forecasts of both models during significant market 
occurrences. Periods of instability and economic announcements are characterized by significant fluctuations in real 
market prices. The TPOT model exhibits superior alignment with real data during high-volatility periods, underscoring 
the efficacy of AutoML in adapting to rapid market fluctuations. The LSTM model exhibits a delayed reaction to these 
fast changes, indicating constraints in its adaptability to sudden external factors.

For practitioners in the field of financial forecasting, these results suggest that while LSTM models are a powerful 
tool for capturing temporal dependencies, there is value in exploring AutoML approaches like TPOT that can 
optimize model performance in a more automated and potentially more effective manner. The ability of TPOT to 
discover better-performing models through genetic programming offers a promising avenue for enhancing the 
accuracy of financial predictions, particularly in volatile markets.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, we investigated the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Automated Machine 
Learning (AutoML), focusing on TPOT for forecasting volatile financial time series. Both models exhibited robust 
predictive ability. Nevertheless, AutoML surpassed LSTM, particularly in managing market volatility, due to its 
automated model selection and hyperparameter optimization. Nonetheless, the ""black-box"" characteristic of AutoML 
poses transparency issues, limiting understanding of the precise elements influencing its efficacy. Our results 
underscore AutoML's capacity to improve financial forecasting by providing a scalable, efficient solution that 
minimizes the need for manual adjustment, hence making it suitable for fluctuating market circumstances. Subsequent 
study needs to investigate alternative AutoML frameworks and emphasize interpretability to improve comprehension 
of long-term patterns and infrequent market occurrences, hence augmenting transparency for decision-making 
processes in finance.

Abstract 
Innovation ecosystems are complex systems involving diverse stakeholders with varying interests, focused on 
fostering innovative outputs. These environments enable large corporations, entrepreneurs, investors, and government 
institutions to connect, share knowledge, and combine their contributions to generate value through networking. They 
encourage partnerships and interactions that support co-creation. This paper investigates the innovation ecosystem as 
a network of interacting agents. While much research has emphasized qualitative analyses of orchestration, we use 
agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore both individual agents and their aggregated behaviors. Our model serves as 
a decision-making tool to evaluate the effectiveness of orchestration strategies on both individual agents and overall 
ecosystem performance.

6. Conclusion 
This paper aims to elucidate the phenomenon of establishing innovative ecosystems and proposes a novel approach to 
address the complexities associated with orchestrating these systems. To better understand the nature of innovative 
ecosystems, we developed an agent-based modeling simulation. This calibrated simulation model serves as a valuable 
what-if analysis tool, enabling policymakers to evaluate and validate their strategic recommendations without the need 
for real-world experiments, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. By allowing for the exploration of 
various scenarios and potential outcomes, the simulation offers insights into how different factors may influence the 
dynamics of the ecosystem. As such, it facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning in the context of 
innovation. Looking ahead, our future work will prioritize the integration of real-world data into the model to enhance 
its calibration and operational effectiveness. This process will involve collecting empirical data from established 
innovative ecosystems, which will allow us to refine the model's parameters and improve its predictive capabilities. 
By utilizing actual data, we aim to make the simulation more representative of real-world dynamics, thereby increasing 
its accuracy and relevance. Gathering this data will entail collaborating with various stakeholders within innovative 
ecosystems, including businesses, research institutions, and government agencies. We will seek to understand the 
unique characteristics and performance metrics of different ecosystems, focusing on factors such as the types of 
collaborations, knowledge flows, and innovation outcomes that can impact the overall effectiveness of the ecosystem. 
Incorporating this empirical data will not only bolster the model's reliability but also enhance its utility for 
policymakers. By providing a data-driven basis for simulation, we can offer more precise insights into the potential 
impacts of different strategic decisions. This will empower policymakers to test various scenarios, evaluate the 
implications of their choices, and ultimately foster environments that promote innovation and economic development. 
Additionally, we envision that this iterative process of calibration will facilitate continuous improvement of the model. 
As new data becomes available and as innovative ecosystems evolve, we can update the model to reflect these changes, 
ensuring that it remains a relevant and powerful tool for analysis and decision-making. Ultimately, our goal is to create 
a robust framework that not only aids in understanding existing innovative ecosystems but also supports the 
development of new strategies for enhancing their effectiveness and impact.

Abstract 
This study explores the thermal behavior of HDPE composites reinforced with micro- and nano-Hydroxyapatite (HA) 
through Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). TGA was employed to 
assess thermal stability, with tests conducted from 25 to 550°C. The analysis revealed that HDPE/micro-HA 
composites begin to degrade at around 300°C, with polymer decomposition complete by 450°C. Micro-HA 
demonstrated higher thermal stability, increasing degradation temperatures more than nano-HA due to its larger size 
and surface absorption properties. DSC analysis measured the effects of filler content on the thermal properties, 
including crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm). The results showed no significant change in 
Tm between pure HDPE and HDPE-HA composites, indicating that HA had little impact on HDPE crystallization. 
However, as the filler content increased, the melting temperature of the composites slightly increased. The crystallinity 
of HDPE-HA composites improved up to 5 wt% micro-HA and 1 wt% nano-HA, after which crystallinity declined. 
The findings suggest that both micro- and nano-HA enhance the thermal properties of HDPE, but their effectiveness 
varies with filler concentration.

Abstract 
Daily commute on bike has proven to be an economical way of transportation in many countries. Muscle fatigue 
significantly contributes to lower back pain and injuries, particularly among motorbike riders. This study focuses on 
investigating the phenomenon of muscle fatigue utilizing electromyography (EMG) to analyze and understand the 
impact of muscle fatigue on two major muscles responsible for maintaining posture while riding a bike. The mean 
power frequency is used as a measuring index, which indicates muscle fatigue. To evaluate the influence of different 
factors, the study focuses on two distinct trunk orientations: 90° and 60°. These orientations are chosen to simulate 
common riding positions adopted by motorbike riders. Additionally, the study examines the impact of vibration on 
muscle fatigue by comparing conditions with and without vibration. It is observed that the vibration and the 60-degree 
trunk angle are significant factors in inducing fatigue, as evidenced by a greater slowdown of mean power frequency 
for both the erector spinae and multifidus muscles (P<0.05). These findings highlight the importance of considering 
trunk angle and vibration exposure when addressing muscle fatigue in motorbike riders. Understanding these specific

Table 3 shows the slopes of the different settings of the two muscles. The slope reading shows that sitting posture at 
60 degrees induces higher muscle fatigue. It is also evident that when the ignition is on, the effect of vibration causes 
the muscle to fatigue more quickly over time. The normalized power frequency slope is at -0.0174 for 90-degree for 
erector spinae and -0.016 at 90-degree for multifidus, the slope decreases to -0.0218 and -0.024 for erector spinae and 
multifidus at 90-degree respectively. Similarly for erector spinae the worst conditions where the posture is at 60 
degrees or similar the slope drastically descends from -0.0053 to -0.0218. 
 
6. Discussion 
Muscle fatigue is a significant cause of lower back pain. Long bike hours cause significant stress on lower back posture 
and also plays an important role in causing stress and injuries to trunk muscle and in particular lower muscles [31]. 
Posture affects the fatigue levels in bike riders. The statistical analysis of the mean power frequency indicates that the 
posture of 60 degrees inclination produces more fatigue than sitting the driver at 90 degrees on motorbikes. Further 
studies on the level of inclination or providing back support could further reduce the stress on the lower back muscles 
of the multifidus and erector spinae. 
Vibration increases the stress on the erector spinae and multifidus thus increasing fatigue. In this study, we have found 
that the effect of vibration is significant and plays a major role in causing lower back injuries. The effect of vibrations 
can be reduced by design optimization of the seat and bike to reduce bike vibrations. However, more studies are 
needed to find the correlation between vibration and sitting posture.  
The scope of this study is limited by the number of participants and the time in which this study was performed. Future 
research can be carried out by including other lower back muscles and shoulder and hands muscle to reduce stress on 
healthcare systems. The effect of bad infrastructure needs to be investigated in future studies to find the relationship 
between lower back injuries in bike riders and bad infrastructure. 
 
7. Conclusions 
Muscle fatigue is induced because of a lot of external and internal factors. This is also because of the load on different 
muscles for different durations. These factors contribute to lower back problems which put a lot of stress on the 
healthcare system. Bike riders are one group of society who are much more affected by lower back injuries. In this 
study, we have tried to find the effect of posture on the motorbike and the effects of vibration on the lower back muscle 
erector spinae and deep muscle multifidus of bike riders. We have used the SEMGs method for calculating the mean 
power frequency which indicates the fatigue in the muscles. The experimental setup was conducted on 13 subjects

with different professions but who use a motorbike daily. It was evident that both vibration and posture affect muscle 
fatigue in both of the muscles. 
 
This is followed by a statistical analysis which shows the correlation between the different variables of the 
experimental setup. In this study, we have used the Mean Power frequency as the indicator for fatigue in the two main 
lower back muscles, erector spinae, and multifidus. The SEMG is then recorded and using the fast Fourier transform 
it is converted from the time domain to the frequency domain. A t-test was performed to find out whether there is any 
correlation between the two experimental setups i-e vibration and posture that were designed to experiment. The 
experiment identified that a sitting posture (90 degrees) is more optimal than (60-degrees) regarding fatigue reduction. 
The vibration and non-vibration state plays an essential role in muscle fatigue as fatigue readings recorded during 
vibration were higher than the non-vibration state.

Abstract 
The Lean Six Sigma Approach to Continuous Improvement in the pharmaceutical industry emphasizes the importance 
of maintaining consistent quality and operational efficiency due to stringent regulatory requirements and the high cost 
of defects. This research investigates the practical implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies, specifically the 
DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) framework, in optimizing the tablet compression process for 
a specific type of medicine in tablet form, referred to as ABC tablets. The continuous improvement methodologies, 
rooted in the historical foundations of Six Sigma—which began with Carl Friedrich Gauss's concept of the natural 
curve and later evolved through Walter Shewhart’s quality control charts—are employed to systematically identify 
and address variability issues inherent in the manufacturing process using statistical tools such as control charts and 
cause-and-effect diagrams. Developed at Motorola in the late 1980s by Bill Smith and Mikhel Harry, the aim of the 
Six Sigma approach is to reduce variation in major product quality characteristics to levels where failure or 
nonconformities are extremely unlikely. By employing targeted interventions inspired by both Lean philosophy and 
Six Sigma principles, significant improvements in process capability, yield percentages, and defect rates are achieved. 
The findings also demonstrate a substantial reduction in variability, leading to increased process reliability and product 
quality; for instance, process capability indices improved, yield percentages rose from 85% to 95%, and defect rates 
dropped from 10% to 2%. This underscores the tangible impact of Lean Six Sigma methodologies on enhancing 
operational efficiency and product quality in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Additionally, the research highlights the 
importance of sustained improvements through rigorous control measures, ensuring long-term benefits and fostering 
a culture of continuous improvement within the industry.  This research serves as a valuable case study for the broader 
application of Lean Six Sigma in the pharmaceutical industry, providing a structured approach to process optimization 
and quality enhancement.

The Control phase of the DMAIC process in the tablet compression process involved the meticulous implementation 
of controls, SOP updates, and targeted training to ensure the lasting effectiveness of solutions. Continuous monitoring 
using control charts and SPC techniques allowed for proactive quality maintenance. Efforts to prevent defect 
recurrence and a commitment to ongoing improvement through feedback mechanisms were key. Transparent 
documentation and reporting procedures promoted informed decision-making. Overall, the Control phase 
demonstrated a proactive approach to quality management with a focus on continuous improvement and sustainability 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
This research study demonstrates the significant benefits of applying Six Sigma principles, particularly through the 
DMAIC framework, within the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. The systematic analysis of the tablet 
compression process revealed the impact of variability on product quality and identified key areas for improvement. 
By following the DMAIC approach, improvements were observed in process efficiency and product quality at various 
stages. 
 
The Define phase highlighted critical issues such as manual procedures and maintenance lapses, setting the stage for 
targeted solutions. In the Measurement phase, historical data provided insights into process performance, guiding 
improvement initiatives. The Analysis phase identified sources of variability and root causes of non-conformance, 
informing intervention strategies. The Improve phase focused on addressing identified issues through error-proofing 
and process enhancements, leading to significant improvements. 
 
The Control phase ensured the sustainability of improvements through rigorous monitoring and documentation, 
fostering a culture of quality and continuous improvement. Collaborating with a pharmaceutical firm validated the 
effectiveness of Six Sigma methodologies in driving operational improvements. The research-maintained validity 
through internal control, consideration of external applicability, and diverse data collection methods. 
 
In conclusion, the research underscores the impact of Six Sigma DMAIC methodology in optimizing pharmaceutical 
processes and improving product quality. The recommendation for pharmaceutical organizations is to consider 
adopting Six Sigma, focusing on DMAIC, to enhance operational efficiency and product quality. Investing in

The initial design had several flaws that led to unreliability and unsustainability. One main issue was the use of a DC 
motor, which typically requires more maintenance as it has a shorter lifespan when compared to AC motors. In 
addition to an unnecessary barrel support, which used extra material without serving any functional purpose. And the 
design lacked ergonomic considerations, as this aspect was overlooked during the initial development. All these 
shortcomings were addressed and corrected in the final design (Figure 6). 
 
5.2 Pros and Cons of Manufactured Extruder and Design Process 
A custom design offers several advantages, including the ability to tailor the extruder to meet specific project 
requirements and applications, such as processing unique materials, achieving specific throughput rates, or operating 
under special conditions. It also allows for the optimization of key parameters like screw geometry, barrel design, and 
heating systems, resulting in optimized performance and efficiency. Additionally, custom extruders can be designed 
with scalability in mind, enabling future modifications or upgrades to accommodate evolving needs. However, custom 
designs come with certain drawbacks, such as longer lead times due to the extended design period, and manufacturing 
phases, which can delay implementation. There is also the risk that the custom design may not perform as expected, 
necessitating further iterations or redesigns, which could increase both costs and time. 
 
6. Conclusion & Future Work  
6.1 Conclusion 
In conclusion, this paper has portrayed an accomplishment in the design and prototyping of a filament extruder. The 
paper followed a methodical approach that integrated different aspects of research, design, and practical application. 
First, the stage of literature research was thoroughly carried out, then the paper passed through careful selection of 
materials, through CAD designing and design analysis, to assembling a working prototype. The variations encountered

during the manufacturing and assembly process pointed out some practical aspects of this design that needed to be 
addressed (Figure 7). Despite these challenges, the main goals of this paper were accomplished and offers a solid 
foundation for future improvements.  
 
6.2 Future Work 
Filament extrusion research can approach a number of potential paths in the future. To start with, the emphasis should 
be placed on improving effectiveness of the extruder’s performance. Researching the integration of the rest of the 
production line, and more autonomous complex systems can help in alleviating the challenges coming from the 
extrusion process in an economic and accurate manner. For example, introducing a PLC would provide some level of 
control while allowing for monitoring of the operations and taking feedback in real time and boost effectiveness. As 
well as, simulating the extrusion of different polymers would allow for tuning of multiple parameters of the extruder, 
and test the limits of the extruder without any risk of harm.  
 
There is a lot of scope for the development of sustainable processes in additive manufacturing, and it is desirable to 
continue getting involved with research in this field. Primarily, such research will improve and enhance the proficiency 
and effectiveness of the overall process in the use of these materials. Lastly, advancements in the extrusion process 
can contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing material waste and enabling the recycling of plastic 
materials. Developing energy-efficient systems and exploring the possibility of adding percentages of recycled plastic 
into the raw material.

Abstract 
Public procurement systems play a critical role in the functioning and governance of national economies, responsible 
for acquiring goods, services, and infrastructure that support public services and national development. However, 
traditional procurement methods in many countries have faced significant challenges. These challenges include 
inefficiencies in the procurement processes, lack of transparency, limited accountability, and difficulties in 
managing increasingly complex procurement demands. Traditional procurement systems are often decentralized, 
with individual public sector entities managing their own procurement activities. This decentralization can lead to 
inconsistencies in procurement practices, fragmented supply chains, and inefficiencies in resource allocation. 
Additionally, traditional systems may suffer from extended procurement cycles, which delay project completion 
and increase costs. These systems also tend to lack transparency, making it difficult to track spending and detect 
irregularities, which can lead to corruption or mismanagement. In response to these challenges, many countries have 
begun transitioning to centralized procurement systems. A centralized system consolidates procurement activities 
across public sector entities, aiming to standardize processes, improve efficiency, and reduce costs through 
economies of scale. Centralized procurement allows governments to streamline operations, negotiate better 
contracts, and improve oversight and accountability. Despite these benefits, the transition to centralized procurement 
is not without challenges. Some of the remaining issues include managing the integration of various stakeholders, 
ensuring compliance with new regulations, and fully optimizing the potential of centralized operations. Recent 
research has investigated the potential of emerging technologies to address the limitations of both traditional and 
centralized procurement systems. Technologies such as Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of 
Things (IoT) are being increasingly adopted in public procurement to improve transparency, efficiency, and 
decision-making. Blockchain offers a decentralized ledger that secures transactions, making procurement records 
tamper-proof and easier to track. AI is used to analyze procurement data, forecast demand, and automate processes, 
helping governments make more informed decisions and reduce cycle times. IoT enhances inventory management 
by providing real-time data, allowing governments to monitor supply chains and minimize shortages or 
overstocking. This research aims to provide clear descriptions of both the traditional and centralized public 
procurement system, offering a comprehensive understanding of their structure and challenges. It also highlights

Abstract 
The quality of education is greatly improved using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and tools. Many 
organizations across the globe have incorporated the use of AI tools to enhance their teaching methods and prepare 
themselves against pandemics and other disruptions. On the other hand, practitioners do not completely understand 
the factors that influence the application of these systems. Moreover, little research has examined the factors and 
challenges that facilitate the successful integration of artificial intelligence in higher education institutions in the 
Sultanate of Oman. As a result, there is a gap that this research identifies, defines, and assesses the key factors 
associated with AI integration in higher education. In this paper, we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight 
experts and extracted four factors. From these factors and challenges, we proposed a conceptual framework that was 
classified using the Technological, Organizational, and Environmental (TOE) framework and the Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM) model. We used NVIVO software after the categorization and involved eight experts in 
gathering the relevant data. The major findings were four factors and challenges: data readiness, 
educational transformation, financial readiness, and ethical anxiety. The study proposed a conceptual framework to 
investigate relationships between the factors and challenges and developed propositions for each. These propositions 
are crucial in understanding how these relationships impact the adoption of AI tools in the higher education sector.

can improve productivity and efficiency. Also, training the students and exposing them to real-life examples helps to 
change their behavior and intention towards the adoption of AI and that can be done by offering workshops and 
tutorials that involve the use of the various AI technologies and interactive demonstrations can help them immerse 
themselves into the world of artificial intelligence. Changing the perception of the students to perceive the AI tools as 
easy to use can also be done by training and familiarizing them with AI tools and how they work by offering step-by-
step guidance and also by exposing them to AI tools with a user-friendly interface that is simple to navigate with low 
complexity and instructions to guide the users. Furthermore, highlighting the practical use of AI tools in solving real-
life problems and the benefits obtained can help people’s perception of how it is easy to use AI tools and also an 
illustration of how AI tools automate tasks, save time, and improve the decision making is helpful to persuade the 
students to adopt AI. In addition, it is recommended that policymakers offer a new introductory course (as a 
fundamental course) about applications of AI tools by concentrating on the social aspects, such as ethical issues and 
students' behavior when using AI tools in their studies. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research identified key factors and challenges affecting AI adoption in Omani higher education, confirmed 
through literature and expert interviews, with some factors being notably more significant. Some factors and 
challenges were mentioned more frequently than others, highlighting the considerable effect of those specific factors 
and challenges. The top management of higher education institutions and the government should focus more on 
training and raising awareness of AI technologies to help change the behavior and perspective of the stakeholders and 
affect their intention to adopt AI tools. This study provides managerial insights and paves the way for the Omani 
government toward new horizons in the field of AI technologies, according to the vision of Oman 2040. Limitations 
included a shortage of experts which should be considered in interpreting the findings. As a foundation for further 
research, future work will utilize the TAM and TOE frameworks to assess institutions' intentions to adopt AI tools 
and develop strategies to address the identified challenges. Research endeavors should incorporate additional 
theoretical frameworks, such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and The Theory 
of Planned Behavior (TBP).

Abstract 
With the growing demand for flexible learning environments in higher education, asynchronous online courses have  
become increasingly popular, particularly among graduate students. This study investigates student preferences and  
the perceived effectiveness of various learning tools in an asynchronous graduate-level Engineering Economy course. 
We surveyed students and collected data across different demographics, including age, employment status, and degree 
level, to understand why they enrolled in asynchronous learning formats and their preferred methods for accessing 
course materials. Students rated the effectiveness of key learning tools, such as recorded video lectures, online 
discussion forums, virtual office hours, and interactive assignments, using a Likert scale. Additionally, they provided 
feedback on challenges faced during the course, including time management, peer interaction, and technical issues. 
The survey also explored students' overall satisfaction with the flexibility provided by the asynchronous format and 
their confidence in mastering the course material.  The findings aim to offer educators actionable insights into which 
tools students indicated most effectively enhanced their learning and how the unique challenges of asynchronous 
education might be addressed. By better understanding student needs and preferences, this research contributes to 
improving the design and delivery of asynchronous courses, ensuring a learning experience that is both flexible and 
of high quality. These insights will be crucial for educators seeking to develop more inclusive and effective online 
learning environments for graduate students, balancing the demands of professional and academic commitments.

6. Conclusion  
This study explored how students engage with asynchronous learning tools in a graduate-level Engineering Economy 
course, highlighting both reportedly effective and ineffective resources / modes of learning. Recorded video lectures 
and supplemental reading materials emerged as the most effective tools, while limited peer interaction and challenges 
in understanding course material were identified as key areas requiring better support. These findings reflect the 
growing demand for flexibility in higher education, as many graduate students balance full-time work, family 
responsibilities, and academic commitments, making asynchronous courses not only an essential option, but one that 
requires further attention for improvement. 
The research offers practical recommendations to enhance the design and delivery of asynchronous courses. 
Incorporating structured opportunities for peer interaction such as small group discussions and peer review activities 
can foster collaboration and a sense of connection among students. Providing additional resources like interactive 
tutorials and practice problems can help students navigate complex concepts while offering more flexible office hours 
can ensure support is accessible for those with demanding schedules. These strategies aim to improve engagement, 
comprehension, and accessibility for students from diverse backgrounds. 
In the broader context of engineering education, this research highlights the importance of asynchronous courses in 
providing flexibility and access to a diverse group of learners. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing 
thoughtful improvements not only enhances the learning experience but also ensures courses remain inclusive and 
adaptable to students’ varied needs. By adopting these changes, educators can design courses that empower students 
to succeed academically and professionally, ultimately contributing to the broader goal of making engineering 
education more inclusive, relevant, and impactful.

Abstract 
Even during minor seismic events, buildings and towering structures are destroyed by earthquakes. For 
structures to withstand seismic vibration, they must be strengthened to the greatest extent feasible. Seismic 
retrofitting refers to the process of enhancing the earthquake resistance of buildings with external 
connections. Traditional seismic retrofitting techniques are frequently inefficient and costly. The phrase 
""energy dissipation"" is commonly used. Significant advances have been made in the field of energy 
dissipating devices. New retrofitting techniques and dampers have emerged in recent years. Dampers are 
retrofitted devices that both increase a structure's resistance to seismic vibrations and dissipate energy. In 
this investigation, a building model was fitted with three distinct types of dampers and then subjected to 
seismic loading. To determine the most effective attenuation configuration, the responses and outcomes of 
all cases were recorded and compared. A model of a thirty-story building was constructed in SAP software, 
and all specified loads were applied to it. Accelerogram were obtained following an analysis of time history 
without dampers. Different responses, including storey displacements, drifts, and pseudo spectral 
accelerations, were obtained using the same retrofitting procedure on the same structure. Responses for 
three distinct damping configurations were obtained. Time history analysis was repeated for each of the 
three configurations. Comparing the retrofitted structure to the unmodified structure, the seismic response 
was drastically reduced. The analysis revealed that seismic responses were substantially reduced by 
retrofitting.

Abstract 
 This paper explores the application of simulation modeling of an economic system using the aspects of Agent-based 
modeling. The developed model relies on the aggregated behavior of the agents and provides a what-if analysis tool 
that can be used by a policy maker to tackle economic phenomenon such as economic stratification. The model uses 
both macroeconomic and microeconomic measures in diagnosing the economic situation. The economical level of 
each agent is taken into consideration which discriminates the contribution of this model in addressing the 
phenomenon in an integrated way.

Agent-based Modelling, Economic environment simulation, policymaking, Economic Stratification. 
1. Introduction
For studying and forecasting economic results in the modern world, simulation has always been a crucial tool. 
Economic models are used to extensively rely on historical data and statistical analysis to forecast future trends, with 
the accuracy varying with the magnitude of the data. Yet, by simulating the intricate relationships between economic 
entities and their surroundings, simulation offers a more dynamic method of doing economic research. Simulating 
real-world economic situations entails creating a virtual environment. This setting may be used to examine the effects 
of different policy choices, market circumstances, and economic shocks. Researchers may experiment with economic 
systems via simulation, which can reveal important details about how these systems function. Simulation models are 
used in the economic environment because they allow for the testing of policy decisions' effects prior to their

governmental entities compared to private investments. This is also coupled with high rates of financial abandonment 
in which it reaches 12% and keeps rising dramatically as time elapses. However, 83% of the agents were contributing 
to the economy. This can be a sign indicating that some individuals lack access to opportunities and resources that are 
being offered to the more affluent groups in society who are the high-income class. 
 
For the second scenario, the average stable income multiplier of 100 RO for low-income households is increased to 
15. less governmental attention is paid to the low-income households in this case, and it accounts for 43% of the total 
governmental interactions. Furthermore, 70% of the governmental resources are utilized to sustain the economy and 
this is coupled with the increase of collective contribution to the economy reaching a high percentage of 95.7%. This 
also explains the decreased abandonment rate of financial institutions reaching a rate of less than 3%. The economic 
system is able to absorb and meet the local needs reaching a level of 95.7%. However, only 40% of the total investment 
are made by the governmental entities comparing to private investments. Thus, in this particular case less economic 
stratification is to be witnessed and raising the stable income threshold of low-income households can be a successful 
policy to tackle unequal distribution of wealth, income and opportunities. 
 
For the last scenario, the needed stable income multiplier of 100 RO for individuals and firms is set to be at 60 and 
the average stable income is kept at 10. Similar to the first scenario, governmental attention is paid to the low-income 
households, and this is illustrated by the governmental interactions between the two agents, it reaches a maximum 
value of 244%. Furthermore, 85% of the governmental resources are being utilized to address this concern. This also 
explains the decreased percentages of economic absorptive with which it reaches a peak value 86.9%. Only 40% of 
the total investments are made by the governmental entities compared to private investments. This is also coupled 
with high rates of financial abandonment in which it reaches 16.5% and keeps rising dramatically as time passes; this 
occurs due to the fact that both medium-income individual and medium-profit firms have not been able to acquire 
loans and financial institution stressed on the tight criterion of having 60000 as a net present value. This may imply 
that economic resources and opportunities are concentrated in the hands of a small, affluent group of agents (with 
high-income), and this can limit the ability of the wider population to access knowledge, technologies, and 
investments. However almost 96% of the agents were contributing positively to the economy, especially the high-
income agents who are taking the lead of the economy.

6. Conclusion 
To conclude, the aim of this paper was to develop an empirical simulation tool using agent-based modelling to tackle 
the phenomenon of economic stratification. The Simulation model can demonstrate insightful outputs that represent 
measures of economic stratification with which a policy maker can test his/her policies and their impacts. The

complexity of the addressed phenomenon is dissolved by selecting appropriate measures and indicators that any user 
can relate to them. However, the developed simulation model can be further extended to include more agents and 
economic aspects. Moreover, the model has the potential in investigating the impact of politics in such an economic 
situation, with the present of realistic parameters that would assist in the validating the simulation model. As was 
previously mentioned, the intricate realities of economic systems can be captured by incorporating agent 
heterogeneity, which involves integrating diverse agent characteristics to reflect real-world complexity. Modeling 
realistic market dynamics, including price fluctuations and competition, is crucial for understanding the behavior of 
markets, also experimenting with different policy interventions allows for the assessment of their impact on economic 
outcomes, providing valuable insights into potential policy effects. Introducing the element of randomness into the 
model simulates uncertainty and stochastic events, would add a layer of realism to the analysis, with which researchers 
can gain profound insights into the dynamics of economic stratification and the potential effects of various policies 
and interventions.

Abstract 
As 3D printing technology advances, the demand for precise, reliable production methods grows, with tighter product 
specifications and higher quality standards becoming essential. This study focuses on students learning experience as 
they explore the statistical analysis of process capabilities in 3D Printing, specifically assessing the accuracy and 
precision of vertically and horizontally printed objects. Through hands-on experimentation, students gain valuable 
skills in evaluating critical factors influencing 3D printer performance, such as geometry, material selection, and 
printer settings. The research enables students to assess the process limits of 3D printers and develop strategies to 
minimize variability and improve production quality. Students learn how these factors affect the final product by 
experimenting with different printer configurations, internal designs, and operational parameters. The study also 
highlights cost-effective solutions by identifying print settings that optimize performance and reduce defects. 
Ultimately, this learning experience deepens students understanding of 3D printing process control, enhances their 
ability to make data-driven decisions, and equips them with practical knowledge for improving efficiency in advanced

7. Conclusions 
The experiments on process capability using different infill patterns and orientations in 3D Printing provide a valuable 
learning experience for students studying statistics, quality control, and manufacturing processes. By measuring the 
dimensional accuracy of 3D-printed PLA discs and analyzing the data through Cp (process capability index) and Cpk 
(centering index), students gain hands-on exposure to the real-world application of statistical tools in manufacturing. 
The comparison of vertical and horizontal printing orientations highlights the importance of understanding and 
managing process variability. Students can see how data driven decisions, such as choosing the right print orientation, 
can significantly improve product quality. Patterns such as Cross and Concentric performed best in horizontal Printing, 
demonstrating how different design choices affect process outcomes, while vertical Printing showed challenges in 
maintaining consistent quality. This contrast provides a rich opportunity for students to interpret and analyze statistical 
results, identifying areas for improvement and optimization. Through this exercise, students apply statistical concepts 
like standard deviation, process capability, and Six Sigma and learn the importance of data collection, measurement 
precision, and critical thinking in addressing real-world manufacturing issues. This combination of theory and practice 
helps solidify their understanding of statistics and its role in ensuring quality in industrial applications. The hands-on 
exploration of 3D printing and process capability analysis offers students a rich learning experience that bridges 
theoretical concepts with real-world applications. Students understand how these factors influence printed objects 
accuracy, precision, and overall quality through experimenting with different infill patterns, orientations, and printer 
settings. Through data collection and statistical tools like Cp and Cpk, students develop practical skills in assessing 
and optimizing the performance of 3D printers. This approach enhances their ability to make data-driven decisions 
and fosters critical thinking in problem-solving for manufacturing processes.

Abstract 
This study intends to present a new approach to predicting stock prices via sentiment analysis and deep learning 
techniques within a dynamic framework. The approach addresses the inherent volatility and unpredictability of 
financial markets by incorporating the influence of both market sentiment and investor emotions on stock price 
changes. In today’s rapidly changing financial markets, the ability to accurately forecast stock prices is highly valued. 
Traders and investors continually search for new strategies to gain an advantage and make well-informed decisions. 
A prominent approach that has attracted significant attention involves integrating sentiment analysis with machine 
learning techniques. Through analyzing social media sentiment, articles, and pertinent data, researchers and analysts 
can provide significant insights into market movements and investor's state of mind machine learning methods are 
exploited in sentiment analysis to find out the text's emotional tone.

1. Introduction
Stock market price fluctuations have long-confounded financial experts, whose efforts to accurately predict these 
variations have achieved only modest success. Verma et al. (2020) introduced a method noted for its simplicity and 
practicality, offering a more accessible approach to stock market prediction. Simultaneously, Sebastian et al. (2020) 
investigated the integration of Machine Learning models with sentiment analysis for predicting future stock prices. 
Their work significantly advanced the field by evaluating different forecasting methods to enhance prediction 
accuracy. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, there has been a notable increase in research focused on stock 
market prediction, further affirming its potential viability. 
For example, Gurav et al. (2020) presented a sentiment-aware forecasting model that employs a Log Bilinear model 
to capture and learn short-term sentiment patterns in stock data. Further, Wang et al. (2021) explored the potential of 
combining social media analytics with sentiment analysis to forecast market trends, offering a knowledge-based 
approach to trend prediction. Munde et al. (2021) extended this line of inquiry by examining automated methods for 
stock market analysis, further highlighting the evolving landscape of predictive techniques in financial markets. 
Moreover, the forecasting of stock markets may be enhanced by integrating machine learning with fundamental and/or 
technical analysis. Business, computer science, statistics, and finance are among the disciplines that often address the

Chains

Abstract 
The complexity of supply chains, consisting of retailers, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, and suppliers, 
poses a significant challenge to effective coordination and management. One of the most widely recognized issues 
in these systems is the bullwhip effect, where small fluctuations in consumer demand can cause amplified variations 
in orders as they propagate upstream through the supply chain. This phenomenon results in distorted demand 
information, excessive inventory, increased production costs, and inefficient resource allocation, all of which 
compromise the overall performance of supply chains. The bullwhip effect is primarily influenced by factors such 
as order batching, long lead times, price variations, and demand signal processing, with the latter being one of the 
most critical contributors. In demand signal processing, forecasts at one stage of the supply chain are based on the 
orders received from the immediate downstream partner rather than the actual customer demand. Previous research 
on the bullwhip effect has largely focused on multi-echelon supply chains with independent and identically 
distributed (i.i.d.) demand patterns, but the effects of correlated demand, where demand in one period is dependent 
on the demand in previous periods, remain underexplored— especially in multi-echelon systems. While some 
studies have addressed correlated demand in single-echelon systems, the gap in understanding its impact on multi-
echelon supply chains under various operational conditions remains significant. This research aims to fill this gap 
by investigating the impact of correlated demand on the dynamic performance of multi-echelon supply chains. 
Specifically, the research examines how correlated demand—modeled using a first-order autoregressive AR(1) 
demand process—affects the bullwhip effect in a multi-echelon system. The study also explores how collaboration 
and information sharing between supply chain partners can mitigate the adverse effects of demand distortion, 
providing insights into strategies for improving supply chain management practices. The research employs a 
simulation modeling approach to analyze these dynamics. The simulation model represents a multi-echelon supply 
chain operating under a generalized order-up-to (OUT) policy and integrates a moving average forecasting method 
at each echelon. This allows for a detailed examination of how correlated demand and varying levels of information 
sharing between supply chain partners influence the bullwhip effect and the overall performance of the supply chain. 
The model incorporates several key variables, including the nature of demand, forecasting techniques, and ordering 
policies, which are analyzed under different operational and collaborative scenarios. This research is expected to 
contribute to the body of knowledge on the bullwhip effect by providing a more comprehensive understanding of 
how correlated demand impacts multi-echelon supply chains. The study also highlights the potential benefits of 
collaborative practices such as information sharing of customer demand, forecasting method and ordering policies, 
which may help to reduce the negative consequences of demand amplification. By investigating these factors, the

Abstract 
There is an increase in the emphasis on Sustainability that has led companies to re-evaluate their Supply Chain 
Operations which gives rise to the Green Supply Chain Management practices (GSCM). By examining the various 
industries in the Sultanate of Oman, this study aims to understand how eco-friendly sourcing, waste reduction and 
sustainable logistics contribute to both economic performance and environmental responsibility. On the other hand, 
there is also an increased awareness among the consumers on usage of sustainable goods. According to ‘The 
Economist Intelligence Unit’, there has been a 71% rise in online searches for sustainable goods globally. 
Environment stability is a high priority for many consumers, and it has translated into the responsibility of all the 
business partners to lower their carbon footprint. This study will make use of secondary data, and the research will 
explore the potential benefits of adopting Green Supply Chain such as cost savings, improving the brand reputation 
and regulatory compliance. This research will also identify the challenges that these companies will face when 
implementing Green Supply Chain practices. These findings will offer valuable insights for businesses that seek to 
balance operational efficiency with long term sustainability goals in the global economy.

Abstract 
In recent years, management in restaurant industry has found itself in an extremely harsh environment and faces the 
important challenge of finding out how to attract consumers. It is assumed that ways to attract consumers to restaurants 
are to create attractive and individualistic restaurants and menus. From this context, we previously proposed models 
(Kwon and Yamashita 2014, Kwon 2015) that analyzes the influence restaurant menu design, the menu profile and 
the messages it carries have to consumers’ selection behavior. On the other hand, the emotional state of consumers 
somehow impacts their own decision making and actions. Therefore, we analyzed the menu selection behavior of 
consumers in positive and negative emotional states (Kwon, Kawanaka and Yamashita 2019). This study focuses on 
consumers’ nostalgic feeling and analyzes the effect that consumers’ nostalgia has on their menu selection behavior, 
along with the impact that this has on how messages (fuzzy messages) are received. To achieve this, we first test 
subjects by evoking nostalgic feeling through the application of stimuli. Next, we conduct a questionnaire on the 
attractiveness of a restaurant menu using the menu profile designed by the L8(27) type orthogonal array of the 
experimental design method, and analyze the collected data.

Abstract 
This research presents a quantitative analysis of state-level competitiveness across Mexico’s 32 states, based on data 
spanning 22 years. By exploring key economic, educational, and infrastructural variables, we develop a predictive 
model that estimates patent generation per 100,000 inhabitants, identifying the most influential factors driving 
innovation. The study employs exploratory data analysis, parametric statistics, and multiple linear regression to 
uncover insights into how regional competitiveness affects patent output, a proxy for innovation capacity. Our findings 
suggest that states with higher levels of academic performance, talent availability and economic diversification 
demonstrate significantly stronger innovation potential. To further clarify regional disparities, we propose a novel 
classification system that categorizes states into three tiers of innovation strength: Leading, Intermediate and Lagging. 
This classification provides policymakers with a tool to better understand innovation dynamics and tailor strategies 
for fostering technological growth at the state level. The results of this study are particularly relevant for regions 
seeking to enhance their innovation ecosystems by identifying and leveraging key drivers of patent generation. This 
model not only contributes to the existing literature on regional competitiveness and innovation but also offers 
practical insights for policymakers aiming to strengthen innovation capacity in emerging economies.

Abstract 
As new settlement areas emerge, it is crucial to design the necessary electricity infrastructure effectively. These areas 
are divided into grids, each defined as a rectangle or square of uniform dimensions. This study focuses on optimizing 
the placement and assignment of low voltage distribution transformers (DTRs) based on forecasted electricity 
consumption for each grid. Key constraints include ensuring that forecasted loads are allocated to one or more DTRs, 
that DTR capacities are not exceeded, that assignments remain within a limited range of grids, and that all loads within 
a grid are fully assigned. We develop a mathematical programming model aimed at identifying the cost-minimizing 
solution for DTR placement and load assignment.

Abstract 
There are currently many legacy facilities operating in the Middle East & Africa region that have plans in place to 
extend the plant life. Oil prices have been steadily going up, leading to increases in production, and driving economic 
growth. In order to extend the life of these older facilities, the sites are budgeting to replace critical parts accordingly. 
Obsolescence is an inevitable part of every product lifecycle and, with the new wave of technology and AI in the 
market, facilities face the challenge of increasing profitability in the fast-paced economy. The number of more efficient 
upgrades available presents an opportunity for strengthening supplier and customer relationships and increasing 
aftermarket revenues for suppliers. A large amount of data exists regarding the suppliers' installed base at the customer 
facility, however, navigating that data and adequately communicating the value of obsolescence management both 
internally within the supplier company and externally to the customer comes with a set of challenges. By investigating 
the current internal obsolescence management strategies at the supplier, the respective pain points attributed to big 
data management and internal/external communications will be addressed with the implementation of a framework to 
streamline the process. A streamlined flow of communication with a customer focused approach from information to 
orders pertaining to obsolescence will ultimately increase aftermarket revenues for the supplier and increase customer 
satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Obsolescence is an inevitable part of the lifecycle management of critical process components. The reasons for 
obsolescence can vary, leaving asset management and reliability teams at industrial facilities having to scramble to 
identify their obsolete assets and replacements in time for routine maintenance activities. Many questions can arise 
like: Who to contact? Which parts are available? How long does it take for them to arrive? Will they arrive on time? 
How much downtime will this cause? How much will this cost? Are there any other obsolete devices that we are not 
aware of? These are issues that are currently faced by facilities maintenance teams, and it presents an opportunity for 
suppliers to strengthen their relations with customers and increase customer satisfaction by taking a proactive approach 
towards obsolescence management from the supplier end.   
Supplier lifecycle management teams provide customers with various aftermarket products & services to ensure the 
longevity of their devices and respective facilities through maintenance, reliability, and throughput solutions. The 
suppliers also provide Shutdown, Turnaround, and Outage (STO) services which are critical for the customers’ facility 
health. STOs are typically planned months and sometimes years in advance so it is advantageous to plan around the 
activity as soon as possible to minimize facility downtime. Some of the STO planning components include part 
lifecycle auditing, criticality ranking, and delivery. Facilities perform major upgrades during STOs, where all down 
time is equivalent to a loss of production and therefore a loss of profits. In many cases, due to a lack of thorough

Figure 6. Obsolescence Management Plan 
Ultimately, effective obsolescence management necessitates collaboration among stakeholders, as it drives continuous 
improvement across the supply chain and ensures assets operate efficiently, safely, and in compliance with 
international regulations. 
8. Conclusions
Maintenance has been steadily evolving with current technology allowing facilities to manage their assets through 
condition monitoring through diagnostics enabled by machine learning and data driven analytics. By upgrading 
devices that can provide data and run analytics, facilities can foresee problems and fix them accordingly. This 
advancement in asset management capabilities requires an effective method for phasing out obsolete assets, such as 
to maintain productivity, increase profitability, and increase operational efficiency (Figure 7). 
Figure 7. Evolution of Maintenance 
Given the new wave of digital transformation and AI penetrating the industrial automation market, suppliers should 
ensure their readiness to commit to their customers’ needs. Optimizing parts replacements and upgrade replacements 
deliveries requires planning far in advance between the customer and the supplier. In this fast-paced economy, there 
is very little room for operational delays as every additional minute of downtime at a facility can be incredibly costly. 
A streamlined communication process between suppliers and customers can ensure a smooth transition for facility life 
extensions and revamps. Maximizing visibility of supplier installed base at customer facility allows the supplier and 
the customer to work together to devise obsolescence management roll outs within budget constraints, around routine 
maintenance activities, and with just-in-time deliveries.

Abstract 
In healthcare, the location and capacity of warehouses are crucial to ensure timely delivery of essential medical 
supplies, reduce transportation costs, and manage demand fluctuations. This project addresses the challenge of 
determining the optimal number, capacity, and locations of medical supplies warehouses in Muscat, Oman, 
considering real-world constraints such as transportation costs, warehouse costs, and fluctuating demand. Using a 
discrete location optimization model and CPLEX solver, we developed a cost-effective solution that balances 
proximity to healthcare facilities with logistical efficiency. The solution includes both rental and newly constructed 
warehouses in key locations like Ghala, Mabailah, and Khoudh. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that demand 
variations significantly impact warehouse decisions and costs, highlighting the importance of accurate demand 
forecasting. Our proposed strategy enhances supply chain responsiveness and reduces costs, contributing to a more 
efficient healthcare system in the region.

Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Driving Change and 
Growth 
Abstract 
Definition of Innovation 
Innovation refers to the process of creating new ideas, products, services, or processes that bring value and 
improvements. It is not just about inventing something completely new; it can also be about improving existing ideas 
to solve problems more efficiently or effectively. Innovation requires creativity, a vision for change, and a willingness 
to experiment with new methods. 
Definition of Entrepreneurship 
Entrepreneurship is the activity of setting up and running a new business or venture with the goal of making a profit 
or creating a positive impact. It involves identifying opportunities, taking risks, managing resources, and working 
toward sustainable growth. Entrepreneurs are often seen as the drivers of innovation, as they bring new products and 
ideas to market and help them reach consumers. 
Purpose and Importance 
In today’s fast-paced world, innovation and entrepreneurship are essential for economic growth, job creation, and 
tackling social challenges. They push boundaries, introduce new ways of living and working, and provide solutions 
to complex problems. Nations and businesses that prioritize innovation often find themselves more competitive, 
adaptable, and resilient in the face of global challenges. 
Mutual Dependence 
Innovation and entrepreneurship are closely linked. Entrepreneurs rely on innovation to offer something unique in the 
marketplace, differentiating their products or services from competitors. Conversely, innovation needs the platform 
that entrepreneurship provides; without entrepreneurs, many innovative ideas would not reach consumers or create 
real-world impact. 
Examples 
Major companies like Apple, Tesla, and Google exemplify the powerful synergy between innovation and 
entrepreneurship. Apple’s iPhone, for instance, revolutionized mobile technology, but it was the entrepreneurial vision 
and execution of Steve Jobs that turned it into a market-leading product. Similarly, Tesla’s electric vehicles represent 
cutting-edge technology driven by Elon Musk’s entrepreneurial drive to reshape the automobile industry.

Abstract 
This research studies the effect of friction stir processing (FSP) on the mechanical properties of LM-25 aluminum 
alloy. The research is conducted by trying different processing parameters (spindle speed and feed rate) settings to 
observe the effect of such parameters on the alloy. A tensile test and a Vickers hardness test are carried out to analyze 
the result of the FSP on the mechanical properties of the alloy. The results show a notable improvement in the 
mechanical properties and show a relation between the processing parameters and the mechanical properties of the 
alloy. Improvement in strength, toughness, and hardness of the alloy is linked directly to the parameters of the friction 
stir processing of the alloy.

1. Introduction
Aluminum alloys are nonferrous metals that have a large spectrum of applications and are heavily utilized in multiple 
industries. Aluminum is considered a sustainable material since its recycling process does not affect its quality nor its 
quantity and saves about 95% of the energy required to produce it from ore (Black et al. 2017). Noting that aluminum 
and its alloys are the second in global expenditure and quantity after steel and are used in most industries like 
automotive, aerospace, construction and electrical applications etc. (Latif et al. 2022). 
The joining of different alloys and metals brings a combination of higher properties of both metals to the product. 
However, the joining process by fusion or welding can be difficult due to the difference in physical and chemical 
properties of the metals (Jadidi et al. 2022). Friction stir welding (FSW) created joints with better mechanical 
properties than the parent material (Yogesh et al. 2022), which lead researchers to study the ability to improve the 
metal’s properties using Friction Stir Processing (FSP). FSW is a process that plastically deforms two objects by 
generating heat between the tool and the work piece (Choy et al. 2022). 
The technique reviewed in this paper is friction stir processing. FSP is a process derived from friction stir welding 
used to modify the microstructure of the material (Sharma et al. 2020). FSP can be used to process material and change 
its mechanical or physical properties. In this study, tensile specimens were cut according to ASTM – E8 standards 
from the aluminum alloys (LM25) plates that were processed under different processing parameters.

4.3 Proposed Improvements 
After observing the above results, the following improvements can be proposed: 
The tool used in the process can be updated by adding features to the pin profile; like threads, or it can be tapered, or 
grooves can be added to the shoulder. These different features on the could influence the mechanical properties. 
Moreover, a study can be conducted on the microstructure of the material and establish a relation between the 
processing parameters, tool profile, and nature of microstructure. The current test examined specimens that were only 
processed in the center. Further tests can be conducted on specimens that have been fully processed by FSP and 
observe the change in mechanical properties. 
 
4.4 Validation 
Based on the literature, Friction stir process is directly linked to improvement of processed material or even the 
processed regions of the material. The initial hypothesis of this study was that FSP will improve the mechanical 
properties of LM-25. This research proved the hypothesis, hence achieving a positive effect on the mechanical 
properties of the aluminum alloy LM-25 after being processed. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Friction Stir processing is considered an advanced technique to process metallic parts in the manufacturing industry. 
FSP is used to manipulate the mechanical properties of alloys to achieve superior characteristics in automotive and 
aeronautical applications. In this research, we concluded that first; we can improve the strength and toughness of the 
material, hence handling higher loads. Second, FSP can increase the hardness of the products via creating a more 
indentation resistant surface. Third, there is a direct link between the processing parameters with the mechanical 
properties. These conclusions are that a high spindle speed is directly linked to an increase in surface hardness and a 
low spindle speed, and a low feed rate setting can be directly linked to the increase in material strength. The latter is 
true since the process is considerably slow causing more friction to happen and more distortion to occur in the material 
leading to strain hardening.

Abstract 
The automotive industry is among the sectors most significantly impacted by challenges related to its global supply 
chains, which are characterized by complex multi-tiered supplier networks and fragmented data systems. The 
integration of components from numerous suppliers, combined with reliance on a limited number of part-time 
providers, results in operational inefficiencies that compromise safety, quality, and brand integrity. These challenges 
manifest in issues such as restricted visibility, traceability concerns, and the proliferation of counterfeit parts. This 
study examines the potential for transforming automotive supply chains through the decentralization and enhancement 
of transparency, immutability, and audit capabilities afforded by blockchain technology. Employing a theory-building 
qualitative research methodology, the paper elucidates how the integration of blockchain and smart contracts can 
facilitate end-to-end traceability and compliance enforcement across organizations, thereby strengthening the 
coordination between Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers. The primary insights reveal that 
the implementation of blockchain can diminish the risk associated with counterfeit components, enhance the efficiency 
of logistics operations, and optimize inventory management practices. The feasibility of the proposed framework is 
further substantiated through a case study of BMW's PartChain Initiative. The findings underscore the potential of 
blockchain technology to fundamentally transform the automotive industry by introducing enhanced efficiency, 
security, and transparency within the supply chain.

1. Introduction
The realm of automotive manufacturing is characterized by some of the most complex global supply chains, 
comprising multiple tiers that extend from raw material suppliers through component manufacturers to assembly 
plants. However, conventional supply chain methodologies exhibit significant deficiencies in adapting to these 
intricate multi-tiered networks, where maintaining traceability, transparency, and quality proves to be a formidable 
challenge. Legacy systems are often compartmentalized, resulting in blind spots and collaboration difficulties within 
organizations. Concurrently, these challenges adversely affect operational efficiency and escalate risks pertaining to 
safety, brand integrity, and financial stability, including the proliferation of counterfeit components (FIA 2017). 
A viable solution to these challenges is presented by blockchain technology, which offers a transparent and tamper-
resistant log through a distributed ledger that meticulously records the entire transaction history of each component 
throughout its lifecycle. This integration enhances traceability from production through to the end user and mitigates 
the prevalence of counterfeit components (Staake et al. 2009). Furthermore, it facilitates the automatic enforcement 
of quality standards compliance via smart contracts. This capability enables real-time data sharing and process

blockchain ensures data integrity and builds trust among stakeholders.  Table 2 summarizes the key differences 
between traditional and blockchain-integrated supply chain models, highlighting how blockchain technology 
addresses the inefficiencies of traditional systems.  
4.4.1 Technical Implementation Considerations and Challenges 
Implementing blockchain technology in the automotive supply chain brings significant benefits but also presents 
several challenges that need careful attention. Key considerations include integrating blockchain with existing 
systems, ensuring scalability, maintaining data privacy, and addressing stakeholder concerns. 
 
One of the main challenges is integrating blockchain with current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Supply 
Chain Management (SCM) systems. Rather than replacing these systems entirely, companies can use Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs) and middleware to connect blockchain technology with their existing setups. This 
approach allows for a gradual adoption process, minimizing disruptions and helping employees adapt smoothly to 
new workflows. Scalability and performance are critical due to the high volume of transactions in automotive supply 
chains. Permissioned blockchains offer enhanced speed and efficiency through consensus mechanisms designed for 
trusted environments, like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Raft. Techniques such as sharding can 
distribute the workload, increasing throughput and ensuring the blockchain system can handle enterprise-level 
demands without slowing down. 
 
Data privacy and security are paramount when dealing with sensitive business information and personal data. 
Protecting this data through encryption and digital signatures prevents unauthorized access and ensures authenticity. 
Permissioned blockchains provide controlled access, which helps companies comply with regulations like the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) while still benefiting from blockchain's transparency (European Parliament 
2016). Stakeholder resistance, particularly from suppliers concerned about data sharing and competitive 
disadvantages, is another challenge. To mitigate this, fostering collaboration through open communication and formal 
agreements on data confidentiality is essential. Demonstrating the benefits of blockchain—such as faster payments 
and reduced administrative tasks—can help alleviate concerns. Implementing robust data security measures further 
reassures stakeholders about the protection of sensitive information. 
 
A lack of technical expertise within organizations can hinder blockchain adoption. Investing in training programs and 
collaborating with technology partners can address this gap, ensuring smooth integration and providing ongoing 
support. Additionally, the absence of industry-wide standards may impede interoperability between different 
blockchain systems. Participating in industry groups like the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) can 
promote common standards, enhancing compatibility and scalability across the industry. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The automotive supply chain can be radically transformed by using blockchain technology to increase transparency, 
security and operational efficiency. With a decentralized and immutable ledger at its core, businesses can enjoy full 
traceability through every tier of the supply chain — reducing counterfeit component risks and building trust among 
stakeholders. This paper analyses BMW's PartChain Initiative and provides evidence of tangible value from 
blockchain in current supply chain systems - smart contracts automating many logistics, inventory management, and 
compliance steps. 
 
While there are some technical challenges that remain to access and integrate reliable information and data for example 
on privacy protection, but these can be mitigated with adequate planning, stakeholder engagement/awareness 
processes and regulation. Ultimately, industry practitioners should consider getting all stakeholders in the supply chain 
involved early on in their adoption experience process, invest in interoperable blockchain platforms, and foster training 
to educate human resources with the technical expertise needed within organizations. More broadly, the next steps for 
research include long-term effects of blockchain use and cross-industry applications where the benefits can have a 
greater impact and technology improvements that help scalability and interoperability. The introduction of blockchain 
technology not only ensures high standards in quality assurance, but also reduces inefficiencies and fosters vital 
collaborations throughout the supply chain within automakers to drive innovation as the industry gears up for a rapidly 
growing global market.

Abstract 
This study investigates the factors influencing safety compliance among airfield workers at Muscat International 
Airport, with the goal of enhancing adherence to essential safety protocols in this high-risk environment. Safety 
violations are often driven by behavioral factors rather than management deficiencies, making it crucial to 
understand what influences compliance behavior. The research was conducted in three phases. The first phase 
involved a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify key factors affecting safety compliance, which were 
then categorized. In the second phase, data was collected from airfield staff through an online survey, which was 
analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). SEM was employed 
to assess the significance of factors such as the work environment, individual attributes, and organizational 
culture. The ANN model was developed to create a predictive framework for monitoring compliance over time. 
The results indicate that the work environment is the most significant factor affecting safety compliance, followed 
by individual attributes. Based on these insights, a continuous improvement framework is proposed, involving 
collaboration among the People and Culture, Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE), and Airfield Operations 
departments. These departments would monitor and address safety behaviors through targeted initiatives informed 
by the predictive model. This proactive, data-driven approach aims to foster a strong safety culture and enhance 
operational standards at Muscat International Airport.

Abstract 
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are conditions that affect the muscles, bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments, often 
causing pain, discomfort, or impaired movement, typically due to repetitive strain, overuse, or injury. According to 
the World Health Organization, there are more than 1.7 billion people who suffer from MSDs. In our study, we focused 
on measuring MSDs with a modified version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and improving the 
work environment in an office in Kuwait. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), which was developed 
by The Nordic Council of Ministers, is commonly used for assessing musculoskeletal troubles in nine body parts over 
the last 12 months and the last 7 days. The original NMQ also evaluates whether the trouble prevented the person 
from doing his/her normal work (at home or away from home) over the last 12 months, while the modified version 
that we proposed in this study collects the same information for both the last 12 months and the last 7 days as well. 
According to the data we collected from 38 participants in the preliminary stage of our study, our modified version of 
the NMQ collects more information than the original NMQ without increasing the data collection time statistically 
significantly as the paired t-test resulted in a p-value which is greater than 0.05. Using the modified version of NMQ 
in an office in Kuwait, we identified the most troublesome body parts of 50 workers—none of them belong to our 
preliminary study with 38 participants—as neck, shoulders, upper back, and lower back. Based on our results, we 
provided ergonomic improvement suggestions including lumbar support, neck support, and stretching exercises. We 
also conducted an ergonomic awareness seminar for the workers and gave them leaflets and posters for stretching and 
keeping a healthy posture while at work and any other location. MSDs develop over time and, if uncontrolled, worsen 
as the person ages. We think that the workers that we have contacted will have improved quality of life and less 
musculoskeletal trouble in the following years of their careers and personal lives. A follow-up study may be conducted 
after several years to see the improvement if the same workers can be reached at that time.

3.3 Improving the workplace 
The existing chairs in the office were padded and supported with armrests, but they didn’t have a lumbar support or a 
headrest. Sitting on such a chair for an extended period in an uncomfortable posture can cause MSDs. In addition, 
prolonged use of keyboards and computers can hurt the musculoskeletal system. Stretching and doing physical 
exercises can reduce the risk of work-related MSDs. At the workplace, the workers were allowed rest time. However, 
they didn’t use this time for stretching or exercising.  
 
Amick III et al. (2003) reported that an ergonomics training can reduce pain levels although it is not as effective as 
ergonomic furniture in reducing the growth of symptoms within a day. We first focused on increasing the ergonomics 
awareness among the workers and then made recommendations to the management about ergonomic furniture. Based 
on the recommendations from the literature (ISO, 2021; CDC, 2024; Mahmud, et al., 2011; Taifa & Desai, 2017; 
Shikdar & Al-Kindi, 2007) we conducted an office ergonomics training for all workers, beginning with an explanation 
of how Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) are developed and how to avoid them. We emphasized the importance of 
maintaining a proper sitting posture to prevent back pain and other musculoskeletal issues. Key points included 
avoiding posterior pelvic tilt by sitting as far back in the chair as possible, yet still ensuring the back of the knees 
doesn’t touch the seat rest, removing armrests if they prevent the chair from moving under the desk, and adjusting the 
seat height with the help of a cushion so that forearms can rest on the desk with elbows at 90 degrees. We highlighted 
the importance of keeping knees at a right angle and heels touching the ground when ankles are at 90 degrees, 
suggesting a footrest if feet don’t reach the ground. To avoid shoulder tension and forward head posture, we 
recommended placing the keyboard and mouse close enough to keep elbows beside the body. We also discussed the 
importance of keeping wrists straight in line with the forearm and supporting the wrist with something soft at the base 
of the palm. We also discussed that the screen should be at arm’s length distance and the top of the screen at eye level 
to avoid eye strain and neck issues. We also recommended elevating laptops with a stand or books and installing a 
phone app to remind about posture checks and breaks for exercises. 
  
We also advised the workers to focus on good nutrition, adequate sleep, hydration, avoiding smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight; as well as keeping the work environment clean and conducive to worker health. These tips may 
effectively help improve overall health and may have a good effect on their work productivity. 
 
As the old Chinese proverb goes “The faintest ink is better than the strongest memory”, we gave each worker a booklet 
with advice on how to reduce musculoskeletal pain through exercise at work or home. We also made a poster with 
quick muscle-stretching exercises they could perform during breaks. By following these guidelines, workers can 
improve their posture and reduce the risk of developing MSDs, leading to a more comfortable and productive work 
environment. 
 
Other than these general tips that apply to most office workers, we also made recommendations based on the results 
of the simplified modified NMQ. As mentioned in section 3.2 of this paper, the body parts that were reported to have 
musculoskeletal trouble most among the 50 workers in this office were the neck, shoulders, lower back, and upper 
back. The first idea that came to our mind was to recommend replacing the existing chairs in the office with fully 
ergonomic chairs. However, considering the budget of the office and the environmental impact of discarding 50 chairs, 
we recommended improving the existing chairs by adding lumbar support, neck support, adjustable elbow rests, and 
an option to adjust the height of the seat. The office management appreciated our efforts and implemented the lumbar 
support immediately. However, for the other improvement suggestions, they preferred to bide their time and see the 
effect of the ergonomic training first. We hope that our positive impact will make the workers in this workplace healthy 
and set an example for other workplaces to follow. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, we proposed a modified version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and showed that 
it can help collect more data without increasing the data collection time statistically significantly.  
 
We also improved the work environment in an office in Kuwait by addressing Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) 
among office workers. Using the modified NMQ, we collected data from 50 office workers and identified the most 
common areas of pain. Our findings suggest that the design of the workstation (e.g. chairs without lumbar support), 
and the lack of exercise and stretching during working hours are significant factors contributing to MSDs. We provided 
ergonomic improvement suggestions, including neck support, lumbar support, and stretching exercises. Additionally,

Abstract 
The FIFA World Cup is a significant sporting event that attracts millions of fans worldwide and promotes international 
friendship. It is essential for host countries to make precise predictions about the expected number of spectators for 
the 2034 World Cup to enhance preparation and ensure a positive experience for both fans and athletes. The study 
aims to provide accurate forecasts of attendance turnout at the FIFA World Cup, highlighting various factors that can 
impact attendance figures. Historical attendance data from the official FIFA website was used, and two weighted 
moving averages were applied to predict attendance for the 2030 and 2026 World Cups. This study also aims to 
enhance sports event management by creating a thorough model for predicting fan attendance, such as Bias (BIAS) 
and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) metrics. The study uses prediction models based on past data to forecast 
occurrences, considering both inputs and outcomes. The accuracy of these models depends on the quality and 
accessibility of data, the selection of appropriate models, and the validation procedures employed. The outcome helps 
to ensure that the host country, organizers, and other relevant parties have the necessary arrangements in place to host 
many international guests and contribute to the World Cup's overall success and legacy.

Abstract 
This project presents a structured lab experiment designed to enhance students' learning experience by integrating 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM), simulation modeling, and digital twin technologies to analyze and improve the 
performance of manufacturing systems. This approach not only equips students with the technical skills to map, 
model, and test improvements in manufacturing settings but also deepens their understanding of contemporary 
methodologies in analysis and improvement of manufacturing systems. The experiment aligns with the objectives of 
the SQU-IEOM Simulation Competition, which emphasizes innovative educational techniques for improving 
manufacturing and supply chain performance. The experiment is divided into four integrated phases to ensure a 
comprehensive learning experience and hands-on engagement with each of the methodologies. In the first phase, 
students will design and conduct physical simulation experiments to replicate a simple production line in a 
controlled lab environment. They will define a basic product and delineate the stages of its production, which will 
include multiple workstations. During the physical simulation, students will assume various roles some will perform 
the production tasks, while others will conduct time studies, document the process, and record data on processing 
and waiting times. This stage will help students capture and analyze real-time data, setting the foundation for 
subsequent simulation and digital twin development. In the second phase, students will use the collected data to 
construct a current-state VSM, which visualizes the flow of materials and information across the production line. 
This VSM will highlight key performance metrics, identify sources of waste, and uncover inefficiencies within the 
simulated production system. The mapping exercise not only provides a baseline model of the current production 
state but also reveals areas where potential improvements can be made, reinforcing the lean manufacturing concept 
of waste elimination. This mapping activity will be supported by statistical data gathered from the physical 
simulation, giving students an analytical basis for identifying and quantifying inefficiencies. The third phase 
involves developing a simulation model that serves as a digital twin of the manufacturing system, using the data 
and insights obtained from the VSM. In this step, students will employ SIMUL8 software, utilizing Stat::Fit tool to 
derive probability distributions for the workstation cycle times. This digital twin enables virtual testing of various 
improvement scenarios, providing students with a low-risk platform to predict the outcomes of adjustments before 
implementing them physically. This phase includes verification and validation activities to ensure the simulation 
model accurately reflects the real system’s behavior, achieved by comparing the simulation outputs with data from 
the physical experiment. Students will run a series of simulation experiments, testing potential improvement scenarios 
informed by the VSM analysis, such as adjustments to processing times or resource allocations. In the fourth and

Abstract 
The petrochemical supply chain (PCSC) needs production planning, inventory control, and emissions reduction to run 
sustainably. This approach reduces waste, costs, and environmental impact, making the supply chain resilient to 
demand and raw material changes. This paper proposes an optimization model for multi-echelon PCSC that integrates 
production planning, inventory control, and reverse logistics. The model aims to maximize the SC's overall profit 
while minimizing its environmental footprint, and it considers both feedforward and reverse logistics. This integrated 
approach allows for optimized production planning, inventory control at each echelon, and efficient logistics network 
management. The practicality of the proposed model has been demonstrated by its implementation in a C4 SC from 
Saudi Arabia. In a case study, the C4 supply chain system is optimized under specific policies, achieving a profit of 
$44.63M with a flaring cost of $643K daily.

1. Introduction
The petrochemical industry stands as a cornerstone of modern society, serving as a lifeblood for various sectors 
ranging from manufacturing to transportation. Amidst its critical role, the intricacies of managing the petrochemical 
supply chain (PCSC) pose a myriad of challenges that demand nuanced solutions (Alfares 2023, Elsaghier 2017). This 
research delves into the complexities inherent in PCSC management, exploring the intricate interplay of factors, such 
as feedforward and reverse logistics, production planning, inventory control, and emissions reduction. 
In recent years, the emergence of feedforward and reverse logistics has reshaped conventional supply chain paradigms, 
introducing both opportunities and complexities. While feedforward logistics streamlines the flow of raw materials 
and products toward production and distribution channels, reverse logistics addresses the challenges of handling 
returns, waste, and recycling, a domain particularly pertinent in the petrochemical industry where sustainability 
concerns are paramount (Dyckhoff et al. 2013). 
Navigating these logistics intricacies is further compounded by the multifaceted difficulties inherent in the PCSC. 
From volatile market dynamics to geopolitical tensions and regulatory constraints, stakeholders face a landscape rife 
with uncertainty (Sahebi et al. 2014). Moreover, the industry grapples with the imperative of balancing production 
planning with inventory control while concurrently mitigating environmental impacts, particularly in terms of 
emissions reduction, an endeavor that necessitates innovative strategies and technologies (Ratnakar et al. 2021, Riera 
et al. 2023).

6. Conclusion and Future Research 
In conclusion, this paper proposes an optimization model to achieve sustainable operations management of the 
petrochemical supply chain (PCSC). Reverse logistics management, production planning, inventory management, and 
methods for reducing emissions are all successfully integrated into the model. This holistic approach ensures that the 
industry meets market demands while aligning with sustainable goals. Referring to the case study, the C4 SC system 
is optimized under adopted policies that satisfy demand without flaring and can achieve a profit of $44.63M. It 
manages inventory well, with a recycling process of 180 tons/day and levels above or equal to safety stock. Future 
research aims to expand the model's scope by exploring the effect of maintenance operations on PCSC efficiency and 
developing a multi-objective model to enhance the understanding.

Abstract 
The rapid growth of e-commerce, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has transformed the way consumers shop 
and receive shipments. However, delivery systems in Saudi Arabia often remain inefficient, relying on third-party 
providers with limited customer information, which can lead to missed deliveries and customer dissatisfaction. In a 
survey we conducted with approximately 1,006 responses in the Tabuk region who regularly use delivery services, an 
overwhelming majority—97.6%—reported that they do receive contact from the delivery service, indicating that 
direct communication is standard practice for most deliveries. However, the traditional model of meeting drivers for 
package collection is increasingly impractical in today’s fast-paced world. To tackle these challenges, we developed 
a smart parcel box prototype that uses QR codes and IoT technology to provide secure, round-the-clock access for 
customers, enhancing the delivery experience for both recipients and businesses. This project supports Saudi Arabia’s 
Vision 2030, which focuses on improving logistics and lowering transportation costs. We aim to simplify delivery 
processes, boost security, and reduce unnecessary steps. The research covers the design and testing of the prototype, 
hardware selection, and delivery optimization, all to build a more sustainable and efficient logistics system suited to 
modern delivery demands in the Tabuk region and beyond.

1. Introduction
In the current state of our lives, and after being impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, which enhanced the use of e-
commerce, the way we shop and receive shipments has changed. E-commerce has become a crucial part of our daily 
lives, contributing significantly to the growth of online retail and increasing its share within total retail sales, even as 
traditional retail sales have declined. During the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, e-commerce sales surged by 
25%, and they are projected to reach around $600 billion by 2024. This rapid growth presents vast opportunities for 
businesses of all sizes and online investors alike. The potential of e-commerce can be seen everywhere, and it should

on each floor near the elevator or staircase, providing more accessible and organized parcel storage for residents. Here 
the box may be placed in a suitable way that fits the residential style, so it doesn't affect the urban shape of the building. 
There is a lot of waste in the size of service areas. According to the Ministry of Housing, the minimum space for a 
staircase inside the building is 180 cm x 370 cm high (Saudi Building Code, 2024), which is sufficient to place several 
boxes. In this research, they tested an ultrasonic sensor that detects goods being entered by the courier. It has succeeded 
in detecting goods and sending information to the owner through telegram. They also have tested a camera that detects 
faces and items placed in the box (Ronaldo, et al. 2023). What varies in our methodology is the concept of contactless 
delivery, where the delivery driver can easily deliver shipments using a barcode label on the shipment which contains 
the password of the box in a QR code and scan it to open the box. Future steps are among the most important pillars 
of all projects, and here we believe that there will be a qualitative shift in the production of the current and future basic 
product. We believe that in the future there will be trust in drone delivery, and we believe there will be significant 
growth in the drone delivery market, as it is expected to reach £42 billion in the UK alone by 2030 (Seakhoa, et al. 
2019). In terms of jobs and business opportunities. The drone is one of the most recent delivery operations as it began 
in 2013. Many companies carry out delivery operations using drones and achieve good results, such as Amazon, DHL, 
FedEx, Alphabet (Google), UPS, and Zip-line (Aasrith, et al. 2023). Many companies carry out delivery operations 
using drones and achieve good results, such as Amazon, DHL, FedEx, Alphabet (Google), UPS, and Zip-line (Ashari, 
et al. 2022). In Saudi Arabia, SAL Company, and we are seeking to make this box capable of receiving shipments with 
a sensitive mode that receives the drone, and in turn, delivery is made directly to the box. This large project will 
integrate technology and clean energy, as one of the goals is sustainability, as the box is powered by solar energy. 
6. Conclusion  
This research focused on the development of a smart parcel box concept, resulting in a secure and efficient 
prototype for modern delivery needs. The smart box offers substantial benefits to both customers and logistics 
providers. For customers, it provides real-time updates on package status, precise delivery timing, and 
convenient, flexible access to shipments. Despite these advantages, certain challenges remain, including high 
initial costs and limited information about senders and package contents, which could affect transparency and 
user experience. From the perspective of postal operators, the smart box has the potential to streamline courier 
operations, facilitate feedback collection, and support data-driven insights to enhance delivery efficiency. It also 
opens new service possibilities, enabling operators to safely transport temperature-sensitive items such as food, 
pharmaceuticals, and laboratory samples. Notably, this technology can be utilized by the Saudi Post Office and 
other delivery companies, offering a versatile solution adaptable to different logistics networks. To maximize 
the impact of this innovation, testing and initial implementation should be undertaken at the local level, ideally 
through collaboration between delivery companies, academic institutions, and industry specialists. Such a 
collaborative approach would generate valuable insights, optimize the system, and ensure that the smart box is 
effectively tailored to the logistics needs of Saudi Arabia and aligned with the goals of Vision 2030. Future 
research could focus on improving the model by testing it in diverse urban and rural settings to evaluate its 
adaptability and effectiveness. In addition, addressing challenges related to smart box placement, and exploring 
the integration of IoT combability and maintenance aspects would further contribute to advancing modern last-
mile delivery solutions.

Overall, understanding the impact of these factors and their interactions is crucial for optimizing the 3D printing 
process and enhancing the mechanical properties of DPPF/rPP composites. Adjusting these parameters appropriately 
can lead to improved printing quality and material performance. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Significance of Tensile Strength in 3D Printing 
Tensile strength plays a pivotal role in ensuring the quality and functionality of 3D printed products. It indicates the 
maximum stress a filament can withstand before breaking, making it a critical property for applications where 
durability and stability are essential. For instance, when manufacturing filaments for 3D printers, precise specifications 
regarding tensile strength under various conditions are crucial. Experiments, such as those involving nozzle 
temperature, printing speed, and layer thickness variations, help determine optimal settings for achieving high tensile 
strength. These settings directly influence the manufacturability and reliability of printed objects. 
• 
Nozzle Temperature: Higher temperatures improve material flow and adhesion during extrusion, enhancing 
structural integrity. 
• 
Printing Speed: Slower speeds allow for better precision and stronger bond formation between layers, 
resulting in higher tensile strength. 
• 
Layer Thickness: Optimal thickness ensures the filament is neither too brittle nor prone to faults during 
printing. 
Identifying the right combination of these factors enables manufacturers to produce filaments that exceed performance 
expectations for various applications, from industrial parts to consumer products. Rigorous testing ensures the 
production of reliable and durable 3D printed products. 
 
Optimal Parameters for rPP/NDPP Composite 
Based on experimentation, the recommended parameters for using the bio-composite (rPP/NDPP) are a nozzle 
temperature of 270°C, layer thickness of 0.1 mm, and printing speed of 60 mm/s or lower. These settings positively 
affect tensile strength, with a 95% confidence interval between 19.249 and 22.405 MPa.

Classification of Spare Parts Criticality: A Multi-Criteria 
Decision-Making framework with Application in an Oil & 
Gas Company 
Tahra Hamed Azzan Al Rawahi 
Sultan Qaboos University 
Al-Khoud, Muscat, Oman 
Abstract 
Spare parts are inventoried items stored in warehouses for immediate response to demand requirements of repair jobs 
and maintenance activities. Most oil & gas companies maintain large numbers of spare parts to ensure stock 
availability and avoid shortages. Due to the substantial contribution of spare parts to the total inventory cost, it is 
important to balance stock availability and the inventory holding costs of spare parts. In line with these objectives, the 
specification of the spare parts to keep in stock is one of the most crucial steps which requires the spare parts to be 
classified based on the corresponding criticality. Criticality is a key factor towards identifying the resources and the 
actions needed to reduce the risk or the impact of failures and losses affecting a process, including incidents relating 
to economy, safety, and environment, among other practical aspects. The aim of this thesis is to identify the most 
relevant criteria for the classification of spare parts criticality prior to assessing their impact on inventory management 
using a large oil & gas company in Oman as a case study. The investigations are based on a methodological framework 
that integrates two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, Evaluation based on Distance from 
Average Solution (EDAS) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator. The findings of this study reveal that 
less than 2.5% of the spare parts require special attention regardless of the optimism level of the decision maker, which 
enables reducing substantially the inventory costs besides assisting the inventory team in deciding what to maintain 
in stock and whether to add or remove items from stock.

Abstract 
The world's automobile industries are currently moving in a speedy trend to accelerate the diffusion of electric 
mobility in the global market. Electric mobility has the potential to compete with internal combustion vehicles 
due to its significant role in i) improving public health in cities by reducing CO2 emissions and ii) enhancing 
energy security to be less dependent on fossil fuels. However, electric mobility still faces a few challenges to 
prove themselves in the market, such as charging anxiety, fill-up-time, and range anxiety. Moreover, the most 
critical challenge is the thermal management system of the batteries. It is highly recommended to keep the 
working temperature of the battery in a range of (15-45) ̊C. The battery's efficiency decays when the battery is 
not in the optimum thermal range, especially in the charging/discharging processes. Also, using the batteries at 
high temperatures may shorten the battery life. Accordingly, a proper cooling system is essential to 
maintaining optimum performance and avoiding overheating, which can reduce the battery's efficiency, 
capacity, and longevity. In this study, an innovative hybrid cooling system was designed to help thermal 
runaway by quickly detecting and controlling temperature spikes and avoiding failures. The hybrid cooling 
system was established for a Li-ion EV battery type Lifepo4 of Grade A 30 Ah to work in two modes. MODE-
I is a natural cooling mode, while MODE-II is a passive cooling mode using the Phase Change Material 
(RT35HC) to absorb the generated heat in the battery and extend its operating period. The experiments were 
conducted during the discharge phase of the battery with a discharge rate C-rate of 1C. It was found that the 
passive cooling mode using PCM below 80g was unable to reduce battery surface temperature compared with 
the natural cooling mode. In comparison, 100g of the PCM could provide better thermal performance with a 
reduced battery surface temperature of approximately 5oC. During phase transitions, PCMs can absorb and 
release thermal energy. Such a reduction in surface temperature will increase the life cycle of the battery and 
allow it to be used in hot climate conditions.

Abstract 
Developed by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), the Trade 
Intelligence and Negotiation Adviser (TINA) platform is a free professional tool of choice in trade policy analysis and 
negotiation preparation. This article explains the benefits of incorporating TINA in higher education at Sultan Qaboos 
University, whereby students simulate trade agreement-related economic benefits with different partners. Structured 
project assignment empowers the students with knowledge about the workings of trade in the real world. The assigned 
project also enhances the real comprehension of key economic concepts such as comparative advantage, tariff 
liberalization, and economic impact assessment. This hands-on methodology bridges theoretical legacies and applied 
skills that allow students actively to enumerate opportunities and challenges presented by bilateral trade based on data-
driven insights. Results show that TINA has greatly improved the students' analytical ability and understanding of 
trade policy dynamics between country pairs. This study highlights the broader impact of integrating digital tools like 
TINA into higher education, offering a scalable approach to fostering critical thinking and hands-on learning in 
economic policy courses. It contributes to the growing conversation on using technology to advance teaching methods 
in economics and trade education.

Abstract 
The advent of the fourth industrial revolution has an impact on the majority of domains and industries. In the 
manufacturing industry, it is usually referred to as Industry 4.0. Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), is the one of 
the nine pillars that is garnering a lot of interest worldwide. It is an intriguing technology which has proven benefits 
in several domains such as healthcare, teaching, training, etc. Since VR, AR, and mixed reality are all closely related, 
the term used to describe them all together is eXtended reality. Specially for the developing nations these technologies 
are very useful. Therefore, it is very important to know about these technologies’ applications and their prevalence. 
As a result, a study has been done in this research work to gain an understanding of its appeal in Saudi Arabia's various 
industrial sectors. The data was collected using surveys and expert interviews. The data was analyzed statistically and 
it is reported that eXtended reality technologies are gaining popularity and people are using it more in the field of 
entertainment. Moreover, big firms in oil and gas sector have employed it, however small and medium 
enterprises(SMEs) are lagging behind. In the academics and education establishments, its presence is there from a 
long time. Moreover, there are quite a few medical organizations that are utilizing these technologies. It can be 
concluded based on the results that more training and familiarization programs and courses are required by the 
academic and training institute to harness the benefits of these captivating technologies.

5. Discussion and Conclusions
This study provides insights into the acceptance and perception of extended reality (XR) technologies within Saudi 
Arabia's industrial sectors, highlighting specific trends in familiarity, usage, and problems that influence XR's 
deployment. 
This report emphasizes the encouraging but inconsistent implementation of XR across various industry sectors in 
Saudi Arabia. Elevated adoption rates in industries such as oil and gas, healthcare, and entertainment validate XR's 
adaptability and capacity to foster innovation. Nonetheless, diminished familiarity and acceptance within SMEs and 
academia suggest that enhanced awareness and assistance are crucial to promote wider use across many industries. 
SMEs lag behind in the usage due to lack of knowledge as well as the management think it as an extra burden on the 
company’s finance. However, with proper implementation strategy XR can be profitable in longer run. 
Major findings of the study reveal: 
1.
Operational efficiency and employee skill enhancement are the most significant benefits, especially for
industries with complex workflows and training needs.
2.
Limited expertise, infrastructure, and cost constraints are prominent challenges, particularly in resource-
constrained industries like SMEs and academia.
3.
The need for targeted training programs is crucial, as familiarity with XR directly correlates with a
willingness to engage in further training.
XR technologies possess significant potential to propel Industry 4.0 developments in Saudi Arabia; yet, widespread 
adoption necessitates coordinated efforts to address implementation issues. Policymakers, industry leaders, and 
educational institutions ought to pursue joint initiatives to enhance accessibility to XR technologies, provide 
subsidized training, and provide XR infrastructure that accommodates the requirements of many industries. Through 
smart investment and information distribution, XR can significantly enhance Saudi Arabia's status as a leader in 
regional digital transformation.

Abstract 
 Green hydrogen is considered the cornerstone of sustainable energy and has received attention from the world because 
it is capable of removing carbon. However, it remains a challenge to achieve economic sustainability in the 
downstream green hydrogen supply chain. This study aims to explore economic sustainability factors in the 
downstream supply chain. Using Scopus and Web of Science databases, articles were pooled, selected and peer-
reviewed to ensure inclusion of studies with impact and relevance. This methodological understanding is based on 
literature review (LR) integrated with bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive perspective. The bibliometric 
analysis was based on identifying influential studies, research trends, and key areas, while the content analysis was 
based on an in-depth exploration of the factors that drive sustainability. The analysis highlights critical factors such 
relevance of green hydrogen research with other research areas, sustainability performance enablers for green 
hydrogen supply chain related research connections and other areas that need improvement. The results indicate 
economic sustainability because it is affected by economic and technical trade-offs and investments in logistics and 
distribution networks.  Moreover, digital technologies and artificial intelligence have become prominent in improving 
supply chain performance. The study also underscores the importance of policies that influence green hydrogen 
adoption and reduce barriers to private sector investment.  This hybrid review not only fills knowledge gaps, but also 
provides insights that can be applied by researchers and policy makers. This research is conducted to understand the 
research gap in developing sustainable transportation for green hydrogen downstream supply chain and what are the 
sustainability performance enablers with scope focused within the sultanate of Oman. Future research will focus on 
developing quantitative frameworks and models to operationalize enabling factors across market contexts and 
geographic regions.

Abstract 
 Relief distribution logistics play a critical role in disaster response, particularly in geographically diverse and disaster-
prone regions like Oman. However, the complexity of these logistics systems often hinders the timely and effective 
delivery of aid. This study aims to identify the key variables influencing modern relief distribution logistics systems 
during disaster response in Oman through a hybrid content review. Using qualitative content analysis with ATLAS.ti 
software, we systematically analyze selected top-tier research papers to uncover core factors, including operational 
challenges, technological advancements, collaboration frameworks, and socio-environmental considerations. By 
synthesizing findings from diverse sources, the study provides a comprehensive framework of variables critical to 
optimizing disaster logistics systems. This research not only enhances understanding of the logistical challenges in 
Oman but also provides actionable insights for policymakers and humanitarian organizations to improve disaster 
response efficiency. The results contribute to the broader field of disaster management and establish a basis for future 
empirical studies on logistics systems in developing countries. The findings of the analysis highlights that relief 
efficiency is heavily influenced by challenges such as infrastructure damage and distribution bottlenecks. Effective 
information sharing and stakeholder engagement are critical to mitigating bottlenecks and ensuring time-critical 
deliveries. Technological tools like digital twin simulation play a key role in visualizing supply chain constraints and 
optimizing logistics. Addressing these factors collectively can significantly reduce lead times and enhance the overall 
effectiveness of relief distribution efforts.

1. Introduction
Disasters, whether natural or man-made, pose significant challenges to communities and governments worldwide. 
They disrupt normal life, destroy infrastructure, and create an urgent need for rapid and efficient response systems. 
Relief distribution logistics, a critical component of disaster response, ensures that essential supplies such as food, 
water, medical aid, and shelter reach affected populations promptly. The effectiveness of these logistics systems can 
determine the success or failure of disaster management efforts. However, logistical challenges such as infrastructure

the flow of resources, an enhancement by MacCarthy et al., (2022). This will be a great deal in optimizing last-mile 
delivery and analyzing bottlenecks. This linkage could be used by logistics teams to prioritize repairs or deploy 
additional resources around impacted areas by showing precisely what delays are caused by. 
 
6. Contribution to Theory  
This research, by attempting to identify and study significant factors affecting the relief logistics in poor countries, 
contributes to an advanced theoretical knowledge regarding disaster logistics. It goes further to conceptualize a model 
on disaster response where the interrelationship of elements, including infrastructure resilience, stakeholder 
coordination, and proper allocation of resources, comes into focus within a limited logistical capacity context. These 
findings provide an understanding of the relief logistics systems that are unlike those in rich countries as they focus 
on Oman, a place with specific topographical, economic, and institutional problems. This theoretical understanding 
helps to complete knowledge of catastrophe logistics literature by addressing the unique requirements of developing 
nations and providing more efficient theoretical models and frameworks. 
 
This study's methodological contribution is its application of ATLAS.ti for qualitative content analysis. The study has 
accentuated systematic coding, thematic development, and visualization in bringing out the intricate patterns in 
qualitative data, stating the relevance of sophisticated qualitative methods in disaster logistics studies. Using this tool 
on data from developing countries, this research illustrates how such a methodology can uncover insights specific to 
the context, which usually take time to grasp through conventional quantitative methods. For disaster relief logistics 
to be effective, cutting-edge technologies and efficient procedures must be combined to guarantee accurate and timely 
help distribution. In order to overcome obstacles like infrastructure degradation and resource distribution bottlenecks, 
digital twin mapping, lead time reduction, resource allocation, cost estimate, and efficiency building are essential. 
 
6.1 Optimizing Resource Allocation to Increase Impact and Reduce Waste  
Correct and equitable resource allocation ensures the scarce resources reach the neediest locations. Robust 
information-sharing systems that rapidly share information about supplies, demand, and on-ground situations form 
the pillar of any efficient allocation system. Sophisticated mapping technologies, such as bottleneck analysis and 
digital twins, allow for effective matching of resource supply with demand. Resource misallocation can lead to 
stockouts or overstocking, impeding relief efforts. By showing justice and flexibility in the process of relieving, the 
smooth distribution of resources enhances efficiency and gives confidence to the communities affected and 
stakeholders. 
 
6.2 Estimating Costs and Increasing Efficiency Through Sustainable Recovery  
Besides operational efficiency, the sustenance of long-term recovery also depends on cost estimation and efficiency-
building strategies. Digital technologies, such as resource flow mapping and simulation models, will enable the 
accurate cost estimate and expenditure optimization. This includes, among others, last-mile delivery on local networks 
and exploiting identified bottlenecks economically by appropriating resources. Cost-effective logistics systems ensure 
a more solid framework for disaster response through financial stability and preparedness for crises. Modern relief 
logistics are basically set up by digital twin mapping, reduction of lead time, optimization of resource allocation, and 
improvements in cost efficiency. These interrelated elements form the basis on which responsive and resilient systems 
are designed to address the logistical challenges of disasters. This would indeed ensure timely, effective, and 
sustainable disaster relief operations, saving lives and allowing communities to recover, provided stakeholders 
leverage technology and data-driven strategies effectively. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The conclusions of this research provide theoretical and practical relevance by highlighting the key components and 
variables that influence relief logistics in Oman. Crucial components, such as infrastructure resilience, resource 
allocation, and stakeholder cooperation, are significant and essential components of catastrophe response. The 
application of state-of-the-art technologies also identifies revolutionary improvements in efficiency and speed for 
relief through bottleneck analysis and digital twin mapping. The study elucidates the complex dynamics of relief 
logistics by analyzing the inter-relationships between logistical elements such as distribution bottlenecks, time-
sensitive deliveries, and effective recovery—these further our theoretical understanding of disaster logistics in light 
of specific conditions surrounding poor countries like Oman.

The study provides practical information for legislators, aid agencies, and logistics companies. In practice, data-driven 
decision-making and real-time supply chain visualization can reduce lead times and enhance the overall effectiveness 
of disaster response systems. This report also highlights how vital it is to resolve issues like communication 
breakdowns and infrastructure damage, which often exacerbate logistical inefficiencies during disasters. These 
findings not only enhance the capacity of Oman's disaster relief systems for readiness and response but also set a 
benchmark for other nations willing to enhance their catastrophe logistics frameworks.

Abstract 
Textile MSEs in Peru play a leading role in business fabrics. However, small and medium-sized companies are facing 
different problems. Since they do not have the same purchasing power as large companies, it is difficult for them to 
implement advanced technologies or expensive machines that help reduce waste and improve production times, which 
leads to a decrease in productivity. The research has a mixed approach and a sequential design with a qualitative 
priority. It consists of two phases: in the first phase, qualitative tools will be applied to know and describe 100% of 
the problem to be addressed, and in the second phase, quantitative tools will be applied. The first tool to be used will 
be the Value Stream Map, which is used to know the current situation of the company and the future situation after 
implementation. It will be used to diagnose the company's problems and to model the solution. The second 
methodology to be implemented was the 5S, which follows a five-step process aimed at the correct division of 
resources, creation of culture and formation of discipline. The main objective of the research was to increase the 
productivity of the MSE, this was fulfilled by the application of the VSM and 5S tools, and the proposed 
improvements, reducing cycle times by 28.47% and shrinkage percentages by 18.43%.

1. Introduction
The Peruvian textile industry faces various challenges that hinder its productivity, particularly within small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to their limited purchasing power compared to larger companies, SMEs often 
struggle to implement advanced technologies or expensive machinery that could help reduce waste and improve 
production times, ultimately affecting their overall efficiency. This issue is prevalent across the industry, manifesting 
in low-quality production, disorganized labor and machinery, inefficient processes, and poorly defined maintenance 
routines, among others (Mahmood, 2020).

practical implementation, it was possible to improve the standard, reducing results by half over the years. This suggests 
that the results become more evident in the long term, as they will be measured by the profits and sales the company 
receives. However, these studies do not all agree on the necessity of using external tools such as SMED. The use of 
5S yielded favorable results in the production process without the need to add this tool. In the process of creating a 
culture for workers, the aim was to make the new work system as understandable as possible, which is why only the 
two tools (VSM and 5S) were used. 
 
Through this research work, it was possible to verify the hypothesis raised, since after the implementation of the 5S 
methodology and VSM, there was an increase in productivity of 15.67%. This is due to the reduction of downtime 
caused by dirt, equipment and/or unprepared materials, disorder, etc. Similarly, the work of Ruiz et al. (2019) found 
that one of the main factors influencing delays and low productivity is the inadequate management of waste generated 
and the lack of a standardized system. 
 
6. Conclusions 
• 
The feasibility of Lean Manufacturing was validated, showing that significant efficiency improvements can 
be achieved without large capital investments. However, to sustain success, SMEs should consider expanding 
their Lean practices to include more advanced tools like TPM and Kaizen, along with proper employee 
training to maximize implementation. 
• 
Continuous monitoring and data analysis were identified as critical for maintaining Lean improvements over 
the long term. By implementing KPIs to regularly track performance in productivity, waste, and cycle times, 
SMEs can adapt their Lean strategies as necessary. This ongoing evaluation ensures that the benefits of Lean 
are maintained in dynamic market conditions. 
• 
VSM and 5S were highly effective in reducing waste, improving production times, and increasing 
productivity by 14%, while reducing operational costs by 3,000 soles. To sustain these improvements, 
continuous training and regular process evaluations are recommended to embed Lean practices into the 
company’s culture. 
• 
The diagnostic phase and VSM implementation identified key areas for improvement, such as bottlenecks in 
the cutting and sewing stages, leading to reduced waste, defects, and higher productivity. To further maximize 
the impact, SMEs should use VSM alongside other Lean tools like 5S for comprehensive process 
optimization. 
• 
Lean Manufacturing tools positively impacted both economic outcomes, such as productivity and cost 
reduction, and fostered a culture of continuous improvement. The hypothesis was confirmed, but future 
studies should explore broader applications across multiple SMEs to validate long-term sustainability. 
• 
The success of Lean Manufacturing tools, such as VSM and 5S, depends on their adaptation to the specific 
needs and limitations of each SME. While these tools have proven effective in general, the study suggests 
that customization of Lean strategies, tailored to the size, resources, and operational constraints of the SME, 
is essential for maximizing results and ensuring long-term sustainability.
