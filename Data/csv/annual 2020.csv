Abstract 
Communication among members in an organization is an important research aspect in organizational 
processes. Therefore, our research is based on communication networks and a series of studies is developed 
by applying the information theory and the Markov chain to construct quantitative models that can grasp 
information distribution for infinitely repeated communication in an organization. However, the 
constructed models mainly focus on the aspect of randomness in information processing, and do not 
sufficiently deal with the concept of fuzziness. Dual aspects of ambiguity exist for both randomness and 
fuzziness in human information processing complexity, which cannot be overlooked when discussing 
organizational communication. 
This study considers a memory communication channel, and proposes an estimation model for both 
randomness and fuzziness to analyze the prior information allocation ratio to each member in two different 
organizations. Additionally, we conduct positive analyses on a communication network with isomorphic 
and non-isomorphic structures, and suggest an inter-organizational communication and the role among 
members of the organization.

Abstract 
Healthcare organizations have increasingly turned to Lean and Six Sigma (LSS) as management systems to 
achieve quality and efficiency in patient care. This study aims to classify this body of literature and to 
discover factors that enable and prevent successful LSS implementations. Peer-reviewed literature in 
journals that were published through 2018 in English language were sought through a search of multiple 
databases. The inclusion criterion was broad in that all areas of healthcare and interpretations of LSS were 
considered. The literature search yielded 368 publications. One third of the studies present a U.S. affiliation 
and only 19% has been conducted in developing countries. The case study is the most popular study type 
but only represents around 52% of the body of literature. Lean and the ED are preferred approach and 
setting, respectively. Factors that enable and prevent successful implementation were grouped by 
Managerial, Preparation, People, and Project relationships. There is a need for future literature to provide a 
longitudinal balanced view on the benefits and challenges of implementations, and for studies to follow 
experimental designs for statistical validity. This is the most inclusive review about LSS in healthcare as it 
includes different study types, healthcare settings and LSS tools together.

Learning from the published literature and closing the gap in future publications is the first step to fully realizing the 
benefits of LSS in healthcare (Hasle, et al. 2016). While there is a plethora of reported evidence of LSS being successful 
in narrow instances, there is not nearly as much evidence of what not to do or what might go wrong. To have full 
learning, both the positives at an organization and societal levels, and the negatives in specific instances need to be 
explored and reported upon. In the next two decades, we suggest that the LSS literature embrace this full learning 
spectrum, and that reported projects follow a strong statistical design to increase scientific validity.

Abstract 
This article presents an optimization design of the X &EWMA chart for monitoring a cold rolling process 
producing galvanized steel coils. Using real data from industry, the results show that the detection 
effectiveness of  the X &EWMA charts is better than the optimal X  chart and the optimal EWMA chart 
in terms of Expected Average Number of Observation required to identify an out-of-control case 
(EANOS) by about 36% and 10%, respectively. The optimization design of the X &EWMA charts 
ensures that extra inspection resources will not be necessary, and the false alarm rate of the charts will not 
be increased.  
Keywords. Cold rolling process, Online monitoring, Statistical process control (SPC), X &EWMA charts. 
1. Introduction
Cold rolling is a metal forming process in which sheet metal or strip stock passes through rollers at a temperature 
below its recrystallization temperature, and then compressed and squeezed to give it the desired shape/value (Figure 
1). Cold rolling increases the yield strength and hardness of a metal by introducing defects into the metal’s crystal 
structure. The aim of the rolling process is to reduce the thickness of a strip to the desired value with good 
dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and excellent mechanical properties. During the cold rolling process, there are 
uncertainties and external disturbances such as eccentricity arise, which usually appears on the strip periodically and 
causes variation in the thickness of the strip (Koofigar et al. 2011, Haridy et al. 2011). Thus, an online monitoring 
system is essential to identify the excessive variation in the thickness of the strip at the earlier stage, and Statistical 
Process Control (SPC) charts can play an important role in this respect. 
The SPC charts are popular choices in manufacturing and service industries for monitoring process variation 
over time so that timely action can be taken to identify the root causes of the excessive variability, and as a result, 
reducing the defective rate of the process. In recent years, many new charts and their applications have been

n = 19, h = 1.90, λ = 0.135, UCLactual = 1.524, Hactual = 1.521, ATS0 = 397.1, EANOS = 43.0 
Even though all three charting schemes required the same inspection resources (R) and their false alarm rates (ATS0) 
are almost the same, the expected average number of observations, EANOS required to signal an out-of-control case 
of the three schemes are quite different. The values of EANOS of the three charts indicate that the conventional 
EWMA chart outperforms the conventional X  chart. However, the optimal X &EWMA charts outperform the 
conventional X  chart and the conventional EWMA chart by about 36% and 10%, respectively. The combination of 
the X  chart and EWMA chart, and the optimization design makes the proposed X &EWMA charts more effective 
from an overall viewpoint.   
4. Conclusion
This article presents optimal X &EWMA charts, and explains the application of the proposed charts for monitoring a 
cold rolling process producing steel coils. The application of SPC charts can help to take timely action to reduce the 
number of defective items. The optimization design of the X &EWMA charts considers a wide range of mean shifts 
in the cold rolling process, which is more realistic in practice. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is 
investigated through an example, which shows that the proposed optimal X &EWMA charts outperform (in terms of 
EANOS) the conventional X  chart and the conventional EWMA chart by about 36%, and 10%, respectively. In the 
proposed design, the mean shift is characterized by a Rayleigh distribution. Future research could consider the 
effectiveness of the charts under different shift distributions such as Beta distributions.

Abstract 
This study presents a model for the optimization design of an economic exponentially weighted moving 
average (EWMA) control chart based on random process shifts in the process mean. The optimization 
model aims to minimize the total expected cost involved with the charting scheme. The optimization 
process ensures that the false alarm rate of the charting scheme will not be increased, and no extra 
inspection resources will be required. The performance of the proposed optimal economic EWMA chart 
is compared with that of the traditional economic X  chart, optimal economic X  chart, and traditional 
economic EWMA chart. The results reveal that the total expected cost can be reduced by the optimal 
economic EWMA chart compared to the other three charts by about 109%, 23%, and 95%, respectively.

1. Introduction
In this era of ever-growing competition, it has become necessary for a company to keep a continuous watch over the 
quality of the goods produced. A continuous quality improvement program is the only tool to achieve this goal. A 
successful quality improvement effort may lead to lower costs, higher productivity, increased customer satisfaction, 
higher market share, and ultimately the higher profits for the company. In order to produce high-quality products, it 
is necessary for a company to keep the variation in the quality of its products as minimum as possible, and to make it 
as the main task in quality control. The need for quality control arises from the fact that even after the quality 
standards have been met, some variation in quality is unavoidable. The control chart is the most widely used

Traditional economic EWMA chart:  
λ = 0.10, n = 1, h = 0.1, UCL = 0.7883, LCL = -0.7883, ATS0 = 399.76, EC = 25.90 
ECnormal = 1.955 
 
Optimal economic EWMA chart:  
λ = 0.03, n = 4, h = 0.40, UCL = 0.1655, LCL = -0.1655, ATS0 = 399.86, EC = 13.25 
ECnormal = 1.000 
 
The results show that both optimal X  and EWMA charts exhibit superior performance compared to their 
traditional versions, which highlights the importance of the optimization design of the control charts. However, the 
optimal economic EWMA chart significantly reduced the total expected cost compared to the other three charts. The 
values of ECnormal indicate that the optimal economic EWMA chart outperforms the traditional economic X  chart, 
optimal economic X  chart, and traditional economic EWMA chart by about 109%, 23%, and 95%, respectively. 
 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
This study presents an optimization model for the design of an economic EWMA control chart. The optimization 
process considers random process shifts instead of a single or a few shift values, which is more realistic from a 
practical viewpoint. The optimization process also ensures that the false alarm rate of the designed chart will not be 
increased, and extra inspection resources will not be needed. The proposed optimal economic EWMA chart 
outperforms (in terms of total expected cost per unit time) the traditional economic X  chart, the optimal economic 
X  chart, and the traditional economic EWMA chart by about 109%, 23%, and 95%, respectively, which highlights 
the importance of optimization design of the control charts. In this study, the optimal economic EWMA chart is 
designed for monitoring shifts in the process mean. Future research can consider shifts in both process mean and 
variance, and the randomness of the process shift can also be characterized by using other distributions such as 
uniform distribution instead of Rayleigh distribution.

Abstract 
Healthcare simulation allows management to make decisions based on a solid framework. Continuous 
simulation is the foundation for systems dynamics, an approach to structure problems, understand those 
complex interactions within these problems and their changes over time. This paper reviews and resumes 
the state-of-the-art of system dynamics applications in healthcare. There are 74 publications related to 
system dynamics and healthcare that were identified in academic databases worldwide from 1999 to 2019. 
These articles were sorted by their characteristics, revealing that the applications of system dynamics have 
been broadly used in the healthcare to gain understanding about policy planning and public health decisions. 
The representation of patient behavior and technology advances, and the management of quality, staff and 
risk, are areas with potential application for systems dynamics in future research. The tendency to use 
continuous simulation in healthcare has been decreasing since 2014; however, the strength of hybrid 
simulation could exploit the innate power of the holistic view of system dynamics.

1. Introduction
Healthcare is a large, complex and adaptive system that does not naturally lend itself to easy analysis, design, or even 
understanding (Koelling & Schwandt, 2005), because its dynamic components interact with each other creating a large 
complexity and several possible outputs (Atkinson et al., 2015). Effective and sustainable decision-making in 
healthcare requires tools that can address this complexity (Chahal & Eldabi, 2008). The critical nature of the system 
requires developing good representative models (Koelling & Schwandt, 2005) such as those used in computer 
simulations that are useful in healthcare because of its power and flexibility (Sally Brailsford, 2005).  
Simulation is an analysis tool that uses the computer model of the system to estimate and evaluate the performance of 
models within a certain period in related operating conditions (Deryahanoglu & Kocaoglu, 2019). A simulation study 
begins with a real-world problem that needs to be solved, alleviated, or better understood. A conceptual model of the

Abstract 
We consider an integrated maintenance/production and spare parts optimization problem for components of a wind 
turbine farm for which the degradation level is observable. Degradation is modeled as a function of the current 
operating mode. The spare parts are stocked at a local inventory. The costs associated with spare parts deliveries and 
part replacements depend on the operating mode. Our objective is to optimize the total discounted cost of maintenance, 
production and spare part related costs over a finite planning horizon. We formulate the problem the structure of the 
optimal policy, which is shown to be a bi-threshold policy in each operating mode. Our numerical experiments show 
that the cost savings obtained by the integrated optimization of maintenance, production and spare parts are significant. 
Key words: 
spare parts, optimal production and maintenance strategy, wind turbine functionality, fluctuating demand, preventive 
and corrective maintenance.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) of India 
and examine the impact of intellectual capital and professional experiences on the performance of HEIs. In 
this study, Two-Stage DEA (DEA-Regression) has been used, and the Authors have collected the required 
data related to performance measures and determinants of efficiency from the National Institutional 
Ranking Framework (NIRF) web portal. In the first stage, data envelopment analysis method (Banker, 
Charnes, & Cooper, 1984) has been used to obtain the efficiency scores of thirty-four management 
institutions of India. Authors have used the output-oriented BCC (Banker et al., 1984) DEA model for the 
assessment of the efficiency of HEIs. Further, Tobit regression has been used to examine the impact of 
research publications/Highly cited research works, Professional experience of academic staff, etc. on the 
performance of these management institutions. The results of this study indicate that research publications 
and professional skills of academic staff are positively impacting the performance of management 
institutions. The findings of this study indicate the importance of intellectual capital/resources in 
educational institutions. These findings will also provide the direction for the benchmarking of the 
Management Institutions in India.

Abstract 
In most of the multi-objective multi-skill resource-constrained project scheduling (MO-MSRCPSP) 
research works, it has been assumed that a staff member is able to exhibit different skills with the same 
proficiency or expertise. However, this is not true in real life. Usually, a person possessing various skills 
may be expert in one (or two) skill(s) but may only be moderately trained for performing other skills. The 
assignments of persons with less-skilled levels have to be kept as low as possible to achieve satisfactory 
quality targets. Under this motivation, this paper develops a mathematical model for a MSRCPSP with 
two objectives. In addition to the regular objective of minimizing the makespan, the second objective 
aims at minimizing the total time elapsed with the less-skilled resource assignments defined as ‘skill 
divergence span’. A weighted sum teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is employed 
to solve this complex problem. In addition to the TLBO, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is also 
developed as an alternative metaheuristic for the comparison purposes. The computational results are 
performed on 36 test instances with varying level of skill factors, resource strength and network 
complexity. The average % deviation from critical path based lower bound obtained is comparatively 
lower for the MO-TLBO as compared to the MO- GA. It is 62.17% for the proposed MO-TLBO while for 
MO-GA its value is 75.11% which shows that TLBO is an effective metaheuristic for solving such 
problems.

With increase in network complexity (NC), the number of precedence relations also increases. This means less 
number of activities are available that can be processed simultaneously, i.e. the degree of parallelization decreases. 
This in turn results in low values of percent deviation.

Conclusions 
This paper investigates a scarcely treated work in literature about multi-objective multi-skilled resource-constrained 
project scheduling problem (MO-MSRCPSP) by considering mixed skill proficiencies. A multi-objective 
mathematical formulation is presented for this problem which aims to minimize two time estimates; the project 
makespan and the total time elapsed with less-skilled resource assignments which has been conceptualized as total 
skill divergence span (SDS). To solve this complex problem, a priori-approach based on weighted-sum or 
scalarization method is used. The weights given to makespan and SDS function are 0.7 and 0.3 respectively which 
can be arbitrarily modified by decision maker.  To solve this problem, two metaheuristics have been proposed 
namely MO-TLBO and MO-GA. The test instances developed for the MSRCPSP have been suitably modified with 
mixed proficiency levels of the staff members. The comprehensive test results reveal that the MO-TLBO has 
performed significantly better than the MO-GA and can be an effective metaheuristic for solving such real life 
problems.

Abstract 
Process capability indices (PCIs) are widely-used statistical quality control tools for measuring process 
performance. In manufacturing industries, PCIs can be used to help companies stay competitive by 
providing understanding of process capability and guidance for quality improvement. However, the 
normality assumption for traditional PCIs, such as 
p
C  and 
pk
C
 , might be violated in real-world 
manufacturing processes, and this can lead to erroneous conclusions of process capability and eventually 
financial losses for companies. Hence, many researchers modify existing PCIs or construct new PCIs to 
evaluate the performance of non-normal processes. Given various non-normal PCIs that have been 
proposed, there is an interesting in knowing how well these methods are, and there are demands for a 
proper comparative analysis. 
In this study, we investigate four non-normal PCIs, 
Npk
C
, 
s
C , 
y
C  and 
py
C
. We first compare these 
PCIs in terms of their capability to reflect true process yields under different parameter combinations of 
Weibull distribution, then examining their magnitude of estimation biases when implemented in different 
sample sizes. The result shows that 
y
C  is the most exceptional among the four PCIs in the above two 
aspects, and has a recommended sampling size of 50 or more. Moreover, we employ a well-known 
inference approach, Bayesian inference with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to review the 
sampling variation derived from parametric estimation of the Weibull distribution. A series of simulations 
for establishing MCMC credibility intervals is conducted on 
y
C  with the adaptive rejection Metropolis 
sampling (ARMS) algorithm. The coverage rates and average widths of credibility intervals are adopted 
as two criteria to assess the accuracy and precision of the MCMC method, respectively. It turns out that 
the MCMC credibility intervals perform satisfactorily in different sample sizes and under various 
parameter combinations of Weibull distribution.

Abstract 
Acceptance sampling plan is a statistical tool of quality control. It is a well-considered decision system 
that meets both consumers and producers need for product quality. The purpose of acceptance sampling 
plan is to provide a decision-making guideline, whether or not the lot is likely to be accepted. Many 
efforts were directed to make sure that we are meeting the requirement in the most cost-efficient way. A 
common practice is single acceptance sampling plan, because of its simplistic. However, with its 
simplistic comes with a downside that a larger sample size is usually required to avoid making a judgment 
mistake, because there is only a chance to sentence the lot. In this paper, for the expectation of reducing 
the required sample size, we propose a two-stage sampling plan to give a questionable lot another chance 
of inspecting samples before deciding to accept or reject the lot. The propose plan is designed on the 
basis of one-sided capability index with the assumption of the quality characteristic follows a normal 
distribution. The concept of two-stage sampling is that decisions in the second-stage sampling inspection 
is independent to the first-stage sampling inspection, having the desired to operate on variables inspection. 
The optimal parameters are determined by optimization of the design model, which minimizes the 
average sample number (ASN) and satisfies the producer's and the consumer's risks at the specified 
quality levels. The utility of the proposed sampling plan is shown through comparison with the single 
sampling plan in terms of sample size required for inspections under various combinations of quality 
levels and required risks. The result indicates that two-stage sampling plan involves smaller required 
sample than that corresponding to the single sampling plan. Thus, the propose plan proceeds towards to 
help practitioners efficiently sentence the submitted lots.

Abstract 
In recent years, the level of competition extremely increased for all markets. Due to globalization, similar 
products and services are offered by many players. In order to become stronger in this competitive 
environment, all players must act strategically and enhance their supply chain management activities. Some 
companies try to extend their market share from wholesale level to retail and lower levels. This strategy 
forces companies to reach customers by vendor machines. The aim of this study is to develop a 
mathematical model to optimally manage operations of vendor machines carrying multi-items located at 
different locations. The considered problem handles pricing, routing, inventory management and capacity 
planning problems. We seek an optimal solution that will answer the following research questions: (1) 
Which items should be available at each location and how many towers should be allocated for those items? 
(2) What should be the optimum inventory level of these items at the beginning of each period? (3) Shall
there be any item transfer between locations at each period of time? (4) What should the price for each item
at each location and at each time period be? Our model considers the uncertainty in demand of the items
with the help of scenarios. The proposed model is checked by several functional tests to verify that the
model works properly and gives the expected results. By conducting numerical experiments, we understand
that our model provides efficient solutions to the problem with uncertainties. We also compare the results
of the model with the results of a heuristic approach. When compared with the mathematical model,
heuristic approach does not produce efficient results for the locations without direct link to the supply
centers. The results support usage of the proposed mathematical model.

Abstract 
This paper presents an integrated maintenance and lot-sizing problems under energy constraints with risk 
assessment in the case of unforeseeable circumstance. The considered production system is composed of 
identical parallel machines that must meet a random demand with a required service level. The lot-sizing 
optimization consists in determining the number of operating machines and produced quantity to meet 
demand and/or replenish the stock. Then, an analytical model is developed to determine a common 
maintenance plan for all machines while minimizing the total maintenance cost. The failure rate, of each 
machine, assumed that increases according to both manufactured size and the cumulative failure rate. In 
the second part of this paper, a novel risk assessment is presented in order to overcome the unforeseeable 
circumstance making some machines unavailable. The conducted experiments on generated instances show 
that the proposed approach is efficient and provide good solutions for maintenance plan, lot-sizing plan and 
risk assessment.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the dependability plays a very important role in all industry sectors and even other activities, particularly 
in the defense, aeronautics, space, nuclear, telecommunications and transport. It consists of assessing the potential 
risks, predicting the occurrence of unforeseen failures and attempting to minimize the consequences of catastrophic 
situations when they arise. In that unforeseen situation, risk assessment (Lee et al. (2017), Mossa et al. (2016)) is a 
key part in decision support for industrial stakeholders. In this paper, the risk assessment for a production system aims 
to satisfy the customer orders, their financial consequences and the condition of choosing the outsourcing solution. 
In addition to risk assessment, the industrial stakeholders are responsible for effectively determining the produced lot-
size and the maintenance policy adopted. To ensure increased competitiveness, the industrialists must manage these 
two parts simultaneously and in a complementary way. In this context, several studies have been conducted how to 
combine the lot-sizing and maintenance after several searches in which those two activities are treated independently. 
The study of maintenance policy is started with Barlow and Hunter (1960) and followed by others several works as 
they are cited in Pierskalla and Voelker (1976). However, in the real world, a study of maintenance without considering 
the lot-sizing problem can only lead to bankruptcy. The need for studying novel integrated maintenance and lot-sizing 
strategies became useful. Brandolese et al. (1996) presented a policy for maintaining a multi-machines production 
system. The planning consists in determining the date of each job and the machine that should perform it. They 
introduced the preventive maintenance actions in the lot-size planning by placing them close to optimal maintenance 
periods. Chelbi and Rezg (2006) elaborated a programming model in order to establish both the stock level and the 
preventive maintenance actions for a production system composed of one unit. The optimization of preventive 
maintenance and stock level also treated by Radhoui et al. (2010) with imperfect production system that can move to 
a state called out-of-control after a time considered random. In addition, the authors assumed that stock level and 
production rate are considered as decision variables. Rezg et al. (2008) was addressed the joint inventory control and

7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we studied an integrated maintenance and lot-sizing problems with risk assessment in the case of 
unforeseeable circumstance. The manufacturing system composed of identical parallel subject to energy consumption 
constraints and random failures. Besides, the production system may have an unforeseen impact that may affect the 
availability of certain machines at specific periods. With the aims of decreasing the machines failure rate, a common 
periodic preventive maintenance for all machines is proposed with minimal repair for corrective maintenance. A 
random demand over a ﬁnite planning horizon that must be satisfied by production system with a required service 
level defined by the stakeholders. With this in mind, analytical models have been developed to establish combined 
sub-optimal lot-sizing and preventive maintenance plans that optimize the total costs of lot-sizing, maintenance, 
consumed energy and inventory with regard to different constraints. Besides, to overcome the unforeseeable 
circumstance making some machines unavailable and unable to meets demands, a novel risk assessment is presented 
to assist the company to choose the appropriate subcontractor cost. The proposed approach has been illustrated clearly 
through a numerical example with five machines over six months of production horizon. In the future, we investigate 
to address the lot-size and maintenance plan optimization in the case of new returned products and their influences on 
different costs.

Abstract 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method applied to enhance ecologically sustainable development in the construction 
industry. LCA is used extensively pertaining to the construction industry in developed counties rather than in 
developing countries. Accordingly, this study aimed to develop a literature-based SWOT analysis to examine the 
strengths and opportunities confronted by developed countries and weaknesses and threats faced by the developing 
countries in practicing LCA in the construction industry. The SWOT analysis is a data-driven, fact-based analysis 
used to overlooks internal and external factors to assist decision-making. Findings highlighted that developing 
Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for communication purposes in developed countries is the frequently 
claimed strength in implementing LCA. Lack of accurate LCA data in developing countries can be recognized as a 
highly reported weakness. Initiation of LCA software is the commonly stated opportunity to integrate LCA into the 
construction industry in developed countries. Lack of societies’ environmental awareness has created the greatest 
threat to the application of LCA in developing nations. The study emphasized that developed countries enjoyed a 
literature-based multiplicity of strengths and opportunities whilst developing countries faced a great proportion of 
weaknesses and threats, which need to alleviate to create LCA enabled built environments in developing countries.

Introduction
The construction industry is a prominent contributor to both economic and social development in the contemporary 
world (Behm 2008). Nevertheless, the construction industry has also been identified as the main source of substantial 
environmental impact locally, nationally, and globally (Kylili et al. 2017). Evidently, the construction industry 
contributes immensely to the adverse global environmental impacts: for instance, the construction industry is 
responsible for approximately 40% of the energy consumption, 33% of the global GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions, 
30% of raw material usage, 25% of solid waste generation, 25% of water consumption, and 12% of land use globally 
(Antón and Díaz 2014). Concurring with Xing et al.’s (2011) there is an indication that current building stock and 
other structures will be further escalated by 1% per year due to new constructions. It is probable that these 
environmental issues will become adverse along the timeline (Grundel and Dahlström 2016). Hence, there is an urgent 
requirement to mitigate these formidable environmental challenges that are arising from the construction industry 
activities (Sharma et al. 2011). Subsequently, different methods and tools have come into the practice to alleviate 
undesirable environmental problems, which can address the issues with a multi-disciplinary approach such as energy-
saving, reduction of material usage, and emissions control etc. (Atmaca 2016). 
Consequently, a number of environmental management tools have been implemented over the last decades to assess 
the environmental impacts of construction activities and to identify opportunities for environmental improvements 
(Manuilova et al. 2009). Examples include LCA, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA), Ecological Footprint etc. (Manuilova et al. 2009; Todd 2012). Amongst several environmental 
management tools, the LCA approach can be identified as a globally recognized method used to assess all 
environmental inputs (i.e. raw material, energy and water) and all environmental outputs (i.e. solid waste generation, 
atmospheric emissions, and waterborne waste) throughout the expected lifespan of the construction (Stevenson and

Abstract 
Buildings are long-lasting infrastructures which usually designed to withstand over 60 years. Durability or 
performance of the building is affected by numerous reasons and among that fire incidents may cause direct 
or indirect impacts to the present building or even in old age. Building collapses, implied damages and 
potential injury can be identified as outcomes of fire incidents. Moreover, fire fatalities are reported 
frequently as a red light to the safety of buildings. Despite, many fire detection and protection techniques 
are available for buildings, building fires are still considered as a major threat to the occupants. Thus, to 
ensure fire safety of the building, comprehensive review of past fire incidents to identify factors affecting 
to the fire is needed. Hence, this study aimed at reviewing the factors which are mostly affecting to the 
building fire incidents worldwide. A comprehensive literature review was directed to explore the behaviour 
of building fire, hardware and software measures of fire safety, models for fire impact evaluation, global 
fire incidents in different buildings and factors affecting to the building fire incidents. Building design 
features, refurbishment practices, human behaviour, fire regulations, policies and building codes, fire 
fighting  tools and techniques and perceptions of architects and fire protection engineers were identified as 
factors affecting to the building fire incidents. Finally, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for better 
understanding on past fire incidents and to strive for fire resistant buildings in the future.

1. Introduction
Fire incidents have considerably increased during last years by endangering human lives and have caused economic 
and ecological damages (Félix et al. 2014). Shocking fire events challenged the essence of the building performance. 
Further, among various reasons, uncontrolled fires, is one of the major reasons for building collapses, implied 
damages, potential injury and loss (Wong and Jan 2003). Not only that, at local to regional scales and at global scale, 
emissions due to fire incidents have significant impact on air quality and atmosphere. Moreover, after a fire, people 
tend to be traumatised due to the losses of belongings. Among that, losing the building is one of the most stressful 
factor for building owners (Caia et al. 2010). World Fire Statistics Report 2018 No. 23, which reported fire incidents 
in year 1993-2016, 2.5 to 4.5 million fires occurred and nearly 62 000 fire deaths were reported from 57 countries 
(International Association of Fire and Rescue Services 2018). Accordingly, failure to consider the causes for building 
fire incidents leads to under-performance of existing fire safety system in the building (Xiuyu et al. 2012). This implies 
that there is a necessity of reviewing factors affecting to the building fire incidents, which so far not has been addressed 
as a research area. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to have a precise consideration on the factors affecting to the 
building fire incidents. 
2. Research Methodology
In order to review the contributing factors for building fire, an extensive literature review was conducted. Current 
knowledge on this area was explored through keyword searching (Building fire*, Fire incidents* Factors* Review*). 
Databases such as; Science Direct, Emerald Insight, SAGE, Springer Link and IEEE Xplore were involved to conduct

9. Conclusion
Fire incidents are contributed to the economic and ecological damages worldwide. Failure to consider the factors 
affecting to the building fire incidents leads to under-performance of existing fire safety system in the building and it 
endangering human lives. This research paper presented the findings on factors affecting to the fire incidents in 
buildings. An extensive literature review was undertaken to explore the behaviour of building fire, hardware and 
software measures of fire safety, models for building fire impact evaluation, global fire incidents in different buildings 
and factors affecting to the building fire incidents. Findings of the paper review behaviour of building fire through 
classic fire concept and tetrahedron concept and involvement of hardware and software measures in building fire 
safety. Structural behaviour, material of construction, physical barriers, earth leakage devices, surveillance system, 
automatic fire suppression system, staircase pressurisation system and signage were recognised as hardware measures. 
Software measures are consisted with human monitoring, maintenance of mechanical and electrical systems, trained 
occupants, maintenance of fire barriers and evacuation drills. Early fire detection was recognised as an important 
preliminary firefighting method which includes ultraviolet and infrared detectors, particle sampling, relative humidity 
sampling, smoke analysis, temperature sampling and transparency testing.  Further, existing models for building fire 
impact evaluation, such as CMFST, BFSEM, BAW, FSES, FSCT, GFRM and ICIM were examined as a detailed 
analysis methods for building fires. Different fire incidents in different building structures were also reviewed and the 
highest fire rates relative to population were found in Australia, Bulgaria and Israel.  Asian region was identified as 
the second highest region with fire safety non-compliance and fire was identified as the second highest disaster 
topology in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, factors affecting to the fire incidents in building were recognised through various 
real fires in building worldwide. Building design features, refurbishment practices, human behaviour, fire regulation, 
policies and building codes, fire tools and techniques and perceptions of architects and fire protection engineers were 
evaluated as factors.

Abstract 
TQM implementation serves the purpose of achieving business excellence which eventually leads to 
customer satisfaction, increased profits and higher production for the organization.  The purpose of this 
paper is to investigate the most important success factors of TQM and study its comparative importance 
for enhanced execution in manufacturing industries. In this study a broad literature review was done to 
identify and prepare the list of success factors for sustaining TQM implementation. Analytic hierarchy 
process is used to assign the relative importance and ranking the identified success factors of TQM in 
perspective manufacturing industries. The finding of study demonstrates that ‘Top management 
commitment’ ranked number one and this factor is fundamental for implementing TQM initiatives 
successfully. The success factors ‘education and training’ and ‘rewards & recognition’ ranked at second 
and third positions which need special attention while performing TQM activities in a more effective 
manner. The results also propose a general hierarchy model for judging the relative importance of success 
factors that would influence implementation of TQM.

1. Introduction
In the current circumstances of fiercely competitive environment, different business management tools such as Total 
Quality Management (TQM), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Six-Sigma, Just in Time (JIT), etc. are used by 
many organizations to improve their operational capabilities. In TQM, the organizations used to deploy some 
statistical and management tools for enhancing organizational capabilities through continuous improvement 
approach (Ismyrlis and Moschidis, 2015; Ismyrlis, 2017; Silombela et al., 2018). Total Quality management is 
indeed a joint effort of management, staff members, workforce, suppliers and dealers in order to meet and exceed 
customer satisfaction level (Prajogo and Sohal, 2003; Singh and Smith, 2004; Thai Hoang, Igel and 
Laosirihongthong, 2006). Another definition, Total quality management is a continuous endeavor by employees to 
continuously enhance (Yang, 2006; Prakas and Murali, 2016) the quality of their products and services through 
customers’ feedback. Total Quality management is indeed a joint effort of management, staff members, workforce, 
suppliers and dealers in order to meet and exceed customer satisfaction level. In today’s competitive environment, 
customer satisfaction is a most important concern for all type of organizations (Choi and Eboch, 1998; Reed et al., 
2000; Ugboro and Obeng, 2000). TQM attempts to incorporate all the organizational activities like marketing, 
quality, finance, design, engineering, production and customer service to focus on meeting customer demands and 
organizational objectives (Soltani and Wilkinson, 2018; Sahoo, 2019). TQM not only improve the business 
performance of the companies but also boost the morale and skill of the employees. 
A number of good researchers have emphasized many success factors like leadership commitment, employee 
participation, financial resources, suppliers, communication, customer focus, process approach etc. that are essential 
to effective deployment of TQM implementation in any organization (Kaynak 2003; Rao et al. 2004 and Baird et al. 
2011). TQM is not just a management philosophy but a culture of an organization dedicated towards continuous

Abstract 
Hazards, accidents and ill management in thermal power plants have a big impact on business, whether it's 
due to reduced productivity, lost sales, lower staff morale, or even closure. To prevent and/or mitigate 
workplace injuries, hazards, accidents and to improve productivity, it is needed to establish safety culture 
practice in the entire management system. Use of safety signs is one of the ways for controlling hazards in 
the work environment. Safety signs are widely used to effectively control workplace hazards. In this 
research, different safety culture factors were taken from OHSAS 18001:2007 standard. The objective of 
this study was to assess the safety culture factors in three selected thermal power plants namely Sylhet 150 
MW Combined Cycle Power Plant, Fenchuganj 90 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant and Bibiyana South 
400 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant. This research work describes the key factors of organizational 
health and safety management system. The research also measures the existing safety practice performance 
of the three selected thermal power plants. The collected data were analyzed to explore research findings. 
Lastly recommendations were made to take corrective actions to improve existing safety culture practice in 
the three selected thermal power plants situated in Sylhet, Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
 
Work related accidents and injuries are a major occupational health problem in most of the industrialized countries. 
There are about 340 million occupational accidents and 160 million victims of work-related illnesses annually 
worldwide. These estimates are updated by ILO at intervals, and the updates indicate an increase of accidents and ill 
health [1]. Accident and ill-health record of the thermal power plants compares poorly to that of other economic sectors 
such as manufacturing, construction and railway. The 20th century has experienced a considerable amount of success 
in thermal power plants safety in India. To ensure workers safety as well as the safety of the facility, safety assessment 
and safety management in thermal power plants are necessary. An industrial facility that generates electric power is 
called a power plant. In thermal power plant mechanical power is generated by a heat engine that transforms thermal 
energy often from combustion of a fuel, into rotational energy. As most thermal power plants produce steam, these 
are called steam power plants. The World Bank added that, “Driven by industry, Bangladesh’s economy continues to 
grow at an impressive rate. Bangladesh is among the five fastest-growing economies of the world, despite insufficient 
private sector investment, with a 7.3% GDP growth projection in the FY2019” [2]. To meet the huge demand of energy 
in industries power plants are increasing in a significant number. A large number of people are working in those 
sectors. To ensure their health & safety, no research work has been conducted so far on safety assessment in the 
thermal power plants based on an international standard like OHSAS 18001:2007 worldwide or in Bangladesh. If 
proper safety rules and regulations could be implemented in these plants, the number of accidents and incidents could 
be minimized to almost zero. This research work has tried to show the present scenario of the safety culture practicing 
in the selected three thermal power plants and has tried to identify the gap between the practicing culture and the 
standard cultured proposed in OHSAS 18001: 2007. Then the research work has tried to suggest a better safety practice

different individuals in case of emergencies. Bibiyana South 400 MW Thermal Power Plant has emergency 
preparedness facilities. Most of the sites have separate emergency evacuation paths and large number of mock drills 
are conducted. Routine health check-up is done for employees, specially eye test, hearing test. 
7. CONCLUSION 
This study has tried to assess the current safety culture scenarios in three selected gas turbine thermal power plants. 
As for Sylhet 150 MW Power Plant, OH&S management system, OH&S management organogram and OH&S 
objectives are missing in this power plant. Those are few prime necessities for establishing a good safety culture in 
Sylhet thermal power plant. Health and safety hardware (e.g. PPEs), Health and safety training, Health and safety 
incentives etc. should also be increased in this power plant. All equipment need to be tested periodically as per the 
Factory act 2015. Emergency evacuation paths should be established, and mock drills conducted should be increased. 
In Fenchuganj 90 MW thermal power plant, OH&S management system, OH&S management organogram and OH&S 
objectives Should be established. Number of fire drill, mock drill and vertigo training should be increased in 
Fenchuganj 90 MW thermal power plant. Trees and other vegetation closer to live conductors, transformers and other 
equipment should be trimmed and cleared. Light and sound intensity need to be measured as per Factory Rule 2015. 
Management review of the existing safety culture practice is also necessary for continuous improvement of safety 
culture in Fenchuganj 90 MW thermal power plant. Bibiyana South 400 MW Power Plant has the best safety culture 
practice among the three studied thermal power plants. This power plant is OHSAS 18001:2007 certified and has EHS 
policy award too.

Abstract 
The Philippine governmental structure is divided into four levels such as national, provincial, municipal and barangay. 
Being the basic political unit in the country, the assessment of disaster preparedness and mitigation at barangay level 
is vital in the performance management of the local government. Disasters are also health emergencies and the role of 
the healthcare system is very crucial.   This paper aims to provide an emphasis on the design of survey to evaluate 
healthcare resiliency of barangays using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy methodology. The survey design is tested in 
one of the barangays in the country and serves as a model to determine the factors that need to be prioritized for 
establishing health resilient programs in other barangays.

1. Introduction
The Philippine archipelago ranked 4th in the list of countries that are most prone to natural disasters based on a 20-
year evaluation of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) (Foreign Service Institute, 2016). 
This is evident in the 565 natural disasters that have struck the country leaving an estimate of $23 billion damages and 
70, 000 Filipino lives lost (Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, 2017). The country’s vulnerability 
and its countrymen’s history of grief led to the authorship of the Republic Act of 10121 of 2010. RA 10121 provides 
the legal basis for policies, plans and programs to deal with disasters resulting to the establishment of disaster key 
agency, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). The healthcare system resilience 
of the Local Government Unit (LGU) is one of NDRRMC’s tasks. As the forefront of disaster preparedness and 
response, Barangay DRRMC resilience should be known and strengthened. A survey design to evaluate healthcare 
system resilience at barangay level of the Philippines is the focus of this study.  
As per RA 10121, NDRRMC provisions have to be evaluated every 5 years. Following its establishment in 2010, 
among the 2015 evaluation critical issue is the full-implementation of the law in local levels in order to address the 
non-functionality of current local DRRM system (Rappler, 2015). As a vital part of the Local DRRMC, BDRRMCs 
resilience is lacking based on the 2015 NDRRMC evaluation. However, it is not known how the lack of resilience is 
concerned with the healthcare system in the barangay level. 
The BDRRMC is the unit responsible for materializing the national level’s plans before, during, and after disasters. 
Composed of the barangay captain, the council, a congressman, and non-government organizations, the BDRRMCs 
are tasked to come up with plantillas that will contribute to LGUs’ resilience to disaster that involves training, 
planning, warning, and operations (RA 10121, 2010). However, the presence of government officials alone and 
reliance on the NDRRM Framework cannot fully realize the tasks the BDRRMC are given. Disasters are also health 
emergencies. The key responsibilities of BDRRMC require knowledge in healthcare. The absence of healthcare 
integration can result to its inaccessibility in times of emergency that can cause ill-health or mortality. This makes the 
role of healthcare system in times of disaster very crucial especially with the increasing frequency that disaster strikes

All expert judgements got a consistency ratio of below 10% thus passing the consistency tests. This proves that the 
judgements of each expert were consistent to be used as reliable basis of results. The group consistency ratio also 
passed the 5% limit. This suggests that the individual judgements of the experts have low enough differences to 
achieve a consensus in prioritization. 
 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
Resiliency of healthcare system plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and safety of a community especially 
when a disaster strikes. Developing a framework that can identify the gaps in the current healthcare system in 
barangays will surely help improve the system by integrating the need and capacity of the present systems and giving 
quality health care for the people. The survey developed using Fuzzy AHP can be validated by selecting another set 
of experts from other barangays. Conducting sensitivity analysis is also recommended to further investigate the 
validity of the results.

Abstract 
 
Total Quality Management (TQM) and Lean Production (LP) have been considered as emerging world-class 
manufacturing strategies to meet the increasing demands of customers for product quality at competitive price. 
However, their overall and detailed association has not been fully explored by earlier studies. The objective of this 
study is to describe the overall and detailed relationship of TQM and LP. The result is envisioned to give meaningful 
insights for academicians on the inter-relatedness of TQM and LP as well as for industry practitioners on the potential 
implementation synergy of TQM and LP towards an integrated application, as one system or program. The study was 
conducted using the Philippine Electronics and Semiconductor Industry as the locale, and employee respondents as 
the unit of analysis. Pearson test of correlation was used to test the relationship between TQM and LP. Result showed 
that the overall relationship of TQM and LP is strongly positive and significant. However, when the relationships are 
compared at detailed levels, the extent of relationship varies. Continuous improvement and striving for perfection 
strongly bind TQM and LP while Benchmarking, Supplier Quality management and Pull Production do not strongly 
support the association of TQM with LP.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
Lean Production (LP) and Total Quality Management (TQM) are popular process improvement methodologies, which 
are incremental and continuous (Caffyn, 1999). The integration is also considered as a world class manufacturing 
practice (Forza, 1995; Singh & Ahuja, 2013). As complementary methodologies, this integration can provide gains 
and competitive advantage to organizations if both are fully applied in practice (Andersson, Eriksson & Torstensson, 
2006; Singh & Ahuja, 2013; Mosadeghard, 2013). The integration can improve customer satisfaction through a culture 
of continuous improvement and employee participation (as cited in Dahlgaard & Dahlgaard-Park (2006). The 
integrated model is also anticipated to give more benefits through synergy, thus, minimizing time and effort (Salleh, 
Kasolang, & Jaafar, 2012). Hence, these practices should be considered together as a system for a joint benefit of the 
practices (as cited in Shah & Ward, 2007). 
 
Literature has identified integration issues as barriers to TQM and LP simultaneous implementations. However, these 
issues have not been described and addressed in detail in an implementation perspective. One of the integration issues 
identified is the lack of synergy (Reddy, 2013) further described by Singh & Ahuja (2013) as a result of top 
management ineffectiveness on holistic implementation, lack of clarity in a joint implementation plan, and the 
organization’s inability to change the mindset towards total involvement and systematic thinking. Lack of synergy 
also occurs when TQM is treated as a separate initiative (Bhat & Rajashekhar, 2009). Ricondo & Viles (2005) also 
cited top management problems in implementation such as no clear implementation strategy and conflict of priorities. 
Such issues also stem from dynamic complexity which is related to the high interrelationship and feedback among 
variables like problems that involve processes, products services and people (Ricondo & Viles, 2005). Dahlgaard & 
Dahlgaard-Park (2006) also emphasized that the boundaries of practices like TQM and LP are not clearly defined due 
to high similarities among the concepts. Furlan, et al. (2011) also emphasized that the concept of synergy between 
these practices is vague since it lacks rigorous empirical methods to be tested. Chiarini (2011) also cited that there is

Benchmarking, supplier quality management and pull production do not strongly support the association of TQM and 
LP. This can be attributed to the lower extent of their implementation, indirect linkage with other aspects and the 
specific nature of the aspects. The dependence of pull production and JIT system to supplier quality management 
strongly supports this finding.  The lower extent of implementing and prioritizing long-term supplier relationships 
would have impacted the implementation of JIT system in the companies.  
 
5. Implication of the Study 
The results of this study have implications for the potential integration of TQM and LP as one program in 
manufacturing environments. By having an insight on the detailed and holistic extent of relationship between TQM 
and LP, a comprehensive simultaneous implementation program can be developed with embedded continuous 
improvement techniques. Thus, a minimized effort and resources with a higher managerial success may be 
demonstrated while managing two operational strategies at the same time. 
 
The results of this study also indicate that describing the relationship between two variables using specific to general 
analysis is beneficial to understand the association. In a methodology perspective, this study has forwarded that 
looking the relationship at the aspect or construct level can provide insight on how the elements of a concept being 
analyzed “behave” towards a systematic and holistic relationship. Focusing not only on the absolute description of an 
element or a dimension but also on relative description can also provide insight on the comparative impact towards a 
systematic conclusion and recommendation.  
 
The results of this study also have empirical implications. The validity and reliability of the developed LP instrument 
in this study proved that Womack and Jones’s framework (the 5 principles of Lean) is empirically valid and that this 
can be used as instrument for Lean measures in survey studies. This proof may also provide further confidence to 
industrial consultants and practitioners on the applicability of the Lean framework as the forefront in developing, 
implementing and sustaining Lean practices. Another implication is the establishment of the significant relationship 
between TQM and LP which empirically validated the interrelatedness of TQM and LP. 
 
This study also forwarded information on the gaps (weak items and aspects), constraints (weak relationships) and 
difference in the implementation of TQM and LP. As an implication, companies may need to focus on these aspects 
in a continuous improvement perspective. On the other hand, this study also forwarded on which aspects companies 
may need to use as leverage (strong items, aspects and relationships) to successfully implement TQM and LP.

Abstract 
Rapid development of textile enterprises in Bangladesh led the sector competitive both locally and internationally. 
However, to ensure competitive advantages, textile industries are applying modern approaches to enhance overall 
productivity growth, product quality, standardization, efficiency and effectiveness, reduction of manufacturing cost 
etc. to recover the enterprise fall down to critical point due to effects of liberal policies in international markets. 
Recently, various total quality management (TQM) tools are playing important role as a function of modern 
approaches. TQM tools are practical methods, skills, means or mechanisms that can be applied to particular tasks. 
In this study, two TQM tools, ‘check sheet’ and ‘flow chart’ (or run chart) are used in finishing unit of a garment 
industry in Bangladesh to find out the ways to mitigate significant amount of alter, rework, rejection and improve 
quality and efficiency. Here, check sheet is used to count the number of defects for the selected items. Then, counter 
measures against the root causes is defined and implemented to improve the quality as well as to reduce the rework. 
Finally, a flow chart is developed. After several analyses, it is found that, in finishing unit, rejection or scrap 
decreases by 29.29%, alter or defect per hundred unit (DHU) decreases by 44.60% and significant amount of alter, 
rework and rejection or scrap per style, per month is minimized without any additional investment but by proper 
utilization of internal resources.

1. Introduction
Garment manufacturing industry is complex for many reasons. The product line is a complex array of styles, 
seasons, varying life cycles, and multidimensional sizing. TQM is a powerful technique to control, manage, analyze 
and improve the performance of a process by eliminating special causes of variation in processes such as tool wear, 
operator error, errors in measurements, use of improper raw materials and so on [1]. Tools for quality management 
can help companies to reduce costs, realize zero defects and thus achieve better results. Quality management is now 
extremely important for all organizations, especially for the textile and apparel industry where quality is one of the 
key competitive factors [2]. The goal is to deliver the highest value for the customer at the lowest cost while 
achieving sustained profit and economic stability for the company [3]. With growing global competition, by 
applying quality management principles, organizations will produce benefits for customers, owners, employees, 
suppliers and society as a whole. There are 7 (seven) basic TQM tools which can be used to analyze to find out the 
root causes and eliminates them from the production system, thus the manufacturing process can be improved. 
Based on long experience in quality issues, a renowned quality expert Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa stated that as much as 
95% of quality related problems can be solved with seven fundamental quality tools [4].

6. Conclusion 
 
This study has extracted an overall scenario of the finishing unit of a garments factory in the context of improving 
quality. The study found that there are some common and repetitive defects which happen almost every day during 
production. It is found that by implementing tools and the pillars of TQM, a garment factory can improve quality, 
efficiency, satisfy the employee by providing a good approach in creation of QM environment, introduction of 
employees to TQM, encouraging cooperation and teamwork. Analyzing the product quality and process by using 
the TQM tools can give a remarkable improvement by reducing defect and rework.

Abstract 
Education data mining is data mining on an education dataset with an emphasis to understand the underlying 
patterns in student learning and its performance. The present study pertains to an analysis of performance 
of schools in Delhi, India using a decision tree approach. This helps to classify the schools that according 
to their performance. Data for government schools in Delhi, India for grade XII has been procured from the 
Delhi government education portal and the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) 
portal. 
There are three measures of the school performance, namely, score in the individual subjects, quality index 
of a school and the pass percentage. Scores in a subject is the average score obtained by the students who 
have appeared in the given subject. Quality index of a student is the total score across the five subjects in 
which the student has appeared. Quality index of a school is the average value of quality index of the 
individual students of a school. Pass percentage is the percentage of students that have obtained the 
minimum passing score in all the subjects. The aim of schools is to maximize their pass percentage 
(typically, 100%) as well as the scores, however, first it is desired to improve the pass percentage to have 
minimum levels of attainment for all the students. 
The school input data used in the analysis pertains to its infrastructure that includes classrooms, playground, 
library, etc; its operations that comprises the medium of instruction, implementation of continuous and 
comprehensive evaluation, number of working days, working hours per day, number of inspections by 
external officials and other concerned authorities; school enrolment, and number and distribution of 
teachers; type of school (boys’, girls’ or co-educational) and school category (based on grades offered). 
The variables that are correlated have been removed to yield a reliable rule set.  
The schools are classified based on whether they achieve the minimum acceptable level of performance. 
The schools are classified with two target labels: (i) those that achieve minimum acceptable performance, 
(ii) those that do not have minimum acceptable performance. The decision rule set can be used by the policy
makers to identify and take appropriate corrective actions in the schools to help them with minimum
acceptable performance. The work can be extended to other classification algorithms as well.

Abstract 
Recently, ICT has been developed markedly. As a result, many companies are effectively using 3M + 
I (Man, Material Money + Information), which are management resources. Above all, they attempt to 
increase their competitive advantage with using ICT resources. For this reason, many companies are 
focusing on the acquisition and education of ICT personnel. And companies need effective ICT education. 
Therefore, this study focuses on ICT education in companies, and presents an analysis model for 
quantitatively grasping the effect of ICT education and the relationship between motivation and workplace 
environment. The feature of this analytical model is that the estimated value of motivation can be obtained 
from least squares method of the parameters when the relationship between motivation and its defining 
factors and the relationship between the effect and motivation, workplace environment is combined. This 
makes it possible to quantitatively grasp motivation that is difficult to measure.

Abstract 
Globally, urban development has been limited to improvements in built environment. Similarly, in Sri 
Lanka, compromise of the natural environment and inability to response real life expectations of inhabitants 
have rested the rigorous urban sprawl in a debatable position. Therefore, need for a multi-disciplinary 
approach towards urban development was identified when implementing new development projects. A 
robust environment with affordable amenities, accessibility to services and environmentally sustainable 
community is recognised as a liveable city. Thus, liveability is selected as a common platform to analyse 
this need, because liveability is the short-term suspense of inhabitants of cities of Sri Lanka; especially in 
Colombo. For this study, a survey strategy is adapted by interviewing experts in sociology, ecology, town 
planning and architecture who are experienced in urban planning. A thematic analysis is steered on 
healthcare, security, stability, economy, infrastructure and environment. Study reveals that most of 
liveability indicators related to Sri Lanka are significantly similar to that of global context, yet resettlement 
of slum households, waste management and restoration of the ecologically significant areas are context 
specific. Moreover, attention to socio- economic aspects, environment and character of the city, availability, 
quality and proximity to services are significant when planning urban built environment.

Introduction
Global population is projected to rise form seven billion in 2011 to nine billion by 2050 (UNFPA 2011). As projected 
in World Urbanization Prospects (2014), majority of the major Asian cities are the densest among the cities in the 
world., these cities have a main role in providing social and economic wellbeing to the inhabitants (Mori and 
Christodoulou 2012; Lowe et al. 2015). Consequently, intensified environmental hazards following climatic changes 
and difficulties in managing the increase in urban population construct a pressure to local authorities (Stevenson et al. 
2016). Built environment and built environmental characteristics such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, 
excessive waste generation and the competition to construction resources need to be widely assessed to upgrade quality 
of life of inhabitants (Seto et al. 2012).  
Accordingly, to measure the quality of lives of inhabitants, liveability indices such as EIU liveability index and Mercer 
Quality of life index, have been developed (EIU 2018; Mercer 2018). Liveability indices represent the idealness of a 
city to live in. Liveability concepts support to strike a balance between the practical implementation of development 
projects and the ideal outcomes. In return, a well-planned built environment of a city addresses the issues raised from 
the urbanisation.

Consequently, these liveability indicators should be considered by the planning and policy making authorities when 
developing propagandas for urban development. For instance, experts point out the ability to make house prices in the 
urban areas tolerable through developing condominiums with the involvement of the government. Moreover, some 
interviewees suggest, importance of a constant dialogue with business community to identify the gaps in markets in 
terms of recreational facilities, hotels, retail shops which enables the government to control demand and supply of 
construction projects in the market. When planning urban built environment, the slum and shanty resettlement is a 
sensitive state of affair. Expert on sociology has proposed the slum community should be educated on the benefits of 
serviced condominium facilities and the parks, play grounds and other attached facilities, prevalence of vector borne 
diseases and security to their livelihoods and new opportunities through resettlements. 
Taken together, these results suggest that the urban built environment planning is a balance of inhabitant’s 
expectations, overall development of the city. This study views urban built environment planning with the perception 
of liveability because, in short-run a city needs to be liveable to inhabitants. A detailed list of liveability indicators has 
been derived through the findings which are discussed as significant factors to be considered in urban planning. These 
factors are not explicitly construction related, but represent socio- economic, ecological and cultural stance of urban 
built environment planning. 
6. Conclusion 
In a summary, the significant factors in terms of liveability, that add value to the expansion of urban built environment 
are identified based on the opinions of experts interviewed.  Characteristics such as socio-economic aspects and 
environment and character of city, promote sustainability while characteristics such as inclusiveness through 
connectivity, services and other infrastructure represent resilience of the community. Thus, combining liveability 
concepts with urban built environment indirectly promote sustainability and resilience of the city in the long term. 
Accordingly, rather than carrying out constructions in urban areas with sole profitability view, the overall liveability 
of the area highly persuasive to make the constructions effective. The proper balance of the developments in the cities 
with public parks, housing, services ranging from water supply and electricity supply to schools and recreational areas 
is the key for the success of the business investments in the cities.  
Thus, attention to socio- economic aspects, environment and character of the city, availability, quality and proximity 
to the services are significant when planning and reshaping the urban built environment. Moreover, the connectivity 
of amenities and community through increasing walkability, public and private transportation and upgraded 
infrastructure which facilitate the mobility requirement is viewed as a highly significant yet an area that has not given 
adequate provisions when improving the urban built environment.

Abstract 
Although many studies have focused on identifying the single factors that cause wind-induced damages on 
roofs, the studies carried out in the Sri Lankan context mainly focus on the wind patterns in Sri Lanka and 
the damages to people and property. Therefore, there is a need for pooling of expertise to identify the wind-
induced damages to roof, strategies to mitigate them and challenges encountered to systematically adopting 
avenues in the Sri Lankan context. This study administered a qualitative approach. The extensive literature 
review was followed by semi structured interviews with 07 subject matter experts and data was analysed 
using manual content analysis. The findings revealed that roof is the most vulnerable building element to 
wind disaster, even in the Sri Lankan context. It also proved that location and topography, structures and 
vegetation around the building, proximity and the height of neighbouring buildings or structures, shape, 
elevation and height of the building, choice of roofing material and workmanship are the factors 
contributing to wind-induced damages on roof. Strategies should be adopted considering these factors. 
Reluctance to adhered to current standards and guidelines is the major challenge.

Roof, Winds, Disasters and Mitigations 
1. Introduction
Extreme winds are regarded as one of the severe disasters, causing massive losses of life and possessions across the 
globe (Jin and Yan 2009). The phenomena resulted from the combined effects of strong wind due to heavy rain and 
storm surge have created damages of severe nature to buildings and structures (Tamura and Cao 2009). Wind is caused 
by the temperature gradient of the atmosphere due to variable solar heating of the earth’s surface (Tamura 2005). 
Majority of wind-induced damages create adverse impact on residential houses and low-rise commercial buildings, 
which are all non-engineered structures. This is because the sophisticated design methods developed and adopted in 
building standards/codes are not very often reflected in the construction technologies for those buildings (Baker, 2004; 
Holmes et al. 2006; Tamura and Cao 2009). In addition, damage to openings such as windowpanes and steel shutters 
is also significant since they can trigger the complete destruction of the main frames and develop damage to 
downstream buildings as wind-borne debris (Holmes et al. 2006; Tamura and Cao 2009). According to Tamura (2005), 
most wind-induced damages have been concentrated on roofs and particularly in their cladding around eaves, ridges 
and corners. In the Sri Lankan context, wind events seem to be most prevalent in the latter parts of the year and are 
most likely to occur in the months of June and November (Disaster Information Management System 2018). In 
addition to cyclones, Sri Lanka is often affected by other wind events throughout the year causing destructions to the 
country. The disastrous circumstances triggered by wind has surged an interest to research on wind-induced disasters.

wind prone area could be challenging. Therefore, both designers and workers who are engaged in the construction 
industry has a huge role in minimising the impact of wind-induced damages on roofs. Further, it can be argued that 
some of the triggering conditions of strong wind could also be minimised up to some extent by growing vegetation 
and by adhering to proper landscaping practices. Placing greater responsibility on the construction workforce further 
strengthen the argument that there are no disasters created by nature, but they are man-made.  
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
Roof has been identified as the most critical element vulnerable to wind-induced damages. Previous studies were more 
focused on identifying the factors, which determine the magnitude of the pressure acts on the roof due to wind forces. 
This study, which has adopted a qualitative approach contributes to the existing body of knowledge by identifying key 
factors that influence wind-induced damages on roofs due to wind speed and thus atmospheric pressure and 
additionally human related factors. These factors affirm why roof is the most critical element in the event of a wind 
related disaster.  
The study categorised the wind-induced damages on roof in to two main origins, namely environmental related and 
human related. Accordingly, it was also deduced that minimising damages on roofs due to wind can be done through 
proper land selection by avoiding high-wind susceptible areas and proper design and workmanship of roofs. Thus, the 
study reconfirms that both designers and workers have a greater role in minimising the impact of wind-induced 
damages on roofs. Further, in terms of the impact on the practice, the study would assist the building designers to 
consider appropriate measures when designing roofs.

Abstract 
The construction industry plays a major role in the economy of a country. Therefore, the development of 
the construction industry mainly depends on the effect of the legal system of the country as well. The 
Environmental and Physical Planning Laws are the main two types of legal areas that affect the construction 
industry. Further, the problems or conflicts in the aforementioned law areas had become a reason to create 
disputes in the construction industry. Accordingly, the main aim of this research is to evaluate the 
applicability of the specific Laws and Regulations which are considered under by Environmental Law and 
Physical Planning Law relating to the Construction Industry of Sri Lanka. To attain the aim, an extensive 
literature synthesis was conducted to identify the problematic and conflicting areas in the existing 
Environmental and Physical Planning Law. Moreover, literature sources related to international 
Environmental and Physical Planning Law context were brought into the picture to recognize the potential 
solutions and the recommendations for the proper implementation of said Laws. Accordingly, problematic 
areas in the construction project licensing process, review of the power factor of the UDA regulations were 
identified as critical factors for a successful legal implementation. Conclusions had presented the 
impression that how the existing said law areas would affect the construction issues related to the Sri Lankan 
context.

activity until obtaining the environmental clearance over EIA procedures and ordered to make clear the EIA report 
according to the Act (Colombo - Katunayake Expressway Case, 1993). 
 
Then in the Balankulame and Others vs. Secretary - Ministry of Industrial Development (Eppawala Phosphate 
Case) is mainly relating to the Protection of Natural Resources and Cultural Heritage area. In here petitioners stated 
that Eppawala phosphate mining projects sites in agriculturally developed area, which closed to the Yoda Ela scheme. 
The plaintiffs filed a case against the government for proposal to allow a US multinational company to manufacture 
the phosphate fertilizer using apatite deposits at Eppawala. It was aimed to extract apatite from entire reserves of the 
area and export it. Due to that reason petitioners stated that the Yoda ela scheme could be getting damaged also. 
Supreme Court decides that, even the archaeological reserves definitions not cover a ''cultural heritage landscape'' 
such as Yoda Ela, it must be under the Heritage Convention. The court held that there are some environmental hazards 
due to implementing of the project and ordered the government for cancellation of the project. So from this court 
order it was help to protect the right to environment and also the economics right of the peoples who lived in that area 
(Eppawala case, 2000).  
 
5. Impact on the Physical Planning Laws from the Environmental Laws Regarding 
Construction Issues. 
 
This review mainly discussed the Environmental Laws and Physical Planning Laws that affect the construction 
industry of Sri Lanka. In that case, the related Acts, Ordinances, and Regulations also present to get a clear idea of 
this process. There are the main two authorities that control the above two Laws separately. The Environmental Law 
is controlled by the Central Environmental Authority and Physical Planning Law is controlled by the Local Authorities 
and Urban Development Authority in Sri Lanka. So the National Environmental Act of Sri Lanka also provides for 
the issue of directions by the CEA to local authorities. Under this legal mechanism, the CEA can instruct the local 
authority to undertake environmental improvements or protection work (Wijayadasa and Ailapperuma, 2005).  
 
This arrangement is of much use, as in Sri Lanka the local authorities are responsible for planning approval for 
construction in urban and other built-up areas, as well as for cleansing and some sanitary services. Then Article 76(3) 
of the Constitution empowers Parliament to make law empowering any person or body to make subordinate legislation 
for prescribed purposes. The 13th Amendment to the constitution established nine provincial councils and empowered 
them to formulate Law on developed subjects. According to the Powers and functions that spelled out in the UDA Act 
develop environmental standards and prepare environmental improvement works also getting influenced by the NEA. 
And also in the National Environmental Act, Part IVC mainly relates to the 'approval of projects' and establishes a 
process known as the 'environmental assessment' (De Mel, et al., 2009). 
 
1994 amendment of NEA delegated the authorization to the local authorities to issue EPL, for low polluting industries. 
In that case, the approval process of the project was mainly given to the Project Approving Agencies (PAA). These 
project approving agencies are the Ministries and other related government organizations like urban councils, 
Municipal Councils, and Urban Development Authority. That control by the Physical Planning Acts and Ordinances. 
The CEA's environmental management functions are holistic and they are very well set out in section IV of the act. 
Then Regime of liability and compensation for damage to the environment can see in the Environmental Handbook 
for Pradeshiya Sabha, Urban councils, under the Institutional arrangements.  
 
6. Conclusions   
 
This research commences with a brief introduction to the present status of the Sri Lankan construction industry. 
Throughout the discussion, the major legal aspects that affect the field were presented. Further, the Environmental 
Law and the relevant Acts such as National Environmental Act and other relevant environmental licenses such as 
environmental impact assessment, architectural impact assessment are being discussed under the point of view of the 
construction industry of Sri Lanka. Subsequently, this paper has elaborated on the physical planning Law and other 
Ordinances such as local government Laws, Urban Development Authority Laws and regulations, Housing and Town 
improvement ordinances which would mainly affect the process of the construction industry.    
 
The objective to explore the impact of above mentioned Environmental and Physical Planning Laws regarding the 
operation of the construction projects was achieved by finding out the impact of the aforementioned Laws, and then

reviewing it in accordance to identify the further improvement process in Sri Lanka construction industry. During this 
process, both Environmental and Physical Planning Laws can be divided into the sub-sections. Further, the impact of 
all of those sub-topics which are related to the construction industry of Sri Lanka can be evaluated. However, the 
following major areas that are being affected by the construction process would be evaluated. They are the National 
Environmental Act, and the procedure of the licensing part. When it comes to the Physical Planning Law, the following 
major areas that are being affected by the construction process were evaluated. Those were Housing and Town 
Improvement Ordinance, Urban Development Authority Law and Regulations, Town and Country Planning 
Ordinance, Local Government Law (Municipal Council Ordinance, Urban Council Ordinance, Pradeshiya Sabha Act). 
All of these sections may principally explain the impact of each topic concerning the construction industry of Sri 
Lanka.

Abstract 
Over the past decade, the increased global focus on sustainability forced organizations to integrate 
sustainability aspects into their supply chains. As a result, Green Vehicle Routing Optimization came into 
action to facilitate the reduction of adverse environmental impacts from distribution networks. This study 
presents a vehicle routing optimization model with the objectives of minimizing both operational cost and 
carbon emission considered in the form of a cost. Study has been carried out in four stages: a critical 
review of literature on Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP); development of a mathematical model to 
minimize operational cost and carbon emission cost; development and tuning of Genetic Algorithm (GA) 
to solve the problem formulation using benchmarked instances. The final output of the model developed 
from this study can be used by logistics service providers to design their transportation networks for 
optimizing the carbon emission reduction and cost reduction.

Introduction
Logistic processes account for a larger portion of the supply chain costs thus, forcing organizations to implement 
mechanisms to minimize costs. Hence, Vehicle Routing Optimization came into practice where distribution 
networks are designed to minimize the operational costs while achieving performance indicators like customer 
satisfaction, reduced delivery time, etc. 
However, with the rising global pressure to ensure sustainability in supply chains, Green Logistics emerged with the 
focus on implementing distribution strategies that reduce the environmental footprints from distribution networks. 
This gave rise to a new branch of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) namely, the Green Vehicle Routing Problem 
(GVRP). GVRP can be classified into three major categories as Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem (PRP) and 
VRP in Reverse Logistics (VRPRL) (Lin, et al., 2014). This study has been carried out with the focus of minimizing 
both the operational cost and CO2 emission from the distribution network thus belongs to the PRP category. 
VRPs are NP-hard and hence, in order to overcome the computational constraints associated with the problem meta-
heuristics have been used in the recent past (Cooray & Rupasinghe, 2017). Genetic Algorithms (GA) is one such 
meta-heuristics algorithm designed to provide a near-optimal solution for optimization problems of this kind. These 
employed meta-heuristic algorithms can be parameter tuned to generate better performances. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the literature review followed by a description of 
the methodology given in Section 3. Section 4 presents a modified mathematical model to minimize the operational 
cost and Carbon emission from a distribution network. The implementation procedure and the results achieved from 
the study are given in Section 5 and 6 respectively. The paper concludes by giving conclusions and future research 
propositions that are presented in Section 7 and 8.

7. Conclusion & Limitations 
Over the past few decades, the concerns on Carbon emission reduction increased over the globe. Many governments 
and international environmental bodies came together in implementing policies and strategies to minimize the 
current emission rate. Vehicle routing optimization strategy is widely used for designing transportation networks to 
achieve operational cost minimizations and with the rise of sustainability considerations, a new branch of VRP 
emerged namely Green Vehicle Routing Problem. GVRP focuses on the minimization of negative environmental 
impacts resulted from transportation. With the current competition within the world, to achieve operational profits 
and environmental goals, organizations need to focus on the dual minimization of operational costs and 
environmental negativities.  
This study presents a mathematical model for achieving multiple objectives of operational cost reduction and 
Carbon emission reduction. The model has been developed as an extension of the study carried out by (E., et al., 
2015) and researchers have been able to identify a computationally efficient GA by identifying parameter values i.e. 
tournament size as 5, generation size as 1000, mutation rate as 0.0025 that bring out the most optimum result in 
solving the mathematical model. This study can be considered as the first instance of using a tuned GA for solving 
multi-objective VRP. 
Analysis showcase that the highest reduction in the total cost is achieved when the tournament size is equal to 5, the 
size of the generation is equal to 1000 and when the mutation rate is 0.0025 where the average percentage reduction 
in the cost at these mentioned parameters is 58.3%. 
This study has been carried out based on the assumption that the vehicle fleet consists of homogenous vehicles only 
and by neglecting the impact from the road gradient for calculations. 
8. Future Work 
With this researched a tuned GA has been experimented with a network consisting of a single depot and a 
homogenous vehicle fleet. Hence, for future work, it is suggested to carry out studies considering networks with 
multiple depots, heterogeneous vehicle fleets, and time-windows considerations. For future studies, considerations 
can also be placed on networks with stochastic demands.

Abstract 
Organizations invest considerable resources on consumer acquisition. Therefore, retention of these 
consumers becomes crucial for them to build their market presence. Consumer switching between 
competing products that provide standardized services may occur where consumers’ personal traits and 
psychological perceptions play the major role of switching intention rather than the service attributes. In 
order to counteract this behaviour, it is imperative that organizations understand the switching intentions of 
consumers. Therefore, there is a need of an accurate model to assess switching behaviour. Although several 
studies have used different models (i.e. Push-Pull-Mooring migration model) and theories (i.e. Theory of 
Planned Behaviour, Prospect Theory) to analyze switching behaviour they have not fully explained why 
switching takes place. Use of personality traits to explain the gaps are limited. Following a systematic 
review of the literature, the psychological approach of theory of planned behaviour and the Five-factor 
model of personality was used to develop a conceptual model to assess switching behaviour. The model 
has been validated through expert opinion.

Introduction
Organizations in today’s competitive world are becoming extremely consumer-oriented, realizing that retention of 
current consumer base is much more cost effective & feasible than acquiring new consumers. Therefore, retention of 
these consumers becomes crucial for them to build their market presence. Consumer satisfaction always plays the 
major role in consumer retention as consumers tends to be loyal to the organizations that satisfied them. It is vital for 
organizations to prevent consumers from switching towards other competing products or services to maximize the 
customer retention. 
According to Ahmed et al. (2015) consumer switching behaviour is being considered as a complex study of factors 
which he described as the behaviour of consumers switching their purchase within brands influenced or stimulated by 
those factors. There are several studies that found that service attributes and elements of customer satisfaction play 
the major role in switching intention of consumers. They are always looking for and switching towards the products 
or services may provide comparatively better performance. However, it has been noted that consumers switch even 
within products or services offering very similar attributes. In these cases where the products or services have the 
equal chances of being selected, consumers’ personal traits and psychological perceptions play the major role in 
consumer switching. Since all the service providers within some particular product or service category provide 
standardized services there is no point in spending more on the product or service improvements as they don’t make 
much impact. Therefore, understanding the consumers and preventing them from switching will provide much greater 
benefits. Consequently, the benefits of consumer retention and the negative impacts of consumer switching drive 
researchers to address this issue. In order to limit switching, it is mandatory that organizations understand the switching 
intentions of consumers to counteract this behaviour. 
There were several studies have been carried out in the past and models such as: Push-Pull-Mooring migration model 
and General Systems Theory of Consumer switching models and theories such as:, theory of Planned Behaviour

5. Conclusion 
 
Consumers switching between very similar product and services are majorly driven by the personality traits and other 
psychological factors. This study focused on developing a psychological model to assess the psychological perspective 
of consumer switching behaviour. A gap was established from existing literature as the models which explained 
consumer switching behaviour from a psychological approach did not use personality traits. It is believed the 
theoretical model developed following a systematic review of literature will be able to better explain consumer 
switching behaviour among similar products and services by conceptualizing one of the special cases where emotions 
play the major role than service attributes. The proposed model should be empirically validated in different contexts 
and can be developed further with different constructs to explain consumer switching behaviour for different contexts 
in the future.

Abstract 
This research proposes an optimal Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart for 
monitoring the failure rate of buses in a transport company to improve the quality of service, avoid negative 
impacts and enhance the customers’ satisfaction. The charting parameters of the EWMA chart, including 
the weighting parameter and the control limit, are optimized to achieve the best detection effectiveness. 
The proposed control chart is compared with the optimal NP chart in terms of the Average Number of 
Failures (ANF) since the shift occurs until the control chart can detect it. Failure data were obtained from 
the company for the implementation of the control charts. The results of the comparative study reveal that 
the EWMA chart substantially outperforms the NP chart, especially for detecting small and moderate shifts. 
It is very beneficial for the company to use an effective monitoring tool to guarantee continuous 
improvement and a high standard of efficiency.

1. Introduction
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart is one of the most powerful control charts to reduce the 
variation and improve the quality of manufacturing systems and service sectors. This chart is widely used to detect 
small and moderate shifts. To detect an upward p shifts, a statistic Ct is updated and plotted for the tth sample in an 
EWMA chart

Figure 3. Values of ATS (NP)/ATS (EWMA) 
 
As shown in Table 1, when there is no shift (δ = 1), both control charts have a value of ATS larger than or close to the 
false alarm rate, which is 500. This means that the process is in control and the comparison is fair. This also ensures 
that the requirement on the false alarm rate is satisfied. It is noted that the ATS0 value of the EWMA chart (=500.15) 
is fairly closer to the predetermined τ (=500) because this chart has more than one charting parameter that can fit the 
constraint (ATS0≥ τ) and as a result, its potential effectiveness can be better utilized. On the other hand, the NP chart 
with only one integral parameter (UCL) generates an in- control ATS0 (=710.89) much larger than τ (=500).  
Figure 3 shows that the EWMA chart outperforms the NP chart for detecting small and moderate shifts (δ ≤ 5) to a 
significant degree, but the NP chart detects the large shifts (δ ≥ 6) faster than EWMA chart with a very slight 
superiority. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This research proposes an optimization design of the EWMA chart. The design algorithm optimizes the charting 
parameters of the EWMA chart so that the best overall performance can be achieved and, in the meantime, the 
constraint on the false alarm rate is satisfied. The main objective is to detect the increasing shifts in the failure rate as 
soon as possible. This will definitely help the decision-makers take a quick action to analyze the failure and 
recommend the required solutions. 
A performance assessment has been carried out between the optimal NP and EWMA charts. The results of the 
comparative study reveal that the optimal EWMA chart outperforms the optimal NP chart substantially for monitoring 
the failure rate of buses. Specifically, The EWMA chart is more effective than the NP chart by 67% in terms of ANF. 
This study highlights the importance of optimization design in control charts. The optimization design has 
convincingly achieved higher overall effectiveness for the EWMA chart.

Abstract 
The emergence of Health 4.0 has become significant due to the development of technologies worldwide. 
Hence, the latest technologies have to be attuned and the competencies of employees should be altered to 
adapt the features of Industry 4.0. An empirical gap has been identified in the field of health 4.0 in a global 
context with expert reviews based on a pilot study. Still, assessing employee proficiencies in health 4.0 
remains relatively unexploited. Therefore, identification of the needed competencies and transition is vital 
for the healthcare industry globally. The overall objective of this study is to seek the potential for the 
adaptation of industry 4.0 for the healthcare sector and to investigate the required level of employee 
competencies to yield maximum benefits from the technology implementation. A systematic review of the 
literature has been carried out to investigate the different assessments and models of studies existing. A 
keyword-based search was conducted in research databases through three main domains namely, 
technologies required for industry 4.0, healthcare sector and employee competency assessment for industry 
4.0 for selecting 50 relevant research papers that have been published and proven as valid, to extract the 
knowledge for this study. According to the relevance, 33 articles were selected for the literature review. A 
framework was developed to benchmark and acquire the key processes of healthcare, the latest technologies 
and the applications used in health 4.0, as well as employee competencies required for each level of 
technology adaptation. It is expected that this framework can be improved and validated empirically 
through case studies in the Sri Lankan healthcare sector as to future research.

Introduction 
Today we are experiencing the 4th industrial revolution where the computers and automation come together in a new 
way. This is termed as Industry 4.0.; an industrial concept which influences individualization and virtualization across 
different industrial domains where most companies and operations tend to be service-oriented rather than product 
oriented.  
Industry 4.0 is the current trend in automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. The industrial 
revolution started from factory production using steam power, water power and mechanization (Industry 1.0) and 
moved into mass production, assembly line and electricity (Industry 2.0). The third industrial revolution started with 
computerization and automation. The fourth is the move towards digitization.  Industry 4.0 uses the Internet of Things 
(IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as sensors, big data, and powerful analytics, and communication 
infrastructures. Smart factories will be the heart of Industry 4.0, in which CPS monitors the physical processes of the

Conclusion 
 
This paper conducts a comprehensive review of literature for Industry 4.0 and presents an overview of its content, 
scope, and technologies, examining existing literature in all databases within Web of Science and Google Scholar.  
The selected 33 papers are grouped into five research categories and reviewed. This paper presents a state-of-the-art 
survey of the ongoing research on Industry 4.0. An empirical gap has been identified in the field of health 4.0 in a 
global context with expert reviews based on a pilot study. Still, assessing employee proficiencies in health 4.0 remains 
relatively unexploited. Therefore, identification of the needed competencies and transition is vital for the healthcare 
industry globally. 
This framework can be used by the healthcare sector practitioners as a guideline to acquire new talents in planning for 
training programmes compatible with the technologies in use. It is suggested that this framework can be improved and 
validated by industry and academic experts empirically through case studies in Sri Lankan healthcare sector as future 
research.

Abstract 
As frontline service providers, the contact centre agents are bound to experience occupational stress with having to 
meet the customers’ demands and shareholders expectations. Occupational stress is a growing problem that can cause 
significant cost to individual workers performance and that of the organization. Studies performed on stress provide 
insight into patterns of stress level among various occupations such as that is the call centre of banks in South Africa. 
New developments in managing job related stress emerge almost all the time and that should be an indication of just 
how much the topic of stress needs attention. The purpose of this study was to find the level of occupational stress and 
its relationship to work performance among contact centre agents working in a bank in South Africa.  
The study used descriptive-correlational research design and the survey method was used to gather data regarding 
occupational stress. The respondents were the contact centre agents of South African banks. This study could well 
provide perception of occupational stress to the employees in the bank’s contact centre in South Africa, and this may 
lead to better understanding of self-apprehension which can enable them to have a productive working environment.

Abstract 
This article proposes a salient feature to enhance the detection speed of the EWMA scheme based on the 
power of the difference between the actual number and the target in-control number of nonconforming 
items. We refer to it as wEWMA scheme and show that the traditional EWMA chart is a special case of the 
proposed scheme. We discuss the optimal design procedure of the scheme, including the determination of 
its charting parameters to ensure the best overall performance. The results reveal that the developed 
wEWMA scheme has better overall detection effectiveness than the traditional EWMA chart. Specifically, 
the former outperforms the latter by 35% for the tested cases under different specifications.

1. Introduction
Unlike Shewhart charts that only use data concerning the number d of nonconforming items in the last sample, the 
binomial Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart comprises all the data in the sequence of observed 
values of d. As a result, EWMA charts typically outperform Shewhart charts (Castagliola et al. 2016). Roberts (1959) 
first introduced the notion of the EWMA schemes in the context of monitoring the mean of a normally distributed 
quality characteristic. When the EWMA chart is used for detecting p shifts, the statistic Et is updated for each tth 
sample as follows:

where dt is the number of nonconforming items existed in the tth sample, d0 (= n × p0 where n and p0 are the sample 
size and in-control fraction nonconforming, respectively) is the in-control value of dt, and λ (0 < λ < 1) is the weighting 
parameter.

viewpoint considering various values of τ, n, p0 and δmax, the wEWMA scheme is outperforming the EWMA scheme 
by 35%. 
In this context, it is worth mentioning that the traditional EWMA scheme is unlikely to possess a better overall 
detection speed than the wEWMA scheme as the EWMA scheme is merely a special case of the wEWMA scheme. If 
w of a wEWMA scheme is equal to 1 and its λ and H are equal to those of an EWMA scheme, then this wEWMA 
scheme will work exactly as the EWMA scheme. Consequently, a wEWMA scheme can be always designed so that 
it will act either better than or at least equal to the EWMA scheme.

5.  Conclusion 
This article proposes a wEWMA control scheme for monitoring increasing shifts in proportion p of nonconforming 
items in a binomial model. The traditional binomial EWMA chart is just a special case of the proposed scheme. Our 
monitoring statistic uses (dt – d0)w instead of difference (dt – d0). By applying this salient feature, the wEWMA is able 
to considerably outperform its traditional counterpart for detecting p shifts much quickly in terms of AND in different 
scenarios. The binomial EWMA scheme is, in general, not as efficient as its generalized version, namely, the wEWMA 
scheme. As a result, the wEWMA scheme should replace the EWMA scheme for all SPM applications.  
This article assumes that the number of nonconforming items dt follows a binomial distribution with a known p0, and 
the shift δ follows a uniform distribution. Thus, studying the performance of the wEWMA scheme when dt and δ 
follow other distribution rather than the binomial and uniform, respectively, is worthwhile. Another prospective future 
work would be to investigate how the detection speed of the wEWMA scheme is affected when p0 is estimated from 
a limited number of samples.

Abstract 
Sri Lankan apparel industry is the most significant contributor to the country’s economy by constituting a 
large portion of GDP. In the competitive apparel world, manufacturers search solutions for future problems 
such as worker inadequacy to minimize human intervention to increase productivity. Therefore, there is a 
need to align value chain operations with the latest technologies. The world is now experiencing the fourth 
industrial revolution that integrates emerging digital technologies; cyber-physical systems, Internet of 
Things, big data, simulation, cloud computing and augmented reality. Industry 4.0 enhances process 
functions by providing real-time visibility for smooth production flow. Before aligning with Industry 4.0, 
there is an urgent need for assisting companies to improve their capabilities. Current literature mentions 
various existing readiness assessment models, but there is no standard and well-accepted model. This 
research presents applications of industry 4.0 in apparel industry and analysis of existing Industry 4.0 
readiness assessment models based on systematic review of literature. Evaluation criteria were proposed to 
evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model. This study will guide academics to develop a 
standardized readiness assessment model for Industry 4.0 that fills the current research gap, while 
practitioners may find assistance in implementing appropriate scenarios in apparel industry.

1. Introduction
Sri Lanka’s apparel industry is the most significant and driving contributor for the country’s economy by employing 
a labour force of over 990,000 and contributing over $5 billion to GDP (Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2018), (Export 
Development Board, 2018). This industry has achieved rapid growth rates over the past four decades despite the 
increasing competition and a rapidly evolving global marketplace for apparel. Today, the apparel industry as the Sri 
Lanka’s primary foreign exchange earner accounts for 40% of the total exports and 52% of industrial product exports 
(Export Development Board, 2018). Apparel categories such as lingerie, sportswear, swimwear and work wear are 
manufactured and exported with the flexibility of catering for specific seasons of many countries around the world. 
Apparel is a human-centric industry and that is a challenge for a small country like Sri Lanka when compared to other 
regional players. Labour shortages and the record number of labour turnover can be identified as the major challenges 
in the current apparel industry in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the apparel manufacturing organization needs to implement 
innovative solutions to overcome these challenges using new technological capabilities. As a result of that, these 
companies have been left with the option of automating some of their processes for being sustainable (Jayatilake and 
Withanaarachchi, 2016). It seems that the apparel manufacturers are in the first step of converting their plants into 
smart factories. Therefore, the apparel industry is likely to get the benefit of Industry 4.0 for most of the processes in 
the apparel value chain to find solutions to the aforesaid challenges while enhancing the overall performance and 
achieving their desired goals. 
The world has experienced three distinct industrial revolutions since 1800s. The first industrial revolution (industry 
1.0) was the usage of water and steam power for the invention of steam machines and all sorts of other machines. The 
second industrial revolution (Industry 2.0) is the period where electricity and new manufacturing inventions like the 
assembly line led to mass production and certain extent to automation. The third industrial revolution (Industry 3.0) 
was the rise of computers and computer networks; Robotics in manufacturing, the birth of the Internet, which is the

in implementing appropriate scenarios in apparel industry. The outcome of this study will help to guide future research 
on the development of standardized readiness assessment model for Industry 4.0 that fills the existing research gap.

Abstract 
The improvement and reinforcement of logistics and freight distribution in cities can be achieved by 
managing the factors affecting deliveries in urban areas. Traffic congestion and time windows of deliveries 
are the most critical factors in solving distribution planning problems and executing deliveries in an urban 
environment. Traffic congestion affects the feasibility of delivery schedules and should be taken into 
account during the initial scheduling, as well as during the execution of deliveries. Time windows should 
be ensured during the initial scheduling of deliveries, but any rescheduling should guarantee that this 
restriction is not violated. Contemporary software technology can assist the scheduling and execution of 
freight distribution in cities. Logistics companies could exploit technologies, such as Cloud Computing 
(CC) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for optimizing the efficiency of their deliveries. Real-time data of
traffic flow and speed of vehicles, collected from sensors, can improve the accuracy of deliveries and
increase customer satisfaction. Alongside, the significant volume of data can be stored, processed and
utilized, through CC. This technology can quickly provide information and take real-time control over
critical processes, to ensure efficiency. The scope of this paper is to describe the architecture of a cloud-
based transportation system. The system integrates routing and traffic forecasting algorithms with CC and
IoV technologies. The functionality of the system includes the initial, static scheduling of deliveries and
the routing of the vehicles. It takes into account the time-windows of the customers and the feasibility of
the schedules based on traffic congestion forecasts. Besides, the system collects real-time data of the current
situation of the trucks and the real conditions of the traffic in the streets of the city, in order to reschedule
the deliveries, if it detects an expected violation of the time windows.

web applications for data input. Output data from the cloud system can be sent through APIs and REST or SOAP 
protocols, using the same or different ID API number with the input data.  
Cartographical data from geographical systems will be retrieved using APIs created by their providers. The geocoding 
of the end point of delivery will be succeeded through REST protocol and through JavaScript Library which has many 
capabilities of interaction on the maps.  
Vehicle routing and scheduling algorithms, as well as the traffic forecasting algorithms, will be developed in python 
or .net programming languages, but C++ is still an option, due to its extended available numerical libraries.   
The big data processing technology integrates IoV data from vehicles devices and online traffic data from data 
providers. This technology will use various techniques and processing methods like NoSQL databases for unstructured 
data, knowledge discovery tools, data virtualization, data integration, stream processing, parallel processing. Yue and 
Jiang (Yue & Jiang, n.d.) present an overview of the recent methods in supporting big data management and analysis 
for the geospatial and mapping domain. The objective of big data management needs virtualization into cloud 
architectures using the cloud management platforms for Infrastructure-as-a-Service, exploiting the cloud architecture 
in which the transportation system will be built. The development of the cloud computing infrastructure is the next 
phase of the research project while the final selection of the technologies is going to materialize soon.  
 
5. Conclusions and Further Research 
The proposed architecture of the transportation system incorporates the current trends in the application of industry 4 
in supply chain and logistics. It integrates static data for vehicle routing and scheduling and real-time data for 
monitoring and rescheduling of routes, avoiding inconsistences in the schedules. It is a decision support system that 
can offer efficiency in the delivery of goods and keep in a high level the customer satisfaction of its users. Cloud 
computing is used in order to build and provide the system for decision making in routing and scheduling operations 
of logistics companies or generally of companies that need to prepare their distribution plans in urban areas. The 
development of the designed system is part of an ongoing research project carried out by the Industrial Engineering 
Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens in partnership with a software company.

Abstract 
The issue of scheduling interrelated product development activities is important and of particular concern to project 
managers. To help them with this issue, several studies have proposed methods for scheduling interrelated activities. 
However, these methods are of limited practicality because of their complexity and because they require input 
information that is difficult to obtain in the beginning stage of product development. This paper introduces interpretive 
structural modelling (ISM) technique as an alternative tool for scheduling interrelated activities. For the 
demonstration, the technique is applied to real-world project data adapted from the literature. The results show that 
ISM can be considered as a promising practical tool for scheduling interrelated activities.

Introduction
Before the 1980s, most of the activities related to product development projects were performed sequentially. 
However, intense competition has compelled companies to create new products at a progressively faster pace using 
the engineering and management philosophy of concurrent engineering (Creese and Moore 1990). In addition to 
shortening the product development (PD) time, and thus the time to the market, the recorded benefits for this practice 
include decreased costs, less engineering changes, defect reductions, less rework and scrap, higher quality, and better 
return on assets (Lawson and Karandikar 1994). In concurrent engineering, the PD process is accelerated by 
performing parallel and interdependent (coupled) activities in addition to dependent activities (Hu et al. 2003). A well-
designed schedule that considers information flow among interrelated activities is the key to having a successful 
project (Smith and Eppinger, 1998; Lin et al. 2010; Shaja and Sudhakar 2010). According to Zhang et al. (2015), 
failing to consider the information flow among interrelated activities can lead to severe project overruns. 
Unfortunately, sequencing the activities can be challenging since traditional project management tools, like the Gantt 
chart, the critical path method (CPM), and the program evaluation review technique (PERT), permit the modeling of 
sequential and parallel processes but do not tackle interdependency (Eppinger et al. 1994; Smith and Morrow 1999; 
Batalllas and Yassine 2006). As a result, several studies have proposed alternative methods for scheduling interrelated 
activities (e.g., English, Bloebaum, and Miller 2001; Chen and Lin 2003; Whitfield et al. 2003; Meier, Yassine, and 
Browning 2007; Chen and Huang 2007; Lancaster and Cheng 2008; Bashir, AlZebdeh, and Abdo 2009; Liang 2009; 
Luh et al. 2009; Shaja and Sudhakar 2010; Lin et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; David 2013; Qian and Lin 2014; Lin et 
al. 2015, 2018). However, these methods might have limited practicality because they involve the use of complex 
techniques, such as tearing algorithms (Luh 2009), heuristic optimization methods (e.g., Lin et al. 2012), genetic 
algorithms (e.g., Meier, Yassine, and Browning 2007), and simulated annealing with genetic algorithms (Lin et al. 
2018). This limited practicality could present a significant challenge in the case of high-performance products or the 
complex systems comprising tightly interdependent activities. Furthermore, most of these methods use design 
structure matrix (DSM) for visualizing interdependencies among project activities (Browning 2001). One limitation 
of DSM is that it does not reveal accumulated or multi-level interdependencies (Laslo 2010). To surmount these 
limitations, this paper demonstrates the usage of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) as a tool for sequencing 
interrelated activities.

3. Conclusion  
 
In today’s highly competitive environment, product development companies face intense competition and shorter 
product life cycles, requiring the development of high-quality products at a rapid pace. In such an environment, 
production development projects often involve a myriad of interrelated activities, and the schedule of these activities 
can significantly affect the project’s success. To assist design mangers with this issue, researchers have proposed 
several scheduling methods. However, these methods have limited practicality. To overcome this limitation, this paper 
proposed using the ISM technique for scheduling project activities. For demonstration, the technique was applied to 
a real product development project adapted from the literature. The performance evaluation of using this technique as 
a scheduling tool would be one of the directions for further research. Last but not least, the practicability of the approach 
was demonstrated using published real data project. The results of this demonstration could encourage practitioners and 
researchers to test further the practicality of the approach on more real-world projects

Abstract 
Maintenance policy is critical to the efficient and reliable operation of an offshore wind power system. 
Employing a good maintenance policy may increase the reliability while reducing the maintenance cost of 
the system. This study proposes a two-step approach for optimizing the maintenance policy of offshore 
wind power systems. The first stage applies a genetic algorithm to determine the appropriate maintenance 
threshold of each of the components under consideration. The second stage utilizes a fuzzy multi-objective 
programming approach to optimize the maintenance threshold of the entire system. Computational study 
shows that the proposed approach increases the reliability of the offshore wind power system by 1.63% 
while reducing the maintenance cost of the system by 1.19%.

Abstract 
Lean principles have been increasingly used in the field of manufacturing over the last decades, and their 
applicability has recently spread from production to warehousing. In this context, a number of studies have 
reported that lean warehousing, a relatively new concept, can play a significant role in decreasing the cost 
of logistics operations and reducing delivery time, thereby increasing customer satisfaction. However, the 
subject of lean warehousing is still in its infancy, and there is a need for more empirical studies to confirm 
its usefulness. In response to this need, this paper reports on work done on the application of lean concepts 
to the shipping process in the warehouse of a major hypermarket chain. The results show that time savings 
up to 16% might be achieved in the cycle time of the shipping process, and the labor cost can be reduced 
by 25%. The findings of this study are valuable to practitioners who are interested in implementing lean 
warehousing.

1. Introduction
Lean manufacturing came into existence from a research program that scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology began in the 1980s.  However, the idea and principles for lean manufacturing were derived from the 
Toyota Production System (TPS) that started in the early 1940s, which Toyota Motor Company developed to produce 
the best quality cars at the lowest cost and with the shortest lead time. This was done through eliminating waste on 
the basis of two pillars, Just-In-Time and Jidoka (Bhamu and Sangwan 2014). Just-In-Time (JIT) is a quantity control 
technique of providing the right quantity at the right time at the right location. Jidoka is the second pillar, which means 
 “humanized automation,” is a sequence of cultural and technical matters concerning the use of equipment and 
manpower together; it involves utilizing individuals for specific tasks they can perform and allowing devices to self-
regulate the quality. Jidoka technically uses approaches, such as Poka-yoke (a technique for fool-proofing a 
procedure), Andonis (Lights which are visual displays to indicate the status of the procedure specifically; the 
abnormalities in the procedure) and 100% examination by machines. Lean thinking is grounded on five principles; 
value, value streams, flow, pull, and perfection: 
1.
Identify the value – Identify and specify the process (products/services) from the client’s perspective to add value
and ensure full client satisfaction. Value can be identified with tools like value management, simulation, and
function deployment.
2.
Map the value stream – Investigate the essential steps necessary to make a product/service by excluding the non-
value steps and create a value stream. A mapping value stream will help knowing how the value for the customers
is created through the steps.
3.
Create the flow of the processes – Create efficient steps, which are defined as the value stream. Exclude steps,
such as batch-and-queue, which possibly cause delay, backflow, or damage, from the workflow.
4.
Establish pull – Supply and produce only upon customers’ demand to minimize the waste of resources.

Abstract 
Warehousing plays an important role in the logistics sector in order to facilitate economic and business 
benefits for both parties including customer and the service provider. 3PL (third-party logistics) service 
providers are specialized in providing end-to-end logistics solutions including warehousing, transportation 
and distribution to their multi-stakeholders in various sectors (Apparel, FMCG). Lean knowledge 
transferring process from 3PLs to their apparel based multi-stakeholders is a kind of challenging process 
for both parties due to several factors. The way of transferring and receiving knowledge is directly affected 
by the success of any business. In this research, a framework is developed on the perspective of 3PLs by 
examining the factors that affect effective knowledge transferring on lean practices for their clients. Based 
on these, the model which consists of relevant factors named extent of lean practices, capabilities of the 
source and the recipient and the relationship between them are providing a clear roadmap to the service 
provider and their stakeholders. The proposed model will help the 3PL service provider to identify critical 
success factors for sharing the knowledge of lean practices effectively. Also, it facilitates the successful 
collaboration with the multi-stakeholders and finally it helps to improve the overall warehouse operational 
performance.

1.Introduction
Warehousing is one of the most important parts in a supply chain which bridges the production flow of a product until 
the delivery to its end-users. Warehouse operations are a fundamental part of any business and it can provide many 
advantages through effective warehouse management. Optimizing warehouse resources, reducing cost and material 
handling, improving warehouse efficiency are some of them. 3PLs (third-party service providers) provide a large 
variety of services to their clients including warehousing, transportation, inventory management, value-added services, 
consulting, shipping, distribution and so on. Hence, 3PLs act a major role in the industry to access win-win situation 
to them as well as their clients. The way of handling warehousing processes is varying according to the types of goods 
in the warehouse. As an example, methods that are used to the apparel sector products have different characteristics 
when compared to the FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods). By identifying those similarities and differences, a 
business can improve its operational efficiency. 
However, many companies have to bear high warehousing costs due to many inefficiencies of the processes. Existence 
of many non-value-added activities is the major reason for those inefficiencies. Therefore, the requirement of lean 
practices arises to eliminate those non-value-added activities in order to gain a competitive advantage to the business. 
Lean is about creating the most value to the customers while minimizing resources, time, energy and effort. It has a 
set of tools and techniques to improve the processes. The ultimate goal of implementing lean in 3PL companies is to 
provide perfect value to their clients through managing their processes effectively.  
Successful lean implementation is basically dependent on the concept of  “waste,” which refers to the non-value adding 
activities in a particular system. Waste can be defined as anything other than the minimum activities and materials

5.Conclusion 
The purpose of this study is to develop a model to transfer knowledge on lean practices effectively from 3PL service 
providers to multi-stakeholders in the apparel sector. Hence, the model is providing a roadmap to both parties to 
identify the factors which are affecting for effective transfer. Sharing knowledge, experiences, values is one of the 
best practices to gain a competitive advantage in the industry. It is a vital need to find out existing capabilities and 
pitfalls in the organization in order to improve service efficiency. Although there are many knowledge-sharing models 
available in various contexts, still there is a lack of developing an appropriate model to transfer lean knowledge in 
warehousing field. 
 
Different authors have focused on critical success factors which are affecting knowledge sharing and developed 
conceptual frameworks to share explicit and tacit knowledge within the organization. The proposed model goes 
beyond it to scrutinize the factors involved in sharing knowledge with external multi-stakeholders of the company. 
Hence the model is very important for both parties to improve their service level. The proposed model of the study is 
based on the assumptions that the selected 3PL service providers are using lean practices for their operations and have 
enough capability to share knowledge with the recipient. In addition to that, selection of knowledge recipient 
companies of respective 3PL provider is based on their revenue generation and that company has already implemented 
lean practices into their operations. The model is recommended to validate through multiple case studies and expert 
reviews. The study is focused on apparel based multi-stakeholder 3PLs and developing a model for entire stakeholders 
representing a variety of industry verticals can be studied as future research.

Abstract 
To survive in the market and acquire a competitive edge, industries need to invest in advanced 
technology. However, most companies fail due to poor integration of technology in their supply 
chain. The concept of Procurement 4.0 has emerged to optimize supply chain performance 
developing new value propositions and meeting new business needs. It is the integration of Industry 
4.0 concepts in procurement. Although Industry 4.0 concepts have been studied in different 
industrial contexts, a limited number of researches have been conducted on the use of emerging 
technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Big data and 
Cognitive analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies, etc. in relation procurement 
while more existing researchers have focused web-based applications which facilitates real-time 
communication across supply chains. Therefore, the applicability of industry 4.0 technologies in 
procurement should be investigated. In this research, a literature survey involving systematic 
identification and review of 45 articles published in different sources between 2000 and 2019 was 
carried out to identify different emerging technologies that can be used across the procurement 
process. Further, the results include the applications of these technologies in the different areas of 
procurement that supports procurement optimization.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management (SCM) has become a key driver of competitiveness in the textile and apparel industry 
and purchasing and procurement management are playing a crucial role in SCM. Procurement involves the 
process of selecting vendors, establishing payment terms, strategic vetting, selection, the negotiation of contracts 
and actual purchasing of goods. Procurement is concerned with acquiring (procuring) all of the goods, services, 
and work that is vital to an organization. (Burt et al. 2003). 
The role of procurement extends far beyond the belief that procurement’s primary function is to obtain goods 
and services in response to internal needs. A world-class procurement process aims to optimize the whole 
process to create significant business value. Efficient procurement is crucial since the demand for and price of a 
product is largely time dependent. Hence the procurement optimization is a must. The leading manufacturers in 
different industries have already optimized their procurement process to a certain extent with the emerging 
technologies while small players are not. However, procurement can be further optimized for leading 
manufacturers too with new concepts from Industry 4.0. 
Industry 4.0 is the 4th industrial revolution which can be defined as a current trend of automation and data 
exchange in manufacturing technologies. The key driver of Industry 4.0 is Digitization. It includes technologies

Model to Assess Risk Perception and Behaviour of 
Individuals

Abstract 
Risk behaviour is the controlled conduct of people in contexts with uncertainty, where there is a possibility of the 
outcome received deviating from the outcome expected. The goal of this study is to assess how the confidence of 
individuals dominate individual risk behaviour. The study was carried out through a systematic review of literature, 
with which the gap of not using individual’s confidence to interpret their risk behaviour was discovered. Hence, this 
study focuses on interpreting the individual risk behaviour through a combination of the theory of perceived self-
efficacy and the reconceptualized model of risk behaviour. Perceived self-efficacy is a cognitive psychological concept 
where people’s confidence on their own personal abilities affect their actions taken to reach designated goals. The 
reconceptualized model suggests that an individual’s risk behaviour is dominated by two major characteristics; risk 
propensity and risk perception. The risk behaviour model has been adjusted by removing the organizational-related 
factors from it. The model has been validated through expert opinion.

1. Background and Objectives
Every decision taken by any human being bears a certain proportion of risk. The ambiguous nature of the future events 
makes it harder to settle on a single decision. Hence, they tend to prepare for the probable consequences that might 
arise from the decisions taken. According to Plato (427-347BC), “The problem with the future is that more things 
might happen, than will happen. With an infinite number of possibilities ahead, it is hardly surprising that the task of 
selecting the one which will eventually materialize is problematic. As the time horizon of prediction extends further 
into the future, the number of degrees of freedom increases exponentially, further complicating the ability to predict.” 
Even within the same context, there is a high chance of the decisions taken by two people differentiating from one 
another. The main reason behind this can be revealed as the diverse nature of individual conduct. Individual behaviour 
can broadly be identified as the method a person conducts oneself or reacts to a particular situation. One’s behaviour 
affects the perceptions he bears, the interactions he engages, as well as the decisions he make. An individual’s 
behaviour is governed by two main characteristics; Inherited and Learned (Morrow 2008). 
Inherited characteristics are genetic in nature and are generally the attributes a person has acquired since birth. This 
includes features such as age, gender, intelligence and intellectual ability. These attributes are usually identified as 
difficult to change or modify. When explaining the relationship between age and the behaviour of people, 
psychologically, younger people are expected to be more energetic, enthusiastic, ambitious and risk taking. Whereas, 
elderly people are supposed to be conventional, hidebound and less adaptable. Intellectual ability is the skill required 
to think critically, see connections between disciplines and problem solve in new or changing situations. This certainly 
affects the behaviour of people as the decisions a person makes depends on his capacity of thinking and analyzing the 
situation. Learned characteristics are the relatively permanent behaviours a person has acquired through his 
experience. This concerns attributes such as personality, perception, attitude and values. Personality refers to the

6. Applications  
 
The study of human factors is a branch in Industrial Engineering, where principles of human physiology and 
psychology are used in when designing and engineering processes and systems. Humans differ from one another 
according to their personality, cognitive and physical abilities and experience. As a result, the extent they excel in 
performing a task vary accordingly. Especially, in job designing, it is important to understand the limitations, 
capabilities and preferences of the employees so that the desired outcome is achieved. Although risk assessment of a 
job or a process is already being done, not many industries assess the risk behaviour of the individual employees, 
which is also an equally important factor in enhancing job performance. Some jobs require risk averse employees 
where they will do as per the status quo without a need of changing the existing methods. Whereas some jobs will 
require employees who are more ambitious and risk seeking, in order to utilize the opportunities received for the 
organization. Therefore, understanding and accurately assessing risk behavior, is an important and a timely need. 
 
Using the developed model as base, the risk appetite of the individual workers can be assessed and matched with the 
requirements of the job, so that the best match is selected and assigned for that particular task. Although talent analysis 
is done in certain organizations at the recruitment process, risk behaviour analysis has not been given much 
importance. Hence this study will be beneficial in matching the recruit with the potential job and thereby achieving 
operational excellence. 
7. Conclusion 
 
The risk behaviour of individuals depends on both psychological factors and environmental factors. This study focused 
on developing a model to identify the determinants of the risk perception and risk behaviour of individuals. A gap was 
identified through a systematic review of literature as the existing reconceptualized model of risk behaviour does not 
explain how the self-confidence of a person affects the risk behaviour of an individual. From the psychological 
behavioural models studied, the Theory of Self Efficacy was selected as the most suitable model to determine the 
confidence of an individual. An integrated model of self-efficacy and reconceptualized model of risk behaviour was 
developed in order to explain the individual risk perception and behaviour better. The model was empirically and 
statistically validated and has the potential of being tested in different contexts in the future as further improvements.

1. Introduction
There are many definitions of what an entrepreneur is. The Royal Academic of Language defines it as: “who initiates 
or assumes difficult or risky actions”, other authors such as Poncio (2010) mention that the entrepreneur is the one 
who addresses the adventure of a business, he organizes it, seeks capital to finance it and assumes all or the greatest 
risk action, a person who enjoys entrepreneurship, while an entrepreneur enjoys generating growth. A definition by 
(Giurfa Johnson, 2012) indicates that the origin of that word dates back to the 18th century, when Cantillon used the 
French word entrepreneur (Spanish translation: pioneer) in the year 1755 in the text ""Essai Sur la Nature du Commerce 
en Général"" , to refer to those ""who were able to take the risk and the responsibility of launching and concluding a 
project"" 
The present project is a descriptive study, which seeks to develop an image or faithful representation of the 
phenomenon studied from its characteristics, but at no time is it intended to establish the relationship between the 
characteristics of the object of study (Yuni & Urbano, 2013). Identifying and defining an entrepreneur are considered 
of vital importance today, where young people should no longer profile themselves as employees but as business 
leaders, an entrepreneur is a maker, someone with a strong impulse to do things, which is also optimistic but not 
deluded and also has to have self-confidence. ""In a train of human beings, the entrepreneur is the locomotive"" 
(Universidad de la Punta, 2017). The role of the entrepreneur is different from that of a victim of the circumstances 
and problems of a country, parallel to the existing limitations, the entrepreneur can also possess important resources 
not only economic that allow it to be a case of success (Elo, 2016). 
Some authors consider that everything is done, that nothing is innate, that everything can be learned; others consider 
it impossible to modify some innate characteristics of people. This current of opinion that has the largest number of 
adherents argues that being an entrepreneur is not a matter of knowledge but of attitude and character. (Poncio, 2010).

3. Conclusions 
 
Through the investigation, the objective of knowing the entrepreneurial profile was achieved, the answers being as 
real as possible since a transparent and autonomous process was carried out in the application of the test by the 
students. 
 
In the Teodoro Gómez de la Torre Educational Unit it was obtained as a result that the predominant profile in students 
is concrete-conventional, so it can be said that students are more focused in areas related to Audit-Comptroller, 
calculations, consultancies, security. The second predominant profile is Social-affective, which is focused on health 
and aesthetics, restaurants, bookstores, etc. Among the profiles with less predominance are those of investigative-
creator and realistic-managerial. 
 
In the University College the predominant profiles are: Realizer-Entrepreneur and Researcher-Creator, that is, with 
the first one they are linked to the world of innovation, ideas, products, services or processes and with the second they 
are directed to create schools of languages, businesses linked to technology and games, as well as companies oriented 
to the transfer of knowledge. 
 
The importance of knowing the profile of the entrepreneur is necessary to promote projects or entrepreneurial ideas, 
which will arise from the development of the profile and in the development of their business plans. 
 
Studies of this nature improve the student's attitude towards entrepreneurship, since they indirectly analyze their life 
project and motivate themselves to develop a business idea early. 
Carry out this research continuously, applying techniques and instruments that awaken the entrepreneurial spirit, so 
as to facilitate learning techniques and to facilitate the development of business plans; It is recommended that this be 
initiated from the first weeks of having started the school year since the results will allow a remarkable advance in the 
business plan. 
 
It is important to awaken the entrepreneurial spirit of the students using different techniques and tools so that they 
show interest in the entrepreneurial culture and become more involved in economic and social development through 
the implementation of their creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.

Abstract 
Blood Supply Chain Management is highly critical as ensuring the availability of the right blood type at the 
right demand point, in the right quantity, at the right time is a matter of life and death. The overall objective 
of this study is to explore the optimization approaches in inventory management of blood supply chains. A 
review of literature has been carried out to investigate different optimization approaches and management 
concepts towards blood inventory optimization while maximizing the service levels and minimizing discard 
rates. In the process of reviewing literature, initially 43 studies published between 2000 and 2019 were 
analysed through the keywords search and 19 papers were selected which were directly related to the area 
of study. A framework was developed by summarizing optimization techniques used; factors and 
complexities affecting blood inventory performance were identified and analysed. This paper includes state 
of the knowledge, potential research areas, and gaps that are available in this arena as a guidance for future 
researchers in this field. As further research, it is suggested to explore the behaviour of inventory 
management practices of multi-product, multi-echelon and perishable supply chains with highly uncertain 
demand and supply.

1. Introduction
Collection, production, inventory, and distribution are the main stages of blood supply chain management. The 
products in blood supply chain management are whole blood, red blood cells, blood platelets, blood plasma, and frozen 
blood. Shelf lives of these products range from five days (platelets) to one year (Frozen Plasma). The main challenges 
in the Inventory Management of blood supply chains are due to the complexities brought by risk, the uncertainty of 
supply and demand, blood nature as a perishable commodity, demand uniqueness. Naturally, problems in Blood 
Inventory Management are complex and it is not an easy task to find solutions for those problems. Unlike other supply 
chains, in Blood Supply Chain Management, having the right product, at the right place, in the right quantity, at the 
right time is a matter of life and death. 
Shortages of blood products lead to high costs for society and they can cause an increase in mortality rates. Discard 
of blood cannot be accepted since blood donors are a scarce asset of society and donors must have recovery time 
between two donations, depending on the type of donation. In addition, only a small percentage (5%) of the eligible 
donor population donate blood (Kuruppu 2010). In the study carried out by  Williamson and Devine in 2013 depict 
that during the next 5–10 years, blood availability in developed countries will need to increase again in order to meet 
the demands of the ageing population. These indicate how valuable blood is and how carefully to handle this “The 
Gift of Life” from the donors. Besides, blood discard rate will directly influence the attitude of people towards the 
blood system of the country and the first-time donor return rate (Kuruppu 2010). However, matching the supply and

banks will help to minimize the shortages and wastages. Continuous awareness and training should be given to the 
staff and inventory layout should be optimized for facilitating FIFO while increasing the transparency.

Abstract 
Develop a supply chain infrastructure is one of the most challenges faced by governments, trying to 
achieve an efficient logistic network. As an option to improve the congestion in seaports and reduction in 
transportation cost, dry ports have a key role to play in advancing port-hinterland connectivity. While 
many researches have been developed in Asian and European countries, studies about dry port are still in 
the early stage in Latin America. However, there are many issues to be discussed in these areas, with poor 
railways infrastructures, covered by bureaucratic customs processes in countries with economic and 
political instability, as happen in Brazil. To overcome the literature gap, this article presents a preliminary 
study about dry ports in northeast of Brazil, classifying the four logistic structures in that region and 
exploring, by two case studies, the main strategic issues related to Brazilian dry ports. This study provides 
a useful insight to policymakers, as well for dry port managers, shippers and costumers that use this 
logistic infrastructure as an alternative to become more competitive as well is a beginning for new 
research developments in this area.

1. Introduction
The massification of maritime transportation and the scale increases in vessel size are putting a huge pressure on 
seaports and their corresponding hinterland transport networks (Nguyen and Notteboom, 2018). With the growth of 
the world trade and containerized cargo transport, dry ports have played an important role in extending their services 
and providing continuous integration with the hinterland, helping to bring together all the stakeholders involved in 
the supply chain process (Haralambides and Gujar, 2012). However, most research was carried out in European and 
Asian countries that have a large container handling and developed railway infrastructure. In this way, a broad

Abstract 
The evaluation of corporate value is extremely important in business decision-making. This study 
innovatively uses the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm to train a 
nonlinear tree ensemble model to investigate the important influence factors of corporate value from three 
aspects of environment, economy, and corporate governance (CG) including energy policies. The nonlinear 
XGboost models are compared with linear panel regression models in terms of their findings. The indicators 
of corporate value, environment, and economy are Tobin's Q, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and 
capital structure (debt ratio), respectively. The annual panel data for 383 Taiwanese traditional industries 
from 2014 to 2017 comes from Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) database. For Tobin's Q fitted model, the 
trained tree ensemble model with 0.43% historical MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is much better 
than the linear panel regression model with 17.54% MAPE. The ranking of the important influence factors 
of Tobin’s Q is the shareholding ratio of directors and supervisors, CSR (environment), asset turnover rate 
and debt ratio (economy). We also trained a tree ensemble forecasting model for Tobin’s Q, the one-step-
ahead out-of-sample MAPE is 13.48%. The proposed good forecast model can be used for scenario analysis 
to enhance Tobin’s Q for a single company. On the whole, strengthening the ownership structure and 
optimizing economic-energy-environment interaction policies can effectively enhance the corporate value 
of traditional industries.

Abstract 
It can be argued that the textiles and clothing industry does not neatly fit into either a lean or agile paradigm, 
instead, it is a combination of the two, driven by low margins and volatility of demand. A number of authors 
have indicated that these two concepts alone seem incomplete so that now the global approach is towards 
a hybrid supply chain model combining both lean and agile concepts. Apparel Industry possesses the twain 
lean and agile features independently and these concepts have been established to a greater extent. As cases 
of pure leanness and agility can seldom be found in real-world problems, considering both strategies can 
be beneficial. Analyzing the characteristics, trends, and relationships within an organization’s internal and 
external environment as well as considering the impact of the new strategy on overall supply chain 
performance is much important when developing a supply chain model. This paper focuses on developing 
a framework to integrate Lean and Agile Concepts for improving supply chain performance in fashion 
garment manufacturing. A structured literature review is carried out in stages: identifying the relevant 
literature, structuring the review and developing a model to guide future research.

1. Introduction
Sri Lankan apparel industry generates 3.2- 4.9 million USD annual business value by catering to the major global 
markets such as the US, UK, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, etc. Apparel contribution towards total 
merchandise exports marks 43.91% by 2019 (Sri Lanka Exports Development Board, 2019). Apart from competing 
in the apparel mass market, the Sri Lankan apparel sector has now identified products with high prices such as fashion 
garments, sportswear, and trendy wear as high potential products possibly be creating a higher value in near future by 
catering to the niche market. 
According to (Agrawal et al. 2018), a key feature of the present-day business is the idea that it is Supply Chains (SC) 
that compete, not companies and the success or failure of SCs is ultimately determined in the marketplace by the end 
consumer. In that, it is much more important how an organization adjusting its micro-environment and SC practices 
according to its dynamic macro-economic environment in order to improve SC performance and to achieve a better 
competitive advantage. Hence, the understanding of market place changes and customer satisfaction requirements is 
the key to implement successful SC strategies. 
Textile and apparel is a major sector for both the industrialized and the lesser developed economies, contributing both 
to wealth generation and employment (Bruce et al. 2004). For the past few years, Apparel Industry has shown a 
significant interest in the idea of ‘‘lean manufacturing’’, and the wider concepts of the ‘‘lean enterprises’’. The focus

1. INTRODUCTION
From the history it is evident that the technological advancements has prevailed a prominent factor in expanding 
modern efficiency, which was exhibited by the past three Industrial Revolutions, i.e., mechanization (fueled by 
steam engines during the 1800s), large scale manufacturing (controlled by power and the assembly line in the 
mid1900s), and computerization (fueled by cyber systems in the late 1900s) (Kagermann et al. 2013). In recent 
years, computer and internet integration innovation—specifically, the information and communication technology 
advances—is experiencing fast improvement, which has led to the rise of various novel technologies, for example, 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, and Big Data Analytics. With the 
implementation of these new advances empowers the production of a smart and connected products and services, in 
which ""things"" are invested with a specific level of knowledge, and also, being progressively associated with one 
another. This technological transformation has given rise to the concept of fourth generation Industrial Revolution- 
Industry 4.0, which composed of human and computer integrated system. In an Internet of Things (IoT) term, the 
logistics challenges may require something like high requirement for transparency (supply chain visibility); integrity

Above matrix is obtained by plotting each risk probability with its impact probability based on the collected data. 
Here darker region denoted the critical and major risks, and lighter region denotes the less risk. From the above 
figure following major risks keywords are highlighted: 
1. Security Privacy and Trust 
2. High Investment and setup cost 
3. Lack of technical skill and standardization 
4. Lack of infrastructure 
5. Digital transformation from the legacy system and resistance to change 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
Today Industry 4.0 represents setting control on the new way of technological developments and innovations in the 
automobile domain rather than focusing only on increasing the efficiency to develop the business model. Hence, 
automobile logistics requires intricate new skills, both at the individual level and within the organization as a whole, 
to become Smarter. 
The digital integration and transformation in logistics will create a single database, making logistics smarter, more 
transparent, and more efficient at every stage, from customer need to delivery. Production, procurement, purchasing, 
and sales & marketing functions are becoming more closely aligned as digitization advances.

Abstract 
 
Sales of electronic devices have been increasing in recent years resulting in increased e-waste in Bangladesh. Although 
Bangladesh is a developing country, it has no infrastructure to handle e-waste properly. At present, there exists no 
formal e-waste dismantling facility for environmentally sound management of e-waste. Therefore, the estimation of 
e-waste generation in Bangladesh is crucial to policymakers. Considering the limited available data, this study 
describes the current and future estimation of e-waste generated from cellphones and PC in Chattogram City, 
Bangladesh. Modified Consumption and Use methods were applied to estimate the e-waste volume in Chattogram 
City in the research work. In 2019, the calculated amount of e-waste generated from cellphones in Chattogram City 
was approximately 401.98 tons. And from PC the amount was approximately 3924.98 tons by applying Modified 
Method 1. Using Linear Trend Forecasting, it is predicted that the amount of e-waste generated from cellphones will 
reach approximately 739.18 tons and e-waste generated from PC will reach approximately 5851.80 tons by 2025.  This 
study also discusses the present scenario of e-waste management in Chattogram city, Bangladesh. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
 
The production and consumption of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) have been ascending significantly in 
the last two decades. This augmentation is due to significant advances in the electronics and ICT (Information and 
Communication Technology) industries, short product life spans, economic development and changes in consumption 
patterns and consumers’ lifestyles (Terazono et al., 2006). Accordingly, the disposal rate has been rising, more 
disposable units are being tossed away, and the quantity of e-waste has been increasing considerably. Electronic waste, 
or e-waste, is a generalized term used to describe old, end-of-life, or discarded electronic appliances containing 
electrically powered components. Shagun et al. (2013) defined e-waste as discarded computers, office electronic 
equipment, entertainment device electronics, mobile phones, television sets, and refrigerators. This definition includes 
used electronic devices that are meant to be reused, resold, recycled, or disposed of. Kottapalle et al. (2015) defined 
e-waste as electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part or rejects from their manufacturing and repair process, 
which are intended to be discarded. Products that are working or repairable but are dumped or disposed of or discarded 
by the owner rather than recycled can be termed as e-waste.  Increasing e-waste volume pose detrimental consequences 
to the environment and public health because of inadequate recycling and disposal techniques (Ikhlayel, 2018). As 
technology grows quickly and electronics reach the end of their life span faster, there is an urgent need for end-of-life 
management options (also known as e-waste management). The increasing amount of e-waste and inappropriate 
management approaches are the major concern of most developing countries. Due to population growth and waste 
generation along with inappropriate waste management practices, Bangladesh is one of the most affected countries. 
To effectively manage e-waste, the amount of e-waste generation must first be estimated. This study aims at estimating 
the volume of e-waste in Chattogram city, Bangladesh. In this study, only personal computers and cellphones are 
considered as e-waste, because these e-products contribute a major share of the e-waste volume.

According to Riyad et al. (2014), the main source of e-waste in Chattogram is the ship breakage industry. Almost 95% 
of the e-waste generated in Chattogram is from this particular sector. Thus, it can be commented that, without this 
particular ship breakage industry, Chattogram would have been less burdened with toxic e-waste problem. The authors 
also mentioned that there are 200-250 purchasing agents of these types of products who bring PC parts as wastage to 
the shop owners. After purchasing a waste product, they first test the product’s functionality. If the product is 
functioning then they sell it to a customer who looks for second-hand parts and products. Otherwise, they break the 
products into pieces to separate iron, lead, copper, silver, plastic, etc. and sell these to buyers of these things. They 
disassemble these products without any protection which can be injurious to their health and the surrounding 
environment. The recycling flow of the informal sector in Chattogram city is shown in Figure 4.

7. Conclusion  
 
This paper has provided some qualitative and quantitative information about e-waste in Chattogram city. As shown in 
the findings, the amount of e-waste is increasing in Chattogram city. In 2019, the calculated amount of e-waste 
generated from Cellphone in Chattogram city was approximately 401.978 tons. And from PC the amount was 
approximately 3924.979 tons by applying Modified Method 1. The amount found by applying Modified Method 2 
was nearly similar to that of Modified Method 1. Due to the high generation of e-waste and the lack of proper managing 
systems, it is predicted that such waste would have some adverse effects on the health of citizens and the environment 
as well. Therefore, it is necessary to provide necessary infrastructures for separation, collection, recycling, and 
management of such waste. Before establishing any proper e-waste recovery and recycling system a complete 
empirical study is necessary. This study will prepare the platform for additional study and exploration of e-waste 
recycling. While this study focused only on cellphone and personal computers, other electronic equipment can also be 
taken into consideration using a similar methodology. This study estimated the e-waste volume in Chattogram city. 
For estimating the volume of e-waste in other major cities, the adoption of this methodology will constitute an effective 
approach.

Abstract 
This research is socio-emotional study of individuals with different gender, age, driving experience and 
academic status. By the help of this research, driving behavior of individuals is studied which can be helpful 
for traffic police to overcome violations on roads due to aggressive driving. This study was conducted to 
reveal aggressive driving behavior of students and teachers at MUET, Jamshoro, Pakistan. Questionnaire 
of Dr. Larson was used as research instrument. 200 questionnaires were distributed among respondents; 
160 samples were collected and 16 were rejected. 16 hypothesis were developed in this study. Data was 
analyzed in (SPSS) version 22. Reliability of the questionnaire was checked by cronbach alpha test 
(alpha=0.875). Firstly, descriptive statistics for all questions was calculated; after the normality test, 
independent sample T-test and ANOVA tests were used for hypothesis testing. Furthermore, relationship 
among driving, anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing were found by the help of Pearson 
correlation. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in driving anger, driving impatience, 
competing and punishing of drivers belonging to different demographics i.e. gender, age, driving 
experience, students and teachers. Furthermore, significant positive association was found among the 
driving anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing of drivers.

1. Introduction
Aggressive driving has become a common occurrence to an increasing extent (Mizell, 1997). Driving aggressiveness 
as defined by Tasca “A driving behavior is aggressive, if it is deliberate, likely to increase the risk of collision and is 
motivated by impatience, annoyance, hostility, and/or an attempt to save time” (Gilbert and Orlans, 2011) or ""ill 
intention or disregard to safety"" (AAA Foundation for Traffic Safey, 2009). It is used as a synonym of ‘road rage’ 
(Paleti et al., 2010). It may involve driver anger, intend to have an advantage over other drivers, and intentional 
violations and exceeding from the normal traffic speed (Goodwin et al., 2013). The behavior which can cause any 
mental or physical injury (Grey et al., 1989). Driver aggressiveness is the bigger problem than the traffic jam as 
observed by most of the people. Aggression as defined by Daula, C.S. the behavior due to which people on the road 
may be physically or emotionally harmed (Dula and Geller, 2003). Frustration always gives out aggression (Lajunen 
and Parker, 2001;Abou-Zeid et al., 2011). It is not assumed always but it rather suggests and facilitate the aggressive 
driving behavior (Berkowitz, 1989). Research indicated that the personality differences in individuals significantly 
play a remarkable role in proneness towards aggressive driving (AAA Foundation for Traffic Safey, 2009). It was 
concluded that expressions of aggression of drivers can be due to anger i.e. speeding tailgating which have been 
indicated to impact the road safety negatively (SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research, 2012). The results of 
aggressive driving can be property damage, injury and mortality (Dula and Geller, 2003). 
During the past few years, aggressive and angry driving have caught the notable attention of the public as well as the 
government (Jerry L. Deffenbacher et al., 2002). Aggressiveness always originates from frustration (Abou-Zeid et al., 
2350","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Dubai, UAE, March 10-12, 2020

dairies were investigated, which showed 293 nearly happened accidents and 383 occasions of experiencing anger: 
mostly anger was reported when there was the traffic congestion, thus it can be concluded that there is the link between 
number of nearly accidents and the events of anger that were experienced by the drivers (Underwood et al., 1999). 
These serious issues indicate that there is a strong need for driving psychology and education that can help reverse 
this trend and change people’s driving habits. Drivers need to be taught the moral dimension of driving, which 
indicates the character we have as a driver: there is the need of research in order to teach drivers to assess their own 
driving personality as supportive or hostile, rational or impatient, calm or frustrated, error-free or making mistakes, 
and cooperative or opportunistic: there is also the need for motorists to acknowledge that driving is a social activity 
that requires coordinated interactions (James, 2017). 
6. Conclusion and Suggestions 
In this research, aggressive driving behavior was investigated by focusing on the demographics of the respondents. 
On the same time, the relationship among various constructs i.e. driving anger, driving impatience competing and 
punishing was found. Results of hypothesis testing (T-test and ANOVA) revealed that there was no significant 
difference in the driving anger, impatience, competing and punishing behavior of the drivers across both genders: 
similarly, no difference was found in the aggressive driving behavior among the drivers of various age groups: 
whereas, the significant difference was found in the punishing behavior of driving across the various groups of driving 
experience; which demonstrates that drivers (having different driving experience) punish the other drivers with no-
equal magnitude aggressive driving: moreover there was no significant difference found in the driving anger, 
impatience and competing among the drivers across different driving experience. Furthermore, there was no 
significant difference between the aggressive driving behavior (i.e. driving anger, impatience, competing and 
punishing) of teachers and students of Mehran UET, Jamshoro. The results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated 
that the driving anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing were in significant positive relationship with one 
another: which clearly indicates that on increasing on factor will cause the certain increase in the various factors. 
7. Future Work 
In this research, drivers were taken the questionnaire samples at offices and canteens but for more precise results, it is 
suggested that the drivers should be taken the questionnaire samples suddenly after the drive. In this way, the 
researcher can have the exact response from the side of respondents.

Abstract 
Delayed healthcare service delivery is major highlighted problem in healthcare centers and is caused due 
to poor design of queuing system or its mismanagement. This study was conducted to suggest the 
optimum number of receptionists and doctors at the study areas in order to optimize the performance of 
existing queuing systems at the out-patient departments (OPDs). The most congested OPD i.e. medical 
OPD was selected for the study at the case hospital 1 and then same OPD was selected in another public 
sector hospital (case hospital 2). Both hospitals were the tertiary care hospitals of the different districts of 
Sindh Pakistan. Data was collected for two weeks: data collection parameters were; arrival rate, service 
rate of patients, number of servers, salaries of the servers and associated waiting cost of patients. Arrival 
and service distribution of the patients were verified as per assumptions of the multi-server queuing 
model (M/M/c) by using input analyzer of Rockwell Arena 14.5. Performance measures of the queuing 
system were calculated by using TORA optimization software. For cost calculation and graph plots MS 
excel was used. According to the results, one receptionist and doctor was suggested to be increased at 
both of the OPDs for the minimization of congestion of patients and their waiting times. In this way, they 
will have to wait for less time as the compared to the existing scenario; their waiting cost would certainly 
be decreased which will be the good point on the side of healthcare providers.

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE 
Pakistani public healthcare system is largely dispersed and its access is given to the citizens along with the well 
trained doctors and staff. Inconsistencies in healthcare system are due to the unavailability of the doctors and 
medicine and the poor managerial constraints are beyond these crises (Callen et al., 2013). Research was conducted 
to reveal the problem which are faced by the patients when they need to visit public hospitals. Frustrated response of 
staff was reported by 41.8% of the patients, 72.7% patients had the opinion that poor patients were not treated well 
the hospital, on the same time, doctors` preference to their relatives and known patients was also reported by 96.4% 
(Ahmad et al., 2013). I was suggested in one of the research that the healthcare should be focused in the context of 
infrastructure, medical equipment and check and balance so that problems can be overcome (Naz et al., 2012). 
Moreover, there are number of problems which are usually faced by the patients but delay is one of the highlighted 
issue; delay is one of the major threat which is observed to be increasing day by day (Obulor & B.O, 2016). Delay is 
not the new problem in hospitals, awaiting patients can be found in laboratories of the hospitals, emergencies, 
surgical departments etc. (Green, 2006). Overcrowding of patients at the hospitals is the highlighted issue. Recently, 
it has been the teething concern for healthcare providers (Ikwunne & Onyesolu, 2016). Practically, queuing theory is 
an application for simplification of overcrowding problems (Olorunsola et al., 2014): This theory was formulated by 
Danish telephone engineer Agner Krarup Erlang in 1913 (Bastani, 2009)(Kissani & Rifai, 2015). In 20th century, He 
was only scientist who treated the queuing problem in the context of telephone exchange (Mwangi & Ombuni, 
2015). Since, queuing theory is developed for simplifying the problems of waiting lines therefore, it is called as 
theory of waiting lines/overcrowding (Adaora .D., 2013). The applications of theory are being applied in service

increment one receptionist and one doctor, queues of patients at both stages would be minimized and so the total 
waiting time of patients. Since they will have to wait for less time as the compared to the existing scenario; their 
waiting cost would certainly be decreased which will be the good point on the side of healthcare providers. 
7. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, the time of patients which was spent while coming to the hospital and the time taken by the patient at 
the pharmacy was not included due to the shortage of time. In the next study, these parameters would be considered 
in order to produce more accurate results. This work can be extended by conducting the modelling and simulation of 
queuing systems of both the OPDs.

Abstract 
Late arrivals and no show are major concern in South African workplace. The bad working environment 
and attitude of management may result in dissatisfied employees, which contributes toward most of the 
absenteeism. This study aims to investigate the impact of the management and workplace conditions on the 
level of satisfaction of the employees. A Johannesburg based non-profit organization which has been facing 
high staff turnover was selected as a case study. About 50 employees across several departments were 
selected using convenience sampling for semi-structured interviews and participant observations. The result 
showed that majority of participants reported on limited equipment and machinery available to perform 
daily tasks, for instance the whole organization was using only one printer to scan, print and copy 
documents. Furthermore, majority of participants were concerned that management does not provide 
sufficient resources and rewards to deserving employees.

1. Introduction
For any organization, work is a fundamental segment to accomplish the mission and vision through the use of 
competent workforce. Employees should meet the execution criteria set by the organization to guarantee the nature of 
their work. In order to accomplish this, employees require a workplace that enables them to work openly, either 
individually or in a group, without any problem. Satisfied and motivated employees are likely to continue working 
efficiently. 
A South African non-profit organization based in Johannesburg has been providing financial support to primary and 
secondary learners with an aim of educating underprivileged and disadvantaged children across the nation. Since 2000, 
this organization has changed over 800 lives, developed 420 young leaders with a 100% pass matric rate (Student 
Sponsorship Programme, 2014). The organization also runs mentorship programmes for students, offers parent 
workshops, and run bursary programmes outsourced by large funding agencies. The organization is a non-
governmental organization (NGO), which is being sponsored by national and international agencies, and has partnered 
with local and international schools.  
The working environment in the non-profit organization under study is more casual and flexible compared to the 
corporate workplace, and employees tend to have little focus or drive when conducting work responsibilities. The 
responsibilities mainly include field work to interact and engage with schools across the country, distribute and collect

Figure 4. Respondents’ view on role of management per department 
 
The participants also reported that they are not involved in the decision-making process, which contradicts the 
statement of Grogan (2005) who stated that employee should not be left to feel isolated in decision making relative to 
their job. It was also revealed that the management resolved the conflict unfairly, which is aligned with the Grogan 
(2005) who stated that unfair conduct is a wider concept than discrimination. Therefore, management should ensure 
that all employees are fairly treated irrespective of their position or power within the organization. 
 
Employee engagement and involvement was considered by all the participants as healthy and necessary to build 
working relationship in the workplace, which will eventually increase the performance and productivity of the 
organization.  
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations   
 
Limited resources and lack of management role contributed to job dissatisfaction within the workplace. The employees 
were observed to be facing difficulty with meeting the deadlines and getting frustration with limited and ineffective 
equipment as stated by 80% of the participants. The behavior of management plays a pivotal role to keep employees 
satisfied within the workplace. However, 90% of the participants reported that management does not promote 
employee engagement and interaction to keep employees motivated.   
 
Recommendations   
 
1. The non-profit organization should attract sponsors and generate funds to add enough and efficient equipment. 
This will help in eliminating delays and employees will be able to complete their jobs on time. 
2. The management must be well trained to handle diversity and ensure equality to resolve conflict and address 
problems fairly.  
3. The organization can implement performance appraisal system to assess employees, which will help to provide 
constructive feedback to struggling employees and reward better performing employees. 
4. The management can implement job rotation, enrichment and enlargement to promote employee engagement 
and involvement. This will enable employees to perform various jobs and assist each other, and give them a 
sense of greater responsibility.

Abstract 
The free market economy and the lifting of restriction of trade across national boundaries have spoilt the consumer 
with a choice where the manufacturers face intense competition to catch the attention of the discerning customer. 
Generation Z consumers have been identified as unique as they are the first generation of digital natives who are 
born with digital chromosomes in their DNA. To cater to their demands with a proper strategy it is important to 
investigate the determinant factors of these buyer's, characteristics and actions. Although there are models like 
Engel-Blackwell-Miniard model and traditional five-stage model which have been used previously to investigate 
purchasing behaviour, their ability to factor the unique characteristics of this market segment is questionable. 
The purpose of this paper is to develop an extended research model based on the theory of planned behaviour 
(TPB) incorporating the additional constructs of market mavenism, technology self-efficacy and social identity to 
capture the specific factors influencing the purchasing behaviour of Generation Z. The validated model can be 
utilized to assist in predicting potential consumer adoption behaviour and in designing favourable shopping 
environments that are compatible with these specific consumer traits.

1. Introduction
To create value for consumers and profits for organizations, marketers need to understand why consumers behave in certain 
ways to a variety of products and services offered. (Jisana,2014). A consumer is a person who buys products or services 
directly. Consumer purchasing behaviour is defined by Solomon et al., (2014) as a series of activities conducted or 
perceived by people before buying products or services. Brooks D., (2012) has analysed it using 3 basic steps. First, people 
perceive the situation, second, people use the power of reason to calculate whether taking one or another action will benefit 
their long-term interest and third people use the power of will to execute the decision.  
By analysing consumer purchasing behaviours, companies can better identify and select the target market and 
formulate effective marketing strategies. Companies can develop new products or improve current products to meet 
the individual needs of consumers (Michaud and Llerena, 2011). However, most often customers do not go through these 
logical processes every time they buy something (Solomon M. 2006). Meanwhile, various other factors are influencing the 
purchasing behaviour of consumer such as internal or psychological factors, social factors, cultural factors, economic factors 
and personal factors.  
Although there are many models which have been developed for the examination of specific consumer traits in product 
purchasing, surveys have concluded that the generation-wise variations in the consumer pool also generate variations in the 
behaviour. According to Lee (2009) age is an important factor in the new digital culture which is why there are 
differences in different categories of consumers, (i.e., Generation Y, Generation Z) and in their expectations as 
consumers. The fact that age or generation sensitive factors have not been included in the previous frameworks of customer 
behaviour represents a significant omission as the relationship between generations and their significant behaviour patterns 
are well documented.  
Tim S. (2014) summarizes those substantial variations in the generations as follows.

Abstract 
With the increase in the global population, natural disasters and climatic changes the agricultural supply 
chain faces lots of challenges due to fluctuations of both supply and demand sides. This is adding pressure 
on the agriculture supply chain demanding it to be more productive and efficient. Adapting to technology 
to improve the agriculture supply chain have been identified as one solution. As the rest of the world is 
moving towards digital transformation, agriculture supply chains should follow the suite in order to meet 
the current challenges they face. This article reviews the literature on technology and technology 
applications in the agriculture supply chain. This article has identified the technological applications that 
have been built with respect to agricultural processes. Among them, it has found that, IoT as the technology 
which was based on many technology applications developed within the past few years. Further, this 
highlights IoT, Big Data and Blockchain as true enablers for the transformation of the agriculture supply 
chain to a digital agriculture supply chain.

1. Introduction
The global population is expected to increase by 2.3 billion people from today’s levels, reaching 9.8 billion by 2050 
and at the global level agricultural production and consumption in 2050 are projected to be 60% higher than today 
(FAO 2018). With the increasing population in the world, the expected demand for agricultural products will become 
higher than ever before adding pressure on the agriculture supply chain. Adding to this, climatic changes, natural 
disasters and food wastages due to mismatch between demand and supply are also challenging the agriculture supply 
chain. 
FAO (2017) describes how the demand will undergo structural changes. It states that population growth, urbanization 
and percapita increases in income as the factors which owe to the structural changes in demand which will result in 
the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends become increasingly stressed. Further, it states that climate 
changes affect food availability and has adverse impacts on crop yields, fish stocks and animal health. Manhindarathne 
and Min (2018) state that recent food crises and growing concerns about global climate change have placed agriculture 
on top of the international agenda. Thus, they mention that twenty-first-century agriculture is being challenged like 
never before.  
These problems have become crucial, demanding a proper solution to transform the agriculture supply chain more 
productive and efficient. FAO (2017) says major transformations of agricultural systems, rural economies and natural 
resource management will be needed if we are to meet the multiple challenges before us and realize the full potential 
of food and agriculture to ensure a secure and healthy future for all people and the entire planet.

the integrated markets, removes information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and promotes real-time price 
discovery, based on actual demand and supply, promotes transparency in auction process, and access to a nationwide 
market for the farmer, with prices commensurate with quality of his produce and online payment and availability of 
better quality produce and at more reasonable prices to the consumer. (Sharma and Patil 2018).

This was intended to help farmers in managing the irrigation time of their agriculture correctly. The resulting of the 
system that is an application can be of great benefit to its users. The user can directly divide own land into as many 
regions as desired in this application. Therefore, the users will provide saving in their time and water. Also, this 
application is reliable because it provides weather information instantaneously from the central stations. (Kiani, and 
Seyyedabbasi 2018).

growth of crops.  
Using the loT network, the exact variations the plant undergoes with time have assessed allowing to pin-point the 
specific deficiencies that the plant faces in terms of mineral requirement or environmental adjustments. The images 
have been obtained from the SD Card that has been installed on the loT Sensing network and fed into the system. By 
corroborating the histograms for all the sets, it was analyzed to conclude the deficiency that is currently affecting the 
plant. Therefore, using the loT Sensing network that contains the exact temperature, soil moisture, humidity data, the 
information has been collaborated to validate the findings by the image processing results obtained. (Kapoor et al. 
2016).

Agri-Food Canada’sNational Agricultural Information Services (NAIS). Climate data from volunteers, farmers and 
media reporting is gathered using this tool and then the data is anonymized and mapped by NAIS, which maps can 
then be used by anyone interested in information about current/historical weather conditions municipally, regionally 
or nationally. The tool is explicitly intended to help producers mitigate weather-related risks (Bronson and Knezevic 
2016).  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
As the agricultural supply chain is facing problems with the increasing population, natural disasters and climatic 
changes, there is a need of transforming the agriculture supply chain to a whole new one which is high in productivity 
and efficiency. Adopting technology to the agriculture supply chain has been identified as a potential solution and 
there are more and more applications that develop day by day. According to the review, it was found IoT as the main 
technological category that has built more applications compared to others during the past few years. Most of these 
applications were made using sensors and was mostly used in the crop growth stage. As the base technology, mobile

technology has played a significant role in IoT devices. Mobile technology has been used to provide advisory services 
to farmers as well. Big data and blockchain have been identified as the technologies that will make a huge impact on 
the agriculture supply chain with other prevailing technologies in future. With this, the article has presented a summary 
of all those published technology applications and technologies to provide benefits to the reader in several aspects. 
The reader will be able to identify the technologies that will transform the agriculture supply chain, about the 
technology applications, identify the areas that have technology applications and identify the areas that do not have or 
lack.

Abstract 
 
This case study is conducted at the yarn manufacturing (spinning) mill of Sindh, Pakistan about the 
implementation of lean manufacturing (LM). LM is new to the process industries and especially in yarn 
manufacturing industry. Though few studies are conducted in garment sector but these are very limited. 
As per my knowledge, no study was conducted in any spinning mill about the significance of waste of 
LM and/or to propose LM practices for the reduction of significant LM wastes.  The aim of the study was 
to identify LM practices to minimize waste in yarn manufacturing industry. The objectives associated 
with this aim are to investigate the significance of wastes of lean in yarn manufacturing industry, to 
identify and analyze the most significant waste through LM standards and to propose the LM practices to 
reduce the most significant waste in yarn manufacturing industry. The study is limited to seven LM 
wastes only i.e. overproduction, waiting, transportation, inappropriate processing, unnecessary inventory, 
unnecessary motion and defect. The study is also limited to six yarn manufacturing processes of ring 
spinning i.e. blow room process, carding process, drawing process, roving process, ring process and 
winding process. The processes before the blow room and after the winding are not considered. The data 
is collected from the interviews, observations and discussion methods. The lean wastes are identified in 
the different areas of the yarn manufacturing process. The wastes are investigated and the appropriate lean 
practices are suggested. Initially the Waste Relations Matrix (WRM) is used to investigate the 
significance of wastes of lean. The   most commonly used tool for identification of lean wastes i.e. 
“Gemba Walk” is adopted to get the details of most significant waste. The statistical tools are adopted to 
get the data of the most significant waste from each section of the yarn manufacturing industry. Defect 
waste is identified as the most significant and inventory is the least significant waste which also affect 
other lean wastes in the yarn manufacturing industry. Lap licking in blow room, irregular sliver in 
carding, irregular sliver in drawing, irregular sliver in combing, irregular roving in roving, improper 
bobbin build in ring and ribbon wound cone in winding are the most occurring defects in the yarn

Abstract 
The demand of automobiles is continuously increasing in the automobile sector of Pakistan. Keeping in 
view the increasing demand of the automobiles, this research work is done in a well-known automobile 
assembling plant. The aim of the research is to improve the productivity of an automobile assembling 
plant with special focus on quality and quantity. The paint shop of the plant is considered as the major 
bottleneck in low productivity. Therefore, it is selected as the case to improve productivity and fulfill the 
market demand. Takt time of the identified process is recorded on the standard sheets. The major causes 
of low productivity are identified by cause and effect analysis. The alternative measures to improve the 
productivity are identified and compared. The alternates are proposed to the company. The annual data is 
collected from Pre-treatment Electrode Deposition Line (PT-ED Line). Takt Time in one of the process of 
PT-ED Line of paint shop is reduced from 2.04 mins to 1.78 mins. This is done with the help of 
electrodes replacement and increasing of amperes of the electrodes in the Cathode Electrode Deposition 
(CED) process. This reduction in takt time increased the daily production of paint shop from 245 units to 
280 units. This improvement in production somehow will fulfill the market demand of the selected 
automobile plant. The calculations are made for each type of shift operations at current, future and ideal 
conditions.

Abstract 
This study is conducted at the production plant of a pharmaceutical company. The selected production 
facility was facing the increase in wastages due to certain reasons which were to be diagnosed keenly and 
reduced it up to least possible level of overall productions. The main goal of this research is to identify the 
lean wastes at the plant because these wastes are responsible for lower the productivity, increase the cost, 
reduce the profit of organization, and reduce the efficiency of workers & machines, less competitive in 
global market and ineffective utilization of resources. The elimination of such wastes is the ultimate 
outcome of this research. Initially the gemba walk is conducted at the selected production line. The flow 
diagram of the production line is constructed. The standard lean manufacturing wastes sheets are adopted 
for the identification of lean wastes. The major causes of the identified lean wastes were identified by the 
detailed analyses with Ishikawa diagram. The defect waste, motion waste, waiting waste and over 
processing waste are identified as the most deadly wastes at the selected production line. The activities 
which created the wastes are identified and measured. The corrective actions are suggested for the 
reduction or elimination of the identified lean wastes.

Abstract 
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) measurement is one of the most commonly used tool as a Key 
Performance Indicator (KPI) for any production plant in conjunction with lean manufacturing. 
Objective:  The aim of this study is to measure the performance of a motorcycle assembling plant through 
the lean manufacturing practice of OEE. The major objective include the calculation of OEE data on 
machine performance to understand the equipment losses. The second objective is to identify the gap 
between the plant’s OEE and world class OEE. The ultimate objective is to highlight the causes and this 
gap and suggest the corrective measures to minimize this gap. Initially the equipment is selected as target 
for calculating OEE. Then the losses and bottlenecks are observed. The related information is collected 
about production and planned schedule time. The OEE is calculated as per standard process and losses are 
identified. The OEE factors are compared with world class and gap is identified. In the end the corrective 
measures are suggested to minimize the gap. The OEE matrix is calculated and results are interpreted. It 
is observed that OEE factor at the availability is 88.46%, performance is 36.42%, quality is 97.44% and 
Overall OEE is 31.55%. The achieved result shows gap between the plant’s OEE and world class. The 
major reason for the gap is performance factor level. Three OEE losses i.e. downtime, speed loss and 
quality loss are measured and the responsible factors behind these losses are identified.

Abstract 
 
A decision on the best condition monitoring technology that fulfills the user criteria can be complicated due 
to the many criteria and condition monitoring alternatives. This work lists criteria filtered from an extensive 
literature review on the condition monitoring selection criteria then surveys experts to know the weight of 
each criterion when selecting a technology to monitor an automotive lubrication system. The work then 
applies a fuzzy-TOPSIS model to select the condition monitoring technology according to the listed criteria. 
The authors conclude that the performance parameters of an automotive vehicle serve as the best option to 
monitor the health state of the vehicle, then comes the condition monitoring technologies on the descending 
favourability order of oil analysis, acoustic emission, vibration, and thermography.

5. Conclusion 
 
With the varying alternatives of the CM technologies and the existence of many criteria to be considered when 
selecting a CM technology, the decision on the matter can get complicated.  
This work listed out the criteria considered to select CM technologies from the literature then surveyed experts in the 
maintenance field to get weights of the CM selection criteria for a lubrication system in a vehicle. The work then 
proceeded to apply Fuzzy-TOPSIS to decide on the best CM technology to use when monitoring the lubrication 
system. It was concluded that the best technologies to use are the performance parameters.  
The work can be extended to quantify the cost and benefit criteria according to a hazard model of the lubrication 
system, and then proceed with the fuzzy-TOPSIS model.

Abstract 
A pre-requisite for exact sciences students is to master basic mathematical skills. Since 2016, to reduce 
the drop-out level of such students, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev offers a ""Mathematics 
Proficiency"" online – self-evaluation and training course. The course was developed by the Mathematics 
department in collaboration with the University’s Academic Development and Teaching Improvement 
Unit. The goal of this study was to classify key learning patterns and characteristics and relate those to 
student’s achievements at the end of the first semester of studies in the faculties of engineering and 
natural sciences (STEM in general), mainly via process mining and statistical analysis. 
Process mining combines data mining with process modeling and analysis to discover, monitor and 
improve organizational processes by extracting knowledge from event logs available in the databases of 
organization’s information systems. In this research we utilized three leading process mining tools: Disco, 
ProM and Celonis, combined with R for statistical analyzes. Our analysis relied on the event and self-
evaluation logs of the students' online course, without disclosing their personal identity. 
After defining the examined population and the research method, an extensive data cleaning was carried 
out. We had over 25.5 thousand records reflecting 6265 students participating during 3 academic years of 
activities. Then, process mining tools were applied for modeling as well as identifying behavior patterns, 
those displayed over 1,100 variants, reflecting student behavior and diversity, Learning those patterns 
with process mining tools led to definition of 5 main learning patterns. Finally, the effect of the 
behavioral patterns during the course was examined through students’ success, particularly on the average 
grade in the first semester of studies. 
The results show that 72% of the students did not use the on-line course despite recommendation, but 
from those who did use it, approximately half have performed most of the recommended tests (as per 
personal recommendation).  Statistical analysis indicated that there was no distinct difference between 
students that studied up to 2 self-evaluation tests before abandoned and students that did not use the on-
line course at all. However, significant correlation was found between persistence learning pattern and 
students’ average. Students who have conducted most of the recommended tests (over 75%), achieved on 
the average, final score higher by 5.4 points (in 0-100 scale) than students who did not perform any tests 
at all.

Abstract 
This study was conducted to examine the impact of poor-quality management on the productivity of a 
beverage industry. A South African soft drinks manufacturing company was selected as a case study. The 
study was carried out among the employees of the company's plant and through observing equipment and 
wellbeing of company's facilities located in Johannesburg. A sample of 150 workers was drawn from the 
company, and each employee was asked questions on how productivity can be improved. The results 
showed that reducing quantity of inputs, such as working time, would enable the company to produce a 
standardized product. It was also found that proper maintenance of facilities and working equipment and 
employee's skill improvement would improve operations within the company. Tight supervision and special 
monitoring of workers have a greater impact on performance and the overall productivity of the company. 
Thus, the company needs to encourage hygiene and improve employee's skills to adapt to fast changing 
technologies, and strategies must be adopted accordingly to obtain optimum productivity of the workers 
and satisfy customers with quality products. By responding to the needs of this contemporary marketing 
environment, it was believed that it will give the company competitive advantage over its competitors.

1. Introduction
Productivity is defined as the effectiveness of productive effort, measured in terms of the output per unit of input, it is 
a quantitative relationship between what firm produce and what it has spent on the production (Zamarripa, 1993). 
Gerald (2004) defines productivity improvement as the process of analysing the performance of the current operating 
processes and then determining specific strategies that can be put in place (established or implemented) to increase 
efficiency as well as production output. ‘’Productivity improvement helps businesses and organizations reap benefit 
from fine-tuning the right productivity processes to accommodate specific operational needs, the benefit from 
productivity improvement include in overall costs combined with the increase in revenue” (Gerald, 2004). 
The application of productivity improvement helps in streamlining an organization or system more efficient and 
effective by employing faster or simpler working methods, processes and ensures a proactive work system ready to 
counter deviations from the ideal state. The major thrust of productivity improvement is to achieve productivity and 
process efficiency by identifying and eliminating problems in work processes and systems. Productivity improvement 
addresses key problems areas such as mistakes in work processes, redundant (needless or unnecessary) processes, 
unnecessary tasks and duplicate efforts (Paul, 2007).  
Study of productivity improvement is becoming more important against a backdrop of market relations because it 
allows the company to stay competitive on the market and strengthen the social component in the development of 
society. An important role in the analysis of productivity is the definition and use of reserves to improve production 
efficiency. It contributes to the economic use of various resources, identifying and implementing best practices, 
organization of work, new equipment and technology, to prevent waste, etc. (Muthiah and Huang, 2006).

4. Conclusion 
 
A South African soft drink manufacturing company was studied to examine the factors that were adjusted to increase 
the overall productivity of the company. Based on the results of productivity index, it was found that the productivity 
of the company was improved, which was achieved by reducing the amount of productivity factors identified during 
the study, and changes were made to increase the level of output for the same quantity of inputs or even lesser inputs. 
This is aligned with Wilt et al. (2010), who stated that productivity is achieved by reducing the amount of inputs used 
to produce the same outputs or increasing the inputs to produce more outputs. The improved productivity makes the 
company more productive and competitive.

Abstract 
The effect of inventory control on the productivity of manufacturing firms has become topical. Inventory 
control is an important factor in determining efficiency and effectiveness, thereby achieving productivity 
of a manufacturing firm. Survival of the manufacturing firms depend on its ability to have uninterrupted 
production, and effective control of inventory is necessary to achieve an efficient production process. This 
study was conducted on selected steel firms based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Based on the information 
obtained from the firms involved, the study established that inventory control has an effect on the 
productivity of a firm. The study also discovered that inventory control is a problem for larger steel firms 
compared to small and medium size firms because the larger firms are dealing with big orders. The study 
also revealed that during the production process, firms tend to use rule-of-thumb when managing inventory 
control. The survival of the manufacturing firm depends on its ability to have uninterrupted production. 
Furthermore for the manufacturing firm to be able to achieve an efficient production process, its inventory 
must be controlled effectively.

1. Introduction
In the ever-changing economic environment, manufacturing firms are faced with many challenges and the most 
noticeable challenge for the majority of businesses is to accomplish productivity in order to have the viable benefit 
(Kumar and Suresh, 2009). Most manufacturing companies strive to have access to the customers, and easy access to 
raw resources or suppliers in order to satisfy needs of the market. Inventory plays a key role in manufacturing. 
Inventory is the stock or resources used to meet customer needs or to support the manufacturing of goods (Krajewski 
et al., 2012). Inventory control is planning and maintaining of resources in order to meet the competitive needs of the 
firm (Krajewski et al., 2012). Efficient control of inventory is important for achieving the full potential of the supply 
chain of any company.  
Inventory control allows companies to substantially decrease the charges related with the movement of materials. 
Inventory control methods are important components in the production process. In the mission to enhance profits on 
investment, most firms fall short on analysing their investment on inventory. This could be disastrous because refining 
the way the firm controls and manages inventory may have the potential for improving the firm’s bottom line 
(Schreibfeder, 2006). According to Temeng et al. (2010), firms have constantly overlooked the potential savings from 
proper inventory control management.  
Effective inventory control has become an effective operational tool for firms that want to maintain a competitive 
advantage and achieve high productivity. For firms to be able to achieve high productivity, they must employ different 
types of strategies and methods to control inventory. However, inventory control has proved to be a serious challenge 
for some manufacturing firms (Chen et al., 2005). Steel producers invest a lot of money on keeping the inventory.

Inventory 
control models  
It appears that larger steel firms do follow prescribed methods, 
the most mentioned method is MRP. Steel firms are mostly 
using the rule of –thumb in their manufacturing process when 
managing inventory. 
Small and medium size steel 
firms do not use structured 
procedural methods prescribed 
in the literature to control 
inventory. 
Productivity 
and inventory 
control  
Inventory control may influence productivity. If the firm did not use material planning properly 
the firm may be short of material for production, which may affect the production capacity and 
the firm may not be able to meet customer satisfaction due to top stock shortage. 
 
4.6 Management Implications  
 
The management of the steel firms must be very knowledgeable and possess special skills on inventory control, for 
the following reasons: 
 
Inventory control - Firms must always strive to build the better distribution networks in order to be able to meet the 
demand of the market ensuring that they create customer satisfaction. Management must understand firm’s distribution 
channels to be able to effectively manage the inventory. 
 
Physical control - Managers must provide oversite over the physical material or stock. Physical control of inventory 
includes control of stores; it is important that materials are of correct quantity and are always verified adequately now 
and then. Managers must mitigate better ways of dealing with shortages of raw materials due to ineffective ways of 
controlling the inventory. 
 
Corroboration and stock checking - Materials or stock need to be verified through physical counting, measuring or 
weighing the entire range of items in the storages by recording the results in a systematic manner. Physical inventory 
control is usually taken periodically or continuously.   
 
Control of Budget and planning - Firms must do budgeting and control for inventory control. The firm must do 
production sales and inventory budget on basis of production target budgetary control. Production budget must be 
done, along with proper planning against demand and supply.  
 
Productivity - Every employee must be trained to understand the importance of achieving high productivity. Suppliers 
play a very critical role in productivity, and managers must develop a better effective ways of managing suppliers to 
ensure efficiency in production. Proper supply and demand planning must be a daily duty of management. Elimination 
of waste must be implemented by using inventory control approaches such as MRP and as well as using JIT 
production.   
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Existing literature establishes that inventory control has an effect on productivity of the firm. The study conducted on 
few selected companies establishes that inventory control is a problem for larger steel firms because they are dealing 
with much bigger orders as their production line is much bigger. The study discovered that that there is a positive 
relationship between inventory control and productivity.  The literature reveals that firms who minimize the level of 
inventory stand a good chance of increasing their productivity. The study discovered that inventory control approaches 
can assist in elimination of waste in production. The study reveals that firms that do not necessarily follow inventory 
control approaches struggle with maintaining and keeping inventory during production process. The study discovered 
that productivity speaks to the company’s production ability being able to reach the process capacity. The study also 
depict that productivity improvement helps to satisfy customer and reduce time and cost to develop, produce and 
deliver products.

Introduction
Changes in the business paradigm that were previously product-oriented turn to customer loyalty. The highest income 
from business processes comes from customers; therefore, companies need to identify, satisfy, and retain the most 
profitable customers (Buttle, 2004). Adding customer loyalty by 5% can increase profits by almost 100% (Gallo, 2014). 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a multi-perspective business paradigm consisting of people, processes, 
and technology (Rahimi, 2017).  
Several studies have revealed the effect of CRM implementation to the achievement of competitive advantage 
(Mohammed, Rashid & Tahir, 2014). CRM also has a direct influence on company performance (Dutu & Hălmăjan, 
2010). In addition, measurements are not only based on finance but also on non-finance, namely customer satisfaction, 
employee satisfaction, the number of new customers acquired, or employee fluctuations (Selvam, Gayathri, Vasanth, 
Lingaraja & Marxiaoli, 2016). 
This study examines for dimensions and strategic criteria that influence the preparation and effectiveness of the 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy followed by the weighting, which is done by taking into account 
the interrelationships between dimensions and criteria for Customer Relationship Management (CRM). After that, the 
mapping of dependent relationships between dimensions and criteria using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) 
method, afterward the mapping of dimensions and priority of criteria that affect the effectiveness of the Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM) strategy was conducted. 
This research aims to determine the dimensions and strategic criteria for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
as input to reduce the level of customer complaints (Oil and Gas Cooperation Contract Contractors) in the oil and gas 
industry sub-contractor.

• 
Managing Problem 
The problems that exist in the oil and gas industry are how to reduce production costs, the optimum 
performance of the assets used by companies and how to improve the improvement of the former 
production environment. If the problems mentioned above can be managed properly, customer complaints 
will decrease in line with improvements made. 
 
• 
Value Creation Strategy 
Value creation strategy is one of the criteria that must be done to reduce customer complaints in the oil and 
gas industry sub-contractor including the cost efficiency of exploration, production, refining, marketing, 
and overhead costs 
 
6. Conclusions  
This research determined six main dimensions and twenty-seven CRM criteria as guidelines for designing a CRM 
strategy in the oil and gas supporting industry. In order of priority, the following are Customer, CRM Strategy, CRM 
Output, Organizational Alignment, and Company Workcode Analysis.  
The customer dimension is prioritized in the preparation of CRM strategies in the order of criteria (performance 
indicators) that are in accordance with their influence on the achievement of CRM strategies as follows: Customer 
Satisfaction, Customer Trust, Customer Complaint, Customer Loyalty, Customer Response and Customer Value. 
The priority of criteria that affects the effectiveness of CRM strategies is Customer Retention, Intellectual Alignment, 
Sales Support, Managing Problems, Value Creation Strategy, Customer Interaction Strategy, Customer Satisfaction, 
Customer Trust, Social Alignment, and Inquiry Management.

Abstract 
Increased development of telecommunication industry requires telecommunication tower provider companies to finish 
the construction of telecommunication tower in accordance with the customer's demand. Business Process Re-
engineering methodology in this research is used to shorten the time of the procurement with the help of the IDEF0 
method, mapping the process through interviews and focus group discussions with six experts. Using Elimination, 
Simplify, Integration, and Automation method, this research resulted in As-Is and To-Be processes in project 
procurement and tower construction could shorten the processing time up to forty percent.

Introduction
The telecommunications industry in Indonesia is currently developing rapidly and increasing competitively. The 
competitive offer must be supported by the technology and good quality of their products, one of which is the quality 
of a good signal or network. One of the supporting sectors in the telecommunications industry is the construction of 
telecommunication towers. Investment in the construction of telecommunications towers is currently growing fast to 
offset the many requests of telecommunications operators to utilize their services. 
According to Nitin Bhat, partner and head of consulting at Frost & Sullivan Inc., tower provider companies will 
experience growth of around 15% by the end of 2013. With a high growth rate accompanied by a large number of 
competitors in the industry, as well as a limited number of consumers, it will automatically increase business climate 
change. These changes are influenced by customers, competition, time, and price (Hammer & Champy, 2001). With 
the increasing demands of the external environment, such as government regulations, growth, competition, 
technological development, and changes in the workforce, many companies are required to make organizational 
changes at least once a year and major changes every four to five years. Therefore the organization is required to 
complete each tower construction project in a timely, fast, and competitive price. 
Delay in the supply of materials and inappropriate storage of materials can result in delays in the completion of a project 
and even stop. As a result, there will be complaints and customer dissatisfaction so that it can result in decreased 
competitiveness of the company. Many things in a company that originated from previous processes result in a delay. 
This includes ineffective and inefficient procurement and storage processes. 
The purpose of this research is to redesign the company's business processes to overcome the problem of delays in the 
provision of project materials, especially in the process of procurement and storage of materials.

Abstract 
The application of statistical quality control in plastic wood MSMEs in Ecuador is the first 
implementation carried out for this productive sector. Where the fundamental problem is the variation of 
the results of recycled plastic wood in tensile analysis, where the coefficient of variation is 51.38% with 
a maximum force of 605.42 N. In this case study, the methodology composed by the diagnosis Current 
of the production process, the identification of qualitative - quantitative variables and the implementation 
of statistical quality control. I provoke the standardization of the productive process in the criteria of 
selection of recycled plastics, optimum values of temperature, pressure and time in each of the 
subprocesses. Thus, improvements were obtained in the tensile analysis of recycled plastic wood where 
the coefficient of variation after the improvement is 7.26% with a maximum force of 751.03 N.

1. Introduction
The use of plastic waste in Ecuador has grown in recent years, since the collection went from 60,870 to 182,857 
tons / year according to the data of the Ministry of Environment. This means that it is collected or recycled three 
times more than the previous years, so it is currently considered an important commercial activity in the country 
(Pozo 2019).  This has as its edges the care of the environment, the extension of the life time of municipal landfills, 
the reduction of environmental impacts mainly on water as well as on land and mainly the birth of SMEs (micro, 
small and medium enterprises) that they are dedicated to waste revaluation. Of which we can mention, ferrous scrap, 
non-ferrous scrap, paper - cardboard, glass and plastic. Being innovative in the country the SMEs that are dedicated 
to the transformation of recycled waste into plastic wood for the use of the furniture and real estate sector of the 
country (Perez 2016).   
In Ecuador, SMEs dedicated to the production of plastic wood from recycled waste are in the main cities Quito and 
Guayaquil. They have a production that varies between 30 to 40 ton / month, their main products are: profiles, floors 
/ planks, benches, tables, playgrounds, pallets, among others (Albán 2019). Despite being a relatively new industry, 
it has a process under the principle of mold - compression, which requires recycled plastic waste to be: selected, 
crushed, extruded, molded and stored. Currently, the SMEs process has an empirical method for evaluating the 
quality of its products, which is based on types of plastics, times and temperatures. Therefore, it is necessary to 
investigate a formal method of statistical evaluation of operating parameters, which guarantees the quality of 
recycled plastic wood products in the market (Cruz 2016; Herrera et al. 2019; Herrera et al. 2019a; Herrera et al. 
2019b). 
Statistical quality control is an accurate tool to guarantee quality products, since it considers the variations that 
production processes generally have. These variations can be classified in the 6M: method, materials, labor,

By maintaining the same formulation for the specimens before and after implementing statistical quality control, 
the density did not vary greatly, thus decreasing only 0.05 kg, that is, the material remains light. In addition, we can 
observe that the coefficient of variation has totally decreased from 51.38% to 7.26%, due to the fact that there are 
now control points in each area of the process that allow the qualitative and quantitative variables in the production 
of production to be kept under control. plastic wood. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The initial diagnosis was determined, each of the subprocesses that make up the plastic wood production process 
were defined, as well as to identify the quantitative and qualitative variables present in each area and in this way 
designate the strategic places that needed a control point that guarantee the quality of the product, which were: the 
raw material reception area, crushing, molding and pressing area, which now have a quality control tool. 
 
It was identified that the production of recycled plastic wood is a process whose production volume is low, for this 
reason, for the control of quantitative variables, the individual graphs of mobile ranges (I-MR) were implemented 
that allowed to detect the variability and stability of the process. On the other hand, since the qualitative variables 
are difficult to quantify, a control tool (process sheets) was designed that allows activities to be carried out in an 
orderly manner and thereby guarantee a standardized procedure. 
 
As for the strength of the material, plastic wood is produced with a maximum resistance value of 751.03 N and with 
316.51 N of breaking strength. It was also possible to standardize the time variable in the molding and pressing area, 
being these 36 and 26 minutes respectively, the temperature in the molding area could be standardized with a value 
of 150 º C and in the pressing area the correct pressure for guarantee the hardness of plastic wood sheets is 4.76 
bars.

Abstract 
Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is one of the major areas of concern for industries. All the 
sectors are mostly aiming on the “GREENING” things. In this aspect, this study focuses on detecting 
various parameters associated with GSCM practices in Diamond mining industries globally. In this 
context, diamond mining can be viewed as an important activity for providing raw materials needed to 
produce essentials items for the growth and development of the society. The severity of past mining 
disasters and the casualties associated with them have raised the public's perception of mining as being a 
high-risk activity not only for the public's and workers' health but also for the environment. In this work, a 
several parameters have been identified from literature which relates to sustainable supply chain concerns 
in diamond industry.

1.
INTRODUCTION
Mined materials play a great role in the growth and development of modern civilized society (Muduli & Barve,
2015), technological advancements and progress to satisfy growing demand arising from increased levels of
consumption creates large accumulations of waste on the environment and faster depletion of non-renewable
resources. Governments of various countries have enacted laws and regulations to address the growing
environmental issues. In response to these laws and regulations most of the companies have switched to the
implementation of GSCM (Barve & Muduli, 2013). Diamond mining is a labor-intensive activity, requiring a
large workforce of skilled workers often deployed in remote environments, so the concern is clear that workers’
safety and maintaining the environment health is big task. For environment’s heath we should focus on
biodiversity conservation, reduction of greenhouse gasses and reduction of pollution, land use and waste, with
this we should take into account workers concerns which includes salaries and benefits, workplace safety,
gender wage gap, proper overtime pay, reduction in insufficient income, forced labor and child labor.
Diamond mining is a complex, requiring energy and resources, generating potential impacts to the natural
environment. But Diamond Producers Association (DPA) members create environmental benefits through
investments in conservation and rehabilitation works in the regions surrounding the mines which enhance and
protect natural ecosystems. The environmental sustainability of the diamond sector is dependent on the degree
to which environmental risks are managed, whilst maximizing benefits to natural landscapes (Lord, et al.,
2016).
Diamond has been the most valuable among gems for more than 2,000 years. Diamond occurs in two types of
deposits primarily in igneous rocks of basic or ultrabasic composition and in alluvial deposits derived from the

evaluate performance continuously and also assess what could go wrong, determine significant 
risks and implement strategies to deal with those risks (Mudgal et al. 2010). 
 
3. CONCLUSION 
 
It can be observed that in future there will be big concern on sustainable issues of supply chains instead of the 
profitable supply chains. Therefore, to sustain in long run manufacturing enterprises need to re conﬁgure their 
strategies rapidly in anticipation to the changing opportunities and requirements towards sustainable growth. 
Growing attention towards environmental issues at both national and international levels is putting pressure on 
organizations to develop strategies that will integrate environmental concerns with their business strategies. 
Further, diamond mining industries can be placed at one of the extreme ends of the supply chain for being 
supplier of raw materials. For this, environmental improvement efforts of the mining industries will deﬁnitely 
reduce environmental degradation effect of diamond supply chain. In this regard this research assumes its 
importance by identifying potential sustainable concerns in diamond mining industries and their 
interdependencies. 
 
This research can be used for further analysis of these factors and their dependency and driving power by using 
MICMAC and other tools. Also, a systematic model of these factors cab be developed using Interpretive 
structural modelling (ISM) technique, this model will give a perfect idea about the factors arranged in a proper 
way. Structural equation modeling (SEM) have the ability to validate an already developed model but unable to 
develop the initial model. ISM and SEM are complementary in nature, therefore, in future SEM can be used to 
test the validity of the developed model, through ISM.

Abstract 
Market competition is fierce and has been intensified due to globalization, therefore companies have 
experienced increase pressure to improve cycle and delivery times and achieve a high level of 
customization. Lean principles have been designed and implemented to respond to market changes. 
However, these principles are commonly aimed to aid low-mix high-volume (LMHV) manufacturers. This 
paper aims to produce an approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (HMLV) 
manufacturing environment. An HMLV manufacturing environment, currently produces a variety of 
products which differs in terms of shape and size and different sequence of operation. 
Furthermore, analysis of the manufacturing assembly shows there is a substantial variation in cycle and 
changeover time from product to product. In this approach, an action based study has been completed. This 
study uses data collection methods to be applied in order to calculate timings to be used in a Discrete Event 
Simulation (DES). The simulation uses lean tools to study material movement and facility layout to 
minimize bottlenecks and eliminate waste from the process. An introduction of lean supermarket is 
considered within the simulation whereby an operator withdraws products in an specific amount needed by 
a downstream process before introducing it across the assembly floor and an action plan is created. As a 
result, a lean manufacturing simulation study has been implemented to evaluate the effects of a supermarket 
concept within the current manufacturing environment. Initial results show a variation within the cycle and 
setup times for each of the different products due to the nature of the process. The paper, is limited to 
applying the approach to a singular production line and a singular manufacturing plant. The practical 
implications to implement this approach into a manufacturing environment is that there should be a need 
from the company. This approach should be driven by senior members within the organization as the 
resistance to change would increase the risk of failure. Another implication of the proposed approach is to 
ensure the accuracy of the data collected and to introduce a series of briefs within each stage of the approach. 
This is important as all stakeholders would need to be kept up-to-date with the project. However, the 
approach is applicable to any organization and can be applied to any sector. This paper, proposes a 
systematic approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (HMLV) manufacturing 
environment. The approach is validated in British manufacturing organization competing in global markets.

Abstract 
Social productive innovation in the country is a topic that has not been exploited and considered for 
research, this being an important indicator for measuring economic growth in a planning area.  The 
enterprises that are classified by necessity, in the course of the years, if these continue with their activity, 
an evidence of innovation is noticed, if to this in the process, product or service that offers, to be able to 
measure this situation, a survey of information was made with the main actors of these socioeconomic 
sectors, through the application of the Mayoux value mapping methodology, working groups of different 
productive sectors and services members of the United Women's Savings and Credit Cooperative were 
formed, through work dynamics the levels and types of innovation that have developed within their 
productive activities, such as: implementation of innocuous procedures for the elaboration of food products, 
improvement of spaces for the provision of services, implementation of machinery for the improvement of 
production, among others. All these activities cause the enterprises to be classified in another 
socioeconomic level, identifying them as microenterprises that are in the highest percentage of agents 
generated by the economy in Ecuador, but not with the same benefits that the enterprises have at the moment 
of acquiring credits for improvement in their productive activities.

Productive innovation, value chain, entrepreneurship, popular and solidarity economy. 
1. Introduction
The definition of ""innovation"" from the social approach, is a term used by the industrial sector but not taken into 
account in the undertakings of the popular and solidarity economy, in recent years we have heard that microenterprise 
is the highest percentage of economic generation in our country, determining the rate of innovation in this sector leads 
us to the study to identify how the ""enterprise"" of the popular and solidarity economy has been making changes, 
modifications, improvements in their productive activities or services. 
Social innovation is one of the phenomena that has gone from being emergent and marginal to occupying a position 
of relevance in political discourses and social organizations (ABREU, 2011).  This is where the interest in determining 
how innovation develops in the sector of companies that have been socially considered ""informal"", but whose activity 
generates economic dynamism in the sectors where they are located. 
The denomination of ""social innovation practices"" are considered in recent years quickly, in which they have seen that 
certain social structures are replaced by others, by different factors such as the political, economic and financial crisis 
of the country and the region.  The social and environmental problems that characterize a more vulnerable society 
have highlighted the need to undertake actions that provide innovative solutions, while presenting social features 
(LEVESQUE, 2012). 
The present work aspires to determine that innovation is carried out in all sectors that generate economic activity. To 
this end, a systematic review of definitions and methodologies was carried out to identify the articulating elements 
that structure the concept. In a second moment, it was developed the survey of productive activities and services,

followed by investment in the local or warehouse, acquisition of machinery and tools, being this fundamental part in 
the innovation of the process and it can be appreciated that investing in technology or computer equipment have also 
done so. 
 
In relation to the qualitative section, the analysis of the personal value maps and summary of all, as well as the 
transcription of the videos made at the time of the workshops, is obtained as a result;

It is interesting to note that the initiatives recognize social innovation as an aspect that allows the development of 
initiatives framed within a community process that seeks to generate strategies and alternatives to the problems that 
arise in their area of action. Among the determinants of why they are considered innovative, it stands out that the 
population with which they work, especially young people, children and the disabled, allow the integration of the 
family into the initiatives since it becomes a scenario in which it is shared and it is possible to reflect on the solutions 
that can be proposed. It is innovative because it contacts the immediate contexts of the beneficiaries, such as the 
community, the family, the school, among others. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Social innovation becomes a possibility that organizations have, to project themselves in the possible solution to 
problems that arise in their immediate environment, with this study is identified that elements that are effectively 
found in the initiatives analyzed, ideas and proposals arise from the same community, in many of them are small-scale 
solutions that seek to prototype to replicate in other environments in similar conditions.   
 
Due to their size, it is not so easy to access and articulate the work with public policies, since they dedicate themselves 
to everyday life and to seeking to participate with their immediate communities. Another difficulty that arises is framed 
within sustainability, since they are interesting ideas that seek better living conditions, but that face problems to 
generate liquidity over time.

It is important to carry out the strengthening process in the light of organizational elements, that is, in budget 
management, in the formulation and presentation of projects, in the development of fundraising, in the rapprochement, 
appropriation and design of alliances with other organizations and key actors that allow to give solidity to the 
processes.  
 
For this reason, it is important to continue supporting the generation of networks with diverse actors that allow them 
to become much more visible at the local and national levels.   
Thanks to the fact that some of the leaders of the initiatives take their participation as a life project, continuity can be 
generated, but this can at some point become a risk since it is necessary to work on the empowerment of the 
communities, since if the leader of the process is exhausted or feels that he cannot continue, the initiatives may 
disappear.   
 
The country is not prepared for the collection of data that evidences or explains the phenomenon of social innovation, 
for this reason when making models in this sense, there are gaps in the validation criteria, both in the individual 
significance and in the model as a whole.  
The dynamics of social innovation is different in each territory, that is, there is no uniformity in the criteria, which 
causes very different results between cities. This can be a starting point to guide the public policy of social innovation 
that leads to a national identity.  
It is evident the pertinence of creating a social innovation survey by the public sector, which gathers the information 
of all the social organizations that are working in the country, from this could derive a transversal model to any 
organization and / or initiatives.

Abstract 
The vertiginous growth experienced in the use of mobile devices is evidenced in that 53% of the population 
in Latin America uses the internet through any technological equipment; At the same time, it has meant 
that e-learning in the field of teaching promotes the appearance of m-learning in turn with the availability 
of millions of applications for the end user. However, there is no Standardized Methodology under which 
such mobile applications are built. This research aims to propose a set of guidelines and techniques that 
facilitate the design and construction of web-based mobile applications for mobile devices. In order to 
achieve this objective, a methodology is proposed which consists of experimenting with source collections, 
designed for PC web pages, making an evaluation and carrying out a standardization, so that in the end 
valid guidelines are obtained for learning objects based on Web for mobile devices. We cite theoretical 
references PMBOK (2010), KANBAN (2013), SCRUM (2011). In conclusion, it was possible to propose 
a methodological guide that covers the necessary techniques and guidelines that allow the good design and 
construction of mobile applications of high quality oriented to m-learning, guaranteeing the success and 
acceptance of the end user.

1. Introduction
Software engineering is defining as the technology discipline, worried about the systematic production and 
maintenance of software products which are developed and modified on time and within the defined budget. Software 
engineering:  It is a discipline on an area of information technology or a computation science which offers technics 
and methods to develop and maintain good quality software to resolve any type. (Roger S. Pressman, 2010). Once the 
engineering universe has been conceived, we can say that software is considered, as a discipline, a technique, a tool 
or methodology in software development in order to get a model to follow in the development of software that is 
reliable and easy to modify. 
Now let's analyze that ""A methodology is a collection of procedures, techniques, tools and auxiliary documents that 
help software developers in their efforts to implement new information systems. A methodology is formed by phases, 
each of which can be divided into sub-phases, which will guide system developers to choose the most appropriate 
techniques at each moment of the project and to plan, manage, control and evaluate it. "" (Jacobson, 2013) 
Achieving the construction of an efficient computer system that meets the requirements, is an intense task and above 
all difficult to fulfill. Methodologies for software development impose a disciplined process on software development 
in order to make it more predictable and efficient. A software development methodology has as its main objective to 
increase the quality of the software that is produced in each one of its development phases. There is no universal

7. Discussion 
 
During the time of application of this methodological guide the effort has focused on demonstrating that its procedures, 
techniques and steps to follow achieved the optimization of the time of construction and development of a mobile 
application. Therefore, the prototype developer team, began these works with an alternation of methodologies. Finally, 
they opted for the ADPE methodological guide, based on time saving, which was evident in the saving of resources, 
and therefore, in the effectiveness of the process. All this is demonstrated in the present research work.  Through the 
metrics shown in the proposal where the time saving was 10% less. 
 
8. Conclusions 
 
The Methodological Guide proposed in this document groups and incorporates innovations to the best practices and 
artifacts of the most evaluated methodologies of the market, generating a considerably high level of productivity in 
conjunction with high levels of development and construction. 
 
A significant improvement has been achieved regarding the occupation of time in the development of prototypes, 
since the Methodological Guide organizes the activities, artifacts and roles in such a way that the Scope, Development, 
Testing and Delivery are given in a prudent time , always maintaining control over the evolution of the product and 
the transparency of development towards the end user.

Likewise, agile software development methodologies and this particular proposal guide allows small development 
groups to concentrate on the task of building software by fostering easy-to-adopt practices and an orderly environment 
that helps people to work better in what  m-learning refers to and allows projects to be completed successfully in the 
shortest time possible without sacrificing the quality of the final product at any time.

Abstract 
A systematic literature review (SLR) is a protocol used to identify publications, select relevant publications, collect 
data, conduct scientometric analyses, and report research results (SLR outcomes or findings).  Despite the increasing 
use of SLR to assess the maturity or evolution of a research field, as Engineering Management, there are a limit 
number of publications focused to test SLR biases.  Therefore, the purposes of this investigation are to test search 
field bias (precise SLR vs. sensitive SLR) and to identify statistically significant differences between SLR 
outcomes.  In order to achieve these goals, a three steps methodology was used in three platforms/databases.  First, a 
precise SLR in ProQuest (search terms only in abstract) was conducted to identify publications describing a single 
Kaizen event in a hospital.  From these publications, five metrics were assessed: new authors per year, number of 
authors per paper, number of publications per year, Kaizen event duration (days), and number of tools used during 
the Kaizen event per paper.  Second, a sensitive SLR in ProQuest (search term in full text) was conducted using the 
same search terms, exclusion criteria, and metrics from the first step.  Third, t-test hypotheses were conducted in 
SPSS version 20 to identify statistically significant difference for each metric between precise SLR vs. sensitive 
SLR.  The same three steps were used in two more platforms/databases: EBSCOhost and Scopus.  Initial results 
from this ongoing investigation show statistically significant differences between precise SLR and sensitive SLR for 
some of the five metrics assessed, such as the number of publications per year.  Final results will be available in 
November 2018.

1. Introduction
Year to year, the number of published scientific papers is increasing due to the accessibility of information obtained 
by technology. This vast range of information has become one of the main challenges for researchers; needing to 
read or scan several articles found for later selecting the pertinent ones for the study (filter information). Because of 
this, researchers spend a lot of their time using search engines to locate the material on the vast and unorganized web 
[1]. Currently, more and more researchers have adopted a systematic way of search and analyze information 
obtained from the literature available conducting systematic literature reviews.  A systematic literature review (SLR) 
is a protocol used to identify publications, select relevant publications, collect data, conduct scientometric analyses, 
and report research results (SLR outcomes or findings) [2].  Despite the increasing use of SLR to assess the maturity 
or evolution of a research field (see Figure 1), as Engineering Management; there are a limit number of publications 
focused to test SLR biases (over-estimation or an under-estimation of SLR outcomes).

4. Discussion 
The purposes of this investigation were to test search field bias (precise SLR vs. sensitive SLR) and to identify 
statistically significant differences between SLR outcomes or metrics.  After applied the SLR framework (see Figure 
2) and test 12 hypotheses (see Table 4), the research team found that four hypotheses were rejected.  This evidence 
suggests, in some cases, that SLR outcomes or metrics could be statistically different when you conduct abstract 
search terms vs. full-text search terms.  It is interesting to observe that the hypotheses related to the average of 
publications per year (a metric used frequently by a researcher in SLR papers) were rejected in the three 
platforms/databases.  Additional hypotheses could be rejected also, but the high level of SD values influence these 
results; for example, the average of new authors per year in ProQuest and Kaizen event duration in the three 
platforms/databases.  Although the research leader selected these four metrics considering that they are frequently 
used by other researchers with published SLRs in other fields, these metrics involve three out of eight dimensions 
used to assess the maturity or evolution of a research field [6]: authors’ characteristics (average of new authors per 
year), average of publications per year (publication characteristics), Kaizen event duration (content characteristics), 
and average of authors per paper (publication characteristics).  Therefore, another way to interpret finding from this 
investigation is that two out of eight dimensions (67%) show a statistically significant difference between abstract 
search field and full-text search field in at least one platform/database.  These findings should be considered by 
researchers interesting to conduct SLRs and publish their results in order to define the maturity or evolution of a 
research field using quantitative metrics. 
 
However, these findings also should be understood considering mainly three limitations.  First, this investigation 
was focused to assess one of several biases identified during an SLR [3,4]. Second, this investigation was limited to 
four metrics from the extensive identify by Keathley-Herring et al., [6] but represent three out of eight possible 
dimensions to be assessed.  Third, the sample size (number of publications) used to calculate the four metrics in both 
search strategies (abstract and full-text) in the three platforms/databases are relatively small.  This investigation was 
designed to be conducted during four months using three full-time undergraduate students (each student worked in 
this project an average of 25 hours per week).  Therefore, the research leader selected a research field that matches 
with his investigation topics (Kaizen event in hospitals) and with a reasonable scope or number of publications to be 
identified and screened. Future work should be focused on the following topics: assess other SLR biases, assess 
search strategy bias using additional metrics, and assess search strategy using a different research field.

Abstract 
A catheterization laboratory (Cath lab) is a place that has high-tech equipment that mainly allows the diagnosis and 
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, which represents 31% of all global deaths, according to the World Health 
Organization. (WHO, 2019) In an attempt to minimize process inefficiencies in Cath Lab, these organizations have 
been using quality improvement projects such as Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, Kaizen events (rapid improvement 
events), general quality improvement projects (plan-do-check-act) and others. However, there is a lack of 
publications synthesizing the literature available in this research field (quality improvement project). Therefore, this 
paper aim is to assess the published literature relating quality improvement projects in Cath labs in three dimensions: 
publication characteristics, author characteristics, and content characteristics. To achieve the purpose of this 
research, a systematic literature review (SLR) will be conducted to obtain the most relevant papers from three 
platforms: EBSCOhost, ProQuest, and Scopus.

1. Introduction
Quality improvement is a systematic approach to analyze and improve process performance. There are a
wide variety of quality improvement projects, some of the most common approaches or methodologies
are:

General quality improvement (Plan-do-check-act): a four-step process for quality improvement.
The first step is developing a plan to effect improvement. In the second step, the plan is carried
out on a small scale. The third step is to observe the effects of the plan. In the fourth and last
step, the results are studied to establish what was learned and what can be predicted. (Siebels,
2004)

Six Sigma: a methodology that provides businesses with the tools to improve the capability of
their business processes. This increase in performance and decrease in process variation leads to
defect reduction and improvement in profits, employee morale, and quality of the product.
(Siebels, 2004)

Lean: an approach that focuses on reducing waste and cycle time using different techniques and
tools. For example, value stream mapping and identifying and elimination “monuments” and
non-value-added steps. (Siebels, 2004)

Lean Six Sigma: an integration of the Lean and Six Sigma methodologies creating a “best of both
worlds” approach. It is the fundamental integration of an improvement toolkit that focuses on the
elimination of waste and the elimination of variation (Cole, 2011)

4. Limitations 
This study has several important limitations. First, the findings may have unique characteristics that may 
not be widely generalizable.  Some of the reasons may be that valuable papers may have been lost in the 
search due to the use of a reduced number of databases. However, the databases were selected 
strategically so that as many publications related to the research area as possible may be collected. 
Second, it was not possible to gather a significant sample of quantitative information to develop a robust 
data analysis to evaluate goals achievement and area improvements due to the modesty of the quantitative 
information recovered in the set of publications. Third, the SRL methodology generally is conducted by 
several participants to have different perspectives and ideas in the search and the analysis of publication, 
this SRL was conducted by two authors. This may cause a lack of profound analysis in the study.    
 
5. Conclusions  
In conclusion, this work may be of interest to practitioners as this investigation offers synthesized and 
comparative information about the methodologies and own designed programs that have helped improve 
processes in the Cath lab. For academics, this study gathers valuable information about the topics of 
interest in the research area that needs validating and improvement. On the other hand, it also shows the 
areas of opportunity where new lines of investigations can initiate. At last, it may be of interest to the 
medical community, in general, to better understand how this research area has developed, and the 
importance of improving its processes to achieve superior medical services.

Abstract 
Sugar industry plays a vital role in the economy of Bangladesh by way of farming and creation of 
employment. But unfortunately, every year a good number of accidents occur and this sector pays a high 
price for accidents or injuries in terms of human sufferings and economic losses. On this background this 
research aims at finding out the significant factors of accident as per the view of the workers. In data 
collection, questionnaire survey was carried out on the basis of the sample size. In the analysis section, 
twenty-five factors under four headings were identified through field visits, journal papers and internet 
search. The analysis of the collected data was started with the reliability analysis of the four major factors 
such as ‘personal factors’, ‘work factors’, ‘accident mechanism’, ‘unsafe act’. Z-test and Relative 
Importance Index (RII) method was used to analyze it.  The findingsrevealed the significant sub-factors of 
accidents. The significant sub-factors were workers negligence for safety practices, lack of training, lack 
of supervision, inadequate maintenance, lack of safety measure, fatigue due to pressure or time limitation, 
workers avoidance reporting unsafe act, coordination gap, confined work area, lack of judgement, lack of 
attention to ergonomic/ human factors, ineffective warnings,  inadequate protection and barriers, objects 
dropped, rotating machinery, inadequate handling of materials and inadequate identification of risky 
items. Finally, some suggestions have been recommended to prevent accidents in the sugar mills. Safety 
should be the priority for all industrial activities. This research work will help the stakeholders to make 
and revise the safety issue in the sugar industries.

Abstract 
Performance of a Smart City (SC) can be measured in terms of the smartness which in turn is defined by 
means of smart characteristics. However, the lack of a proper benchmark itself is a limitation in designing 
and Performance Measurement (PM) of SCs. While there are no well-accepted definitions for the smartness 
of a SC, literature seems to adopt a common set of smart characteristics while defining the term. This paper 
comprehends a systematic literature review on eight PM Models, which cover a multidimensional span of 
SC characteristics, to derive a fitting set of PM Models for SCs with PM indicators. As the major finding 
of this study a summary model is produced representing all the smart characteristics. Findings revealed the 
importance of determining indicators through the identification of themes and subthemes of PM 
frameworks. Therefore, as a way forward, a fitting PM framework with indicators will be produced as part 
of an ongoing research project aiming to enhance the SC development in Sri Lanka through PM.

1. Introduction
Measurement of the performance of smart cities was first considered important while implementing smart city 
solutions in Europe (Huovila et al., 2017).  According to Landy et al. (2017), performance and the measurement of 
performance, is a situational expectation that differs with various occasions in conducting human affairs. While this 
situational expectation turns out to be a “superior expectation”, in other words, the common expression “success” 
measuring performance is problematic as the definition of success is changing (Landy et al., 2017). Consequently, 
when such occasions happen to be “smart cities”, a vision with regards to the aforementioned situational superior 
expectation is indubitably even more convoluted, as the superior expectation has not reached a consensus yet (Gil-

Abstract 
This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model to solve the 
travelling purchaser problem (TPP) with a sustainable supplier selection, order allocation, with multiple 
vehicles and a single product. The manufacturer’s target is to choose the best green suppliers from whom 
the materials can be purchased, which means that suppliers who will be able to provide low-cost products 
and generates minimum CO2 emissions from transportation, while maximizing the social and environmental 
criteria of the material will be selected. As a result, the model consists of three objective functions, the first 
objective function aims at minimizing the total fixed and variable purchasing and transportations costs; the 
second objective function aims at minimizing the total transportation-related CO2 emissions; the third 
objective function aims at maximizing the total green and social value of the materials purchased from the 
selected suppliers.

1. Introduction
Pollution nowadays is increasing compared to last decades, since the number of vehicles increased, which led to 
producing several issues such as global warming, greenhouse gases and many more problems, which affect the 
environment directly and indirectly. Carbon emissions have increased by 2% since 2018, as reported by BP Group 
Chief Economist, Spencer Dale, which is equal to carbon emission related to the increased number of vehicles by one 
third (BP Group, 2018).  
 As a result of these issues, governments recently raised their concerns about the environment, many international 
conferences such as (United Nations Climate Change Conference) have been conducted across the globe to discuss 
and propose solutions for these issues. This paper aims to study and propose a model for the travelling purchaser 
problem (TPP). TPP aims at finding the optimal route to collect products by one or multiple vehicles by  visiting 
several suppliers (Manerba, Mansini, & Riera-Ledesma, 2017).

4. Conclusion 
In this paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is presented for the TPP with multiple 
vehicles and a single product. CPLEX software and the weighted comprehensive criterion method were used to 
solve the model and the multi-objective formulation. The results proved the feasibility of the algorithm to reduce the 
cost and CO2 emissions, for improving the environment and social criteria.  
In order to solve large-size instances of this problem, a heuristic approach needs to be developed. Moreover, the 
formulation can be extended to account for multiple products and to have a limitation on the maximum travelled 
distance for each vehicle.

Abstract 
Recently, several projects started to include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into different applications, 
which might create very dense airspace when UAVs start to be actually used in these applications. This 
paper reviews the research work performed on UAVs routing in order to identify research gaps. A total of 
46 articles related to optimization of UAV routing were reviewed to highlight the most considered modeling 
aspects in the literature and the aspects that need to gain more focus. As a result, the most considered 
modeling aspects include single depot, time windows, payload, and recharging. However, aspects such as 
the number of trips performed by UAV (single or multiple) and other factors that may affect UAV 
operations such as wind and variable speed shall be considered for future work. In addition to integrating 
the operational concept of UAVs within the routing.

1. Introduction
As the technology of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) advances, possibilities for UAV to perform complex missions 
with some degree of autonomy are being considered, which requires new methods to plan the routes of a fleet of UAVs 
(Alighanbari, Kuwata, & How, 2003). Routing of small UAVs is one of the topics that has started to receive significant 
attention in the last decade (Sundar & Rathinam, 2014). Combining vehicle routing with pre-defined locations started 
in the early 1960s, and it advanced with the development of computer technology (Yakıcı, 2016).  
Routing or path planning can be defined as “finding a route to visit a given set of points or areas under some 
constraints” (Ergezer & Leblebicioǧlu, 2014). It is necessary to find and ensure the feasibility of UAV routes despite 
its complexity (Coutinho, Battarra, & Fliege, 2018). Although UAVs have several advantages, they also have 
constraints due to their size and limited payload. Small UAVs typically have energy constraints, which can impact the 
operations of the UAVs as they may not be able to complete their mission (Sundar & Rathinam, 2014). Taking a 
surveillance mission as an example, an UAV starts from one location (depot) and visits a set of targets. Due to the 
energy constraint, an UAV will have to perform multiple trips where an UAV visits a subset of targets and then 
recharges in one of the depots and then continues the mission. In addition, most of the UAVs used for civil applications 
have low flight autonomy, and therefore, the routing algorithm should include battery life (Coutinho et al., 2018). To 
do this, the UAVs’ dynamics should be integrated with routing. A realistic model of energy consumption must include 
the weight of the UAV, the altitude and the speed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a review of the research work 
performed on UAV routing. The paper aims to highlight which modeling aspects are the most considered in the 
literature and which modeling aspects need to gain more focus.  
2. Methodology
A structured literature review has been conducted in this paper. Articles were gathered from the following databases 
and search engines: Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. A combination of synonyms of drone (drone, 
unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) and synonyms of routing (routing, routes plan, path planning) were used as search 
keywords. More than 60 articles were downloaded, and a total of 46 articles were found relevant based on the title and

Abstract 
Infrastructure plays a vital role in the socio-economic development of every. A typical community cannot 
be sustained without setting up necessary and adequate infrastructure. However, one of Africa’s most 
celebrated problems is the inadequacy of infrastructure. Also, lack of maintenance, management, and 
reconstruction has escalated the degeneration of available physical infrastructure. Based on this, the current 
study is aimed at understudying the state of infrastructure in Africa. The study reviewed archived literature 
on the deficits of infrastructure in Africa and how the deficits have been addressed over time. Findings from 
this study revealed that compared to other countries of the world, African countries lack adequate essential 
infrastructure such as road, rail, water and air transportation, as well as electricity and ICT facilities. 
Furthermore, even the available infrastructure are in a relatively bad state. African governments, 
international organisations, foreign governments, as well as the private sector have consistently invested 
funds to upgrade the state of infrastructure in Africa. However, localisation strategies must be employed in 
the development of African infrastructure in order to ensure that the essential infrastructural needs in Africa 
are being met.

1. Introduction
Infrastructure plays a vital role in every country’s development, both socially and economically (Foster, 2010). Ofori 
(2007) contended that a typical community cannot be sustained without setting up necessary infrastructure such as 
roads, electricity, efficient water supply, and sewage disposal systems. Infrastructure encompasses the physical 
networking properties of urban areas that enable communication and interrelations between cities, regions, and 
countries. It allows for the easy flow of goods while linking and uniting people, irrespective of their backgrounds and 
beliefs (Graham and Marvin, 2001; Larkin, 2008). It is no longer news that Africa trails behind the rest of the 
developed world by a great margin in terms of infrastructural development as well as the standard of its construction 
industry. 
One of the major problems of Africa is the inadequacy of physical infrastructure. Also, lack of maintenance, 
management, and reconstruction has escalated the degeneration of available physical infrastructure (Arewa, 2016). 
Provision of infrastructure has always been a global force behind economic growth and Africa should not be an 
exception. Failure to adequately address this infrastructural deficit will only accelerate the deteriorating living 
standards for slum inhabitants. This will affect general economic growth and as well increasing poverty (Giddings, 
2007). Various factors act as a catalyst for infrastructure deterioration in Africa, namely insufficient funding, lack of 
technical ability and unavailable infrastructure inputs. These infrastructure deficits have a ripple effect on almost every 
area of national development (Arewa, 2016). The poor road network in Africa, for instance, can be directly linked to 
substandard and incomplete infrastructure and construction. Over the years, numerous African governments have 
prioritized modernisation and rebuilding towns into standard interlinked cities, which has greatly influenced Africa 
(Arewa, 2016). Infrastructure development significantly influences the fact that Africa is the fastest urbanising region 
in the world (Foster, 2010).

7. Conclusion 
 
Infrastructure plays a vital role in the socio-economic development of every. Provision of infrastructure has always 
been a global force behind economic growth and Africa should not be an exception. Literature was reviewed on 
infrastructure in Africa and the African construction industry. The literature covered infrastructure, its importance, the 
colonial effects on infrastructure in Africa and to what extent infrastructure is deficient. Findings from this study 
revealed that compared to other countries of the world, African countries lack adequate essential infrastructure such 
as road, rail, water and air transportation, as well as electricity and ICT facilities. Furthermore, even the available 
infrastructure are in a relatively bad state. African governments, international organisations, foreign governments, as 
well as the private sector have consistently invested funds to upgrade the state of infrastructure in Africa. However, 
localisation strategies must be employed in the development of African infrastructure in order to ensure that the 
essential infrastructural needs in Africa are being met.

Abstract 
Projects are set up for specific purposes which are to be achieved within a stipulated time period, but not 
all projects achieve it set objective within the set time. In order for a construction project to be executed 
successfully, a team has to work closely together and implement project goals. All project stakeholders 
including the sponsor and the project implementation team are responsible for the successful completion of 
any project. This study, therefore, seeks to investigate organisational behaviours necessary for successful 
completion of a construction project. The study was conducted in Gauteng Province, South Africa and a 
structured questionnaire was administered to construction professionals. Retrieved questionnaires were 
analysed using the relative importance index. Findings from the study revealed that efficient relationship 
management, proper documentation of progress and effective teamwork are the most important traits 
required from project stakeholders to ensure successful completion of projects. It was, therefore, concluded 
certain behavioural traits must be inherent in project stakeholders and team members for a project to reach 
successful completion.

selection. 
1. Introduction
Construction projects are dynamic and complex in nature as it involves carrying out a fragmented set of activities by 
different project stakeholders and teams (Rahman and Kumaraswamy, 2004). Similarly, Studies like that of Whitley 
(2006) and Meng and Boyd (2017) has established that the construction industry is the largest and most complex 
project-based industry in the world which is characterized with volatile projects. This makes it difficult to measure 
project success in the construction industry. One major problem of project success is the complexity of defining what 
is successful or not. This is because success itself is subjective to individual opinion (Ojiako et al., 2008). In the past, 
construction project success is usually measured by accomplishments against time and budgets (Collier, 2009). More 
recently, success has been described as a function of performance measurement and since individual projects are 
unique to each other, the criteria for measuring performance and success will also vary from one project to another 
(Toor and Ogunlana, 2010). Contractors must, therefore, ensure that the construction project management style and 
procedures are customized to meet individual project dynamics (Müller and Turner, 2007). 
Baccarini, (1999) and Cooke-Davies, (2002) explained that while there are interlinkages between both, project success 
and project management success are two distinct concepts. Project management success has to do with the internal 
efficiency of the project while project success has to do with the external performance (Shenhar et al., 1997). Previous 
studies have emphasized that the success or failure of a construction project can be attributed to the performance; 
personalities; skills; and style of the project leaders. These attributes of construction contractors, subcontractors and 
consultants greatly impact the outcome of a project (Duy, et al., 2004). Furthermore, Ahadzie et al. (2008) classified 
performance of construction project team members into six areas of competences which includes; job knowledge; job 
dedication; task proficiency; experience; cognitive ability; and interpersonal facilitation. 
1656","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

behaviours identified by the study which made up the survey are important to construction project success. This is 
because all behaviours identified in the study returned relative importance indexes above 65%, the indexes ranged 
between 67.60% to 78.20%. According to the results, cordiality in relations, efficient documentation of project 
progress, and effective teamwork are the most important organisation behaviours needed for project success as they 
returned importance indexes of 78.20%, 78.00%, and 76.80% respectively. Also, very important on the list are respect, 
effective communication, as well as capturing and reusing experience gained with importance indexes of 75.8% each. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
Mickan and Rodger (2000) agree with the results of this study by emphasizing the importance of teamwork and how 
valuable it is to any kind of organisation. Also, Tarricane and Luca (2002) listed organisational behaviours pertinent 
to achieving project success to include commitment to the team’s success, maintaining a strong belief in project’s 
goals, interdependence among team members, interpersonal skills, effective communication, constructively criticizing 
team members work, commitment to team processes, leadership and accountability. However, Mohyin, Dainty and 
Carrillo (2009) disagree with these results as its findings revealed that the most important organisational behaviours 
for project success are strong desire to remain part of a project, willingness to make extra efforts and a strong belief 
in a project’s goals. These behaviours ranked lower in the current study. Leung (2014), believes that construction team 
members should have an emotional attachment to a project in order for it to be successful. 
Empirical findings of this study revealed that cordiality in relating with team members in a project is very important 
as this will build up trust among project members and form a sense of familiarity that will be much beneficial during 
group activities. Efficient documentation during the course of a project is also a very good attribute to possess as this 
will ensure that all documents pertaining to the progress of the project can easily be assessed as at when needed. This 
will make the decision-making process more efficient as the evidence of past occurrence in the project are readily 
available. Furthermore, effective teamwork was also identified as a key contributor to construction project success. 
Having a good working relationship with colleagues within the same projects will enhance the brainstorming and 
decision-making process because team members can easily depend on each other. Effective teamwork will also 
enhance the acquisition of new skills from colleagues and personally improve individual efforts towards team success 
as well as the ultimate success of the project. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
As a generally established fact, construction projects are very volatile and complex in nature when compared with 
other kinds of projects. The volatility and complexity of construction projects can easily be attributed to the large 
number of multi-disciplined staffs needed to successfully complete individual projects. Since construction projects 
require a large number of workers, there is a need to examine the personal traits of each worker that will promote 
project success. This study was therefore aimed at investigating the organisational behaviours necessary for successful 
completion of a construction project. The theoretical review discussed how project team members and their 
organisational behaviour can be beneficial or detrimental to the success of a construction project. The empirical 
findings of this research stressed the vitality for an efficient team selection process, in order for a project team to 
effectively work together and achieve project goals. Before a team is selected, the skills and experience possessed by 
possible team members should be evaluated. Each team members’ personality should be evaluated as well. Forming 
a team haphazardly often leads to team destruction and non-realisation of project goals. In selecting construction 
project team members, it is very important to consider the personal qualities of individual prospective member in 
addition to their professional capacity and experience. This will ensure a positive organisational behaviour towards 
the project which will enhance the chances of construction project success.

Abstract   
   
This paper aims to redesign the facilities and workstations of public school canteen in the Philippines by applying the 
principles of Ergonomics. Previous studies have proven that workers in the canteen are exposed to musculoskeletal 
disorders and injuries due poor facility layout and workstation design. Review of related literature states that improper 
arrangement of tables and seats cause congestion and irrational spacing (Ismael, 2011), poor design of physical 
environment such as ventilation, lighting and noise can cause discomfort, annoyance and dissatisfaction (Niu, et al., 
2011), and improper design of workstation wherein repetitive work activities are performed lead to muscle fatigue and 
stress (Sripaiboonkij & Taptakarnporn, 2014). Thus, the researchers aim to assess the current condition of the public 
school canteen in the Philippines in order to determine the risk and exposure of the workers to musculoskeletal 
disorders (MSD) and injuries. The researchers also aim to identify significant factors in the design of canteen that 
affect the discomfort level of workers in terms of the following: personal factor, physical factors and task-related 
factor. Key findings from the study revealed that workers in the canteen experience pain and discomfort in the neck, 
upper back, shoulder, lower back, upper arm, hips/buttocks and lower leg. Similarly, result of rapid entire body 
assessment (REBA) and NIOSH lifting equation proved that workers are exposed to risk of MSD due to their poor 
working posture and repetitive work activities. Risk factors identified in the study were further treated and analyzed 
using regression analysis. The result revealed that factors such height, body-mass index, temperature, lifting posture, 
and work posture significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to MSD. Given these conditions, the researchers 
were able to redesign the facilities and workstation of public school canteen by applying the principles of ergonomics, 
quality function deployment (QFD) and systematic layout planning (SLP) tools.

I. Introduction   
The school canteen is a great place to promote an enjoyment of healthy eating. For students who use the canteen 
regularly, the food purchased makes a significant contribution to their total food intake and nutrition; therefore it makes 
sense to ensure the best food possible is available to enhance their ability to learn and take in the information presented 
to them in class. However, when running a school canteen, schools can face a number of problems that stop them from 
getting the most out of their service. One of the biggest problems that school canteen experience especially in the 
public schools is the lack of space and poor layout design. School canteen especially the kitchen area have usually 
confined space and force workers to stand for a long period of time in almost static motions, causing pain and 
discomfort.   
 
Previous studies and researchers have revealed that workers in school canteen are exposed to risk of occupational 
injuries and musculoskeletal disorders. The study of Niu, et al. (2011) showed that staffs in school canteen suffer from 
long working hours and over loads on hands. They are exposed to improper postures like awkward bending and manual 
lifting. Canteen workers are also exposed to occupational injuries due to working in high surfaces and poor workstation 
design. Workers experience pain and discomfort in the shoulders and upper limbs due to raised position of arms during 
work posture (Pekkarinen, Anttonen & Niskanen, 2015). Repetitive work activities such as cutting, grinding and

Figure 11. Current and Proposed Layout Design of Bagumbong Public School  
  
The proposed layout for Bagumbong canteen is designed in such a way that the preparation area for lunch meal and 
packed meal be located in the same area for easier transaction. This will also provide more space for bookstore and 
drinks station. It is also recommended to transfer the bookstore and drinks station on the other side of the canteen to 
permit easier flow of traffic going in and out of the dining area.  
  
4. Conclusion   
The findings of the study have proven that workers in canteen are exposed to risks of musculoskeletal disorders and 
injuries due to poor facility and workstation design. The risk was evident on the scores generated by RULA and NIOSH 
computed from their body postures while performing tasks. Based on the result of CMDQ, majority of the respondents’ 
experience pain on their neck, upper back, shoulders, lower back, hips/buttocks, upper arm and lower leg. Several risk 
factors were considered in the study based on review of related literature, direct observation and interview from the 
people involved in the tasks. Factors considered are the following (1) personal factor: age, gender, height, weight, 
BMI, (2) environmental factor: temperature, illumination, noise, (3) task-related factors: rest period, work duration, 
work posture and lifting posture. These factors were analyzed and treated using regression analysis. The result revealed 
that factors such height, body-mass index, temperature, lifting posture, and work posture significantly affect the risk 
and exposure of workers to MSD. Given these conditions, the researchers were able to redesign the facilities and 
workstation of public school canteen by applying the principles of ergonomics, quality function deployment (QFD) 
and systematic layout planning (SLP) tools.

Abstract   
   
This paper aims to assess the biomechanical risks involved in the lifting tasks of workers in the logistics industry in 
the Philippines. Previous studies have proved that workers in the logistics industry are exposed to occupational risks 
of developing musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and injuries due to the nature of their job. Workers in the logistics 
industry commonly employ heavy manual tasks that involve lifting, pulling and pushing; that can become hazardous 
and could cause significant and even irreversible injuries and disorders. Based on studies, several factors can contribute 
to the risks of workers such as repetitive movement, sustained force, awkward posture and weight of object being 
lifted to name a few. According to OSHA, the best and most effective way to eliminate or minimize the risk of MSD 
and injuries is to consider manual task hazards and risk during the design and planning stage of a workplace or a job. 
During this stage, hazards and risks can be eliminated before they are introduced into a workplace. Given these 
conditions, the authors intend to identify significant factors that contribute to the occupational risks of workers while 
performing lifting task in order to develop a mitigation plan that will help eliminate MSD and injuries of the workers. 
Key findings from the study revealed that workers experience MSD and injury in their lower back, upper back, 
hips/thigh, shoulder and wrist. Similarly, result of rapid entire body assessment (REBA) and NIOSH lifting equation 
proved that workers are exposed to high risk of MSD due to their poor working posture and repetitive work activities. 
Risk factors identified in the study were further treated and analyzed using correlation and regression analysis. The 
result revealed that factors such age, body-mass index, frequency of lift, weight lifted, lifting posture and duration of 
lifts significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to work injury and musculoskeletal disorders with coefficient 
of correlation (R) values of 0.812 and 0.832 respectively. The identified factors serve as the basis for the researchers 
to develop risk mitigation plan to minimize the MSD and injuries experienced by workers.

I. Introduction   
  
Logistics can be defined as the management of the flow of goods, information and other resources, energy and people 
between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet the requirements of consumers. Logistics 
involve the process of manual material handling, manual packing and other various activities that needed manpower 
or strength that may cause physical stress for a long period of time and repetition of task that may involve accidents 
such as musculoskeletal disorder, fatigue, injuries, and other respiratory diseases (www.osha.com.)  
  
Previous studies have revealed that musculoskeletal disorders are most prevalent occupational health problems 
affecting manual workers (Stattin & Jarvholm, 2005). In the Philippines, there are 125,974 reported cases of MSDs in 
establishments employing 20 or more workers (PSA, 2015). The work related MSD escalated during the two-year 
period (2013-2015), accounting to 58.5% of all injuries and illness cases for all industries. It was also reported that 1 
out of every 3 occupational diseases recorded were back pains (32.8%). Back pain is the highest in industries involving 
manual labor such as in logistics industry.

4. Conclusion   
The findings of the study have proven that workers in logistics industry are exposed to risks of musculoskeletal 
disorders and injuries due to heavy exposure to manual material handling and lifting tasks. The risk was evident on 
the scores generated by REBA and NIOSH computed from their body postures while performing tasks. Based on the 
result of NMQ, majority of the respondents experienced pain in their lower back, upper back, hips/thigh, shoulder and 
wrist. Several risk factors were considered in the study based on review of related literature, direct observation and 
interview from the people involved in the tasks. It was determined using statistical analysis that risk factors contributed 
to the MSDs and injuries of workers are age, body-mass index, frequency of lift, weight lifted, lifting posture and 
duration of lifts significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to MSD and work injury. The identified factors 
serve as the basis for the researchers to develop proper manual material handling technique and lifting technique to 
minimize the MSD and injuries experienced by workers.

Abstract  
This study aims to determine the significant factors that affect the mental fatigue of construction workers 
in the Philippines. Studies revealed that workers in the construction site routinely exceed generally accepted 
physiological thresholds for manual work leading to fatigue. They typically carry out highly demanding 
physical tasks with various types of stresses resulted from awkward posture, excessive force demands, 
repetitive actions and excessive energy expenditure. Due to this labor-intensive nature of construction work, 
many construction workers face excessive demands beyond their physical capabilities. Thus, they are prone 
to be exposed to significantly high level of mental fatigue as well as other safety risks. This study aims to 
focus on the physiological measures of energy expenditure of workers leading to fatigue. Factors that were 
considered in the study are activity metabolic rate, heart rate, age, and body mass index. To objectively 
measure the mental fatigue experienced by the construction workers during the whole 8-hour shift, the 
Deary Liewald reaction time software was used. Statistical analysis is also employed to determine the 
significant differences in the factors identified among the 5 construction trades such as labor, mason, 
carpentry, steal work and plumbing using ANOVA. Correlation analysis is also used to identify relationship 
of factors to the fatigue level of construction workers. Results of the study revealed that all factors 
considered in the study have significant relationship to the fatigue experienced by workers among the 5 
construction trades. And in order to develop measures to minimize mental fatigue level of workers, a 
suitable work-rest schedule is designed through the application of Monte Carlo simulation model having 
9,125 runs, which generated a year worth of data for the 25 construction workers.

1. Introduction
Due to the rise of construction industry, the number of employees in the workforce also accelerates. Over the forecast 
period for years 2016 to 2020, the pace of global construction industry will accelerate to an annual average of 3.4%, 
with the industry reaching a value of US$10.0 trillion in 2020. In the United States alone, approximately 10.3 million 
people are part of the construction workforce in 2016 (Ahmed & Rahman, 2015; Statistics Portal, 2018). The 
construction industries in the Middle East and Africa region are predicted to be the fastest growing in 2016-2020, 
overtaking the Asia-Pacific region, which held the top spot in 2011-2015. However, Asia-Pacific's share of the global 
construction industry will continue to rise, reaching close to 49% in 2020, up from 40% in 2010 (Market Reports 
Store, 2015). As one of the largest industries in the world, the construction workers are exposed to harsh and dangerous 
situations, which lead to poor judgment, poor quality of work, and reduction in productivity, and increased risk of 
accidents (Ahmed & Rahman, 2015; Cheng et al., 2012). Construction workers either work only on short contracts or 
at a construction site for a limited period, which leads to unfamiliarity with the workplace thus enhancing the risk of 
injury (Chang, F.L., 2007). They typically carry out highly demanding physical tasks with various types of stresses

Therefore, in order to consider all age groups in the industry—especially that there are still a lot of construction 
workers whom are in the eldest age group—the researchers chose 20 minutes for the rest period for both morning and 
afternoon and the MAWD used will be 120 minutes.

The figure above illustrates the Work-Rest duration in between the lunch break. The work duration runs for 120 
minutes. The worker is then given the chance to replenish for 20 minutes and regain his optimal MAWD by 84%. The 
worker then proceeds to finish the first shift of his task then rest for 60 minutes during lunch break. The worker repeats 
the same work-rest schedule for the afternoon.   
  
4. Conclusion  
  
The findings of the study have revealed that workers in the construction site routinely exceed generally accepted 
physiological thresholds for manual work leading to fatigue. This was evident on the factors gathered from the 
respondents such as their activity metabolic rate, heart rate, age and body mass index. Results of statistical analyses 
such as correlation and regression model proved that the factors considered in the study have significant effect to the 
mental fatigue of the workers as measured in the reaction time of the respondents using the SRT and CRT tests.  
Considering results of this study, the researchers were able to design an optimal work-rest schedule for the construction 
workers using Monte Carlo simulation. Through this method, the researchers were able to determine the maximum 
allowable work duration for the workers and compute the optimal rest period to lessen the mental fatigue experienced 
by workers in different construction trades.

Abstract 
Assuring quality of test results is very vital, although this study only covered minimum of three ways of 
assuring the validity of results but is was evident that these methods can be used as basic approach of 
assuring quality of results.  
1. Introduction
Laboratory services are an essential component of water quality delivery. They can be utilized effectively at every
level of the water quality system, including water treatment and point of compliance testing. Quality laboratory results
are required to support water treatment plant optimisation, rationalize and monitor treatment, for chemical balance
and dosage purposes.
Provision of valid and credible results is very crucial to the laboratory since failing to provide analytical services does
not only impact water treatment plants however; it also impacts the end user (consumers at home) as the water
treatment or purification requires laboratory results for treatments plants to be optimised. This also put accreditation
in question since one of ISO/IEC 17025:2017 requirements are to produce valid and credible results timeously as well
as meeting customer needs.
According to Angmo et al. (2015), Testing Laboratories are employed by all types of businesses to contribute objective 
analytical data on the quality of a process or a product. The purpose of establishing laboratory quality standards is to
ensure the accuracy of test results, increase the confidence of customers, stakeholders, and communities in the value
of provision of essential services such as Water. All laboratory activities may be subject to errors, and studies have
shown that errors in the laboratory can occur in all the phases of testing. Nkengsong et al. (2016).
Currently the WTL is struggling to achieve credible and valid test results for Nitrate method. There is an inconsistency 
of Nitrate levels in water tested which makes it difficult to make decisions for plant optimisation.  Nitrate test method

CONCLUSION
The results obtained from PT are also an evident that proper method validation as well as implementation of QCs
yields positive results. Implementation of Method validation, QCs and PT has assisted the laboratory to be able
to asses Nitrate test method through PT outliers, QC breaches and method validation results, since then; there
have been no uncertainty and inconsistency on Nitrate test results which had increased customer satisfaction and
the level of confidence in the results we produce.
This study did not help the laboratory to assure quality of Nitrate results however; the laboratory also benefited
from monitoring the accuracy and precision of a method, encourage collaboration between laboratories through
PT and demonstrated technical competence against third parties
5. RECOMMENDATIONS
After the study, the following recommendations were made: 
•
To apply all the techniques, use on this study in all test methods
•
To periodically re-validate test methods
•
To periodically review QC limits by calculating using historic data
•
To implement other ways of assuring quality of test results as this study only covered basic techniques

Abstract 
Every year the production of textbooks continues as it is constantly demanded, especially by students. Every year the 
number of secondhand textbooks continue to increase. It contributes to the solid waste in the Philippines. The 
production and disposal of textbooks contribute to many impacts in the environment through global warming, 
acidification, and the likes. This study aims to contribute to the waste minimization through designing a life cycle 
assessment – based recirculation system for secondhand textbooks. This research incorporated reverse logistics with 
life cycle assessment to confirm that the design of the system is efficient regarding the impacts to the environment 
and human health. A survey was done with 404 respondents of various occupations. ANOVA was used to determine 
the significant relationship on the drivers of book recirculation and life cycle assessment - based practices with the 
sustainability performance of secondhand textbook recirculation system. In the design of reverse logistics, Analytic 
Hierarchy Process was used to determine the best collection method. The design was developed and assessed through 
life cycle assessment. The design of the life cycle assessment – based recirculation system for secondhand textbooks 
was concluded to be an efficient process considering the impacts to the environment and human health.

1. Introduction
In the recent years, a considerable increase in the purchase of electronic books (e-books) by academic libraries was 
seen (Hanz et al., 2017).  The global e-book market is the fastest growing submarket in the worldwide book publishing 
industry (ReportsnReports, 2014).  E-books made a major effect on bookstores sales (Flores et al., 2014) and library 
users preferred books in digital format (Rao, 2016).  Thus, electronic publications will be dominant, and therefore 
paper books will not be used a lot (Wilders, 2017).  Due to the preference of e-books over paper books, in due time, 
the latter will be left to waste. 
In the Philippines, paper books are still produced and are preferred over e-books (Flores et al., 2014). The published 
books in the Philippines increases yearly with highest demands on academic textbooks (Flores et al., 2014).  According 
to the Department of Education (DepEd), the number of textbooks required equates to the number of learners enrolled. 
In public schools, textbooks are usually reused for the next academic year.  The effectiveness of the adaptation of the 
prescribed textbooks both in public and private schools shall be in a span 6 (six) years according to D.O. 36 s.1990.  
This will maximize the use of the textbook besides being economical to the parents (Buhain, 2005).  Obviously, due 
to the huge number of books being published annually, it is inevitable for it to be discarded as waste (Hickey, 2012).  
According to the National Solid Waste Management Status Report of the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR), a significant 8.70% of paper and cardboard waste, in which books are classified into (Hickey, 
2012), contributes to the country’s composition of Solid Waste. 
According to The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), books can’t usually be recycled along with other 
paper recycling because of the glue and adhesive used to bind them.  Instead, there are many possibilities for reusing,

The factors that will drive the recirculation of secondhand textbooks were determined, the LCA-based recirculation 
system for secondhand textbooks was designed. This is the third objective of the study. It connects to the first and 
second objective by studying first the existing practices of handling secondhand textbooks and determining the factors 
that will drive further.  
 
Since the focus of this study is the end usage of textbooks, therefore classified as secondhand. Reverse logistics is a 
useful tool in the design since it involves collection, classification of secondhand textbooks, and disposition – the 
decision stage in determining if the textbook would be recirculated or disposed. The focus of this study is on the 
recirculation. The design was run through a life cycle assessment. This was compared to the standard process of 
textbooks – from production, distribution, and disposal. In the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), the method used 
was TRACI. This identified the impacts specifically (1) Global warming, (2) Acidification, (3) Ozone depletion, (4) 
Photochemical smog, (5) Eutrophication, (6) Ecotoxicity, (7) Human health particulate, (8) Human toxicity, cancer, 
(9) Human toxicity, non-cancer. 
 
The result was in favor of the designed recirculation system for secondhand textbooks in the Philippines. It has only 
a higher value in the Human health particulate impact, due to the additional transportation and electricity usage. 
However, in a futuristic view, this impact can be compensated since the textbook will be recirculated and eventually 
will reduce the production of new textbooks which has greater impact in the environment and human health. 
 
The objectives of this study were met. To answer the research question “Is a life-cycle approach in the development 
of a sustainable system for the recirculation of secondhand textbooks possible to be implemented in the Philippines?” 
– it is possible to be implemented in the Philippines, with the support of the government, students, librarians, teachers, 
parents, and other green organizations. The expected outcome of this study as shown in figure 6, is met. With existing 
policies especially, the Philippine Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (RA 9003) that needs to be strictly 
implemented, the support of the government and private sectors, this study of the LCA – based approach in the 
development of a recirculation system for secondhand textbooks in the Philippines will have an impact to ecological 
sustainability.

Abstract 
 
Manufacturing firecracker is one of the most hazardous field in manufacturing yet, in Philippines, prevention and 
mitigation programs provided for manufacturing firecrackers are limited and outdated. Hence, this study focused on 
the welfare of the factory workers. The study also provided general prevention and mitigation programs for 
manufacturing firecrackers. These prevention and mitigation programs resulted to a 56.15% RPN reduction. The 
reduction was achieved through the Identify, Analyze, Assess, Prevention and Mitigation phases. In the results, 
management, physical, and operation needed to be prioritized. And under these major risk factors were sub factors 
that lacks in most of the company. For management, these are provision of personal protective equipment, provision 
of safety training, proper labeling of equipment, provision of orientation before start of work, and safety officer in the 
factory. For physical, floor and wall condition (good), appropriate lighting, and proper ventilations. For operation, 
appropriate distance between processes, correct drying time, and lastly appropriate chairs and tables. The four general 
risks were assessed and given different risk responses. For accidents, control. For explosion or fire, mitigate. For both 
health issue and environmental issue, accept. And to prevent and mitigate the risks, different hazard controls were 
used, such as engineering controls, work practices, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment.

1. Introduction 
 
Fireworks industry is one of the most hazardous industries. As the said industry involves a lot risks in using and 
making fireworks. These risks can be avoided through appropriate safety measures. However, most safety measures 
used in most companies in Bulacan are quite limited and outdated. A good number of these safety measures are 
considered reactive, instead of proactive. Reactive measures are used after an incident or accident has happened, while 
the proactive measures are used before an incident or accident happen. A reactive measure is one of the evidence that 
workers’ welfare is being ignored. Hence, this study focused on worker’s welfare. 
 
The conceptual framework used in this study was to determine the significant factors that affect worker’s welfare and 
to determine the relationship of these factors to work environment, safety, and health. To properly develop risk 
management plan, the researcher identified risk factors associated to work environment, safety, and health. The main 
risk factors are physical factors, management-related factors, workers-related factors, and operational-related factors. 
Physical factors are considered environmental factors such as temperature, lighting, etc. Management-related factors 
are the factors that fall under the responsibility of the management, such as the maintenance of the building, 
implementation of policies, etc. Worker-related factors are factors that can be confused with management-related 
factors. But worker-related factors are the factors that affect knowledge and capabilities of workers. For example, 
there are policies in the company. But the policies are not known to everyone. In that case, it can be confused with 
worker and management-related factors because it is both the responsibility of the management and worker to 
implement policies and know the policies. Implementing would be under management-related factor, and knowing 
would be under worker-related factor. Lastly, the operation-related factor is the factors that are found mainly in

of the four factors were considered as a factor that helps in making the factory safe. The only factor that did not really 
need to be given attention was the worker factor. Because according to the workers and owners, most of the workers 
were knowledgeable enough. The workers knew the roundabout in making firecrackers, being knowledgeable enough 
reduces risks in the factory.

Not all risk scores with same value have the same risk responses. Likelihood and severity must be taken into account. 
There are cases that same risk scores, but different risk responses. Risk responses must be given carefully, to optimize 
and to avoid unnecessary expenses. Application of the mitigation and prevention programs would give a reduction of 
89.21% in RPN.

Abstract 
In the Philippines, the healthcare delivery system has been described as somewhat operationally inefficient as it is 
consisting of government and private health, diagnostic, and treatment facilities spread unevenly across the 
archipelago. Thus, the objective of this study is to (1) assess the current basis of DOH and other regulatory agencies 
in building/expanding health facilities, (2) know the factors that have significant effect in the decision-making and (3) 
develop an integrated decision-making model that will make use of forecasting, simulation and optimization modeling 
approaches. The study proposed an integrated decision-making model that consists of three major categories to 
consider: volume drivers, health resources parameters and health facility requirements based on reviewed documents 
and articles. This model was developed to aid in decision- and policy-making related to health infrastructures. 
Keywords 
Healthcare Delivery System, Integrated Model 
1. Introduction
Healthcare service is a patient-oriented service that requires continuous interaction with customers and utilizes a large 
volume of nursing care (Mardiah & Basri, 2013). In this sector, it has been increasingly vital for healthcare 
administrators to understand what kind of facility, equipment, and workforce decisions are critical to achieve the 
commonly acknowledged goal of providing quality health service within an accessible location at a reasonable cost 
(Ling et al., 2002). Evidently, the healthcare environment received much attention in the research world in the past 
decades (Chen & Lin, 2017). Several of the researches that have been studied were about nurse and surgeon scheduling 
problems (Legrain et al., 2015; Chow et al., 2011), patient appointment system problems (Klassen et al., 2009; Granja 
et al., 2014), medical resource planning and reallocation problems (Tai et al., 2013), hospital capacity problems 
(Kokangul, 2008), emergency medical service problems (Ajmi et al., 2015; Chi et al., 2008), hospital location-
allocation problems (Mestre et al., 2014) and hospital collaboration problems (Chen et al., 2013). In most of these 
studies, there have been fruitful efforts in developing solutions to these problems that made use of demand forecasting, 
simulation and optimization modeling approaches. However, studies regarding the use of these modeling approaches 
are not widely known and limited in the Philippine setting. 
In a news article retrieved from The Manila Times (2018), the Philippine health system has rapidly evolved with many 
challenges through time. Additionally, the article mentioned that the fundamental goal of the Philippines’ government 
in the health system is improving the access of health services for every Filipino. The Department of Health (DOH, 
2011) has instituted various reforms and policies to come up with an arrangement that serves best to the country’s 
population with effective, efficient, fair distributions of resources and funds for organized infrastructure to flourish 
well (Kumar, 2017). Unfortunately, there is also a dearth of studies that developed a model to examine the healthcare 
system in the said country. 
In a study carried out by Lavado et al. (2010), the Philippine Healthcare Delivery System has, in general, been 
characterized as somewhat operationally inefficient as it is consisting of government and private health, diagnostic, 
and treatment facilities spread unevenly across the archipelago. His findings showed that the hospitals with higher 
service capabilities are highly concentrated in urban areas such as Metro Manila and other nearby cities. Due to this 
distribution, a huge human reservoir for health is also highly concentrated in the same urban areas (DOH, 2008). The

The volume drivers are categorized into geographic, market and economy, and social factors. These external factors 
influence the movement of the health resources and patients in a certain health facility. The geographic factors are 
proximities, access to roads, adequate means of transportation, route restrictions, climate state, geopolitical restrictions, 
soil conditions and drainage. These factors will be used to determine the strategic location where a health facility 
should be situated. While the market and economic factors comprise of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); total health 
expenditure, revenue and income growth rate; inflation rate, health sector employment rate, total fertility rate and 
mortality rate. These factors will be involved in the assessment of the current situation and movement of resources up 
to its utilization in the healthcare operations. Lastly, the social factors consist of population density, age group 
distribution, sex profile, marital status, religion and spiritual values, ethnic and cultural group, type of illnesses and 
severity of illnesses. Patients are greatly affected be these factors since it describe their behaviors and needs for a 
facility. 
 
The health resources parameters are categorized seven as they have different data types: hospital bed, medicines, 
medical equipment, medical goods, support, health workers and functional workers. Future researchers of this study 
can consider the following for each sub-category: for the bed – ease of use and maintenance, utilization and delivery 
time, for the medicines – quality, relative efficacy and safety;  cost, for the equipment – utilization and cost, and for 
the medical goods – stability under anticipated conditions of storage and use; ease of use and maintenance; cost. For 
the health facility’s support, these are found to be essential – laundry and housekeeping, dietary services, maintenance 
and engineering, and mortuary. The purpose of these parameters is to know whether a certain number of patients can 
be accommodated in a certain health facility at a time given certain constraints. 
 
Finally, the health facility requirements which are usually predetermined by governing authorities or bodies – in the 
form of a policy, a standard code of conduct, a bill or a law. It comprise of the basic document and information, 
operational policy, site utilization, circulation, physical growth of health facilities, financial aspects and building shape. 
These requirements are essential to all the stages of the study as it will influence in if the operations will run smoothly 
in the short- and long-term. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The researcher reviewed related documents and materials from the Department of Health (DOH)’s official website. 
Relevant guidelines in building health facilities provided by the DOH can be found in the AO 29 series of 2006 
(Guidelines for Rationalizing the Health Care Delivery System based on Health Needs) and AO 4-A and 4-B of 2006 
(Guidelines for the Issuance of Certificate of Need to Establish a New Hospital). This applies to both government and 
private health facilities. The Certificate of Need (CON) takes into account the proposed health facility’s catchment 
population, location and the LGUs’ commitment to the funding and maintenance the health facility. In addition, 
utilization rate, number of staff and bed-to-population ratio are considered. Each CON is evaluated in the context of 
the rationalization plan. With this information, the researcher thought of considering other factors that secondary 
sources have taken into account. Several of the factors and sub-factors were from a World Health Organization 
(WHO)’s Regional Publications on health facilities’ guidelines for development and operations (1998). It was then 
evaluated using a survey instrument with a 5-point Likert scale to determine its importance to the subject of the study. 
Statistical tests were done to reduce the pool of data and attain only the significant ones as shown and grouped in 
Figure 4. The integrated model can be used, not just for policy-making, but also in strategically planning where to 
build future health infrastructures with specific configurations in a city/province. 
 
Future studies can be done through the integrated decision-making model since this study’s aim is just to consolidate 
all the factors that could be useful inputs in the model. Other researchers can continue the research by pinpointing 
which is the best forecasting, simulation and optimization modeling approaches that can be applied to each stage/phase. 
Furthermore, other fields can also consider creating software or a system that can handle such big data and incorporate 
the modeling approaches as its logical flow.

Abstract 
This paper examines the boundaries of project controls throughout the project life-cycle on construction projects. The 
researcher evaluates the factors contributing to the success and failures of projects, as well as identifies what project 
control mechanisms are currently being used in the construction industry to control projects throughout the project 
life-cycle. The details of the study reveal that although efforts have been made to control projects in various aspects 
of the construction project life-cycle, however these control mechanisms seem to be mis-jointed and scattered amongst 
construction professionals, and do not effectively work to address project controls, but only take effect after issues 
appear in a project. With the absence of a clearly defined structure to adopt project control mechanisms throughout 
the project life-cycle, this poses a clear gap in research towards improving construction project performance that 
satisfies the key stakeholders of the project. Thus, this paper proposes the development of a smart project controls 
framework model that would facilitate effective control of the activities identified throughout the project life-cycle, 
whereby the role of project controls becomes well defined within each stage of the project to ensure more sustainable 
project outcomes. 
Keywords 
project controls, smart projects, project planning, project controls system and project controls mechanism. 
1. Introduction
The construction industry plays an important role in the infrastructure of countries with high interest in both 
government and private sectors related to the development of health, transport, education and other initiatives (HHI, 
2018). Furthermore, it plays a wider role in reaching out to address issues such as driving economic growth, 
employment, social, climate as well as energy challenges (WEF, n.d). Thus, it is not without reason that the 
construction industry represents one of the most complex and dynamic environments (Abdul-Rahman et. al, 2009). It 
is therefore crucial that construction projects complete successfully, since constant change could increase uncertainties 
in the aforementioned issues which could impact on the development of initiatives (El-Sokhn & Othman, 2014). By 
adopting and developing appropriate strategies to decrease the uncertainties of facing unprecedented changes, 
construction companies should achieve the highest success percentage in their projects (Jari & Bhangale, 2013). It has 
been proved through various studies that ‘success factors are based on good project control practices, which result in 
improved cost and schedule outcomes,’ (Mackenzie, 2009). For example, in 1999, a study revealed that cost 
improvements of 10% were made as well as improvements in the project schedule due to the presence of dedicated 
project controls  systems. In addition, another study carried out in 2000 showed that the project schedule which had 
slipped, was reduced by 15% due to effective Project Control mechanisms. Moreover, a number of articles have been 
published which show how project controls play an important role in achieving a project’s overall objectives. 
However, despite such improvements, Spire Consulting Group (n.d) explain that there is still a lack of tilisation of 
project controls in the construction industry, regardless of the continuous evolution of the field of project management. 
Since the construction industry is one of the top industries which suffers from commercial issues such as cash flow 
and cost overruns, time delays and poor quality control (Abdul-Rahman et. al, 2009), effective intervention of project 
controls practices could help improve project performance. Since every successful construction project begins with 
careful planning (Spire Consulting Group, n.d), Shtub, Bard & Globerson (2005) explain that this can only be achieved 
through an ‘effective schedule control methodology’. Thus, a project controls system is essential to help monitor work 
and determine if everything is proceeding as planned.

3. Summary & Conclusions (Gap)  
Taking the above into consideration, little literature reveals details of where project controls lies within the project 
life-cycle, which could assumes that project controls is simply applied to monitor and control specific aspects of a 
project,  and thus there seems to be no real evidence amongst literature if project control activities do stand as defined 
valuable inputs amongst projects in the construction industry, although studies suggest many benefits and effects of 
project controls outcomes on project success.  
Thus it is necessary to point out the significance of project controls not just controlling specific aspects of a project, 
but rather needs to be present in all aspects of the project life-cycle and if attention is given in this aspect, particularly 
in the initial stages of a project, then there is a higher chance of project success rates. Furthermore, there are critical 
factors which determine project success and failures, although success and failure factors may be relative in view of 
the key stakeholders to a project. However, project controls could play an integral part in controlling various aspects 
of the critical factors for success on projects. Although there are project control mechanisms and tools in place which 
are used heavily in Project Management and controls, however there are drawbacks which could hint why projects are 
not as successful as they are. Therefore, there needs to be ‘Smarter’ or ‘leaner’ ways of controlling projects, with 
project controls being required in each aspect of the lifecycle through planning, monitoring and control of each aspect.  
Thus, this paper aims to carry out further research in order to develop a decision-based model and framework, which 
would seek to identify which project controls tools and mechanisms are required and their associated timing in each 
step of the project life-cycle to assist in contributing to project success.

Performance of Two-Component Systems with 
Imperfect Repair

Abstract 
Mechanical systems degrade over time and ultimately fail. Failed components of the system are 
either replaced or repaired, non-repairable components are usually inexpensive, and it is often more cost-
effective to replace.  This paper examines the behavior of two component repairable systems. The main 
objective is to determine the system’s performance of three configurations with identical components; 
namely series, parallel, and cold standby. Closed form analytical expressions for steady state availability 
are derived and their behavior is illustrated by an example.  
Keywords: repairable; series; parallel; standby. 
1. Introduction
Repair actions are performed on failed systems in order to function properly. There are many types 
of repair, perfect repair where the failed system becomes as good as new after each repair, minimal repair 
which brings the system to its status just before failure, and imperfect repair, where the repaired system 
becomes inferior after each repair.  The latter is considered in this work, it has been researched by many 
specialists  
Oliveira et al. (2005) developed a method for reliability analysis of systems of components whose 
failure rates may be time-dependent. One special case of such systems is the one whose components are 
under aging. The hypothesis of minimum repair is adequate in many cases, especially in heavy industries, 
such as the nuclear industry. The method employs the technique of supplementary variables to transform 
the models of the non-Markovian systems into Markovian ones. The Laplace transform technique was used 
in order to reduce the number of equations, which are then solved by numerical methods. The inverse 
Laplace transforms to obtain the final solution of the set of differential equations is also utilized by using 
the Gauss–Legendre quadrature method which is very fast. Applications to safety systems, like the 
auxiliary feed water system of a typical PWR plant showed that the method is very fast and accurate as 
compared to other simulation methods. 
Dohi et al. (2003), studied a simple repair-time limit replacement problem with imperfect repair, 
and focused on the problem of determining the optimal repair-time limit which minimizes the expected cost 
per unit time in the steady-state. Applying the Lorenz transform, they developed a nonparametric method to 
estimate the optimal repair-time limit from the empirical repair-time data. Numerical examples are used for 
calculating the optimal policy and to examine the asymptotic properties of the estimator. In this paper, three 
two-component systems were examined i.e., series configuration, standby configuration, and parallel 
configuration. The article by Doyen & Gaudoin (2004) proposed two new classes of imperfect repair 
models. It was assumed that the conditional failure intensity before the first repair is a continuous function 
of time. In the first class of models, the repair effect is expressed by the reduction of failure intensity. In the 
second class, the repair effect is expressed by a reduction of the system virtual age.  In each case, several 
particular cases are studied, which take into account the possibility of a Markovian memory property. For 
almost every model studied, there exists minimal wear intensity, i.e. a maximal lower bound for failure 
intensity.  Sheu et al. (2006) studied three maintenance policies, preventive maintenance, and failed 
maintenance for a repairable system with the objective of maximizing the availability of the system.  In 
their paper, Ke & Chu (2007) examined a one component operating and one standby and one repair facility.

Using the values of the failure rates and repair rates for the different runs, the long term 
operational probabilities for the various configurations are calculated in Table 1 by utilizing the expressions 
in equations (5), (12), and (18), respectively. Table 2 shows the operational probabilities for different 
number of repairs. 
 
Table 1. The failure and repair rates for the different runs 
 
 
     It can be observed from Table 2 below that the standby configuration has the highest long term 
Operational probability in all cases and the series system has the lowest. In addition, the long term 
operational probability decreases as the number of repairs increases. Moreover, it is not significantly 
different for the various configurations when the system is new (0 repair), and after it becomes very old.  
The lower the failure rate, and the higher the repair rate the better the system’s performance. In fact, as we 
examine the operational probability of the different runs, it can be deduced that the operational probability 
is positively correlated with the ratio of the repair rate to the failure rate (μi/λi). 
 
Table 2. The long term operational probability for the various configurations vs. 
 the number of imperfect repairs allowed before replacement 
 
4. Conclusions and Future Research 
 
          As it has been shown, the closed form expressions for the steady state operational probability 
becomes more complicated as the number of repairs increases.  In addition, the analytical derivation of the 
operational probability is easier for the series system than the standby system, while it is very tedious for 
the parallel configuration.  The derived expressions for the steady state operational probability are generic 
in nature; they could be used for the perfect repair case under certain assumptions.  Moreover, if other than 
the exponential distribution is assumed for the failure and repair rates, measuring the performance 
analytically becomes extremely difficult and tedious. Future works should examine systems with more than 
two-component with non-identical components, more than one repair channel, more complex 
configurations, and non exponential distributions.

Abstract 
This work aims to economically evaluate centralized and decentralized Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) 
for a metropolitan city. For the same, centralized and decentralized wastewater treatments for a catchment 
area in Sharjah city (United Arab Emirates) were evaluated by Net Present Value (NPV) method. Three 
options meeting local government regulations were considered for the catchment. Options 1 and 2 were 
centralized, and Option 3 was decentralized. Option 1 was about connecting the catchment to the existing 
centralized STP location, Option 2 to connect the catchment to the new proposed location which may be 
situated at the lowest point around the catchment area, and Option 3 involved constructing three 
decentralized STPs. The results showed that Option 3 had the lowest NPV of costs including CAPEX and 
OPEX for 25 years. There was a saving in Option 3 of around 44% compared to Option 1, and 23% 
compared to Option 2. This finding is useful for engineering managers for infrastructure planning for a 
metropolitan city like Sharjah city.

1. Introduction
One of the measures of any country’s development is its infrastructure, which includes urban drainage. Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP) is the main solution for improving the urban drainage (Pasqualino et al. 2009), which 
contributes strongly in removing harmful substances from wastewater for consumers with the purpose of avoiding 
unhygienic situations (Kärrman, 2001). Complementary sewage system consists of the Sewer Network, Lift Station, 
Pump Station, Rising Main, Sewage Treatment Plant, and Treated Effluent system (Yousif Sani, 2017). The sewer 
network is the network that collects the wastewater from the building to the lowest point by gravity as much as can 
while the lift station pumps the wastewater from the network to the main pump station. The pump station pumps the 
wastewater to the STP through the rising main pipe line.  Treated Effluent system is the system consists of the network 
and pump stations to distribute or discharge the treated wastewater effluent from the STP.

Since this project is a service project, this means there is no cash-in or revenues. The lowest NPV of the investment 
costs will be the most appropriate option. It has been assumed that the OPEX value is constant for the analysis period, 
and it will be dealt with as O&M service cost that will include operation and maintenance costs for both material and 
labor charges with conducting recommended preventive and overhaul maintenance.  
 
Table 6 shows the Net Present Values for options 1 to 3. It is clear from Table 5 that Option 3 is the most cost-effective 
alternative. Option 3 results in an expected saving of around 44% over Option 1 and 23% over Option 2.

4. Conclusion 
This work was aimed to evaluate the centralized and decentralized STP in a metropolitan city like Sharjah city taking 
into consideration the local government requirements. The result showed that option 3 which is the decentralized 
system has the lowest NPV of the CAPEX and OPEX costs for 25 years. In option 3, it is supposed to construct three 
STPs, the first STP for zone 1 to zone 10 with a capacity of 15,630.2 m3/d, for zone 11 the capacity is 537.3 m3/d and 
for zone 12 the capacity is 1,731.2 m3/d. This option shows how the pump station and rising main in options 1 and 2 
occupy great amount of investment resulting in saving around 44% from Option 1 and 23% from Option 2. This study 
shows the importance of evaluation of different alternatives in infrastructure planning. It is expected that the result 
from the Sharjah Sewage Infrastructure will open door for further research in UAE and similar metropolitan cities 
around the world. Recommendation for future research is to include treated effluent system to be a complimentary 
system in evaluating the costs.

Abstract 
Scheduling began to be taken seriously in manufacturing industry at the beginning of 20th century with the work of 
Henry Gantt and other pioneers. Manufacturing industries have to meet shipping dates that have been committed to 
customers, as failure to do so may result in a significant loss of goodwill. Hence, they have to schedule the activities 
in such a way as to use the resources available in an efficient manner. Among various manufacturing industries, 
semiconductor manufacturing industry is an extensive and highly competitive industry mainly due to the fact that both 
price and product-life for new electronics products are decreasing exponentially over time along with rapid 
technological advancements. In such kind of industries, the capability of meeting due-date along with the reduction 
of cycle time is the most decisive factor of the fierce competition in the global market place. Hence, scheduling 
research remains among the most important tasks that must be performed routinely in SM industry.  
Further, among various stages of SM, wafer fabrications are the most technologically complex process and challenging 
industrial environments in use today. The diffusion operation, carried out on batch processing machine, heavily 
impacts the production rate of wafer fabrication and in turn the SM industry. This is due to the fact that, diffusion 
operation requires relatively longest processing time among all the operations in the wafer fabrication. Hence, there 
is a rich amount of research studies available in scheduling of diffusion furnace (DF) since 1991 (i) to improve the 
due-date compliance, (ii) for significant reduction in the overall production time due to their longer processing time 
compared to other operations in the SM, and (iii) to effectively utilize the expensive resource. At the same time, the 
new researchers are struggle hard to get the relevant research studies. Therefore, it is essential to harness the available 
research studies.  
Accordingly, this study presents a literature review, classification schemes and a simple meta-analysis for scheduling 
of DF research in SM industry. This review is based on a study of journals and web based documents/articles, which 
include conference materials, lecture notes in computer science, working papers, etc., which has been published 
between 1991 and 2019.  Based on the detailed literature review carried out, this study grouped the existing literature 
based on (i) type of data, (ii) machine environment, (iii) nature of scheduling, (iv) objectives, and (v) methodology 
considered by the author. This study help the researchers (readers), who are interested in scheduling of DF by 
providing the source of reference, to identify the gap/untouched research problems and to understand the trend in 
scheduling of DF.

Integrating A Systems Model into Global Engineering 
Education Pedagogy 
Adedeji Badiru 
Air Force Institute of Technology 
Abstract 
Global engineering education encompasses learning systems from different parts of the world. In a World 
system, where we must all work together to get the most out of our educational programs, only a Systems 
view can facilitate a sustainable outcome. This paper takes a Systems view of the world of engineering 
education. It recognizes that cultures, traditions, economic system, geographical infrastructure, political 
system, and so on imping upon how education is delivered, received, absorbed, retained, and utilized. These 
factors can vary widely in the global education system. What works in one part of the world may not work 
in other parts of the world, yet the same learning outcomes are expected from all participants. For this 
reason, the methodology of this paper is to use the DEJI Model of systems engineering for the pedagogical 
framework for the Design, Evaluation, Justification, and Integration of engineering education in a global 
setting. Using this approach ensures that the unique settings and nuances of a particular region is considered 
in the delivery and sustainment of engineering education.

Abstract 
Renewable energy is an energy that comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly 
replenished. The usage of energy for human needs these days is beyond limit to accommodate human 
activities. Statistic recorded that the global renewable generation capacity increased worldwide. This 
represents a yearly growth of around 8.3%, the average for seven straight years in a row, according to new 
data released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). However, the community have 
seen the importance of renewable energy resource, but even then, they have no clue on how to use it due 
to lack of education by the government. The aim of this research is to develop an efficient learning 
application that educate primary school student about the importance and the benefits of renewable 
energy to the community and environment. In addition, this research also to evaluate the efficiency of 
edutainment application whether the application will have an impact on awareness among youngsters.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to improve the current Facility Management System of the Philippine National Railways, 
wherein, a combination of different knowledge with regards to the field of specialization of the researchers had taken 
place to resolve certain issues. The issues that were identified by the researchers are free loading passengers, passenger 
management, long queues and safety issues.  The researchers first acquire all the possible data that will be needed to 
assess the facility management and the totality of the system of PNR. After taking the different sets of data, statistical 
tools and other related literatures are used to get specific factors that will be considered to have a precise output. 
Finally, Industrial Engineering tools like quality function deployment (QFD), queuing theory, systematic layout 
planning (SLP) and systems and procedures were used for the design of the improved facility management system of 
the stations. These tools are intended for a specific issue. The common ground for the improvement of the three 
stations are the systems and procedures, that is why the researchers made a standard operating procedure/rule book 
for the employees that is in the perimeter of the station (i.e. security personnel, ticket booth personnel, mechanic and 
ticket inspectors). When in terms to the comparison of the present and improved facility management system of the 
Philippine National Railway, the researchers used Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to check whether the 
improved system will have a better effect for commuters when compared to the present system.

1. Introduction 
 
Public transportation nowadays is a big help not only for their daily lives but also for our environment. Some benefits 
of public transportations may include saving money, improving health, cleaning the environment and reducing traffic 
congestions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011).  
 
Catching public vehicles can help them to save money than driving yourself for work, school or home. According to 
a research of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ), public transportations can be four times cheaper 
than private transport. Thus, it can save you from the cost of buying, maintaining and running additional vehicles. 
Public Vehicles will also allow people to have an exercise in their daily activities in the form of walking. Lastly, using 
public vehicle is good for the environment, it will reduce the number of the cars that will travel on a daily basis because 
public vehicles could accommodate more people than in a private vehicle (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
2011). 
 
Public land transportations found in the Philippines are buses, jeepneys, metered taxis, van, motorized tricycles, 
multicabs, trains, pedicabs, kalesa and other more. The famous and unique public land transportation in the Philippines 
is the “Jeepneys”. This mode of transportation started at the age of world war two and the concept in building this 
vehicle, is the jeeps of the American people, these vehicles is one of the cheapest in the means of transportation 
(Chadhaury, 2012). Tricycles are motorcycles that have a sidecar attached to it. These tricycles are known only for 
short trips for they only go around in a town.  In NCR alone, Jeepneys consists of 34,522 units, Uvs has 6,000 units 
and, Tricycle and pedicabs has 200,000 units (Dabu, 2015).

For the third and last objective, the researchers used SLP to effectively arrange the areas depending on its relationship 
with the other areas. After that, the researchers used QFD to design a station depending on the customer wants.

Abstract 
The study focuses on the establishments labeled as “Independent Grocery Stores” in the Philippines. These are retail 
stores, primary selling food, located in local districts and communities. According to study, one of the biggest concerns 
for store retailer that affects consumer behavior are the store layout and shelf design (Elbers, 2016). For this reason, 
the authors of the study aim to assess current layout or facility arrangement of the independent grocery stores in the 
Philippines, in order to determine the problems encountered with the use of existing layout. Afterwards, identify 
significant variables for layout model for independent grocery stores, and finally, recommend appropriate layout, 
facilities and product arrangement for grocery stores using house of quality and systematic layout planning. Statistical 
tools such as ANOVA and regression model were also employed in the study. Results of the study revealed that 
significant variables important for layout model are the following: (a) PHYSICAL LAYOUT: Shelf Organization, 
Height of Shelves, Aisle Space, Counter Aisle Space, Size of Labels, Package Counter Availability. (b) 
ENVIRONMENT: Lighting, Ambiance, Temperature, Security. (c) PRODUCT: Prices, Variety, Availability, 
Promotions. However, in the regression model developed in the study, only variables that affect the consumer behavior 
and satisfaction are the following: shelf organization, height of shelves, aisle space, temperature, size of labels, 
baggage counter availability and lighting. These variables served as the basis of the researchers in developing a new 
layout design model for independent grocery stores using House of Quality and Systematic Layout Planning tools.

1. Introduction
According to Chung and Myers (1999); Block and Kouba (2006); Powell et al., (2007), independent grocery stores, 
are establishments whose owners operate fewer than four outlets simultaneously. These stores play an important role 
in their local communities, helping to ensure food access for residents in areas that may not be served by dependent 
grocery stores. These includes low income areas and rural cities. They also provide employment opportunities and 
generate tax revenue for these areas. 
The retail sector in the Philippines has been growing exponentially. Based from the article by IFEX Philippines 
Secretariat in the recent years, the rapid modernization and expansion of the Philippine food retail industry have led 
to the increase of grocery and supermarket chains throughout the country. These retail chains provide profitable 
opportunities for imported and high-value food items in the Philippines through their fast product turnover, growth 
and wide market base. Retail is expected to account for one-fifth of the Philippines’ GDP by 2025, as the BPO industry 
helps boost the local economic growth. 
In the National Capital Region (NCR) Ranks of Establishment Statistics, supermarket has the highest number. This is 
because NSO does not classify stores by their size but by how business owners name the store. It can be observed that 
here in Metro Manila, retail stores mainly are referred to as supermarkets despite the space and size it has. Therefore, 
in the Philippines, there is no specific standard for a retail store that primarily sells food. Grocery store, is a retail store

In the methodology, the researchers made use of the Analysis of Variance to determine each specified sub factors that 
have a significant difference, contrasting it with the other answers. The parameters that were given importance based 
on the result of ANOVA were: PHYSICAL LAYOUT: Shelf Organization, Height of Shelves, Aisle Space, Counter 
Aisle Space, Size of Labels, Package Counter Availability. ENVIRONMENT: Lighting, Ambiance, Temperature, 
Security. PRODUCT: Prices, Variety, Availability, Promotions. Another tool that was made use was the House of 
Quality. It is specified and detailed out in the functional requirements for each customer.  
  
These Physical Layout sub factor’s functional requirements were used to be the priority in the design of the layout. In 
making a new layout, a Systematic Layout Planning was used which resulted to the raw design, in the later part, the 
layout was then specified in the process. The standard measurements were followed and the safety measures were 
considered in the layout. In the HOQ, it resulted that shelf arrangement and product are the top priorities of customers 
inside a grocery store. Also, the mandatory and safety measures for aisle were applied.  
  
The model attained by the study showed more space is allotted for the products. This is for both the customers and the 
store owner’s perspectives. This made the researchers conclude that both parties are concerned about the space for the 
products in stock rather than any other parts of a grocery store. The proposed layout and product arrangement were 
not considered as standard layout for grocery stores, but a proposed layout that will definitely have a positive effect 
to the customers and the owners. Having a positive relationship with the customers is an indication of good sales. 
 
Retail establishment is a broad topic. It could be possible that the study can be helpful to other types of retail stores 
such as convenience stores, supermarkets and other types. As recommendation, bigger establishments should consider 
the amount of time, this time layout will be broadened and parameters will be added. This can be a great part of the 
study, not just in limited space, but also the amount of increase in the profit when layout principles and studies are 
applied. The study could be further examined when compared between different store establishments. This can 
strengthen the study on its stand about layout principles and store arrangement. 
 
There are surely more facilities to consider when the study gets to the bigger establishments. More parameters and 
facilities that are included in the survey form could be studied and researched to further know each detail in the 
grocery/retail industry. Sales of products and its market effectiveness is a good inclusion to the study, due to its retail 
industry where sales and profits are the most focused area. 
 
Other statistical procedures can be done as well to strengthen the results obtained from Analysis of Variance. The 
result of ANOVA was surely reliable but the flaw about it is the fact that the conclusions were broad and the factors 
need to be form accurately. Statistical analysis that will answer the “how?” and “what specifically?” will be a great 
help to the future researchers. The use of Multiple Regression Analysis in the relative importance indicated in House 
of Quality will help the analysis to be specified and the relationship will have a relevant basis from a statistical method. 
 
The part of the study about product arrangement can be further analyzed and evaluated through the use of different 
methods. The product placement or arrangement concluded should be applicable to different types and space of shelf. 
The arrangement of products in the shelf has variety of consideration, and studying about its variation will result to a 
more detailed and useful conclusion.

Abstract 
The shopping mall industry has rapid growth and it is highly attractive in the Philippines. Shopping malls compete 
with one another through their tenants to increase the malls’ foot traffic. This industry is driven by location, land area, 
mall tenants, anchor stores, and consumer behavior. The industry’s primary key success factor is tenant mix. However, 
as defined by Casazza, (1985), “there is no single optimal tenant mix for shopping malls” and tenant mix should be 
tailored to meet the location, size, demographic profile and consumer needs. In most cases a tenant mix for one mall 
could be a mistake for another. Dawson (1983) recommended that in a shopping mall non-anchor stores should not be 
clustered but dispersed throughout the mall because consumer focus on a shopping mall is changing as non-anchor 
stores and anchor stores are sharing the spot light as trend setters. In this study, researchers used this new erected shop: 
King Doña Carmen, as the subject, to determine the tenant mix and positioning that will decrease the payback of this 
shopping mall. The methodology involves four phases, first, knowing the consumer behavior through survey 
questionnaire, second, identifying the optimal tenant mix through benchmark with competitors and the result of phase 
one, third, using linear programming to identify the number and types of store to be placed in each floor and to propose 
a new layout design using Systematic Layout Planning to improve rent income, and fourth, have a strategy timeline 
within the term lease of 20 years. It is concluded in the study that the result of the linear programming model to 
maximize the disposable income of consumers and facilities layout design through Systematic Layout Planning will 
reduce the company’s payback period by two years and increase its monthly rent income.

1. Introduction
A shopping mall is a modern, chiefly North American, term for a form of shopping precinct or shopping center, in 
which one or more buildings form a complex of shops representing merchandisers with interconnecting walkways that 
enable customers to walk from unit to unit. Malls are booming across Asia. The continent is now home to some of the 
world’s largest shopping centers. Many malls in North America are considered “dead” (for the purpose of leasing) 
when they have no surviving anchor store or successor that could serve as an attraction or as an entry into the mall. 
This is where the term dead mall came to be, which is a shopping mall with high vacancy rate or low consumer traffic, 
or that is dated or deteriorating in some manner (Kris Hudson, 2009). Without the pedestrian traffic that anchor stores 
typically generate, sales volumes decline and rental revenues from these stores can no longer sustain the costly 
maintenance of these malls (Newman, 2009). Without consumer access, smaller stores inside malls are difficult to 
reach. The factors affecting the community mall industry are location where it can be identified whether the possible 
foot traffic to the mall to be built is attractive, land area which influences the gross leasable area of the mall to be built, 
mall tenants that directly contribute to the mall’s retail revenue, and anchor stores that influences pedestrian traffic in 
the mall, and consumer behavior which is highly variable depending on the trend consumers want. Key success factors 
in the industry are tenant mix which is the tenant mix that influences the branding image of the mall to the consumers, 
and involves the selection of tenants that will reside in the mall, where it affects the customer’s shopping experience. 
The gross leasable area is the main resource of a shopping mall that influences how many tenants may lease in the 
malls, and Omni-channel retailing in which integrates mobile, online, and in-store experiences to complement rather

order by potential foot traffic generated, in these categories the highest foot traffic generators are food shops, dessert 
shops, beverages shops, beauty and health shops, and perfume shops. The proposed floor flan for the second floor is 
shown in figure 2. In comparison, the proposed floor plan was able to generate an increase in income that reduced the 
payback period by two years, which is in line with the goal of 7-9 years payback period rather than the previous 
income projection which has a payback period of 9.4 years. Since, the data is based on the consumer needs and wants 
this tenant mix will be sustainable. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The primary objective of the study is to assess the consumer behavior of Shop King Doña Carmen’s service area (5km 
radius) if the mall meets the consumers’ needs and wants, which will be used to evaluate Shop King Doña Carmen’s 
tenant mix and benchmark it with competitors near Shop King Doña Carmen. It is concluded in the primary objective 
of the study that the ten highest foot traffic generators are food shops, dessert shops, banks, beverages shops, beauty 
and health shops, clothing stores, beauty and health services, perfume shops, entertainment services, and footwear 
shops. Considering these foot traffic generators, these types of tenant categories should be prioritized. However, 
considering the disposable income the consumers are willing to spend, the ten highest income generators are the tenant 
categories of banks, cellphone shops, drugstores, clothing stores, baby shops, bags shops, appliance stores, bookstores, 
restaurants, and beauty and health shops. Among comparison with the three competitors it is concluded the tenant 
categories they have most in common are food shops, clothing stores, and beverages shops. Analyzing consumer needs 
and wants with the current confirmed tenants of Shop King Doña Carmen almost everything is in line with the 
consumer needs and wants except for one, which is Gym Services. Therefore, using the percentage of the potential 
foot traffic to be generated and multiplying it to the total leasable area of Shop King Doña Carmen which is total to 
6101 sqm. The proposed tenant mix ratio allocation per store category is made and shown in table 3.3 Proposed Tenant 
Mix. Using the formulated LP model, it has successfully allocated all leasable areas with the corresponding number 
of stores per category. The store per category is equal to the allotted area in sqm divided by the estimated minimum 
area per category. Using the data gathered the author was able to recommend a revised floor plan that decreased the 
payback period of Shop King Doña Carmen.

Abstract 
Recommender Systems are becoming ubiquitous in many settings and take many forms, from product 
recommendation in e-commerce stores, to query suggestions in search engines, to friend recommendation 
in social networks. Present systems suffer from two limitations, firstly considering the recommendation as 
a static procedure and ignoring the dynamic interactive nature between users and the recommender 
systems. Also, most of the works focus on the immediate feedback of recommended items and neglecting 
the long-term rewards based on reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a recommendation 
system that uses the Q-learning method [1]. We use ε-greedy policy combined with Q learning, a 
powerful method of reinforcement learning that handles those issues proficiently and gives the customer 
more chance to explore new pages or new products that are not popular  [4]. Usually while implementing 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to real-world problems both the state space and the action space are very 
vast. Therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the multiple\distributed Q table 
approach which can deal with large state-action space and that aides in actualizing the Q learning 
algorithm in recommendation and huge state-action space.

1. Introduction
Thanks to the explosive growth of information on the World wide web that has provided tons of choices for users. 
But an overwhelming number of items in the systems also pose a significant challenge for users to get the relevant 
product they are looking for and that ultimately leads to user unsatisfied. To alleviate such a problem, 
Recommendation is the most widely used solution. Recommendation systems are majorly classified into two 
categories: Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering [2]. In content-based filtering, the recommendation 
system tries to match the product’s features with the user’s choice while in the collaborative filtering, the system 
tries to match user patterns with another user that had the same taste then predict the most user’s interest to items. 
The user’s feature is created by the user’s historical data [3]. The other one is the Hybrid recommendation system 
which considers both content-based as well as collaborative filtering approaches. Several studies that empirically 
compare the performance of the hybrid with the other two methods aforementioned and demonstrated that the hybrid 
methods provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. However, these methods cannot effectively 
address the following three challenges in recommendation [5]. Firstly, it is assumed that the user’s underlying 
preference is static. However, it is most likely that the user’s taste is dynamic in nature. The theory of learning

Mastering Customer Journeys to Enhance Customer Experience & Competitive Advantage 
 
 
Abstract 
 
Successful organizations and market leaders like Lexus, Hotel Ritz Carlton, and Disneyworld know they are in 
customer experience business. Their happy and loyal customers ensure repeat business, higher financial payoff, 
brand image and sustainable business. An organization knowing that they are in customer experience is not enough. 
It requires strong sustained leadership to creating a customer focused organization which is critical to designing and 
delivering customer experience.  
 
Leadership needs to establish a holistic customer experience strategy covering, People, Process, Technology & 
Governance. One of the key and essential components of customer experience is mapping, managing and mastering 
end to end customer journeys from customer perspective.  
 
Mapping customer journeys reveal some interesting aspects such as “Not all customer journeys impact customer 
satisfaction equally”, “mapping Business to Business (B2B) customer journeys are more complex than Business to 
Consumer (B2C) customer journeys.  
 
Mapping, managing and mastering customer journeys has many benefits such as aligning internal functions 
towards common goal of designing and delivering superior customer experience, identify all the key touch points 
with customer, identify various stakeholders involved at different stages of customer journeys, continuously 
reinventing customer journeys to deliver superior wow customer experience.

In recent years, customer experience (CEX) has become a major differentiator and competitive advantage for many 
companies such as Walt Disney, Amazon, and Lexus etc. Successful organizations know they are in customer 
experience business. Conversely organizations which are not in the business of customer experience are easy to spot. 
Organizations delivering high CEX can have higher financial payoffs also.  Let’s look at Walt Disney example of 
CEX. 
 
“Everything Speaks to the Customer1”: Disney World Example of Customer Experience 
Typically, a customer in retail business uses his/ her senses such as touch, feel, and smell, sound to make buying 
decisions and experience the product / service. The Walt Disney Company uses it very well e.g. 
 
1. Sight: 70% of body’s sense receptors are located in our eyes making sight the greatest transmitter of 
setting. Disney carefully plans and decides What customers see and What they do not see.

Conclusion 
For a Quality professional it is interesting and heartening to see application of Quality Management concepts 
such as “Customer Needs to Customer Satisfaction Cycle”, Process Mapping, Design of Experiments, Plan-
Do-Check-Act, etc. being used by companies even today to design, deliver and enhance CEX.   
Central to any successful CEX program is understanding, identifying, mapping, managing and continually 
improving end to end customer journeys from their perspective and using it to create a truly customer centric 
organization, align people and deliver memorable positive experience for customers  & differentiation over 
competitors.

Abstract 
The study investigated the prospects of improving e-waste management system. It was established that 
the e-waste comprised of personal computers, air conditioners, refrigerators, fluorescent lamps and old 
telephones handsets. Such discarded equipment was found to contain useful metals such as iron, copper 
and aluminum as well as ecological contaminants such as lead and mercury. The prevailing practice 
simply involved storage and transporting to landfill site for disposal without appropriate segregation. The 
existing legislation framework did not offer satisfactory enforcement effectively appropriate handling of 
this specific waste. An e-waste handling framework was proposed to enable separation and recovery 
scheme to get output secondary raw materials containing ferrous metal scrap, non-ferrous scrap, plastics, 
batteries and glass thereby stimulating for a possible recovery of useful materials and involving local 
recycling companies who can benefit from these materials.

1. Introduction
In recent years, a dramatic increase in the production and consumption of electrical and electronic equipment (EEEs) 
coupled with a decrease in their lifespan has led to the generation of large quantities of waste. E-waste is the 
electronic equipment at the end of its useful life period and is of no further use. Waste from electronic equipment is 
the fastest growing waste stream in the world with a 3-5% increase rate per year compared to generation of 
municipal wastes (Stenvall, 2013). E-waste contains several substances which are toxic and not biodegradable. The 
improper disposal practices produce carcinogenic substances which are harmful to the environment and human 
health. Due to hazardous substances present in e-waste, proper management methods are required. Since e-waste 
contains appreciable amount of precious metals, it is potentially an important secondary sources of such metals 
(Yazici et al., 2011).” Nevertheless, effective management of e-waste would require for safe, scientific and 
environmental sound treatment options that are governed by adequate infrastructure and policies (UNEP, 2017). The 
policies would aid in creating shared responsibility between affected community of local authorities, industrial 
consumers of electrical/electronic products and other environmental boards towards an operative collection and 
treatment of the waste resource. Also integration of treatment options such as the use of the 3Rs (reuse, recycle, 
recovery) would minimize e-waste. In case of recycling, the yieldable benefits would include recovery of a variety 
of reusable metals hence reduction in natural resource consumption, reduction in environmental pollution through 
avoidance of hazardous waste disposal.

 A software based version of e-waste management would serve as tool for policy makers and e-waste management 
coordinators in the industrial area. Figure 7 below shows a sample of the software prototype which was formulated 
to assist the gathering of information required in the e-waste management.” 
 
Figure 7.Main Menu of proposed prototype software 
 
7. Recommendations 
It was observed that there is need to upgrade recycling skills and technologies incorporate processes that 
accommodate glass from fluorescent lamps and cathode ray tubes in personal computer monitors as well as 
thermoset plastics material from e-waste casings. There would be need for importers to bring in products with less 
impact to the environment which can be easily recycled. Guidelines need to be developed to control the quality and 
standards of imported equipment with attached financial and regulatory incentives to promote practices of importing 
green recyclable equipment.  This could be implemented through levying higher taxes on substandard products and 
engaging certified distributors of original equipment manufacturers. There is need to undertake e-waste awareness 
campaigns at industrial, municipal and local leadership level. The improved awareness would ensure that an 
increased number of participants in the e-waste management scheme hence a well as an operative collection and 
handling system of the targeted waste.   
 
The study highlighted gaps in the current legal and institutional framework such as the insufficiency in addressing 
the uniqueness of e-waste as well as absence of clarity on crucial stakeholders’ roles in e-waste supervision. 
Therefore, specific legislation on e-waste needs to be put in place to aid in achieving maximum control of the e-
waste resource at the same time  creating a shared responsibility amongst affected stakeholders of the importance of 
extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes in the area.  Environmental management board could register and 
issue licenses to local recyclers to initiate development of formal e-waste collection and recovery facilities. The city 
council could also formulate bye-laws to manage e-waste at industrial levels such that the uniqueness of the waste is 
observed towards proper segregation prior to disposal. An environmental board would need to develop an e-waste 
management steering community to regularly monitor and control e-waste management activities across industries. 
Considering the fact that no resources have been known to be allocated for e-waste management, the industrial 
community therefore require an e-waste fund establishment to ensure sustainable financing of e-waste management 
activities. Such funding would enable the recyclers to have the potential to modify their systems to effectively 
handle e-waste. The same fund would enable training in technical maintenance, dismantling and segregation 
techniques for e-waste to avoid health and environmental risks.  
 
8. Conclusion 
The study evaluated the existing e-waste management in the case study industrial area. It was established that no 
formal e-waste collection and treatment was practiced. The responsibility of managing such waste lied with the 
producers of such waste but nevertheless almost 90% of the industries were lacking regular e-waste handling 
procedures. Storage and landfill disposal of the generated e-waste without proper segregation was prevalent  due to 
lack of e-waste related policies to regulate e-waste flow across the industries. Lack of e-waste awareness contributed 
to poor stakeholder coordination towards combating the e-waste menace. The e-waste was found to contain high 
proportion of lighting equipment such compact and straight tube fluorescent lamps followed by ICT equipment. It

was observed that the larger the share of any appliance in the e-waste the shorter the lifespan and the higher the 
usage demand in the industries. Computer based software was developed as a prototype to demonstrate the necessity 
of such an application as a tool for the e-waste management stakeholders to improve the know-how in 
quantification, characterization and management of e-waste across the industrial area. Further study research could 
be done to develop a compact design of e-waste recycling facilities to effectively treat e-waste materials generated 
across industries and the country at large.”

Abstract 
This study utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based Goal Programming (GP) in the prioritization of the 
multiple goals in the digital advertising portfolio. AHP was used to determine the Prioritylevel prior to the formulation 
of Goal Programming.  A questionnaire was formulated and distributed among the 30 respondents to conduct a 
pairwise comparison among the 7 criteria and 8 alternatives.  The set of criteria was determined and agreed collectively 
by the domain experts as aligned to the strategic objectives of the organization. The GP results showed that the 5 goals 
were achieved, while the other 3 were not satisfied. Specifically, the p1was attained with a positive deviation of 9,969. 
The p3 was also satisfied with a positive deviation of 371,817. Furthermore, p6 was attained with a positive deviation 
of 284,371 while the p5 and p8 were achieved without any deviations. On the other hand, p2 wasn’t satisfied as it has 
a negative deviation of 474,065. Also, p4 and p7 were not achieved as both have negative deviations of 194,160 and 
184,398, respectively.

1. Introduction
The rise of the internet has seen to be the game-changer in the way the businesses deliver their value proposition. 
This allowed businesses, specifically the advertisers, to leverage this growing technology from using conventional 
means. Hence, paving way for the various online activities to flourish, one of them is the digital advertising. The 
digital advertising industry has grown significantly in recent years as businesses prefer to effectively reach their 
audience on a wide reach. According to Google Analytics report, there are 3.5 billion searches made by users per 
day and the volume of searches continuously increased by 10% on an annual basis. This is contributed by the 
massive shift of the advertisers and marketers to the internet, from the conventional media platform. Truong et al. 
(2010) postulated that digital advertising is poised to disrupt the rapidly-evolving media industry. According to 
Freire et al. (2015), the growth of the digital ads is mainly contributed by the display ads and SEO at a combined 
67%. Examples of display ads are the Ad Placement, Designing Ads, Animated Ads, Banner Ads, and Static Display 
Ads.  
As the digital advertising space has catapulted its brand into prominence, this is not an outright choice for the 
businesses to mobilize their advertising campaigns. One major concern for them is the cost they might spend on 
digital ads. This is because advertising strategy involved significant amount of capital to be invested. This prevented 
organizations across industries as most of them is plague by the budget constraint. Hence, it raised the question of

The GP model contains 6 variables and 8 constraints which was solved using the MS Excel Solver. Table 7 shows 
the GP results and it can be postulated that only 2 goals were achieved, while the other 6 were not satisfied. P3 and 
P4 were attained with no deviations observed, suggesting that it achieved the goal of attaining 500k and 600k users, 
respectively. Although it can be seen that the top priority, which is the achievement of the budget requirement of 
$150k, wasn’t satisfied with a deviation of +$77,235. This only proved that in the context of BPO-ITeS, mobilizing 
marketing and advertising activities with the abovementioned budget is not feasible and might seriously impact the 
effectivity of the digital advertising campaigns.  
 
Given the AHP-based GP results, it can be postulated that in the Digital ads campaign in the context of BPO-ITeS, 
various goals cannot be attained all at once. There were two suggestions that can be given in this study. First, the 
advertising and marketing team should realistically align their customer reach target, and lastly, they should 
recalibrate their budget requirement. In this study, there were two paths that the decision makers ought to undertake, 
as both cannot be fulfilled at once, hence, they need to choose what they should emphasize; increasing the budget 
constraints or can be the lowering of the target number of audiences, in order to meet multiple objectives that were 
established by the organization.  
 
This becomes a tall order for the advertisers in this specific context, to thoroughly consider what ought to be 
prioritized and what adjustments should be done if one of the pivotal goals wasn’t attained. In this scenario, while 
the top Priority was far exceeded, the next Priority wasn’t satisfied which could put the company into a tight and 
challenging situation, to balance the ad presence as well as recalibrating their existing budget requirements in order 
to solve and maximize the company’s desire to leverage the digital advertising campaign.  
 
The GP showed a more granular view of the actual use-cases and budget dilemma that the BPO-ITeS encounters. 
In this regard, the multiple goals identified should be met at a satisfactory level based on the same budget 
requirement of $150,000. While the main goal of attaining 3,000 CTRs, it is noteworthy to look at the regional 
distribution of the customer reach that the GP model attained. Same principles applied to the job class perspective, 
where the GP model showed both achieved and underachieved results. Hence, the AHP-based GP only showed a 
more comprehensive and more granular approach and the results served as an eye-opener to the decision-makers to 
revamp and create feasible and realistic targets. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
As this study utilized the AHP, it was deemed to draw the interest of various researchers, primarily due to its 
promising method of determining the mathematical bounds of decision-making as well the fact that its intuitive and 
quite simple to formulate (Triantaphyllou & Mann, 1995). Thus, its inherent simplicity, according to Vargas (1990), 
was postulated through the pairwise comparison as anchored to its pre-determined criteria. Furthermore, its 
application to drive the advertising campaigns by efficiently managing the limited budget while the customer reach 
was being maximized allows the decision makers to have a highly reliable decision support tool (Aliyev, 2017). 
This allows the decision makers to reinforce their choices through mathematical model, hence creating a more 
2842","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Dubai, UAE, March 10-12, 2020 
© IEOM Society International 
impactful and more granular decision support tool (Caine & Parker, 1996). As postulated by Coyle (2004), another 
key importance of the AHP is its inherent means of evaluations that can be the decision makers, given that a decision 
should be consistent with organizational strategy.  
 
As this study utilized the AHP-based GP model, it allowed every organization in the BPO-ITeS to apply in their 
actual use-cases. Aliyev (2017) used the similar approach in the formulation of the GP model in the allocations of 
marketing campaign. This only suggested that the GP approach, as an extension of Linear Programming (LP), will 
help the decision makers to quantify their digital ads’ effectiveness by considering the multi-dimensional 
viewpoints. Hence, this study exemplified a more granular approach to deal with the specific dilemma in the digital 
advertising campaign. Hence, the AHP-based GP showed a more comprehensive and more granular approach. Kwak 
et al. (2005) also applied the similar AHP approach or Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDM) in the for the 
media selection. Given the results from these past studies, it was postulated that AHP-based GP model are indeed 
the most logical approach in dealing the with the digital advertising allocation problem.  
 
Lastly, the primary purpose of this study is to formulate and analyze AHP-based GP model specifically for the cases 
where the Priority levels or goal hierarchy is unknown or not explicitly stated. Hence, AHP creates a compelling 
basis on determining the hierarchy for the GP goals which deemed to be crucial in the resolution of the digital ads 
problem. This study highly emphasizes the need for the advertisers to adopt quantitative approaches, specifically 
the models that were utilized in this paper, in order to create a cost-efficient and more effective digital ad strategy. 
As according to Mihiotis and Tsakiris (2004), the AHP-based GP could be extended to a wide range of use-cases, 
encompassing all the available advertising platforms both within and beyond the digital ads space.

Abstract 
Aside from the financial and technical ratios and parameters currently used by the Insurance Commission, this 
paper, as based on Gharakhani et. al’s model (2017) develops a measure of efficiency derived using two-stage 
dynamic network Data Envelopment Analysis, a non-parametric linear programming approach as an alternative in 
evaluating the performance of the non-life insurance sector. Using balanced panel data acquired from financial 
reports from 2015 to 2017 of the top non-life insurers of the Philippines based on 2017 Gross Premiums Written 
(GPW), goal programming was used to develop a set of common weights to be applied to the said insurers for the 
following variables: operations expenses; benefit, claims and expenses; general administrative expenses; direct 
premiums written; reinsurance premiums; net income and investment income, to compute for their respective 
efficiencies. Results revealed that by comparing the average normalized overall efficiency scores across 3 years, 
DMU3 is the most efficient among all. Moreover, DMUs 1 and 4 have also obtained the maximum efficiency for 
year 2016 and 2017, respectively. Strengths and techniques of the said efficient DMUs were also presented and 
discussed in this paper.

1. Introduction
There have been numerous prior studies with diverse objectives regarding efficiency and performance evaluation in 
the financial sector particularly in the insurance industry. In fact, performance measurement and benchmarking are 
two of the most prominent research themes in the field (Barros et al, 2005; Cummins and Weiss, 1933; Cummins 
and Zi, 1998; Cummins et al, 1996, Katrischen and Scordis, 1998; and Rai 1996). Gharakhani et. al (2017) 
highlighted that performance evaluation is essential in assessing and designing company procedures and strategies. 
It is imperative to identify units with worsening performance to be able to make necessary adjustments and 
enhancements since it is expected that they should manifest improving performance through time. In addition, due to 
globalization, rapid evolution of the market and competitive pressure, insurance companies are forced to change 
their strategies in order to maintain and improve the quality of their services while minimizing their operations costs 
(Yang, 2005). Efficiency models and measures also serve as alternatives to the accounting-based financial ratio 
measures of the industry performance takes into consideration the importance of operational and strategic decision-

To address the weakness and limitation of conventional DEA models, the goal programming approach was used to 
derive the common set of weights to be applied to the input variables - Operation Expense, Claims and Expenses, 
and General and Administrative Expenses (Stage 1) and Direct Written Premiums and Reinsurance Premiums (Stage 
2) and output variables - Net Income, and Investment and Other Income. Afterwards, the overall efficiency measures 
were obtained and the insurers were ranked and compared accordingly. Moreover, the researchers were also able to 
observe the trend and behavior of the efficiency scores as well as stage 1 and stage 2 performance across time from 
2015 - 2017.  
 
Results revealed that considering all years, DMU3 is the most efficient among all non-life insurers. This company 
has operated efficiently compared to others as it was able to minimize operation and administrative expenses while 
producing maximum possible net income. This insurer focused on the “risk transfer technique” – accepting risks and 
ceding percentage to reinsurers to other insurance companies. Moreover, DMUs 1 and 4 were also identified as the 
most efficient in years 2016 and 2017, respectively. DMU1 reflects large operating insurance companies with high 
expenses and operating costs yet have managed to maximize their risk retention. Lastly, DMU4 highlights the 
importance of risk selection and risk evaluation, producing the highest net income, in general, with low operating 
costs and loss and claim payments.  
 
For future studies, the researchers recommend the application of the dynamic network DEA model using goal 
programming to the insurance data of all the existing 59 non-life companies, as well as life insurance firms. 
Moreover, future researchers may also opt to compare the proposed model with other ranking models such as super 
efficiency models, CCR and BCC models.

Abstract 
In the field of operations and production management, inventory systems is the most studied aspect due to its high 
contributions to most companies’ expenses. In that respect, effective stock control is essential to the improvement of 
many businesses. Problems arise, however, when conducting inventory management due to the many uncertainties 
faced. In this paper, the researchers address issues concerning the said uncertainties in inventory management through 
forecasting and supply chain integration in an inventory simulation model via Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic 
applications. The proposed model incorporates information coming from downstream tiers of the supply chain in 
computing the forecasts. The model was tested using a set of heuristic data using the incurred costs as performance 
measure. The findings show that the proposed model, in comparison with basic and classical forecasting and inventory 
management models, performs significantly better under the different conditions tackled in the study. The findings 
also suggest that the proposed model could be the basis of more complex inventory management models.

1. Introduction
Inventory management plays a vital role in many organizations since inventories usually contribute the largest 
expenses incurred by businesses. The theory on inventory systems is also the most thoroughly researched field in 
production and operations management (Nenes et al, 2010). There are many types of inventory management systems, 
with a single-pro, duct, multi-period being the most basic. It is still tedious, however, to be able to conduct this 
optimally since there are a great number of variables involved. These variables include stochastic demand (Waller, 
2014), (Dekker et al, 2005), (Petropoulos et al, 2013), varying lead times and cycle service levels (Porras, 2008), 
forecast accuracy (Porras et al, 2008), (Ali et al, 2012), (Boylan and Syntetos, 2006), (Syntetos et al, 2015), (Boylan 
et al, 2008), (Silver et al, 1998), supply chain management (Bob, 2016), (Bob, 2017), (Costantino et al, 2014), (Chien 
et al, 2011), (Chien et al, 2010) and cost parameters. All of which greatly affect overstocking and shortages exhibited

4.  Conclusion  
 
The study uses and modifies two similar forecasting tools, Simple Exponential Smoothing and the TSB method. For 
the modifications done, instead of just using the previous demand occurrence in the forecast computation, the average 
between the latest available downstream forecast and the actual demand last period are used, using only last period’s 
demand if no information from downstream tiers are available. 
 
Implication of the proposed forecasting method was done through an equation found in related literature. The ROP 
equation formulated by Syntetos and Babai (2007) uses forecasts for each period in calculating the ROP for the same 
period. By using this equation, the researchers were able to incorporate the two forecasting techniques in an inventory 
management system. The methods were then tested against the classical ROP computation approach in 1,440 Monte 
Carlo inventory simulation runs using a heuristic set of data. The results show that the proposed methods outperforms 
the classical approach under all conditions. For the first set of 360 runs without the availability of downstream forecast 
information, the TSB method generated the least cost on 180 runs (50% of the time), with SES having 139 runs 
(38.11%) and classic approach with 89 (24.72%). For the third set of 360 simulation runs, with the availability of 
downstream forecast information, the TSB method generated the least cost on 290 runs (80.56%), SES with 170 
(47.22%) and classic approach with 28 (7.78%).  
 
Several enhancements can be done to further improve the model’s application on real-life scenarios. Since the model 
proposed in this study was only tested under a heuristic set of data, the researchers recommend doing case study using 
said model. Although the 10 randomly generated demand patterns could closely represent an empirical set of data, 
using the proposed model on a real life business situation would help prove its effectiveness. Particularly in a case 
involving the semiconductor industry. Since the simulations and results in the paper involved very high numbers, it 
was only able to prove that the model works robustly under a product which experiences the same range and variation. 
The study was also limited by the assumption that the demand pattern follows a Normal Distribution in computation 
of the ROP using forecasts. Assuming a more widely used probability distribution in the computation of the ROP 
could lead to a more controlled inventory simulation. Another step towards improving the proposed model is through 
modification for a multi-product inventory problem since the model proposed can only be using for a single-product 
inventory model. The model proposed is a very basic approach towards solving current inventory problems but it can 
be a baseline in coming up with a model to face more complex scenarios.

Abstract 
The primary purpose of this research is to study the criterions used to select the maintenance strategy in the 
food industry. Six criterions were identified; cost, historical data, added value, feasibility, safety, and 
equipment status. A survey was conducted in the Jordanaina food industry to rank them based on the 
importance when selecting the maintenance strategy for machines, 93.5% of the surveys were completed. 
Historical data was the significant (18.8%) followed by add value (18.3%), safety (17%), equipment status 
(16.8%), cost of maintenance (16.3%), and last is feasibility (12.8%).

1. Introduction
Machine maintenance becomes a very critical part of any company, due to the need for high productivity, availability, 
and quality from production lines, while machines have become more complicated and expensive. Improving and 
achieving a maintenance program is a complex issue that suffers from many difficulties, including weak organization 
and lack of proper methodology. Also, while enhancing the procedure of the program connected to different parties 
with interests in maintenance, it becomes difficult to get satisfaction from all parties and to achieve the company’s 
objectives. The maintenance manager has to combine all purposes to maximize productivity, availability, and quality 
while taking into consideration the production plan, available spares, human resources, and skills (Labib, 1998).  
These days, the importance of decision-making tools increase in manufacturing industries. This has to lead to decision 
support systems (DSSs) to help managers to make effective decisions by controlling and processing all information 
and data (Tahir, 2008). Maintenance is part of the production and manufacturing system. Maintenance, in general, can 
be defined as the activities that can preserve or keep any machine or equipment in a system in specific operating 
conditions or restore that item after any failure has happened. This includes assets condition monitoring, lubrication, 
cleaning, planning, scheduling, and so many activities that are helping to do the maintenance or related to it (Shenoy 
& Bikash, 1997). Moreover, it concerns all activities required to keep a system and all of its parts in working order 
(Stephens, 2010).

This was the fifth most important criterion according to the maintenance experts in the Jordanian food industry with 
a percentage of 16.3% 
The sub-criteria were also ranked as following: 
a) 
Training cost 4.45 (29.0%)

This was ranked sixth by the maintenance experts in the Jordanian food industry with a percentage of 12.8% 
The sub-criteria were also ranked as following: 
a) 
Acceptance 3.55 (58.9%) 
b) 
Technique reliability 2.48 (41.1%) 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The demand for high production and high quality has increased. This has raised the importance of manufacturing and 
high expectations regarding reliability and availability. This has led manufacturers to look for new ways to decrease 
or eliminate production line failure and shutdown, and therefore effective maintenance of machinery has become a 
big concern. There is a need to find maintenance strategies to achieve increased production and decrease the number 
of failures and downtime. For this reason, maintenance is now considered as an investment, which helps to increase 
the institution’s profit.   
There is a need to understand the criteria that should be used to determine the optimum and suitable maintenance 
strategies and programs to preserve machines and equipment in the production lines. After much research, it was found 
that most focused on six dimensions, which are: 
1- 
Cost 
2- 
Safety  
3- 
Add value  
4- 
Historical data 
5- 
Feasibility 
6- 
Equipment status. 
After studying the importance of these criteria by evaluating them from the perspective of maintenance expert’s 
opinion in the Jordanian food industry, it appears that the historical data criterion should be the most important 
criterion. Most of them believed that the past trends of the machine could help to determine or predict future expected 
failures. This means that preventive action can be completed and this is the cheapest and easiest way. The least 
essential criterion was considered to be feasibility which is divided into two criteria: acceptance by laborers and 
technique reliability. This may be because the food industry in Jordan has traditional production lines and new 
technology has not been tried and tested.

Abstract 
The traditional production and maintenance planning models have been separately well documented, and 
much work was done to improve them. However, the integrated production and maintenance planning 
model emerged recently, and firms highly desire it due to its ability to ease the production process by 
including maintenance activities from the beginning of the planning horizon. In this paper, we present an 
integrated production and maintenance planning model. We compare the two block maintenance policies 
(as bad as old and as good as new). The results show that preventive maintenance is less frequent when 
using block-AGAN compared to ABAO, while the maintenance and production costs are higher.

1. Introduction
The increased demand for products forced industrialists to develop models that satisfy this demand with the lowest 
possible cost. This requires companies to pay great attention to their machines used in the production processes and 
on their characteristics, i.e., their capacity, availability, suitability to social issues, reliability, and lifetime. Production 
workshops, by their nature, are subject to events such as the arrival of new tasks to be performed by the machines or 
to machine break-down (Bouzidi-Hassini, Benbouzid-Si Tayeb, Marmier, & Rabahi, 2015). They are responsible for

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we presented an integrated production and maintenance planning model for block policies, block-AGAN, 
and block-ABAO. The model is formulated as non-linear and then transformed into a linear one by discretizing the 
maintenance period. Based on our results, using Block-AGAN in production planning requires having preventive 
maintenance in a less frequent manner than block-ABAO. However, the maintenance and production costs are higher.

Abstract 
This paper revels the inception of junior coal mining companies into the coal space in South Africa. 
Even though they are supported by other entities like the government, Eskom and Transnet they still 
face a lot of challenges in operations, finance, logistics, equipment, and other issues leading to high risk 
of companies shutting down. Literature review outlines the big coal mining houses and their 
contribution in the coal industry. Due to that there is little knowledge about junior coal mining 
companies the researcher conducted an explorative descriptive design method which included 
questionnaires and interviews on 85 junior companies. The results show that they do contract mining, 
hire transportation, and they get most of their finance from the private investors. In conclusion the 
public and private sector should do more in order to ensure the survival of junior coal mining companies.  
1.
Introduction
The South African coal industry has of late witnessed a number of junior coal companies joining the sector. 
However, these junior companies seem to be facing a number of challenges, particularly in production processes. 
A junior company is defined by Mitchell (2016) as prospecting organizations who are just associated with the 
beginning phases of mining. Anyway, in South Africa, it implies a black economic empowerment organization 
(BEE) or a small scale mining activity and there is an expanding number of junior coal mining organizations in 
South Africa, which account for 30% of the coal production according to Prevost (2013).  
Junior coal miners are supported by the government through the mining charter of 2016 which encourages 26% 
black ownership (Broad Based Black-Economic Empowerment) in mining companies. On the other hand, junior 
coal miners are supported by Eskom which wants them to supply 40% of thermal coal (Eskom, 2016). Based on 
this, Richards Bay Coal terminal in conjunction with Transnet increased its capacity to boost junior coal miners 
(Kolver, 2014). Regardless of all this support junior coal miners still face a lot of challenges in operations, finance, 
skilled personal, equipment, legal documentation, safety, environment, and other issues leading to high risk of 
companies shutting down. According to Deloitte (2016) reports states that as exploration dwindles, junior miners 
continue to fight tooth and nail for survival and, despite these headwinds, governments still expect miners to help 
bolster their economies through taxes, royalty fees, shares of profit, infrastructure spend and community 
investments.  
2.
Literature Review
According to Hartnady (2011), coal crisis in South Africa which has been caused by absence of re-investment by 
the major coal mining entities like Anglo Coal, BHP Billiton, Exxaro, Sasol, and Glenco, which opened up 
opportunities for junior coal mining companies, with the assistance received from the government, Eskom, 
Transnet and Richards Bay Coal Terminal. Prevost (2003) “the South African coal industry is rapidly approaching 
a stage of stagnation, mainly due to a lack of re-investment by the main producers, when the industry has therefore 
recently not been able to raise its production. On the contrary, the industry is steadily decreasing its coal

Figure 6: Sources of Finance 
Figure 7 illustrates that 37% of the respondents said they sourced their finance through the banks, 44% of the 
companies said they get their finance from private investors, 12% raise their finance from personal financing, 3% 
raise finance from the stock exchange, 4% raise their finance from other sources like re-investment, internal 
financing, personal savings and bridge finance. During the interviews, junior coal miners explained why they get 
most of their loans from banks. The respondents said that they would have gotten a start-up contract from Eskom 
or Sasol and the bank would offer them the loan based on the contract. Other companies said they get their finance 
from private investors and mostly the Indians who are starting to invest in the junior coal mining companies and 
then export the product to India because there is shortage of coal in their country due to floods and poor quality 
of coal. 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion this paper provided an insight into the challenges and support on junior coal mining companies. 
Although there is support much has to be done in order for the industry to survive the storm. If this is not done a 
lot of companies will shut down causing a spill over effect into job losses, load shading which will in-turn affect 
other industries.

Abstract 
The purpose of the study is to determine how web usability and interface design on webpage development can affect 
the purchasing decision of consumers of group buying websites. With the rise of e-commerce, entrepreneurs nowadays 
cannot assume that when they build a website, customers will automatically visit them. Industry analysis shows how 
companies can earn decreased potential sales and low gains on return of investment (ROI) due to poor usability and 
errant designs. The researchers aimed to conduct an assessment on the current performance of websites in online group 
buying, identify significant factors that will affect the decision of webpage designs, create an ideal generic webpage 
layout for group buying websites, and evaluate the formulated webpage layout based on the assessment of current 
group buying websites. The methodology includes distribution of survey questionnaire and usability test among 
respondents. ANOVA and t-test were used as the statistical treatment of data. The study was able to verify through 
the comparison of usability tests that the proposed website showed significant improvements to improve the webpage 
in terms of web usability and interface design. The findings will be useful to entrepreneurs, online shoppers and future 
researchers for an improved e-commerce experience.

1. Introduction
The internet has advanced into a true economy and a new frontier of business since 1977.  The e-commerce industry 
became a hot market in the recent years that spurred a number of entrepreneurs to create businesses online (Nah and 
Davis, 2002). However, there is a hyperbole associated with the Internet and the Web that resulted in a mindset that 
e-commerce was an easy road to success (Pather, 2006).  With the growing competition for online customers,
companies cannot expect that when they build a website, customers will automatically visit them (Kim, 2013 Due to
the growing competition for online customers, companies cannot expect that when they build a website, customers
will automatically visit them. Web shoppers come to be more sophisticated, their knowledge of online purchasing
alternatives makes them less patient on websites that are difficult to understand and use. More so today, where it is
about giving the customers what they want, when they want it and how they want it, or they will go somewhere else.
This arises to the importance of usability and design of websites. Web usability is defined as the ability to find one’s 
way around the Web, to locate the desired information, to know what the next thing to do, and very importantly, to do 
so with minimal effort (Nah and Davis, 2002).  This is also referred to as the cognitive costs that a user has to bear 
because of the efforts made to search, interpret and process information while navigating websites (Suchman, 1987). 
Web usability depends on the webpage itself since it is the only connection with the user; it is what they visit and 
where navigation takes place. Not only web usability but also the interface design, the facade or layout of the website 
is also the first impression of the browsers (Tang, 2011).  Especially to those businesses that have their webpage as 
their sole storefront, it will be their only means of connecting with consumers. Poor website design can be a major 
factor that negatively influences the purchasing intentions of consumers that affect the businesses’ profitability. Online 
firms can be losing a large percentage of potential sales simply because their website is confusing and difficult to use 
(Lais, 2002; Nielsen, 2001).  Previous studies have indicated that design decisions made in Web Pages influence 
consumer perceptions and their intentions to shop at those sites. (Lavie and Tractinsky, 1999; Zhang and von Dran, 
2000) The aesthetics serve as a significant factor that affects pleasure and satisfaction of visitors to the website. In

the study can also be incorporated to have a better grasp of the experience of the browsers. Lastly, the study only 
focused on the group buying websites in the Philippines, other types of websites can also be used to verify and compare 
the results of the study. Additional respondents can also be applied to validate the accuracy of results, such as first 
time users of the said websites.

Abstract 
The objective of this paper is to explore the concept of ‘public policy’ from a project management perspective. In 
particular, we intend to contribute to emerging literature that has sought to establish a relationship between project 
management (specifically, project organising) and public policy. In the process, we continue with the conversation 
initiated in Winch and Sanderson (2015) and subsequently in Sanderson and Winch (2017). However, in a marked 
departure from the approach adopted in these two seminal studies (and associated works) our study is undertaken from 
a legal perspective as against the administrative sciences perspective which we opine dominated these prior studies. 
It is our position that a holistic understanding of the intersection between project management and public policy 
requires a balanced exploration of both perspectives of public policy. Our study that is undertaken in the context of 
arbitration undertaken within the United Arab Emirates construction industry. We do so taking into consideration the 
‘unruly’, fluid and multifaceted nature of public policy. Findings from our study serves as the foundation for further 
empirical exploration of what is a nascent and developing area of project management research.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background context 
Public sector infrastructure projects can be utilised as tools for public policy implementation (Shiferaw and Klakegg, 
2012). As a tool for policy implementation, projects can be utilised to organize the relationship between the public 
(the society) and the state. Projects therefore serve to enable the materialization and operationalization of public policy. 
Public policy may engage in diverse infrastructure projects. For example, it may touch upon projects focused on 
increased mobility for the disabled or projects focused on increasing access to drinkable water. Although major public 
sector infrastructure projects such as the Hinkley Point C Nuclear Power Station project, are utilised to implement 
public policy( Daniel and Daniel, 2019), it is important to acknowledge that the public and larger society rarely in 
direct contact with a number of these projects. Often than not, it is the products and services that emanate from these 
projects that the public will have direct experience of.  
Projects are increasing being assessed as to whether they are in line with the needs, aspirations and priorities 
of the public. This public policy test examines whether the objectives of such projects will meet or contribute to 
societal needs. Underlying this ‘public policy’ consideration is not only the question of how and whether these projects 
should be able contribute to the well-being of the wider society (in addition to its expected economic benefit), but also 
the questions of the purpose and the scope of such policy. Governments however face a major challenge ensuring that 
public sector projects are in line with public policy. This is because more than often, an assessment of public policy 
is not based on any clear commercially oriented transactional exchange between the government and the public 
(society). Furthermore, public policy is usually drawn very broadly and in a generic manner which makes it difficult 
to articulate precisely the specific tools (in this case, projects) that will be required for its successful implementation. 
1.2 Conversations on the interface between project management and public policy  
Currently, conversations on the interface between project management and public policy have commenced (see Winch 
and Sanderson, 2015; Sanderson and Winch, 2017). These conversations also appear replicated in the wider operations

Abstract 
Design experiments have many potential uses in improving processes and products, comparing alternatives 
is one of the purposes of experimentation. In this experiment we will compare two different colored yarns 
in the woven carpet factory, factors might have a cause and effect relationship in Libyan textiles. Woven 
carpet is very much similar to a woven cloth and is produced on a loom only. Different colored yarns are 
used to produce intricate designs and patterns. In this experiment, we will use repeated T-Test or paired T-
Test to compare colored yarns. In this paper, we will consider these to be paired data samples (intricate 
designs and patterns) because each pair of values in each row represents a unique product from different 
colored yarns woven W1, W2, W3, and W4. To compare the mean values we will use paired T-Test.

There are several advantages to having carpets in our homes and commercial spaces, including their aesthetic appeal, 
comfort, economy, temperature, and sound insulation abilities as well as safety considerations. Woven carpet is 
specified in commercial installations when a particularly tight construction and the dense pile is required, or a 
particularly intricate pattern is designed Carpet, in various forms, has been a part of interiors for hundreds of years.

Abstract 
This questionnaire is part of my DEMS research, is to be distributed to selected Libyan Textile companies, 
aiming to evaluate their quality practices and see whether they have the right capabilities to implement lean 
manufacturing.  This questionnaire is developed based on an extensive literature review focusing on the 
technical and cultural requirements of lean, lean critical success factors (CSFs), and elements associated 
with types of wastes which lean works to eradicate. Furthermore, this questionnaire targets the whole chain 
of lean, from suppliers, through internal processes/practices, and finally to customers. This should enable 
us to understand how Libyan companies operate in terms of supplier and customer relations, process flows, 
the use of scientific tools to deal with problems, top management commitment and leadership, and finally 
respecting people via involvement, empowerment, reward systems, and training. The questionnaire is 
divided into six constructs (47 statements): The contents of the questionnaire were selected in order to 
assess the companies’ practices so that the preparedness and readiness level towards the adaptation of lean 
could be identified.

ABSTRACT 
Container Terminal (CT) Logistics is one of the important elements of any country’s economy as it affects distribution 
efficiency, interest rates, productivity, energy costs and energy availability. For reaping profits, CT optimize various 
decisions related to the allocation of berth to vessel, choice of material handling equipment, scheduling of quay cranes, 
scheduling of stacking cranes, scheduling of AGVs, traffic control of AGVs and determination of stack capacity, 
personnel management, etc. Amongst all decision problems in CT, berth allocation problem (BAP) is the very first 
decision to be taken which serves as an input to various other management decisions at the CT, as optimal scheduling 
of berth will improve satisfaction among shipping companies and enhance the performance of CTs and in turn will 
help in generating higher profits for them. There is a large body of research studies available related to BAP. The 
objective of this study is to conduct a detailed review of formulation of BAP model and solution approaches addressed 
for BAP for helping new researchers, particularly for understanding the various modelling and solution methodologies 
presented so far in the literature, working in the area of BAP.   Accordingly, a detailed review was conducted based 
on scientific journals, conference papers, dissertations, working papers etc. Based on all possible descriptors to identify 
research papers on BAP, we identified research papers published between 1992 and 2019. We classified these 
literatures based on BAP-configuration wise studies proposing various mathematical modelling, exact methods, 
simple constructive heuristic approaches, and metaheuristic approaches. Finally, we acknowledge that the review 
presented in this study cannot be claimed to be exhaustive, but the output of this study does provide reasonable insights 
into the state-of-the-art on solution approaches to BAP research. Further, it is hoped that, the output of this focused 
review will provide a source of reference for any new researchers/readers in identifying or developing newness in 
terms of problem configuration, solution methodologies, and objective(s) of BAP being proposed and help simulate 
further interest.

Abstract 
 
In this study, a new linear bubble point correlation for deep offshore Niger Delta crude was developed using 
Excel. Using 129 data points characterizing crude from deep offshore Niger Delta fields, a simple 
multivariate model was developed by dividing the data points into modeling and validation data. With R2 
of 0.999, the new model was found to satisfactorily predict the bubble point pressure of deep offshore Niger 
Delta crude samples. However, it was discovered that for crude samples with API density less than 50, the 
percentage error between predicted actual bubble points were less than 10%. While for crude samples with 
API gravity above 50, percentage error was above 10%, reaching up more than 60% in for some API 
gravities. Therefore, it was deduced that the developed model is applicable to deep offshore Niger Delta 
crude samples with API densities less than 50.

1. Introduction 
The bubble point pressure of a hydrocarbon system is defined as the highest pressure at which a bubble of gas is 
liberated from oil. This input property can be measured experimentally for a crude oil system by conducting a constant-
composition expansion test. In the absence of the experimentally measured bubble point pressure, it is necessary for 
the engineer to make an estimate of this crude oil property from the readily available measured producing parameters 
(Moradi et al., 2010). 
 
Knowledge of bubble point pressure is one of the important factors in the primary and subsequent developments of an 
oilfield. Bubble point pressure is required for material balance calculations, analysis of well performance, reservoir 
simulation and production engineering calculations. In addition, bubble point is an ingredient, either directly or 
indirectly, in every oil property correlation. Thus, an error in bubble point pressure will cause errors in estimates of 
all other oil properties. Which will propagate errors throughout all reservoir and production engineering calculations 
(Ikiensikimama and Ogboja, 2009). 
 
Available bubble point correlations normally use data that are typically available in the field in different combinations. 
Hence, by considering a subset of variables that actually influence bubble points of hydrocarbon systems, the 
contributions of other important variables are usually lost. Also, by taking a clue from the seminal bubble point 
correlation work of Standing in 1947, most correlations developed since then have always been nonlinear in nature. 
Thereby, resulting in rigorous calculations that are usually confusing and time-consuming. In this study, a linear 
approach is taken to model bubble point, by considering as many variables as possible. These variables include bottom-
hole pressure, bottom-hole temperature, bottom-hole density, bottom hole viscosity, oil formation volume factor, gas 
oil ratio, and API gravity.

decreasing percentage mean absolute error from API gravity of 42 up to 47. Then, as API gravity increased from 50 
upwards, the percentage mean absolute error, increased beyond 10% up to 60%. Therefore, it can be deduced that 
developed model is applicable to deep offshore Niger Delta crude samples with API densities less than 50.    
 
5. Conclusion 
 
From this study, bubble point pressure correlation has been developed for a Niger Delta field. This correlation can be 
used in calculating bubble point pressure using available data gathered from field. This can be used in defining this 
important parameter in the absence of experimental value in calculating material balance, analysis of well 
performance, reservoir simulation and production engineering calculations. 
The developed model is applicable to deep offshore Niger Delta crude. The model is a linear multivariate model which 
can predict bubble point pressure satisfactorily for crude oil samples with API gravity of less than 50, which is 
typically the kind of crude oil found in this region.

Abstract 
The electronics industry in the Philippine is the largest contributor to the manufacturing sector within the 
country. The Philippines is also considered the fastest growing economy in the region where its electronics 
products are among its top exports. The manufacturing of new electronics devices that comes with the 
emerging technologies translate to new processes that require new equipment that poses challenges to the 
industry. Thus, innovative solutions are developed by the engineers to improve and increase the production 
yield.  
This study presents the development of a monitoring system that is interfaced to an existing wirebonding 
machine as a means of improving production yield. The system detects and records the bouncing of the 
“area under bond” which is identified as a major cause of product rejection. The Arduino-based microcon-
troller takes the U/SG (Ultrasonic Generator/Gain) signals from the machine. The Raspberry pi monitors 
the real-time signal provided by the microcontroller and compares the signal from the database module with 
trained signals. Tests run show that the system can detect the signals and present it in a “.csv” file format. 
Twenty (20) units of a specific electronic device were tested to identify between good and defective device.

4.4. Reject Criteria Definition 
 
Figure 11 shows a graphical presentation of the data taken for the pull tests and break mode readings for all the samples 
of known good and known poor wirebond signals. All signals  above the UCL are wedge-off upon wirebond and all 
signals below the LCL, less than 500 grams force. Both these conditions exhibit wedge-off which are criteria for 
rejection. The graph shows that wirebond points 3, 4, 5 ,6 are determined as critical points, any signal point that falls 
outside the defined window per point are considered defective in wirebond quality. This will give a trigger signal to 
the wirebonder to stop processing.

5. Conclusion 
 
Based on the result of evaluation, using the Arduino-based microcontroller and raspberry pi system can acquire signal 
from existing wirebond and monitor the ultrasonic generator signal on each wirebond. All signals acquired can be 
determined to be good or poor. The system can detect if the machine needs to stop operations before further wirebonds 
lead to more device rejection. It is recommended to validate the obtained system on 1000 wire bond unit for further 
study and analysis. It is also recommended to feed the acquired data in machine learning algorithm for prediction 
analysis.

Abstract 
This paper aims to present a review of how project management has been addressed and developed through the years. 
This review has been undertaken by theoretical fusion with the management theory jungle first espoused by Koontz 
(1961;1980) then by articulating the research agenda in project management and the findings suggest the existence of 
classical project management, rethinking project management, brave new world and project studies groups within the 
research agenda. In addition, the schools of thought were reviewed as well and they are considered essential in 
management and project management because they help in deciding which school is the most relevant and useful for 
making decisions. This study will cover the various schools of project management and their relation to the schools 
of management. After that, the paper will provide a critical analysis of what has been discussed.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
The subject of this paper is to present a review of the development of the project management research agenda through 
analyzing the published research papers in this field. The paper will contextualize the research agenda of project 
management which considered as an essential concept and schools of thought. Some authors introduced the schools 
in terms of management and project management and the interaction between them. The paper will cover the 
following: it will articulate the concepts of the papers that are related to management, project management related to 
the research agenda and different schools of thought. In addition, the paper will present how the research agenda in 
project management has been developed. After mapping out the research agenda of project management, to best 
contextualize the paper with management and project management, we will draw upon the schools of thought to be 
able to develop a comprehensive understanding of the research agenda in project management. 
2. What is Management - Management as Jungle
There was a study in 1961 by Koontz concerning the “management theory jungle” and in this research the major 
schools of management theory were discussed. The author listed six schools, namely: the management process school, 
the empirical school, the human behavior school, the social system school, the decision theory school and the 
mathematical school. The author mentioned that there is a variety of approaches to management theory which lead to 
confusion and destructive jungle warfare. In addition, he added that the main causes of mental mess in the jungle were 
the semantic jungle, management as body of knowledge, confusion and assumption. 
Later, in 1980, Koontz published research about the “management theory jungle revisited” and elaborated more on 
the schools and improved the review of the original schools that were discussed in 1961. The modified and updated 
list now had eleven schools, as listed below: 
(1) The empirical or case approach: this school is about studying management by analyzing different
experiences in different cases.
(2) The interpersonal behavior approach: this school is about getting things done and accomplishing them
through people, with the focus on interpersonal relations.

performance management as well as quality management which are similar to the functions of the Modeling School 
and Optimization School, as discussed by Bredillet (2007c). Figure 3 below shows the schools of management 
discussed by Koontz (1980) in the Management Theory Jungle Revisited linked with the schools of project 
management introduced by Bredillet (2007 c) as well as the link to the work of Kwak and Anbari (2009).

6. Conclusion 
The purpose of this article was to provide a comprehensive review of how project management has been addressed 
and developed through the years. We proposed the term ‘Project Management Research Agenda’ as an umbrella 
concept involving the various studies related to project management and schools of thought. The literature review 
shows how the research agenda was reviewed from the earlier classical type, rethinking project management, brave 
new world and finally the project studies. Svejvig and Andersen (2015) mentioned that the traditional aim is solving 
the project problems, increasing the productivity and the effectiveness which can be done by understanding and 
highlighting the nature of the project and its environment. Moreover, the purpose behind identifying the schools of 
project management is to understand various perspectives and tasks that lead to make decisions and achieve goals. 
The nine schools of thought – Optimization School, Modeling School, Governance School, Behavior School, Success 
School, Decision School, Process School, Contingency School and Marketing School – introduced by Bredillet 
(2007c) - were identified clearly in the literature review and the interaction between the different schools was 
explicated. In addition, the School of Management was discussed, supported by a brief definition to build up a clear 
vision of its relationship with the School of Project Management.

Abstract 
This paper indicates the structure of the tufting machine mechanism and got some variables by considered 
the implement the growth of the Libyan textile in a tufted carpet. By using response surface design analysis 
we created 2 with adding 4 corner points and 5 center points. Tufted carpet sectors are Needle, Pile yarn, 
Primary backing, looper, and last Pile cutting knife. Since there was a center point and corner points, the 
low and high level will previously change the level, Low level for Looper was around 70 and the high level 
was around 90. Still, Creel's low level was around 30 and a high level was around 70. We collected data 
between two variables one for Looper which has data of 70, 90,65,86,94.14, and 80 for the second is Creel 
also has data of 30,70,50,21.72, and 78.28, these two variables explained in a table. Also, we described the 
response of the contour Plot to see which kind of surface we will get and when it goes out of the focal point. 
Including what is the plot versus between all the creel, Looper and other responses.

Mahapatra and Mohanty highlighted the knowledge and understanding levels of Indian managers about the concept 
of lean manufacturing, its adaptability, the driving factors that lead to its adoption, benefits derived thereon and 
application of lean tools looking into operating environments (whether continuous or discrete). Their study finally 
concluded with a broad implementation framework for the application of lean manufacturing in continuous process 
industries by emphasizing its key areas of application. The similarities and differences in applying lean techniques to 
continuous and discrete part manufacturing are summarized below. 
 
Similarities to discrete manufacturing; 
 
• 
As a final output, the products produced are only discrete. 
• 
JIT and external setup concepts can be implemented. 
• 
5S implementation vis-à-vis tooling, cleaning, arrangement of accessories is possible. 
• 
Standardizing work procedures can be done. 
• 
Fool-proofing methods can be implemented. 
• 
The layout is similar to a line process. 
 
Differences from discrete manufacturing; 
 
• 
High volume, low variety products. 
• 
Long setup times. 
• 
Fixed routing and product flow paths. 
• 
Bulk of the work is flowing through different production machines whereas it is at the assembly-line in case 
of discrete manufacturing. 
• 
Lot size reduction is difficult. 
• 
It is very costly to shut down the process, once it is started. 
 
The advantages of implementing lean techniques in continuous industries are listed below; 
 
• 
Reduce variation in the processes and improve output. 
• 
Inventory and lead time reduction. 
• 
Decrease wastage of raw materials. 
• 
Improve setup time of the machines by external setups. 
• 
Increased use of equipment/improve capacity utilization

Abstract 
We analyze a single replicate of experimental design using Minitab, the idea is to determine what factors 
affect the production of the Trico factory.  form research we have four factors and they are as follows: The 
first factor is Guides and Guide Bar, the second factor Needle and Needle Bar, third factor Sinker and 
Sinker Bar, and Forth factor Pressor Bar. Using programmer productivity unites to measured responses to 
each of the variable combinations. we also go by starting going to a statistic from using the experimental 
analysis to name the factors with two-level factorial which they are either plus 1 or minus 1 and structure 
them by order A, B, C, and D. In this study we will determine the starting values using nonlinear regression. 
However, we got a  result of prediction is submitted to professional workers in the company to give an 
exact response for each run based on the real process to Plot the data to estimate and validate the response 
as Y vs X to find intercepts at X equal to zero then replot the data. However, we are using Minitab to 
compute values pf the model by using the trial estimates and plot the predicted values versus the original 
data we have. We will go through that the Libyan textile company has five industrial units, Woven carpet, 
Tufted carpet, Needlefelt carpet, Trico, and Matters. The capacity of annual productivity for Woven carpet 
is 284000 m², Tufted carpet is 620000 m², Needlefelt carpet is 2000000 m², and Matters is 70000 matters 
annually. The company should implant the Layout and Cycle time analysis and we have it in three points, 
first is the Minimize transit time, Simplify workflow, and Functionality.

Abstract 
Technologically advanced carpets are a definition of the Needlefelt carpet. This produced through the 
electrostatic attraction of individual fibers which combines to produce a unique carpet. Needle felt carpet 
specification and we design four factors (A, B, C, and D) each factor have tow data of Low and High 
nominal values. However, we create the factorial design with a two-level split-plot, and with full resolution 
designing 32 runs. Also, we came up with three HTC factors which are Product weight, Product thickness, 
and the third Rolls length. Besides, we end up with seven total factors with an easy one to change and the 
other three are difficult to change and we established all the factors in one table to have clear data. For the 
easy to change factor we have the Pareto chart, the first statistically significant factor is the amount of Rolls 
length a product variable and the second effect is product thickness, and the last is a mixture of process and 
product variable. We additionally made a table for Split-Plot Factorial Regression and have data from 
Response versus A, B, C, D Analysis of Variance. We want from this to be able to change the normal Plot 
of the hard to change factor to see the effect if it’s negative or positive.

Abstract 
Mattresses factory has four factors which been selected according to the High-speed automatic mattress 
quilting Sewing machine (WBSH-3). We implement variables of the growth of the textile in four groups 
(A, B, C, and D) and each has two-level on the Mattresses sector. However, from the data set, we have two 
categorical variables with Mattresses (Needle Gauge, Quilting Thickness/ Width, Speed, and Stitch Length) 
and there is four-level of Mattresses, also we do have Sewing Machine Factory which is for level two W, 
X, Y, and Z. The response is (Y) and the factor is the absolute variable is Mattresses. This means they are 
all equal which is the Needle Gauge means of Quilting Thickness/ Width mean of Speed mean of Stitch 
Length, they are equal the alternative hypothesis is that one is different. We analyze the variance of the P-
Value we used to sort of the interpret that is the null hypothesis or in our alternative hypothesis earlier on

Introduction 
A tremendous amount of research has been done to understand the mechanics associated with machining processes. 
Besides empirical or analytical methods, the advent of computers has allowed researchers to study machining through 
sophisticated numerical techniques. These include finite element modeling, molecular dynamics studies and recently 
multi-scale modeling. Despite the success in modeling 2-D and 3-D machining, there are still many challenges 
associated with modeling of machining processes. This section provides a quick review of each modeling technique. 
Finite Element Modeling (FEM) Formulations and Approaches 
This method has been the most popular method in machining simulation as chip geometry does not have to be 
predefined but rather develops as the cutting progresses, albeit it is dependent on a defined chip separation criterion. 
In FEM, three main formulations have been proposed for machining simulations: Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Arbitrary 
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods. 
Constitutive Materials Modeling 
Under machining conditions, generally, the workpiece is subjected to extreme deformation involving high levels of 
strain and strain rate and rapid temperature rise. The Norton–Hoff material model was applied by Monaghan and 
Brazil to model the machining of a particulate reinforced Metal matrix composites (MMC), while the J–C model has

Abstract 
Concerning the standards of Quality certification and Audits, the risk management appears more and more 
like a fundamental component. For example, in the ISO 9001 V2015, risk management is one of the major 
changes compared to the ISO 9001 V2008. In this article, we focus on risk management for the supply 
component of a logistics chain in the automotive sector; we are interested in the cases of international 
ALPHA companies that manufacture equipment for companies in the automotive industry. At first, we use 
the classic risk management approach and we show its limits. In a second step, we suggest an approach 
based on the AHP (Analytic Hiearchy Process) or the Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods to 
overcome the limits of the classical approach.

Introduction
The supply chain is the set of components or interrelated links that coordinate with the realization of the 
procurement, production and distribution activities see Figure 1. 
In particular, it is also about ""Coordination and collaboration with partners along the chain"" [4]. And according to 
Donald J et al., 2002 ""The SC or the supply chain is not a chain! It is a network of companies in interaction ""[1]. 
However, the term chain is the one most commonly used in logistics literature and terminology. It is indeed the 
""management of material, informational and financial flows through a network of organizations such as suppliers, 
manufacturers, logistics providers, wholesalers / distributors, retailers, etc., aimed at the production and distribution 
of delivery of goods or services to consumers ""[2] and [3]. 
   Figure 1: Overview of links in the supply chain 
The    concept o f    risks, other than those related to occupational health and safety, ISO 45001: 2018 [1], where the 
person is exposed to properties that are likely to cause harm, is an inherent and dominant concept are facing the 
organisms. 
It is primarily a business strategy that aims to achieve goals and make informed decisions. 
Most research consider the risk as purely negative and lead to undesirable results or consequences (Harland et al., 
2003, Manuj and Mentzer, 2008) [6], however the ISO 31000 standard applies to any type of risk, whatever its 
nature, whether its consequences are positive or negative. 
Risk is ""an effect of uncertainty on objectives, in other words, it is measured against an expected. It can be positive, 
negative or both, and treat, create or lead to opportunities and threats ""[5].

4. Suggestion an evaluation approach based on the ANP method 
 
AHP (Analytic hiearchy Process) is a multi-career method applied in the field of decision-making. In this method 
we use a hierarchical decomposition of the elements studied. In this approach, a hierarchical analysis comparing the 
elements studied is carried out which allows to deduce a classification of these different elements. In our case, the 
elements studied will be the risks identified in the identification phase. The main advantage of this approach lies in 
the relative comparison of one element with respect to another, for a given criterion. A relative comparison is often 
easier to perform than an absolute evaluation of a criterion. 
An overall comparison of the relative importance of the eight risks identified in paragraph 1 is given in Table 3. In 
this table, risk R1 is twice as high as risk R2, R4, R5 and R6.

Using the AHP method, we were able to make a relative comparison of one risk versus another. This relative 
comparison is easier to make than an absolute evaluation used in the classical approach. However, the AHP method 
does not make it possible to take into account any dependencies between the different risks. In order to integrate this 
dependence, we suggest using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. We are currently finalizing an in-depth 
study of the use of ANP in a supply chain risk assessment process.

Conclusion 
 
In this article, we presented a study on the limits of the classical risk assessment approach. In particular, we looked 
at the supply component of a supply chain and considered the case of a manufacturing company operating in the 
automotive sector. We have shown the limits of the traditional approach to risk management, especially at the stage 
of assessing these risks. The first limitation is due to the difficulty of the absolute evaluation of the criteria 
(Probability and severity) of a risk. We have suggested the use of the AHP method for easier assessment based on a 
relative comparison of risk criteria. The second limitation of the classical method concerns the fact that this method 
does not take into account the dependence between the risks. We suggest using the ANP method to integrate this 
dependency

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of Decision-Based Design (DBD) framework to a 
commercial product—a Foldable Hand Truck. This paper’s new contributions to DBD framework are the 
application of discrete choice analysis (DCA) in DBD framework that greatly simplifies the task of customer survey, 
resembles the real purchase behavior of the customers and reflects their preferences on the product design better, 
and recommendations for the utilization of the DBD framework in future product design applications. The selected 
application problem is a Foldable Hand Truck. In contrast with the conventional hand truck, a foldable hand truck 
can be folded and moved through the stairs. Also, the feature foldability saves a considerable amount of storage 
space.

1. Introduction
The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers follow when they are trying to solve a problem and 
design a solution for something (Tayal, 2013). According to the US Accreditation Board for Engineering and 
Technology (ABET), engineering design is defined as the process of devising a system, component, or process to 
meet desired needs. It is a decision-making process (often iterative), in which the basic science and mathematics and 
engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective (Tayal, 2013). The 
establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing, and evaluation are among the 
fundamental elements of the design process (Chen et al., 2012). 
Two steps constitute the engineering design, which are: (1) determining the possible design options and (2) choosing 
the best one (Li and Azarm, 2000). These steps seem simple but the problem is, for most products, the range of 
possible design options is literally infinite. Also, there is no single universally accepted design process. 
Traditional engineering design is conducted primarily with an engineering-centric viewpoint, with limited or no 
input from the other functional domains and thus establishing a one-way communication between different domains 
(Krishnan and Ulrich, 2001). Product development is carried out through a sequence of analysis, evaluation, 
modification, and refinement processes (Ohsuga, 1989). Thus customer preferences are ambiguously and 
incompletely incorporated in the engineering design specification resulting in sub-optimal solutions. Decision-Based 
Design (DBD) is an approach to engineering design that seeks to select an unambiguous design alternative from the 
available options by considering the inter-domain decisions so that the selected design maximizes the overall 
economic benefit of the organization. 
Furthermore, traditional selection approaches use a variety of multi-criteria decision-making methodologies which, 
at times, can cause problems resulting in irrational choices during the alternative selection stage (Ben-Akiva and 
Lerman, 1985; Hazelrigg, 1998). Assignment of weights and multi-attribute ranking are two common approaches 
where decisions based on multiple-criteria are to be made. But weights and ratings are subjective in nature, i.e., they 
are dependent on the decision maker's intuition, experience, and judgment (Chen et al., 2012). Also, they often 
become manipulated by the decision-maker to get favorable results. For example, an attribute can be given 
unusually high weight if it is positively correlated with the product's success. In the case of multi-attribute ranking,

4. Conclusions and Future Work 
In this research, the limitations of traditional approaches to engineering design and problems associated with the 
multi-criteria design methodologies have been elucidated. In this regard, the DBD methodology is seen as a remedy 
to these limitations which employs a single-criterion approach to design and select the preferred alternatives 
consistently and unambiguously. The customer survey was embedded with DCA so that it resembles closely with 
actual consumer buying behavior. Finally, the complete DBD process has been demonstrated by applying it to a new 
product design problem. 
DBD enables us to reflect customer preferences in the engineering design process of product development. 
However, difficulties may arise in situations where customers never used the product or customers are little 
familiarized with the product. This might occur during the development of a completely new type of product whose 
design has been radically changed. In these cases, customers may find it difficult to respond to the survey due to 
their lack of product knowledge which eventually may result in unreliable survey data. 
In some cases, the design specification may affect the marketing, inventory and distribution costs (Wassenaar et al., 
2005). For example, packaging costs may depend on the physical dimensions of the product. The impact of 
marketing, inventory and distribution cost can be incorporated in the DBD framework in the future. The DBD 
framework can be made robust by taking account uncertainty into the objective function, constraints and design 
variables. Thus Decision Based Robust Design can be another possible scope for future efforts to improve the 
framework.

Abstract 
Urbanisation and rapid development of the economy together with the enhancement of living standards 
has caused a dramatic increase in the generation of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). There are Municipal 
Solid Waste Management (MSWM) strategies already implemented in Sri Lanka. But it is noticeable 
that most of those were failed due to relevant authorities are being unable to contemplate the cultural 
factors when implementing MSWM strategies. Thus, this paper intended to derive a culture-based 
solution to MSWM in Sri Lanka through a broad literature review. The paper synthesises values, 
attitudes and behaviours as the main cultural manifestations which describes the cultural context of 
MSWM. Consequently, it has been identified, among Sri Lankans, there are negative attitudes and 
behaviours while holding positive values. According to the literature findings, there is a hierarchical 
order of the aforesaid cultural manifestations, whereas behaviours are influenced by the attitudes while 
attitudes are influenced by values. Yet, through the attitudes and behaviours, the positive values in 
MSWM are not reflected, in which highlighting the urge of having a thorough study on the dynamisms 
in the hierarchy of value-attitude-behaviour in Sri Lankan Context. Further, this paper discusses a cycle 
of value-attitude-behaviour hierarchy.

and the population linked with urbanisation (Karak et al. 2012; Hoornweg and Thomas 2000). Further, Eurostat 
(2003) explains that volume of MSW has a persistent growth than the Gross Domestic Production (GDP). A study 
done by Zhao et al. (2011) illuminates that with the increase in the generation of MSW, the composition of MSW 
is also drasticaly changing. Concequently, this MSW generation has led to different adverse environmental 
impacts, public health risks, many other socio-economic problems (Ramachandra et al. 2018). Further, this 
majorly affects for the management system of the MSW. The main reason behind this increase in the rate of MSW 
is the poor management of waste and Ogawa (2000) reported, this is due to the problems like absence of proper 
waste collection mechanisms, open dumping and deficiencies or absence of pollution control systems in burning 
waste and so on. Compared to developed countries, this situation is far more critical in developing countries, 
including Sri Lanka. The recent tragedy in Meethotamulla is one of the best examples for the poor MSWM 
practices in Sri Lanka (Mallawarachchi and De Silva 2017). Furthermore, the most recent issue in Arawakkalu 
waste dumping site which caused the collection of garbage in Colombo halted for three days is also can be 
identified as a result of poor decision making of authorities in MSWM (The Sunday Times 2019; News First 
2019). Factors like legal requirements, international influences, unplanned management, operational and

 Abstract 
Information technology (IT) departments play a vital role in organizations. In order to attain a campus-wide 
quality service in higher education institutions (HEI), the department must undergo continuous 
improvement. This paper is about an assessment on the quality of service rendered by the IT department by 
identifying the key issues it faced, determining the service gaps, and measuring service efficiency. Using 
SERVQUAL, it was found that gap scores for all five (5) dimensions yielded negative values, showing that 
all customer groups of the HEI thought that the IT department does not meet their expectations most 
especially in terms of empathy and reliability since those dimensions posted the highest negative scores. 
Upon review of service requests and service level objectives (SLO), it was found that five (5) services have 
performed below the target of 80% efficiency. Further, several key IT issues include information security, 
student access, institution wide IT strategy, data-enabled institutional culture, and IT staffing and 
organizational models. The department was also found to have difficulty in sourcing and retaining its IT 
personnel especially the key positions because of the fast-paced, ever-changing nature of the IT industry. 
This means that the HEI should develop programs to maintain employee loyalty and attract more IT 
professionals to serve the academic community.

1. Introduction
Information Technology (IT) plays a very important role in many businesses today. It is being employed in different 
areas of almost all sectors currently existing: manufacturing, retail and distribution, healthcare, banking, education, 
and others. Many companies build an IT department or at least use an IT infrastructure to reduce transaction cost [1, 
2], facilitate coordination of services and scheduling to support task management [3], improve knowledge sharing, 
and speed up the flow of information and communication [4]. This in effect brings harmony across all departments in 
the company because information exchange is made more accurate and convenient to do; helping the organization 
attain a sustainable competitive advantage [5, 6, 7]. Studies also show that IT helps increase employees’ creativity, 
innovation, and productivity [8, 9, 10].  
The use of IT in higher education spreads across the many services that an institution offers. It facilitates openness 
and exchange of knowledge but requires the community to value the importance of sharing and collaboration [11]. To 
facilitate learning and enable faster access to information, technological innovations such as digital libraries, 
computer-assisted instruction, and learning management systems are being used by both students and instructors. This 
kind of technology has given the students an opportunity to obtain out-of-class information which in turn helped 
increase their motivations for learning [12]. Online registration and grading systems, on the other hand, allow faster 
processing of transactions, help reduce inaccuracies, provide students real time data about their performance scores

3.4. IT Service Efficiency  
 
The SLOs prepared by the department indicate that customer requests should be resolve in two (2) business days after 
its initial report or application. Among the 595 tickets reviewed for this research, five (5) services or requests were 
found to have performed below the target of 80% efficiency. These include desktop application support (44.44%), 
network connectivity (56.25%), computer support (61.29%), system access (66.67%), and desktop application 
development (71.43%). The most evident reason for such inefficiency rooted to lack of available guide for users and 
lack of helpdesk personnel to accommodate the requests. This findings were also included in the identified key issues 
of the IT department. It is therefore very important to ensure having an adequate workforce so that target SLOs would 
be achieved.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
IT services have become an integral part of many organizations today, including many HEIs. Since technology is 
constantly evolving, there are plenty of opportunities to improve services in the field of IT in order to satisfy the 
growing needs of customers. This study utilized various methods of assessing the service efficiency level of the IT 
department in a subject HEI. The levels of services were determined using SERVQUAL assessment and review of the 
department’s SLO. It was found that the IT department failed to provide the expected quality of service from its three 
(3) customer groups since the gap scores computed for the five (5) dimensions yielded negative values. Further, the 
insufficient number of workforce greatly contributed to poor service efficiency. This means that the HEI should 
develop measures or programs to maintain employee loyalty and to attract more IT professionals to serve the academic 
community. Further studies including other customer groups not covered in this study may be explored in the future. 
This may include prospective students, parents, and alumni.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 (I4) has rapidly gained its importance across manufacturing industries over the globe. It can 
be seen as the fourth up-gradation of the Industry sector, which is competent to influencing entire 
business processes mainly at the designing, production and delivery stages. Accordingly, the key 
objective of this research is to identify the key enablers of I4 practices that facilitate its adoption across 
the Indian manufacturing industries. This study captures a unique set of ten key enablers with the help of 
existing literature. Further, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM)-fuzzy MICMAC was used to assess 
the interrelationship among key enablers and also compute a structural hierarchy. The primary result 
indicates that ‘Supportive government policies’ have a critical impact in implementing I4 practices from 
Indian perspective. This study may help policymakers and practitioners in the implementation of I4 
practices in the Indian perspective for sustainable business development.

Abstract 
 
This study deals with a quality control application in a furniture manufacturing company. Furniture 
manufacturing involves several wood cutting operations in specified dimensions. Based on our 
investigation in a selected sofa-manufacturing factory, we have observed that cutting operations are not 
done in accurate procedures and usually result in wood slabs, which deviate from standard dimensions. One 
of the reasons that wood cutting operations are not done as accurate as the metal cutting operations is 
because it is easy to recut the excessive part on the longer wood slabs, and to add a small piece to the wood 
slabs which is cut shorter. These types of simple remedies are not possible in metal cuts. While these extra 
processes do not appear to be significant, when they are added up in a mass manufacturing system, the 
waste in workers time, as well as in material usage, becomes substantial. 
 
We have investigated a specific sofa manufacturing system and developed some hypothesis testing 
procedures to prove to the management the significance of the cutting deviations from the standard 
requirements. Amount of waste in labor time and material usage are quantified for a selected manufacturing 
period. Furthermore, some quality control procedures, including control charts, are developed and 
implemented in the factory to control the cutting operations. The procedures and the results presented in 
this study can be used by managers as guidelines in furniture manufacturing industry to improve their 
cutting operations and minimize the waste.

 1. Introduction 
 
Dimensions of assembled products in furniture industry play an important role to decide how well the products have 
been manufactured. One of the important quality dimensions is quality of conformance. As indicated by Montgomery 
(2008), the quality of conformance is an indicator of how well the product conforms to the specifications required by 
the designer. The difficulty level of manufacturing processes rapidly increases with the level of complexity and 
aesthetic in furniture design, which essentially increases the cost of production. In order for a company to meet 
customers satisfaction, it should establish very high standards for each process within limitation of variability, which 
is inversely proportional to quality. To improve the quality, one must reduce the variation in quality characteristics.

6. Conclusion  
 
This project aims to improve the quality of sofa furniture production by implementing engineering statistics & quality 
control techniques to reduce process variability. This results in reducing excess material waste and opportunity loss, 
as well as increasing the level of perfection in order to meet customer requirements. Based on the study, we were able 
to address a significant analysis which could result in improvement of furniture manufacturing processes by applying 
statistical process control tools. Based on capability analysis, the company has huge opportunity to reduce financial 
burden by increasing the capability of production processes up to (1.25). Also, by applying quality control charts, 
company could be able to assure accurate monitoring of the process stability and eliminate erroneous results. 
 
As a further research, it is helpful to establish quantitative indicators to easily capture any sort of shifting of a certain 
process which can be used to cut off overhead cost significantly. Other quality attributes, in addition to length of strip 
wood cuts, should be monitored by control charts, which would play important roles in process monitoring in furniture 
industry. One of important measure that should be stringently controlled is the fabrics cut and sewn to fit the sofa 
units. A lot of wasted material and quality control problems can be seen in these processes and need detailed study 
and analysis. Such studies can minimize wasted fabric material, contribute to company profits and also economy of 
the country in general. Because of time limitations, this issue could not be included in this study.

A Simulation-based Optimization Approach to Facility-
Allocation under Demand Uncertainty and Enforced Level

Abstract 
Deciding on the number and configuration of distribution centers (DC) is one of the most impactful decisions that 
create a pathway for competitiveness and responsiveness. In this research, the allocation of distribution center problem 
is studied under demand uncertainty. The purposes of this study were to specify the optimal number and allocation of 
distribution centers out of candidate ones. This paper proposes a three-step model with probabilistically distributed 
demand where the coefficient of variation is the measure of risk along with the enforced level of service metrics that 
are focused on responsiveness which aligns with real-world problems and the considered company, working as a 
backward linkage of the fast fashion industry. To consider uncertainty, a set of scenarios for customer demands is 
created based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The best network structure is identified by optimizing each scenario and 
detecting which configuration has been observed the highest amount of times. Furthermore, the uncertainty of 
demands creates variations of the optimized total cost which is imposed on the logistical system. Notably, this research 
has been done in one of the oldest textile yarn distribution firms in Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
A supply chain consists of a set of tiers ranging from suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. 
Within these tiers, there is are flows of physical goods, financial transactions and movement of information with the 
objective of fulfilling the requirement of a customer (CTL.SCOx Spring 2017).  In a supply chain, the flow of products 
reaching up to the customers goes across multiple stages and each stage may include some facilities (Sabri & Beamon, 
2000). Supply chain design is the most cardinal and impactful decision that will influence the entire supply chain and 
due to the increase of competitiveness in markets, it has been obtaining much importance recently (Simchi-Levi & 
Kaminsky 2004; Thomas & Griffin 1996). It has become involuntary for firms to maintain customer service levels 
while they are obliged to reduce costs as much as possible and maintain profit margins at the same time. Distribution 
network design is considered as the primary key for making profits because it directly affects both the cost of supply 
chains as well as the satisfaction of the customers (Chopra 2003). As there is a significant amount of investment 
involved, the allocated facilities are expected to sustain their expected activities for a long period of time. Therefore, 
it is mandatory to design a well-performing supply chain network with some parameter variation across time to 
compete with the tight standards of the market (Santosa 2003).  
Supply chain design includes tactical decisions such as determining the number, location, and capacity of facilities in 
each stage of the supply chain. The location of facilities and the allocation of demands to them have been a prominent 
area for research. In fact, the configuration stability of a supply chain network is highly desirable since substantial 
investments are usually involved with this type of decision (Izadi & Kimiagari 2014). In this paper, the goal is to 
obtain a distribution network configuration that can cope with the future demand variations and achieve robustness in 
the network design taking into consideration the responsiveness or level of service (LOS) provided. In this case study,

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, a facility allocation model has been formulated in order to identify the optimal allocation of distribution 
centers out of candidate centers. The objective function was modeled to minimize the total cost that includes inbound 
transportation cost, outbound transportation cost, goods handling cost, fixed cost of opening a distribution center and 
sourcing cost of the goods. The model is formulated as a three-echelon supply chain model with demand uncertainty 
with two plants or goods sourcing points, five candidate distribution centers, and eleven aggregated customer zones.  
 
To represent the uncertainty of demands, scenarios have been generated using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique 
with the coefficient of variation. In the developed model it has been made sure that the average customer is not at a 
great distance as well as not a great number of customers is far away to impose the required level of service in the 
optimal outcome. The result gives us a probabilistic output that shows us that it would be optimal to open four 
distribution centers without the one that had the lowest optimal appearance with a probability of 84.2%.  
 
The uncertainty of demand that is taken into consideration in this study is generated because of the existing fierce 
bullwhip effect throughout the whole supply chain. Although the generated demand is the most visible and impactful 
area where unpredictability is present, other components of uncertainty can also be considered as an extension of this 
study. Furthermore, other additional elements of the level of service like the condition of the delivered product, after-
sales service and strict time windows for delivering the products can also be taken into account for future studies. 
Moreover, the objective of this model was to minimize the incurred cost for the considered element and multi-objective 
models might also be explored as an improvement of model formulation.

Abstract 
This paper presents a systematic review on halal supply chain (HSC) topic. HSC is a growing concept (since 
2008) as a spin-off from classic supply chain concept due to the increasing awareness of delivering halal 
products for Muslim as well as non-Muslim customers.  The study has reviewed 88 papers (65 empirical 
ones) and provides four main findings. Firstly, in term of theory, theory of planned behavior, theory of 
reasoned action, and arc of integration approach are the most theories used for studying HSC. Secondly, 
the choice of quantitative method dominates the empirical papers on HSC studies. Thirdly, the majority of 
HSC studies were conducted in Muslim countries with the food and beverage industries as the main studied 
sectors. Fourth, based on the results from social network analysis (SNA), the HSC studies are clustered into 
three research themes, namely HSC related issues, food issues, and supporting system issues. The study 
suggests future research agendas such as elaborating theoretical and methodological aspects by examining 
the three research themes. These would contribute to the HSC body of knowledge.

scenario (TGES) were developed using a computer tool kit LEAP from 2018 to 2050. The reference 
scenario was developed base on governments plan for renewable and sustainable power sector, while the 
three alternative scenarios were developed base on different policy settings in order to examine the 
reserves, demands, supply and emission impact of each of the scenarios. Also, the research compared 
some important energy policies existing in Germany with Nigeria. The results obtained showed that at 
2050, the business as usual scenario has the highest energy demand with about 1.3 million GWh , while 
the total green energy scenario has the least energy demand with about 0.9 million GWh. For the 
greenhouse gases, the business as usual scenario again has the highest level of greenhouse gases (GHG) 
with about 231 million ton carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) while the total green energy scenario has 
the least level of greenhouse gases with about 119 million tCO2e.

1. Introduction
The importance of energy cannot be over emphasized, as it is an integral part in the sustenance of societal 
development, economy, security and eliminating poverty of a nation. The availability or otherwise of an energy that 
is environmentally friendly, affordable and accessible naturally affects the total development of a country. Also, 
there are many issues such climate change, public health which affects a society that is also related to energy 
(Ramchandra et al. 2011). Strictly speaking, energy is important in all the sectors of a nation the per capita energy 
consumption, is a measure that is used in measuring the standard of life in any nation. The rise in standard of living 
and increase in population are the two main reasons that cause energy crises in the world. Ideally, the prosperity of a 
nation is measured base on its per capita income, which is measured base on the per capita energy consumption (Rai 
2004).

4. Conclusions   
 
This research work developed four different scenarios namely the Business as usual, Mild renewable energy, 
Extreme renewable energy, and Total green energy scenarios based on different policy settings to make a 
comprehensive forecast report on the energy sector in Nigeria. The demand, supply and emission impact of each of 
the scenarios was examined under different scenarios. The results obtained from each of the scenarios showed that 
by 2050, business as usual scenario will have the highest energy demand, followed by the mild renewable energy 
scenario and extreme renewable energy scenario while the total green energy scenario has the least energy demand 
due to high level of implementation of renewable energy policies and energy efficiency techniques being adopted in 
all the four sectors i.e. residential, industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. Also, the level of GHG emission 
was observed to be very high in the reference scenario while the green optimistic energy scenario has a very low 
level of GHG emission in 2050 due to aggressive policies taking by government in retirement of fossil based fuel 
technologies and full implementation of energy efficiency in virtually all sectors.

area of factory premises is 477,225𝑚𝑚2 which includes factory buildings, utility buildings, stores, hangers, residential 
camps, customs yard, administration building, car workshop, central workshop, etc. The factory buys its raw wool 
directly from farmers and sheep projects that belong to the government. These projects are in the middle region of 
Libya, which Wool textile company is a part of, and can be considered as a rich source of wool compared with other 
parts of Libya. It is one of the few factories which is still operating today. It is the leading company in carpet 
manufacturing. The objective of the wool Textile Company is to meet the demand of the Libyan market of the carpet 
and floor covering and export the surplus. This aim is achieved by utilizing the Libyan raw wool in this industry. The 
products of wool Textile Company are very high quality, of classical and modern designs with very attractive colors 
which makes Wool Textile Company a very well-known name in Libya and the Baniwaild carpet is the pride of Libya.

Abstract 
In this study, we reviewed the history of textiles in North Africa also will determine the Processes either 
add value or waste to the production of a good or service. Initially, we have collected all the information 
for Libyan Textile Company starting from overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, over-
processing, motion, defects, workforce underutilization, and improper utilization of technology of our ten 
wastes in manufacturing. Analytically modeled using a comprehensive computer simulation model that has 
been created using Rockwell software (ARENA14.7) in order to test the solutions for experimentation and 
enhancing of the company. In this experiment we will compare two different colored yarns in the woven 
carpet factory, factors might have a cause and effect relationship in Libyan textiles. Woven carpet is very 
much similar to a woven cloth and is produced on a loom only. Different colored yarns are used to produce 
intricate designs and patterns. In this experiment, we will use repeated T-Test or paired T-Test to compare 
colored yarns. In this paper, we will consider these to be paired data samples (intricate designs and patterns) 
because each pair of values in each row represents a unique product from different colored yarns woven 
W1, W2, W3, and W4. To compare the mean values we will use paired T-Test.

Carpet and fabric is a common floor covering in today’s homes and offices. The first carpets characterized by pile 
surfaces were probably cured animal skins laid on the dwelling floors of early hunters. Those floor coverings served 
many of the functions that floor coverings serve today.  It’s not easy to find out the exact time where textile discover, 
during the 4th or 5th millennium BC, floor coverings were plaited rushes as showing on Figure.1 from Acacus Caves 
and Tassili Caves in Libya. Early Libyan colonists made rugs and Jarad using (Mizda) a variety of techniques including 
knitting, crocheting, and braiding embroidering, and hooking. Hand-knotting is carried out on a simple loom as shown 
in Figure 2.

Abstract 
The study evaluated the impact of the ISO 9001:2008 International Quality Management Standard 
on Project Success. Project success was defined from the viewpoint of the contractor; and Cost, 
Billing, Profitability, Schedule, Quality, Safety and Environmental performance are measures of 
project management success.  Case study research was conducted in a South African construction 
firm which evaluated the impact of the ISO 9001:2008 International Standard on two projects 
within the firm. Data collection was enabled through document review, a survey and performance 
index calculations. The ISO 9001:2008 clauses that were determined to have the most impact on 
project success were ISO Clause 4 Quality Management System and ISO Clause 5 
Management Responsibility. The case study projects were also deemed successful by the 
determination of the Project Management Success performance indices, using actual project data.

Quality Management System and Project Success 
1. Introduction
Construction is comprised of various professions and production processes that present difficulties in 
ensuring quality assurance (Pheng and Teo, 2003). Traditional approaches toward the management of quality 
within the construction sector were deemed inadequate to address the needs of modern day projects and society 
(Rounds and Chi, 1985). Currently, as quality management systems become mandatory for construction firms 
to bid on both public and private projects (Aichouni, Ait Messaoudene, Al-ghonamy and Touahmia, 2014), the 
allure of having a certified ISO 9001 quality management system for external benefits only, such as marketing 
purposes, and not invest in the system’s further development within the company, has hindered the perception 
and effectiveness of quality management systems (Sampaio, Saraiva and Rodrigues, 2009). Furthermore, within 
the quality assurance community, the assumption that implementing the ISO 9001 International Standard 
aids in the increase of a project’s performance remains to be proven (Samsudin, Ayop, Sahab and Ismail, 
2012).  
The argument surrounding the value of ISO 9001:2008 certification presented the problem statement of 
the research, namely “To what extent does the ISO 9001:2008 international standard contribute towards 
project success in a construction firm within South Africa?”. The objectives of the research were to determine 
how the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system contributes to project success in a selected construction 
firm in South Africa; and which ISO 9001:2008 clauses have the highest impact on project success.  To enable 
these objectives, it was necessary to determine the composition and measurement of project success. 
2. Literature Review
The literature reviewed previous research regarding quality management systems, the ISO 9001 
International Standard and Project Success.  
2.1 Conceptualization – ISO 9001 International Standard 
The conception of the ISO 9000 series occurred during the system quality paradigm shift, where the need arose 
for the standardization of formal quality management systems (Weckenmann, Akkasoglu and Werner, 2015). 
ISO stands for the “International Organization for Standardization” and is a recognized global federation of 
national standard bodies (ISO 9000, 2005). The headquarters of ISO are based in Geneva, Switzerland.

Top management commitment is seen as a leading critical success factor towards successfully achieving quality 
management implementation (Patil et al. 2012). Top management oversee four key aspects that affect quality 
performance, namely: Setting of policies inclusive of the quality policy, sovereignty over resources, training of 
human resources and the allocation of project managers to projects (Jha and Iyer 2006). Furthermore, the study 
intends to improve the existing project management practices within the construction sector by identifying 
objective quantifiable measures of Project Success. 
 
6.2. Research Study Limitations 
 
The major limitation of this study is that a single case study does not allow generalisation of the results to other 
construction companies in South Africa. Nevertheless, the study applied rigorous methods of multiple data 
collection and analyses strategies which enhanced the reliability and validity of the findings. 
 
6.3. Future Research 
 
Additional empirical research and investigation needs to the conducted to substantiate the impact that the ISO 
9001 International Standard has on Project Success, particularly within the construction sector of South Africa. 
Possible future research can be conducted on the impact that the newly revised ISO 9001:2015 International 
Standard has on Project Success. The research design should aim at including construction companies of various 
sizes and operating in diverse sectors of the economy, while still ensuring multiple methods of data collection. In 
this way, variations in the success factors can be adequately accounted for.

Abstract 
The problem investigated in this research was that the vast majority of the manufacturing 
practices in Bangladesh are being invariably dealt with little or no regard for the current field-
tested paradigm of what is called responsible manufacturing practices, which addresses the socio-
economic milieu while adding value in every step of the process itself. The prime objective of 
this experimental research was to compare the effect of responsible manufacturing instructional 
design interventions in the socio-economic intersection to foster sustainability and hence 
maximizing wealth. A case study based on Action Research has been deployed in the 
investigation. Results signified that responsible manufacturing practices statistically improved 
firms’ performance in the value-based propositions compared to the traditional method both in 
tangible & intangible terms. In brief, the very practice significantly improved firms’ attitude, 
satisfaction, motivation and perception towards reconstructing sustainability by balancing the 
wider set of trade-offs that lies within.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Study 
Increasingly, organizations are interested in managing corporate social responsibility (CSR) and 
sustainability as part of their operations management (OM). OM practices and research must respond to 
demands to address sustainability. This response is triggered by climate change and other environmental 
concerns, the well-being of workers and communities, and other broad social demands. Sustainable OM is 
defined as the pursuit of social, economic and environmental objectives – the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) – 
within operations of a specific firm and operational linkages that extend beyond the firm to include the 
supply chain and communities. Bangladesh, over the years, has been tagged as a cheap manufacturer of 
Apparel and the like! No high-end brands, generally, come into Bangladesh to place order solely because of 
the fact that the work norm is not up-to-the-minute that touches the issue of Triple Bottom Line whilst

The main limitation of this study pertains to the lack of interviews conducted directly with the firms in the 
related industries through the agencies surveyed, which could generate direct information from the end of 
the communication channel for significant analysis. One should also consider the very exploratory nature of 
the study, which, despite not supporting generalizations, can still provide consistent evidence from direct 
field research with firms from other countries. As this study paper has been conducted only for research 
purpose, which is why, the main constraints were cost and time. For the in-depth analytical purpose, 
adequate time and financing are required. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
Milton Friedman (1970) argued that ""the business of business is business"", and that the foremost concern of 
organizations should be profit, and not CSR and sustainability issues. However, many CEOs reported that 
sustainability issues are rising on their agendas (HBR, 2010). It would seem that much sustainable OM 
research is still driven by the profit paradigm, linking sustainability with organizational and financial 
performance. Are sustainability initiatives only of value if they lead to a profit or competitive advantage? 
Or are responsible business practices a worthwhile endeavor regardless of profits? Although Bangladesh 
has achieved noteworthy success with respect to all three pillars of sustainable development, yet, much 
more are needed to be done in relation to constructing a pathway for an accelerated development of the 
country. 
 
Responsible manufacturing model is in a position to lead the business disciplines in sustainability research 
and practice. This paper continues the sustainability leadership position of Responsible manufacturing 
practices. Given this situation, we look forward to seeing the exciting developments in sustainable 
manufacturing with a view to shifting the attention of the world market towards Bangladesh. Failing to do 
so might as well prove disastrous for Bangladesh. And, it has never been more an uphill task for countries, 
as in Bangladesh in this fragmented world. Responsible manufacturing fueled by sustainability issues 
would capture the bold change that business seeks to create in the world. Infusing the model under question 
requires a strategic choice in the context of Triple Bottom Line. And in turn, it helps prioritize, differentiate 
and design more exceptional experiences in the long run.

Abstract 
This paper aimed to analyze the wind speed distribution and variability in Saudi Arabia with emphasis on the city of 
Riyadh using two different methodologies to estimate the Weibull scale and shape parameters: Weibull Least Squares 
and Weibull Openwind. Data collected from a local meteorological measurement data provided by King Abdullah 
City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE), over a period of one year were used to statistically analyze wind 
speed distributions. Results show that the agreement rate increases with the frequency of observations and the suitable 
heights for installing wind turbines machines in future applications were found to be  64.6 m and 79.8 m. 
Keywords 
Wind energy, Riyadh, Weibull Parameters, and Wind Power Density. 
1. Introduction
In Saudi Arabia, more than 15% of the domestic oil production is used to generate electricity, and another 50% is 
consumed by electric power plants. KAPSARC reported (KAPSARC, 2018) that around 50% of the total electricity 
consumption in the building's stock comes from the energy consumption. In its vision 2030, Saudi Arabia set a target 
in its national transformation program on renewable energy and redirect the oil and gas exploration to other higher

5. Conclusion 
 
This paper provides a strong background for possible future investment in wind energy in the region of Riyadh. Two 
mathematical methods for Weibull parameters estimation have been estimated numerically and graphically to simulate 
wind speed data obtained from measurement data provided by K.A.CARE. Results obtained using  the two  methods, 
namely the Weibull Least Squares and the Weibull Openwind compared quiet well with the experimental data 
obatained from K.A.CARE. The use of Weibull distribution indicates that the region of Riyadh might be suitable for 
installing wind turbine machines. , The monthly average wind speed and frequency distribution of wind speed in 
Riyadh has been plotted and analyzed for a possible deployment of wind power in Riyadh.

Abstract 
A smart energy meter is one of the smart city applications that record, monitor, control, analyze, and predict in-house 
energy consumption. Although smart energy meters have great capabilities, this technology is still in very early stages 
in many developing countries, and little is known about users’ trust in this technology and what perceived values are 
associated with trust from users’ perspectives. Therefore, this research aimed to fill this gap by examining the influence 
of four different types of perceived values on residents’ trust in smart meters in UAE. By following a quantitative 
approach, 266 survey responses were tested by using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares. The 
statistical results genuinely indicated that perceived epistemic values significantly impact emotional values, monetary 
values and convenience values, and that emotional values, monetary value and convenience values significantly 
influence users’ trust in smart energy meters. In addition, the three perceived values of monetary, emotional and 
convenience also play a significant mediating role between perceived epistemic values and trust in smart energy 
meters. Theoretical and practical implications are indicated, and directions of future research are specified afterwards. 
Keywords 
Convenience values, Emotional values, Epistemic values, Monetary values, Trust in smart meters. 
1. Introduction
IoT (Internet of Things) technologies are ubiquitous nowadays, and they have different applications and services 
(Shuhaiber, Mashal, & Alsaryrah, 2019a). As one example, smart metering system is an integrated solution for 
recording, monitoring and controlling energy consumption rates at homes. They do not only measure the energy 
consumption, but also send the status wirelessly to the energy supplier company, which means there is will be longer 
a need to read the meter readings manually. In its simplest form, the smart metering system consists of two devices: a 
smart energy meter of electricity and a separate In-Home Display device – IHD (Shuhaiber, 2020a). The smart meter 
sends real time data about the current usage of energy from different devices to the IHD which displays the consumption 
rates in 24/7, and the display instantly shows how much energy in use and how much it costs.  
The smart meter, therefore, can provide many benefits to users from several aspects: (a) providing helpful automated 
visual readings of daily energy consumption that can help users in making decisions associated with their energy usage 
behavior, (b) helping users in utilizing power resources efficiently by balancing electric loads while reducing power 
outages (Gianniou, Reinhart, Hsu, Heller, & Rode, 2018) (c) mining the frequent patterns and data association 
generated from the smart meters (Reddy, Chakravarthy, ReddiNeelima, & Zion, 2018),  (d) enabling users for better 
controlling and forecasting energy loads in regular basis (Fallah, Deo, Shojafar, Conti, & Shamshirband, 2018). This 
is also associated with enabling dynamic pricing and contributing in optimizing income with existing resources, and 
(e) avoiding technical, legal, ethical and social issues associated with device malfunctioning, energy leaking and
unjustified high bills, government bribery, energy thieving, and others (Shuhaiber, 2018).
2. Previous Studies
Perceived benefits are considered the root construct of performance expectancy and other relevant constructs, such as 
perceived usefulness, motivation, Job-fit, and perceived outcomes that include the advantages and benefits of a specific 
kind of technology (Shuhaiber, 2020b). However, some other factors are directly associated with perceived values, such 
as perceived monetary values, perceived convenience, perceived social values, perceived environmental values, and

5. Conclusion 
It is noteworthy that the strongest path in the research model is the influence of perceived epistemic value on monetary 
value (β = 0.643), whereas perceived monetary value scored the lowest value in affecting trust in this technology (β = 
0.156), but it was still found a significant path on 5% confidence interval. The amount of variance explained by R² 
provides an indication of the model fit as well as the predictive ability of the endogenous variables. The R² scores should 
be greater or equal to 0.10 (Hair et al., 2016). As a result, the R² value of ‘Trust’ was found moderate and equal to 
56.8%. Other R² scores are presented and shown in Figure 1. Overall, the four dimensions of perceived values are found 
to have a significant influence on either trust in smart meter in a direct or indirect way. Perceived epistemic value

Abstract 
The expansions of global population, increasing water demand, along with recent climate changes and 
scarceness of natural water sources, have caused the increment need of seawater desalination worldwide. 
Much attention has been paid in the water desalination literature to optimize the unit processes of a single 
desalination plant and its operations. Nevertheless, there are few researches considered evaluating the 
desalination supply chain as a whole, more particularly closed-loop supply chain. Examining the water 
desalination process as a closed-loop supply chain allows decision makers to evaluate the performance of 
water desalination operations end to end. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a performance 
measurement model for closed-loop supply chain in water desalination industry. The research methodology 
is based on literature analysis concerning performance measurement in closed-loop supply chain to be 
applied for companies belonging to the water desalination industry. Since the study focuses on a specific 
industry, this could be seen as a limitation. The proposed model could serve as a reference for the 
desalination industry to establish applicable performance appraisal indicators. It is believed that both 
researchers and practitioners would benefit from the model developed.

1. Introduction
Water is one of the most significant substances in earth. Although water covers almost 75 percent of the earth’s surface, 
yet the lack of drinkable water is one of the major challenges to be resolved globally (Al-Nory & Graves 2013). It is 
essential that the water which people drink and use for different purposes is fresh water. The number of the population 
who resides in regions where physical water accessibility is restricted, as in arid areas, exceeds 1.2 billion (United 
Nations, 2015). In addition, the number of the population who resides in regions where they do not have the monetary 
means to extract an adequate portion of fresh water exceeds 1.6 billion (United Nations, 2015). Therefore, finding an 
appropriate method to face this water shortage dilemma is critical nowadays.  
Desalination has been considered globally as a feasible solution to the scarcity of fresh water shortage problem. 
Different forms of water, such as seawater, brackish water and ground water, can be pe processed through desalination. 
The seawater desalination sector has been developing progressively for the recent decades with plenty of additional 
desalination plants constructed every year. The overall capacity of desalination plants worldwide reached 80.9 million 
m³/d by the end of 2013. This showed a dramatic increase since the desalination capacity was appraised by 52.8 million 
m³/d in 2008 and only 5 million m³/d in 1980 (Ghaffour et al., 2013). Furthermore, the overall desalination market 
surpasses USD 31 billion in 2015 with more than 16,000 desalination facilities worldwide (Menichetti et al., 2019). 
The management of supply chain (SC) activities focuses on the question of how best to match supply to demand 
(McCormack et al. 2008). The value of SC perspective comes from the capability of planning or assessing at a system 
level rather than at a component or unit level. In essence, the SC perspective aims to go beyond sub-optimization.

5. Conclusion 
Shortage of fresh water is one of the major challenges for life in earth planet. Even countries which do not suffer from 
water scarcity at the current time might experience water shortages in the near future due to population growth, climate 
change and desertification. Therefore, seawater desalination has been realized as a feasible solution to water shortage 
problem. It is important to assess the performance of water desalination operations holistically by considering the 
seawater treatment process by desalination plants as well as the process of providing the desalinated water to 
consumers. The focus on closed-loop SC is a step towards the wider adoption and expansion of sustainability, since 
the SC considers the product starting from its initial processing of raw materials up to the delivery point to consumers. 
This study has proposed a performance measurement model to evaluate and ultimately enhance the closed-loop SC 
performance in seawater desalination industry. Based on the literature review, the collected performance metrics were 
distributed into BSC model perspectives which are financial, customer, internal processes, and learning & innovation 
as well as environment to construct the performance model for the closed-loop water desalination supply chain. This 
research contributed to further understanding the nature of seawater desalination industry and allow for refinement of 
future research. Moreover, this research is likely going to help stakeholders of the industry by fostering a better 
understanding of the impact of SCM toward the closed-loop water desalination performance. The decision makers 
should be able to know the story of current performance through digits and graphs and how to enhance it in future.

Abstract 
In recent times, the world has experienced the rising importance of environmental friendliness in the textile 
and apparel industry. Examples of organizations such as Patagonia, Walmart, etc. signify this phenomenon. 
Motivated by this issue, here we design a dyadic environmental friendly textile supply chain comprising 
one apparel manufacturer and one apparel retailer under price and environmental friendliness sensitive 
demand. First, we design the supply chain under a centralized and a decentralized setting using wholesale 
price contract. Here, we determine the optimal greening level, wholesale price, retail price of the apparel. 
Then, we propose two mechanisms, i.e., cost-sharing and profit-sharing approach between the apparel 
manufacturer and the apparel retailer to improve the greening level of the apparel. Under these mechanisms, 
we determine the optimal greening level, wholesale price, retail price of the apparel. With the help of 
comparative analysis, we show that the greening level and the profitability of the supply chain members 
increase under these mechanisms compared to that under wholesale price contract, whereas profit-sharing 
mechanism emerges as the best option for both. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of the customer’s 
green sensitiveness and the cost of greening production on the decision variables mentioned above.

Abstract 
In India, over two decades the technical industries unique selling proportion has been that, with its wide 
infrastructure of technical institute, it  is capable of supplying best in class engineers. But recently this claim does 
not hold water. According to All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) about 2.6 lakhs mechanical 
engineers are graduated every year in India. But the real count of industry ready mechanical  engineers is 
approximately less than 7%, hence there is a need to assess the quality of engineering education in India to reduce 
the flaws in the higher education. The purpose of the paper is to find the various defects associated with the 
technical education and eliminate those defects using various quality tools. This research is based on six sigma 
technique ,which is used to assess the quality  criteria proposed by National Board of Accreditation India (NBA). 
The proposed model is then applied in a typical tier II Indian engineering college located in south India. Six Sigma 
has mainly two methodologies DMAIC and DFSS. The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) 
methodology is implementing for existing system whereas DFSS(Design For Six Sigma) is for assuring quality in 
new products. In this project  the conclusion is driven by DMAIC methodology. Various statistical and non 
statistical tools are employed in this research. The tools used are CTS-CTQ, SIPOC, Pareto chart, Normal process 
capability analysis, one way ANOVA, Ishikawa diagram, FMEA, RCBD, and SPC chart. All the statistical process 
are done  using Minitab analytical software. From the results it is identified that the factors which are having (Risk 
Priority Number) RPN greater than 300 needs improvement, such as versatility in program curriculum, laboratories

1. Introduction
We are living in a competitive world which is giving more priority to quality in most aspects. Six Sigma have been 
effectively implemented in engineering, retail and healthcare sectors for reducing the defects. Currently, the 
researcher are focusing on implementing six sigma in an unlikely location ie the educational sector. Six Sigma will 
assist in  enhancing  the structures which build up the education sector. As the parents, faculties, policymakers and 
global economic factors begin to place more emphasis on developing quality education, educational establishments 
will depend even more strongly on the Six Sigma approach to provide the best potential guidance for reducing the 
defects in educational sector. As in the global sense we can define the term ‘Quality’ as “Quality is the ability of a 
product or service to consistently meet or exceed customer expectations”. The evolution of Six Sigma is from the 
inspection. In this Six Sigma project the customers are Industries, Society, Parents & Institutions.(Joseph . et al

Abstract 
Industrialization and globalization affect the world's view of carrying out the economy. The company 
cannot conduct business as usual because of the openness of international markets and information. 
Increasing population, cultural change, economic movements throughout the world are the effects of both 
of these. Rapid changes to consumer needs and product diversity make market conditions more competitive. 
Every country in the world competes to become the most competitive economy by increasing its 
competitiveness to survive in the era of globalization so that, national competitiveness becomes an 
important point for all countries in the world. The purpose of this paper is to identify gaps from previous 
studies for contributing new research ideas. This paper adopts a systematic literature review method to find 
out the state of the art based on general characteristics (conceptual and measurement), solution methodology 
and strategic level. This paper contributes to give a new idea in competitiveness research, which categories 
that are useful for solving competitiveness problems at each level, including International, National and 
Firm

1. Introduction
Industrialization is a process that produces products using mechanical and chemical-mechanical expertise 
with specific resources (Biernacki, 2001). Industrialization is also marked by the increasing use of technology and 
changes in the way of the view of the company accompanied by an increase in population, urbanization, cultural 
differences, and shifts in power between countries. Therefore, industrialization is essential in human welfare (O'Brien, 
2001) 
At present, in every country dealing with the so-called globalization era. Globalization is changing the way 
companies do their business as usual because of the openness of international markets, openness of information, the 
use of low resource costs in developing countries and efficient supply chain systems. This incident makes 
Globalization affect all lines of life such as economic, social and political throughout the world (Chatha & Butt, 2015; 
Kuivanen, 2008; Manyika, 2012; Scapolo, Geyer, Boden, Dory, & Ducatel, 2003) 
The manufacturing industry faces market uncertainty, product diversity and changing customer needs very 
quickly when market conditions become very competitive (Chatha & Butt, 2015; Manyika, 2012). At the same time, 
environmental issues become very important to consider (Chatha & Butt, 2015; Garetti & Taisch, 2012; Kuivanen, 
2008; Qiu, 2009; Scapolo et al., 2003). The changes that almost occurred in all these lines have made every country 
in the world compete to become the most competitive economy by increasing national competitiveness to build global 
competitiveness and be able to survive in the era of globalization (Fahy, 2002; Setyawan, 2011). National 
competitiveness is one of the critical points for the government and industry of a country, also expressed by (Dong-
sung & Hwy-Chang, 2013).

 Abstract 
This study explored the correlation of hand preference to brain dominance of senior high school students 
(SHS) in the Philippines using the Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) questionnaire. Students 
were asked to accomplish the questionnaire and their scores were evaluated to confirm the theory of Sperry 
(1981) which suggested that the brain dominance of a person is lateral to his hand preference. Further, the 
characteristics of students in the four (4) academic strands for SHS were also assessed to verify if students 
have chosen the appropriate track that could enhance their skillset as individuals. Results revealed that 
Sperry’s theory was conclusive since most of the students with right hand preference demonstrated left-
brain dominance and possessed the characteristics of being analytical, logical, and critical thinkers which 
are appropriate for the academic track they were enrolled in while students with left-hand preference are 
creative thinkers and artistic and exhibited dominance of the right side of the brain. Students who posses 
the character of being logical and have above average ability in mathematics and problem solving may 
pursue careers in science, technology, and engineering since these professions require analysis of data, 
perform various calculations, and create innovative designs. Consequently, the study will aid not only the 
students in finding the best profession suited for them in the future but will also help the teachers in 
assessing the profiles of their students to identify the suitable teaching methodologies in the classroom.

1. Introduction
High school students all over the world encounter problems on finding the right career path and program that will suit 
their personality and skills or raise awareness on their academic track. Students commonly display limited awareness 
and substantial belief ambiguity, especially regarding lower-ranked options thereby showing significant heterogeneity 
in students’ initial knowledge and learning patterns across demographics and socioeconomic characteristics 
(Giustinelli and Pavoni, 2017). Students strive in conceptualizing their future or preferred career because of lack of 
comprehension on their skills, peer pressure, and financial incapacity. Social researchers like Bancroft, A. et al. (2017) 
observed the generalization danger --- which is the phenomenon of “being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, 
a negative stereotype about one's group” --- in academic settings. In another study, Korkmaz (2015) pointed out several 
factors that are considered to affect the career choices of high school students and these include: gender, parents' 
educational level, family income, and school type. While the different academic programs all over the world help and 
guide students of their career paths to take, it is still a challenge of how precise these tend to be. In the Philippines,

The results for HUMSS students for right hand preference has a p-value of 0.192, as presented in in Table 7. This 
suggests that there is no significant difference between the two variables. In this group, their skillset or character 
involving the left side of the brain is seen as contradicting to their chosen academic track. The high p-value suggests 
that the connection between the means of the given data have no relationship to one another.

Consequently, responses of left-handed students yielded a p-value is 0.006 which is less than the significance level of 
0.05. The result shows high significant difference between the two means. Left-handed people tend to be more creative 
or artistic therefore majority of them are right-brained. As explained, HUMSS is an academic track that focuses on 
logic, language, and critical thinking of the students. It shows that the theory proves that majority of the HUMSS 
students are on the right academic track since they chose the program that is related to their skillset.

Finally, for GAS, the p-value of 0.766 was computed for students who are right-handed, and no student preferred to 
be left-handed. Students who are enrolled in this track are still undecided to which career they would like to pursue. 
In summary, a high p-value for this group suggests uncertainty in students’ characteristics.

The result can help students enhance their skillset and take up courses that would eventually fall on what dominant 
brain side they have. Numerous electives from the other strands are offered to the students of this strand to further 
enhance their abilities and help them decide which career path they should follow. The theory can serve as a guide in 
finding the suited profession that matches their mindset and that can complement the skills they acquire.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The theory stating that individuals may be left-brained or right-brained means that people in general have specific 
skillset unique to the activities of the brain. The working theory of Split- Brain Experiment of Sperry suggested that 
the brain dominance of a person is lateral to his hand preference. Following this theory, this study centered on the

comparison of academic skills of students enrolled in the various academic strands in Senior High School education 
in the Philippines. Examination results of selected group of students revealed how majority appropriately selected the 
specific track they are in where 84.42% with right hand preference and 42.86% with left hand preference for STEM 
students and 78.38% and 40% of the right and left handed, respectively, for ABM students demonstrated dominance 
of the brains’ left hemisphere, a character appropriate for those who are analytical logical, and critical thinkers. On 
the other hand, 65% of the right-handed and 100% of the left-handed students in HUMSS track exhibited dominance 
of the right side of the brain, suitable for careers in journalism, communication arts, liberal arts, education, and other 
social science-related profession of students who are artistic, creative, and imaginative. Finally, students enrolled in 
the GAS strand, who are all right-handed, displayed contrasting characters since half of them have dominant right side 
and another half with dominant left side. This suggests that students in this group may take careers either in 
engineering, technology, journalism or social science profession in the future. 
 
Future researchers may explore on correlating the dominant brain side to the academic scores or grades of students to 
create a profile on which field their motor skills are mostly accustomed to, and for these students to fully develop their 
expertise. Using the academic scores or grades, researchers can create a comparison on the connection of their 
dominant hemisphere to their grades in different courses that varies among skillsets from both brain side. Another 
subject to consider is involving the junior high level for them to know which of the senior high academic track best 
suited their abilities and character. Exploring these studies can help students assert their personal traits and relate those 
to their academic skillset which would be beneficial in continuing a path or career suitable for them may it be in the 
fields of engineering, medicine, and architecture, or the shift to the aesthetics of creative arts and literature.

 Abstract 
The advancement of technology required most organizations today to utilize an integrated information 
system. The use of such system was proven to help improve different types of processes through elimination 
of delays and minimizing errors. This study was conducted to optimize the scheduling of room reservation 
of a higher education institution in the Philippines which was found to be highly manual, time consuming, 
and tedious. Different units were responsible for the management of various rooms and their office locations 
were scattered around the campus that required too much traveling activities. Similarly, delays were also 
experienced due to availability issues of the concerned and authorized personnel who will approve the usage 
of rooms. Through information system design, an online system called eReserba Cardinal was created to 
facilitate ease of room management, provide real-time information, and offer a convenient manner of room 
reservation for students, faculty and personnel.

1. Introduction
The use of information technology aids a lot of industry nowadays to achieve a more accurate, efficient, and faster 
processing of information, and data management is one of the core functions of information systems. Gandomi and 
Haider (2015) emphasized that data management includes processes and technologies to acquire, store, prepare and 
retrieve data for analysis and the primary goal of automating manual processes is to minimize time. Improving 
processes, especially in enrolling customers or reserving for a facility is very significant to organizations that provide 
such services like hospitals, hotels, banks, schools, and others. Booking methods of time-based services at present 
have migrated from the traditional manual and phone method to computer-assisted practices; and most online booking 
facilities are typically service and web specific (Moore, 2008).  
Incorporating information systems and technologies in college education is beneficial to professors and students since 
it allows both parties to perform well. Information systems and technologies does not only benefit professors and 
students but the higher education institutions (HEI) as well because of market-efficient management of resources and 
the business (Martins, et al. (2019). Further, involving computers and information systems in school facilities such as 
in libraries, in enrolment system and in grading system basically shows that people have become more dependent on 
information systems to survive (Koyluoglu, et al., 2015). This just makes everything very accessible and convenient 
for the people around the institution which results to a good performance when there is a good facility (Puchol, et al., 
2017). 
Facility reservation in most HEIs, specifically for usage of rooms, follow the ‘pen and paper’ system. Proper 
management of such facilities is a must since those are regarded as important components in providing quality

the users. By design, eReserba Cardinal would eliminate common problems in manual documentation system and 
unavailability of personnel in-charge and will provide proper coordination and communication between the requestor 
and facility managers. Several entities were identified to utilize the proposed system and these include the requestor 
or user, faculty adviser, the department dean, personnel or staff in-charge, directors of the various departments 
managing the rooms, and the system administrator. The researchers have also identified six (6) processes that will 
enable the transfers and flow of data in the system. The first process is the log-in process. Users will be asked to 
provide credentials such as official email account or proper identification numbers which will be subjected to 
verification by the system. The verified information will come from two (2) data stores namely, student database and 
staff data base. The user will proceed next to the room reservation process where reservation request and room 
availability can be checked from the reservation database and room schedule data base. Since eReserba Cardinal also 
caters laboratory room reservations, laboratory equipment request will also be part of the system to accommodate 
equipment requests. Subsequently, the system will provide available room suggestions from the room schedule 
database. To address the issues on availability of proper signatories, the signing process was replaced with an 
authorization process that can be done online through e-mail. The process will send authorization request to respective 
personnel such as faculty advisers, department heads and facility in-charge. The authorization data shall come from 
the forms database that are filled up and stored in the data store. Lastly, a system administrator will serve as the overall 
manager of the process. The reservation process will handle requests, provide real-time availability, and facilitate easy 
and quick approval. Most organizations have been adopting various automated processes to improve the performance 
of certain parts of the organization. eReserba Cardinal will offer an online solution for the current inefficiencies of the 
manual room reservation method of the HEI. Electronic document management systems are found to provide positive 
result on performance since IT helps easily sort and retrieve information from databases (Kittanah, et al., 2016). 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Manual processes are commonly found to be prone to data inaccuracies, are time consuming, and cost inefficient. The 
use of technology, particularly an information system, improves system efficiency, allows for better management of 
facilities, and increases worker productivity because a lot of non-value adding activities such as waiting times and 
travelling can be eliminated. The eReserba Cardinal, an integrated system for room reservation at HEIs, is a web-
based application that will aid users to conveniently monitor the status of reservation request and easily manage 
various facilities and equipment. eReserba Cardinal can help eliminate the non-essential steps and redundancies in the 
current room reservation system of the institution, thus improving the speed and quality of the service the institution 
provides. The use of this system will also help reduce the usage of papers and go for eco-friendly transactions.  In 
turn, organizations may be able to save money and help protect the environment. Future researchers can perform 
simulation of the proposed online reservation system in order to verify the system’s efficiency and applicability to 
other HEIs. In addition, creating an information system for other services offered by the HEI may also be done to 
optimize the other processes. A mobile application may also be developed to complement the eReserba Cardinal web-
based system so that users can easily and readily reserve their preferred rooms at a more convenient manner.

Abstract 
Social networking sites, such as Facebook, allow users to create a public profile and interact with other 
users. One of its features is having a business page wherein users or business minded people advertise and 
sell their products online. Living in the fast phase environment and advancing technology, the role of social 
media in the social economy is seen to increase. SMEs are facing strong expectations for their role to be 
key players when economies recover from the present global recession. Previous researches include the use 
of social media as a marketing strategy for businesses however, the standard design for business platforms 
is yet to be realized. Such in the case of Facebook, it is observed that the features, use, and settings of its 
business page are not being maximized by the business owners. Nonetheless, it is the intent of this study to 
standardize business platforms in social networking sites. Focusing on Facebook’s platform, the researchers 
were able to classify the categories that small and medium online businesses sell as well as assess its 
significant factors and failure points that may affect customer’s decision making using the Facebook page 
interface. Lastly, to meet the user requirements for the proposed business platform design, the study used

1. Introduction
In the era of advanced technology, everything is available on the internet. Internet connections are accessible anywhere 
that people can use them anytime. Social networking sites (SNS) are extremely popular with online users. One of the 
important parts of social networking and SNS is seen as electronic-based services that enable users to connect (OECD 
2007). In business, according to Boyd (2010), social media have been used widely in many aspects, for example, 
advertising products, social networking and attract customers, and studies about social media have emphasized the 
significance of their utilization in business.  
Social Networking sites such as Facebook have become part of people's daily lives. It opens a big opportunity in starting 
a business as it can attract customers using social media platforms. The potential to market products via online social 
networks is enticing, with hundreds of millions of segmented members (Ahmad 2010). It allows online users to build 
business relationships, improve online trading and increase brand awareness. It was reported by Statista (2017) that 
among all the SNSs, Facebook has 1.968 billion users trailed by WhatsApp (1.2 billion), Youtube (1 billion), Messenger 
(1 billion), WeChat (998 million), QQ (868 million) and Instagram (600 million). Thus, having a Facebook account is 
essential for an effective marketing campaign. 
Facebook has turned into the most popular social network in our society on both a national and global level, as it is a 
generalist network with an extremely broad user base. This social network has broken the boundary of the virtual 
world and has built up itself in the everyday lives of millions of individuals who, as of recently, barely had any contact 
with the network. In this unique circumstance, the utilization of S-commerce in regards to this social network

4. Conclusion 
 
The success of an online business Facebook page relies on its interface. When purchasing online, buyers cannot touch 
the products, smell them, feel them, taste them, or use them therefore, it takes exceptional persuasive power and 
powerful content to sell online where customers base their decisions on content in its many forms such as written 
descriptions, photos, videos, reviews, spec sheets and product demos (Ganoe 2014). The researchers intend to design 
an online business page with the needs of the customers in mind, capitalizing on its features and settings to prevent 
redundancy of posts and avoid customer confusion. Likewise, help business owners in managing their business page 
conveniently. 
 
The proposed interface developed by the researchers, based on the data and results articulated, arranged and displayed 
significant posts of what was needed in an online Facebook business page. Potential users were asked to test the new 
design wherein time observations were gathered. Results showed a significant decrease in time spent on browsing the 
page and when posting to buy the product. It only took an average of 1.75 minutes for a customer to complete an 
online transaction which is 15% lower than the current interface. The users also remarked how the page looked 
pleasant in the eye as decluttering was minimized and noted the convenience in exploring the page as the time 
consumed to scroll the page was reduced. 
 
This research study also proved that there is a need for improvement with the current Facebook business platform. 
This implies to maximize the utilization of the features offered by Facebook and to use the settings of the platform 
efficiently to increase online sales and sustain the business for the long term. Moreover, the limitations of this study 
is it focused only on the fashion product line since it dominated the online business shopping trend. However, 
researchers who want to improve this study can as well assess platforms of other online stores selling various or 
multiple products (e.g. Electronics, Toys, Food).

Abstract 
 
The supply chain in the automotive component industry today had faced multiple challenges on-demand, delivery, and 
costs simultaneously. In order to keep up with the uncertainties on order requirement, the component suppliers need to 
continuously innovate their business practice to be more efficient and cheaper than competitors. Kanban is a proven lean 
tool for a pull production system that controls the flow of material between various workstations by using a signal or 
travelling card methods. As the supply chain industry has entered the new era of Industry 4.0, the concept of signalling 
system has been restructured along with new technologies given the advantages of the Internet of Things (IoT). This 
study aims to develop a concept for electronic Kanban (e-Kanban) to speed up the information and data transfer for 
production planning and scheduling between companies by using Hybrid e-Kanban Production Systems. The model 
applies an effective tool of Microsoft Excel combined with cloud database using Microsoft OneDrive. This data sharing 
on production planning and scheduling can reduce preparation and delivery time for the product. The supplier than can 
view customer’s production data in real-time and respond to any changes to minimize their inventory, to avoid 
overproduction and wastage. The traditional travelling card method had some issues on the missing card, recording 
and documentation. However, the e-Kanban ensures the production database is recorded and documented with the 
necessary production details at real-time. The e-Kanban addresses various industrial challenges including customer 
satisfaction, communication, and innovation. The author demonstrates the application in a shared database. 
Furthermore, by implementing an e-Kanban cloud database design, it improves production efficiency, reduces material 
cost and labour usage. This paper discussed the potential benefits contributed by e-Kanban for cost-efficient operations.

1.Introduction 
 
In recent era the most of the manufacturing companies attracted to world-class initiatives to develop and create 
themselves to recognize in competitive in market, However, lean tools are becoming a key factor to follow the overall 
strategic planning in manufacturing to eliminate the of wastes as “Muda”. The “Muda” Japanese word meaning 
“waste” it is key concept in lean process thinking such as Toyota Production System (TPS). 
 
The lean manufacturing defines as the values of the product or service from a consumer point of view. Lean 
manufacturing emphasis that the non-value-added activities or wastes does not add any value for the customers. It is",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Hence, this survey interview research is successful in IoT implementation methods. The future work of the research 
to apply hybrid push or pull systems in Kanban systems or lean hybrid models to improve operational efficiency in 
industries, where factories can harness Artificial Intelligence technologies as an integral part of lean methodologies to 
minimize the waste and continuous improvements are implemented, future work of our study is to focus on lean 
Kanban technologies support with Industry 4.0 tools using the heuristic algorithm to optimize the Kanban delivery 
model to cost optimization. Secondly to design and development of algorithms for lean technology which can be 
compatible with visualization techniques, and improvements to support for the internet of things within manufacturing 
industries.

Abstract 
This paper presents a portfolio selection framework exploiting exchange traded funds in ASIA considering different 
portfolio weight thresholds for individual asset within the portfolio of a safety-first model investor. Back-test result 
shows that the safety-first portfolios of exchange traded funds can significantly outperform the benchmark considered. 
It was also observed that safety-first investors who doesn't limit the portfolio weights of individual asset can 
significantly outperform the benchmark. Overall, this study offers an alternative equitable investment option for 
safety-first investors which, on the long run, can probably be considered as a generic investment procedure for any 
investor.

1. Introduction
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are relatively new Financial instrument that is made for the purpose of tracking a 
specific index, the very first ETF created was the SPDR ETF which tracks the S&P500, today the cash invested in 
ETFs is around $5.1 trillion dollars as shown in Figure 1 courtesy of investopedia.

all SF-I portfolios have better returns than the benchmark. It is also supported by Figure 3, wherein it is visually 
evident that the returns of the benchmark is more volatile compared to all SF-I portfolios. 
 
 
 
These above mentioned comparisons are still not enough to accurately conclude that SF-I portfolios are superior 
portfolios than the benchmark. Thus, more rigorous tests (pair-return difference T tests) were done to compare the 
respective performances of SF-I portfolios against the benchmark. Again, the null hypothesis is that the average 
difference between the respective SF-I portfolio and the benchmark is equal to 0. The alternative hypothesis is that 
the average difference between the respective SF-I portfolio and the benchmark is greater than 0. Result shows, as 
seen also in Table 2, SF-1 and SF-0.2 have significantly larger returns than the benchmark with respective P-values 
for the pair-return difference T tests of (0.080 and 0.088). SF-0.8, SF-0.6, and SF-0.4 are also close to having 
significantly larger return than the benchmark with respective P-values for the pair-return difference T tests of (0.1, 
0.136, 0.131).        
 
Now that it is known that SF-I portfolios can significantly outperform the benchmark, the SF-I portfolios are compared 
to one another to determine the best portfolio among the SF-I portfolios. It is evident in Table 2 that SF-1 has the best 
descriptive statistics among the SF-I portfolios. Except for risk (standard deviation) wherein it is the highest among 
the group. It is expected that as the value of I increases the risk considered is also higher compared to those with lower 
values of I. This is evident in Table 3 which shows the composition of the SF-I portfolios that as the value of I increases 
the distribution of portfolio weights is getting concentrated to fewer stocks. SF-I portfolios with lower I values are 
more diversified than those with higher I values but the reward is also lower.

Similarly, the descriptive statistics are not enough to have an accurate conclusion thus for further support, pair-return 
difference T-tests were also done between the SF-I portfolios such that although not significant, only SF-1 portfolios 
have P-values, as shown in Table 4, which are very close to being significant. Thus, it is advisable to consider SF-I as 
the best SF portfolio where larger I values correspond to superior portfolios.

4. Conclusion 
This researched analyzed the indices of Asian Markets namely Hong Kong, India, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, 
and Taiwan, and Malaysia. Then, it is assumed that there are exchange-traded funds that correspondingly tracts the 
performances of these indices perfectly such that these indices are considered as the investment pool of the portfolio 
selection considering the safety-first portfolio selection model. The resulting portfolios are then compared with the 
market or index with biggest influence to Asian Markets. This index is the China Index which is considered as the 
benchmark or point of comparison of the SF portfolios. Back-test results show that the SF-I portfolios can significantly 
outperform the benchmark. It can also be concluded that it might be better to invest on multiple assets instead of just 
investing on the asset with the biggest influence (China ETF). 
 
Overall, this study contributed in 3 ways: (1) it provides a strategy on how to exploit exchange traded funds.; (2) it 
presents an alternative investment option which is profitable and can significantly outperform the benchmark 
(market).; and (3) it offers a simple variation to basic portfolio selection framework of return estimation, assignment 
of weights, and selection model.  
 
Further improvements can still be done to improve the results of this study. One way is to consider the actual 
investment environment wherein trading costs are considered which plays a huge role in the profitability of any 
portfolio. Next is to consider the actual ETF indices of respective countries to lessen estimation errors. Another one 
is to consider other portfolio selection models like different variations of the mean-variance model to have another 
point of comparison. Application of the strategy to other continents can verify the applicability of this strategy to other 
continents or data. Lastly, modification of the 3 basic parts of portfolio selection framework can also be a starting 
point for further studies.

Abstract 
    In modern conditions, innovative projects and commercialization of technologies is one of the most 
important factors in ensuring sustainable business development and play an important role in building 
a knowledge-based economy. SMEs represent a significant part of the national economy, approximately 
99.8%. The problem of innovative development and growth is actual for small and medium sized 
enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to analyze an entrepreneurship environment and conditions 
conducive to the innovative development of SMEs in Latvia. This study examines a factors of 
entrepreneurship environment in the context of innovation development of small and medium-sized 
enterprises in the Latvian market. The methodological basis of the paper consists of analysis of scientific 
literature and publications, data of statistical reports, normative acts of the EU and the Republic of 
Latvia. According to a survey of SMEs and banks conducted by the Bank of Latvia, 13% of SMEs 
surveyed identified a lack of innovation as a factor that significantly limits SME growth. In addition, 
according to Eurostat, almost 90% of companies in Latvia indicate that they do not have a compelling 
reason for innovation, while around 7% considered the issue of innovation but the obstacles were too 
significant.

Abstract 
The proper design of the urban infrastructure is crucial to develop civilization in a developing area. 
While there are dozens of managerial suggestions to go along with the static aspects of components in 
urban infrastructure design, hardly any piece of advice may be found to ensure dynamic outcomes of 
the whole design in advance. In this paper, a novel system dynamics model is introduced and applied 
in this context as a contribution to fill the research gap. The modular nature of the model development 
helps to alleviate the challenge of simultaneous design of components and system, with the potential 
capability of both static and dynamic verification. It allows the decision aider to observe the results of 
policies with the growth of the model over time and be informed of the consequences of policies before 
deployment. The model is developed for water infrastructure design. It involves various inter-related 
subsystems such as industry consumption, geographical location, and labor asset. According to the 
scope of the model, Chabahar free-zone is selected as a case study to validate the temporal aspects of 
the model design. A comparison is also made between two policies for water supply. The consequences 
of adopting each policy on other aspects of the free-zone development are discussed. The model truly 
depicts that the main challenge in developing the water infrastructure, considering the geographical 
condition of Chabahar, is choosing an efficient and beneficial way to supply water for industrial and 
urban consumption.

1. Introduction
Today one of the vital issues facing most developing countries is the excessive consumption of water
resources. Due to expanding industrial and agricultural activities and applications, the limitation of water 
resources is getting more important in these regions than others. As free zones are among the premier channels of 
industrial thrive, their role is much more critical in the water consumption rate. Specifically, when it comes to the 
development and extension of new trades in free zones, it is of more importance to be able to detect the behavior 
of consumption based on the anticipated volume of industrial and civil activities in that region. 
Iran, as one of the rapidly growing developing countries in the world, is also challenging the shortage of water 
resources significantly.  Chabahar, as an Iran future trade hub, is important due to its geopolitical location. It is 
the closest access to free waters in Central Asia (Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
and Kazakhstan) and lots of governmental and private investment has been deposited in its formation throughout 
the last decade. Since the growth and development of a region depend on investing in industrial and agricultural 
sectors, investors have a great need for water in addition to economic wealth. According to existing reports 
(Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization (IRIMO) website, URL: https://data.irimo.ir. ; Bagheri, 
2007; Bagheri, 2007), freshwater resources in Chabahar have been declining for the past five years. Thus, close 
attention should be paid into optimal water consumption and the requirement of projects for water resources.  
In general, water infrastructure is a set of interconnected structural factors such as desalination plants, 
groundwater resources, municipal sewage systems, etc. that are created to manage water supply and demand. 
Failure to pay attention to any of the above factors can affect various sectors, such as industry or agriculture in 
the long or short term (Bagheri, 2007). Although most of the previous studies consider water supply with explicit 
relationships among the important parameters, the temporal and spatial dynamic significance of the water 
infrastructure is not considered appropriate. Policies are also set based on the assumption that the amount of water 
available in the region was the least fluctuating and commensurate with the demand. The impact of policies 
adopted in other important sectors such as industry, agriculture, population and labor market are also ignored

current demand. Accordingly, the importance of the industry is equal to the ratio of unsatisfied demand to the 
current demand.  
- The coefficient for agriculture: In this policy, investment in agriculture will increase when there is a 
high potential for agriculture. Agricultural potential refers to areas where no crop is cultivated, in other words, the 
difference of total hectares for cultivation from the cultivated lands. So, the weight and importance of agriculture 
is equal to the ratio of agricultural potential to agricultural land. 
- The coefficient for desalination facilities: The criterion for deciding whether to invest in desalination 
facilities is urban consumption. Whenever urban consumption deviates significantly from normal consumption, 
the mode of investment must change. If consumption is higher than normal, investment should be reduced and if 
consumption is lower than normal, investment in desalination should be increased. In this case the weight and the 
importance will be equal to the ratio of the difference in water consumption per person from normal to individual 
consumption. 
In this policy, we have population control at a constant level without drastic changes. As Figure 19 shows, 
in the original model, the population had been increasing  exponentially, which would certainly be difficult to 
afford but in this scenario, we will achieve the desired level with population control and drinking water supply. 
Another positive point in this policy is that we prevent overshoot behavior in water volume, as we observed 
in model behavior, the water volume had an undesirable behavior for water supply infrastructure, and It will cost 
a lot. As you can see in Figure 20, after adopting this policy the freshwater volume will reach to a stable state. 
 
 
The most important advantage of adopting this policy is determining the budget coefficient for investment 
in different fields (FRONE, 2011). In this population, according to the productivity of investment (the growth in 
the field in comparison to the investment in that field), a dynamic budget allocation will be done. As it is shown 
in Figure 21, these dynamic coefficients will reach a stable state. Therefore, by adopting this policy we can 
determine a budget allocation in which the system will have more productivity with the same amount of budget.

Abstract 
There have been considerable advances in sensing instrumentation, hardware, signal processing algorithms, 
and internet technology infrastructure that have eventually paved the way for the long-envisioned concept 
of smart factories under the purview of Industry 4.0. To leverage the available system data, factories across 
the globe are embracing Predictive Maintenance in the era of Industry 4.0. In the current study, the objective 
is to understand failures by mining asset maintenance log. Towards this end, first, a text mining-based 
approach has been suggested to identify different failures, followed by a survival analysis based approach 
to predict the failure sequence and patterns. The developed algorithm has been tested on maintenance logs 
of centrifugal casting machines.

Abstract 
 
Military camouflage is an important part of defense technology. It is designed to confuse the enemy by visually 
merging the outline of military design to the surrounding environment. The purpose of this study was to apply a color 
similarity index for evaluating existing military camouflages designs. Camouflage Similarity Index (CSI) was utilized 
as a color similarity index and the value varies between 0 to 1. The best value of 0 is achieved if the selected existing 
military camouflage design perfectly blends with the surrounding environment. 10 existing military camouflage 
designs from different regions were evaluated under 14 different locations in the swamp environment. The results 
indicated that the CSI was an effective tool for identifying the effectiveness of existing military camouflage designs 
across regions. Interestingly, even the CSI values were found different among 10 selected designs, Post-hoc Tukey 
HSD test revealed that there was statistical difference between each design and it could be categorized into 3 different 
groups. This study contributed to the advancement of color similarity index to the existing military camouflage and 
the results would be very useful for military research organizations, ministry of defense, and textile engineer.

1. Introduction 
 
Military camouflage is an important part of the army combat uniform. It is an attempt to minimize the difference 
between the army combat uniform and the surrounding background so that human eyes and military detection 
instruments struggle to detect and distinguish the target (Xue et al., 2016). Military research organizations and color 
researchers are continually engaged in the test and evaluation of prospective camouflage patterns, seeking to maximize 
concealment while also considering the background heterogeneity of diverse operational contexts (Brunye et al., 2017; 
Chang et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2014c; Xue et al., 2016b; Xue et al., 2018). By advancing military camouflage research, 
soldiers could improve the survivability and mission effectiveness by preventing visual observation and other military 
sensors from detecting both the soldiers and their equipment (Killian & Hepfinger, 1992; Chang et al., 2012; 
Fincannon et al., 2013).    
 
Military camouflage effectiveness is often assessed by image quality assessment algorithm. Previously, Zhang et al 
(2013) proposed an algorithm based on Fourier transform and Gaussian low-pass filter (LPF) to mix the color based 
on tricolor angular frequencies. In the model, the tricolor angular frequencies were introduced to the spatial frequency 
response function of human color vision, and the effects of atmospheric attenuation and air screen brightness on color 
mixture were also considered (Zhang et al., 2013). The field test indicated that the model can simulate the color-
mixing process in the aspects of the color-mixing order, and shape and position of the color-mixing spot. However, 
the color-mixing spot was found not perfect. Xue et al (2016a) extracted primary colors from the background using a 
k-means clustering algorithm to generate the color constraints. In addition, a spot template distribution algorithm was 
proposed to generate camouflage patterns. Even this study achieved good results in terms of optical camouflage, 
however, proposing this method to enhance an existing military camouflage would be difficult since it would change 
totally the currently existing design.

Despite the substantial and clear study results, the authors would like to acknowledge the limitations of the current 
study. First, the lack of proper military camouflage collection. Instead of using the proper design, we obtained the 
camouflages by using the Google search engine. This would lead to unbalance color distribution. Moreover, the 
sunlight or when the picture was taken would definitely affect the results. Second, the CSI values were limited to the 
selected woodland background which was taken at 09:00 am. Different sunlight, terrains, and thermal conditions 
would influence the environment which subsequently influences the CSI values. Future research to assess the selected 
camouflage in dessert or other terrains would be a promising research topic.

Abstract 
As digitalization is on the rise, customers are rapidly changing the way they engage with accessibility and 
convenience yet the typical drive-through remains unchanged from when it was first introduced in 1947. The 
researchers conducted a time study in different fast-food restaurants that offer a drive-through service in Metro 
Manila, Philippines. Data showed an average of 6.27 minutes for the whole transaction in the current layout. 
Through the use of ProModel Software, the researchers have identified that out of 100 customers, 57 of them 
experience long queues and delays while 43 of them does not. This paper aims to provide an improved method of 
operation by revamping the traditional layout of a fast-food drive-through. At the end of the study, the researchers 
designed a system to balance speed and order accuracy in a drive-through restaurant, reducing the processing time in 
the proposed layout by 52%, equivalent to 3.27 minutes. The simulation results show that 57 customers who 
experience long queues and delays in the current system have been reduced to 8 customers in the proposed system 
which has an 86% improvement in the operation.

Introduction
1.1 
Background of the Study
With people’s hectic lifestyles today, time-efficiency in services becomes ever more important. One common
example of a service where people could use better methods for time efficiency is a fast-food restaurant’s optional
drive-through service (Jekanowski, 1999). Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) and Insula Research estimated that
about 50 to 70 percent of fast-food sales come from drive-through service.
Most fast-food restaurants offer an optional drive-through service that has been around in many commercial 
establishments since it was first introduced across America in the late 1950s. In a traditional drive-through setup, for 
a customer to make an order, several steps are to be followed in a sequential manner. As the customer enters the 
drive-through lane, the first station a customer passes is the order selection. From there, a customer temporarily 
stops the vehicle to view the menu board, which displays the food items offered by the restaurant. After, the 
customer proceeds to the next station to place order. After order placement, the customer advances to order payment 
to settle the transaction. By the same time, the restaurant prepares the food and arranges it for pickup, which leaves 
the customer to move forward at the pickup window and put on hold while waiting for their order. Some fast-food 
restaurants, to accommodate drive-through customers, perform order payment and order preparation simultaneously 
to optimize time choosing to rely on the accuracy of the order placement (Johnson, 2015). Order preparation 
immediately commences as the customer places order. 
1.2 
Problem Statement 
From the historical research studies of a quick-service, most fast-food restaurants with drive-through services 
concentrate on speed of transaction and order accuracy based on the most pressing needs of drive-through 
customers. However, consumers’ attitudes and behaviors have shifted tremendously in recent years and continue to 
do so. Yet, the typical drive-through remains unchanged from when it was first introduced in 1947.

Conclusion 
Fast-food restaurants have upgraded their services through drive-through that can be used by customers who have 
their cars with them and do not want to leave it in the parking or wants to have their food but are in a rush. As drive-
through became popular for the customers, the management began to encounter problems in their drive-through 
service. The researchers conducted a time study to measure the elapsed time by every process in ordering in a drive-
through restaurant. Long queues of cars, long time waiting for the orders, small spaces for cars, and fewer items are 
present at the order station are just some of the problems being encountered by the customers. These are also the 
reasons why the researchers came up with the idea of improving the ordering system of a drive-through and the goal 
is to reduce problems so that fast-food restaurants would be able to satisfy the customers and to allocate their 
services to more customers. In the comparison of the proposed system versus the current system in drive-throughs, 
the proposed system has an ordering menu display and a built-in payment collection process where the customer will 
have a choice between cash or card payment. If the customer chooses to pay in cash, the customers can conveniently 
insert their cash in the kiosk. This method reduces the time and costs for fast-food drive-through as the company 
does not need to put different windows for the ordering process and payment process. The proposed system also 
shows on screen the status of the orders and notifies the customer whenever their orders are done and that will be the 
only time, customers can leave the staging station to pick their food up unlike in the current system, customers have 
to wait in queue for their orders. This system also reduces the bottlenecks in the drive-through which currently the 
main problem being encountered by fast-food restaurants, especially during rush hours. The researcher also provided 
a floor plan layout of the drive-through for implementation. With this proposed system, the researchers are 
expecting that the management will increase the number of customers that they will be served, and the customer’s 
specifications will be met.  
Using the current self-service kiosk as a basis for the proposed system, the researchers were able to reduce the 
average time of transactions the customers have to spend while ordering. From the current system having an average 
time of 6.27 minutes per customer, it went down to just 3.27 minutes. Through the use of ProModel Software, the 
researchers discovered that in the current system, 57 customers out of 100 are experiencing delays and long queues. 
By creating a simulation for the proposed system, the researchers were able to improve the customer service of the 
fast-food by reducing the number of customers who are experiencing delays and long queues from 57 customers to 
just 8 out of 100 which provides an 86% improvement.  
 
The researchers recommend adding the function of a reloadable smart card for payment. The customers will have an 
additional option on how they want to pay for their orders. It will be a small card that can be tapped onto the system 
after ordering and it will process the payment afterward. The researchers also recommend adding a mobile 
application or online website for the customers to order in advance and pick up their orders at the fast-food drive-
through. Order customization; discounts for persons with disabilities (PWD) and senior citizens; and discounts for 
coupons/vouchers can also be added to the system.

Abstract 
The technologies of industry 4.0 such as big data brings challenges since companies will have to deal with a large 
amount of data that will help to anticipate and solve problems in development, ﬂexibility and organizational efﬁciency. 
On the other hand, companies need to create defenses strategies, also known as “cyber security” in order to deal with 
the cyber-attacks. The objective of this study is to perform a science mapping in the field of study of cyber security in 
order to discover current topics, authors in the field and create a map of the area of study, identify productive themes 
with great scientific impact and point challenges, perspectives and suggestion for future works. To perform this science 
mapping, the SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool) was used. Besides, the VOSviewer was used to 
analyze co-authorship between countries and authors. The scientific evolution presented 17 clusters whereby the most 
representative themes are: 'challenges', 'framework' and ‘intrusion detection’. The analysis of the network of the cluster

Abstract 
The world is witnessing a tremendous breakthrough in technology owing to the use of the Internet and 
electronic devices. Accordingly, the relationship between companies and their customers will be closer than 
before. These changes will allow products’ users to communicate with their manufacturers so that they can 
be improved in future generations and can also be supported with updates made remotely, without user 
intervention. Productivity increment, continuous improvement, and enhancement in customer relations are 
the objectives of this paradigm shift. Products from all durable and non-durable segments will have a high 
level of customization with the customer being responsible for specifying which characteristics will satisfy 
them. The current work presents concepts of Industry 4.0 and IOT (Internet of Things) and highlights the 
retailing process of the automotive industry. The related works are reviewed, and a solution framework is 
reported and discussed in details.

1. Introduction
The three industrial revolutions developed mass production, electric energy and the use of information 
technology and made technological competition the center of economic development [1]. The first 
revolution, at the end of the eighteenth century, involved the use of machines. The second revolution, 
around 1870, the utilization of electric energy and the third, around 1969, the use of industrial automation 
[1]. In the third industrial revolution, the Internet was the key factor because it was considered as a public 
infrastructure technology rather an exclusive technology [2]. In the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 
4.0), the impact will be more exponentially intense as it is built on a set of technologies that integrate the 
physical, digital and biological worlds. Industry 4.0 has the potential to increase economic growth and solve 
some of the global challenges the world is facing. 
Industry 4.0 does not exclude the previous eras of industries, but it is expected to bring immense advantages 
and many challenges. Nonetheless, the main challenge that most stakeholders are concerned with is the 
cyber- security risk which make the IoT (Internet of Things) the pillar of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the rate

7. Conclusions 
 
Industry 4.0 has the potential to make the retailing processes of cars more efficient and thereby enable 
the production of products and after sales service with high quality standards and in a very short time. 
Many potential benefits can be highlighted: cost reduction; increased safety; environmental 
conservation; error reduction; no waste; and business transparency. All the above-mentioned benefits 
enable the automotive industry to expand its research and development centers, encouraging the study 
of new technologies and their integration into existing and future product lines alongside dealing and 
retailing process. This paper gave a glance about the shape of the retailing process in the age of Industry 
4.0. a proposed approach was introduced to address some issues in the current retailing process using 
IoT.

system is an intelligent assembly line, where the machines can perform several operations by consulting 
specifications electronically described in the component that is being manufactured, remembering that this 
all happens in the manufacturing process of the Prototyping using 3D printers, supported by the concept of 
Additive Manufacturing, also helps to reduce development costs since it is not necessary to develop 
corresponding tooling [1]. Likewise, the dealing and retailing process can be undergo to Industry 4.0 as it 
is increasingly loaded with technology. Like manufacturers, dealers can also benefit from the use of the 
Industry 4.0 set of technologies by capturing information from their customers and then using this 
information to improve their retailing process. With the use of sensors and the CAN network, the dealers 
can initiate a data connection, capture sensor data and use it to analyze the preferences of customers and 
drivers, and behavior of components and systems of the vehicle. For instance, tracking the number of 
kilometers travelled; checking fuel quality; remembering the geographic regions travelled; monitoring of 
parts that affect safety, and strong connections between manufacturers and customers through dealers.  
All this information provides the manufacturer with the ability to monitor the product very precisely and 
even to contact the customer if necessary, in case of complaint. The information can also be used in a 
knowledge base for use in continuous improvement and new product development projects. 
 
6. The Proposed Approach 
Traditionally, the main information channels between the manufacturer and the customer have been through 
car dealers.  Consequently, a lot of information about the condition of the vehicle is lost to the manufacturer. 
The proposed approach as shown in Figure 3 is supposed to find better ways in solving problems and come 
up with innovative solutions; to achieve dramatic improvements in retailing process of cars while 
continuously improving quality to meet rising customer expectations. First, we need to listen to the voice 
of customers from Industry 4.0 perspectives: by conducting surveys and interviews with them. Additionally, 
we need to organize brainstorming sessions with the stakeholders [Frontline staff, Administrators, 
Managers …etc.]. To shape the area of improvements and guarantee quality of service delivery: the degree 
to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements. Then analyzing the collected data using the 
theories for the quality and use the results from quality control process to reflect the overall quality status. 
Finally, we need to provide guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and verified throughout 
the implementation. For example, by adding to the proposed approach a feedback flow from the 
User/Support phase to the phases of ideation and definition, and inclusion of this information in a 
knowledge base. Moreover, IoT can play a fundamental role in channel integration of retailing process 
because it allows companies to rebalance supply and demand [8].

Abstract  
This paper presents an analysis of the trends of financial ratios of one hundred fifty (150) companies that are currently 
listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange with the aim of helping equity investors in their investment strategies. Exam-
ining the annual company financial reports, a set of criteria was set in order to determine whether certain companies 
can be deemed equitable by investors. Stocks that passes the set criteria are added into a portfolio following an equally 
weighted strategy. The portfolio performance is then compared with the market index (Philippine Stock Exchange) 
which shows that the resulting portfolio can outperform the market. In addition, individually considering each ratio as 
the criteria of selecting stocks into the investment pool results to portfolios with negative returns. This implies that the 
portfolio selection with the proposed criteria is superior to the portfolio selection considering each ratio as the selection 
criteria.  Overall, although white noise may occur in the stock market, this research provides investors with an unbiased 
forecast reference to help them evaluate their stock picks and build their investment portfolios.

1. Introduction 
As the famous saying goes, “the stock market is risky—even when it is going in the right direction.” According to 
Lewis (2019), there are three reasons why the stock market is indeed risky: volatility, timing, and overconfidence. 
Volatility, which is the fluctuation in stock price that is beyond investor control, may include geopolitical events, 
monetary and fiscal policies, and inflation. Timing in the market, meanwhile, refers to the prediction of stock prices 
so that one can buy low and sell high. This entails the need to escape frustration that comes from trying to earn from 
stock capital appreciation but losing money after selling at a price lower than expected. Overconfidence all together 
leads to carelessness in picking stocks and not being able to dodge unnecessary risks. In order to avoid all these, it is 
important for an investor to analyze leading and lagging indicators prior to engaging in equity investment. This paper, 
therefore, aims to provide the possible course of movement of the following indicators to help investors anticipate 
future changes in stock price.  
1.1. Current Ratio 
The current ratio determines the competence of a business to meet short-term obligations or those that are due within 
a year. It can be computed by dividing the total current assets over the total current liabilities. Having a current ratio 
of the number two (2), for instance, means that a company has the ability to settle any debt or accounts payable twice. 
Hence, it can be said that this ratio may indicate how well a company can maximize the liquidity of its current assets 
in settling debts. According to the Corporate Finance Institute (2019), “a rate of more than 1 suggests financial well-
being for the company”. A current ratio that is too high, however, may not necessarily mean that a company is in a 
better position. It could also mean the following: stocks are moving slow, collection of receivables is poor, or the 
company is having cash surplus due to the lack of investment opportunities (Vaidya, 2019).

Table 2 shows that considering 𝑛 favorable financial ratios the investment pool out of 150 companies ranges 0-142. 
Looking at the portfolio returns, it shows that at certain values of 𝑛 as 𝑛 increases the portfolio return eventually 
becomes positive. Considering the total return difference with M for all 𝑃𝑛 portfolios is equal to 1.2436. This also 
implies that 𝑃𝑛 portfolios can outperform the benchmark (M). Note that even though the returns of 𝑃𝑛 portfolios are 
mostly negative, the returns are better than the market performance. Therefore, if this is the case for all back-tests then 
profitability can be achieved using this information through alternative investment instruments. 
 
Comparing the performances of 𝑃𝑛 portfolios with 𝑃𝑟 portfolios based from Tables 1 and 2, it can be said that 𝑃𝑛 
portfolios are superior to 𝑃𝑟 portfolios. 𝑃𝑛 portfolios have better returns than 𝑃𝑟 portfolios. 𝑃𝑛 portfolios outperform M 
more than 𝑃𝑟 portfolios. Moreover, only 𝑃𝑛 portfolios showed profitability that as 𝑛 increase the portfolio return even-
tually becomes positive.  
  
4. Conclusion 
This research analyzed the trends of financial ratios of 150 random companies from the Philippine stock exchange. 
Using some simple criteria, investment pools are generated screening out companies with at least 𝑛 number (out of 12 
financial ratios) of favorable ratio trends. For comparison purposes, investment pools considering only 1 type of fa-
vorable financial ratio trend are also identified. For testing purposes, equally weighted portfolio strategy is applied to 
select for the optimal portfolio. Portfolios using the investment pool consisting of companies with at least 𝑛 number 
(out of 12 financial ratios) of favorable ratio trends are denoted as 𝑃𝑛 portfolios. Portfolios using only 1 type of favor-
able financial ratio trend are denoted as 𝑃𝑟 portfolios. 𝑃𝑛 portfolios, 𝑃𝑟 portfolios, and the market portfolio (M) are 
compared to one another to identify the superior portfolio. As expected, back-test results show that 𝑃𝑛 portfolios can 
outperform both 𝑃𝑟 portfolios and M portfolio. 
 
Overall, this study provides research contribution in 3 ways: (1) it presents an alternative investment procedure that 
can probably outperform traditional benchmark like the market portfolio.; (2) it provides a research study on portfolio 
selection using Philippine data.; and (3) it offers a simple variation on the basic framework of portfolio selection. 
 
Further improvements can still be done to improve the results of this study. One way is to consider the actual invest-
ment environment wherein trading costs are considered which plays a huge role in the profitability of any portfolio. 
Next is to consider other portfolio selection models like safety-first model and different variations of the mean-vari-
ance model to have another point of comparison. Consideration of all the companies listed in the Philippine Stock

exchange can also show some significant difference to the current result. Lastly, modification of the basic parts of 
portfolio selection framework can also be a starting point for further studies.

Abstract 
Human factors and Ergonomics (HFE) is one of the fundamental subjects of industrial engineering. The 
purpose of this study was to provide a comparative assessment of the ergonomics courses for industrial 
engineering in the Philippines. Several institutions were assessed and the ergonomics courses were listed 
and compared. In addition, the courses were also compared with ergonomic courses in one of the best 
industrial engineering institutions in the United States, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University 
(VT), as a benchmark. The result indicated the industrial engineering programs in the Philippines, 
particularly in graduate school, had a lower variety of ergonomic courses. In addition, the number of 
professors with doctoral degree in human factors & ergonomics were also very limited which subsequently 
lead to a limited variety of ergonomic courses and journal publications. Several classes for graduate school 
were proposed which cover cognitive ergonomics, physical ergonomics, and organizational ergonomics. In 
addition, a consortium between several universities to enhance the variety of ergonomic courses is highly 
required. This study contributed to the highlight of the important characteristic that can be useful for future 
improvement of the industrial engineering program in the Philippines. Finally, the proposed approach for 
analyzing the human factors and ergonomics education can also be applied and extended to other countries.

1. Introduction
Ergonomics is derived from Greek words “ergo” (work) and “nomos” (law) and it becomes one of the
fundamental subjects of industrial engineering. It is defined as “the scientific discipline concerned with the
understanding the interactions among humans and other elements of a system and the profession that applies
theoretical principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize well-being and overall performance”
(IEA, 2000). Ergonomics is also widely known as human factors but usually, academicians in industrial
engineering will combine it into a complete term “human factors and ergonomics (HFE)” (Bridger, 2009;
Naeini & Mosaddad, 2013; Karsh et al., 2014).
HFE adapts the human-made world to the people involved because it focuses on the human as the most 
important component of the technological systems (Kroemer, et al., 2001). Thus, the utmost goal of 
ergonomics is the “humanization” of work (Kroemer, et al., 2001) or “humanize human”.  
“Ergonomics make things compatible with human abilities and limitations.” (IEA, 2000) 
Ergonomics today is growing and changing (Kroemer, et al., 2001; Wilson, 2014) and it has two major 
objectives. The first is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which wok and other activities are 
carried out (Sanders & McCormick, 1993). Included here would be such things as increased convenience

Ergonomics is one of the fundamental subjects of industrial engineering. The purpose of this study was to 
provide a brief overview of the ergonomics courses in the Philippines. Several institutions were assessed 
and the human factors & ergonomics courses were listed and compared. In addition, the courses were also 
compared with human factors & ergonomics courses in one of the best industrial engineering institutions 
in the United States, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT). The result indicated the 
industrial engineering programs in the Philippines had a lower variety of ergonomic courses. In addition, 
the number of professors in human factors & ergonomics were also very limited which subsequently lead 
to limited journal publications. Several classes for graduate school were proposed which cover cognitive 
ergonomics, physical ergonomics, and organizational ergonomics. In addition, a consortium between 
several universities to enhance the variety of ergonomic courses is highly required. This study contributed 
to the highlight of the important characteristic that can be useful for future improvement of the industrial 
engineering program in the Philippines.

Abstract 
 
Fisheries worker is constantly mentioned as one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. The purpose of this 
study was to analyze the pattern of 50 cases of Indonesian fishing immigrant workers in Taiwan from 2013 to 2014 
using a cross-sectional study. The cases consisted of occupational injury, illness, fatality, and work-related abuses 
which were coded up to four causes for each case. In addition, the outcome of each case was also analyzed. The results 
indicated that 44 cases were coded to one cause, four cases were coded to two causes, one case was coded to three 
causes, and one case was coded to 4 causes. This research contributes to the determination of important characteristics 
in the statistics which may be used for prevention measures, especially for fisheries immigrant workers. A constructive 
dialogue between Taiwan Fisheries Bureau, Taiwan Ministry of Labor, agencies or broker, and Indonesian Economic 
and Trade Office to Taipei (IETO) is very important to prevent future occupational injury, illness, fatality, and work-
related abuses.

1. Introduction 
 
Fisheries worker is widely known as one of the most dangerous occupations. Every year, The International 
Labour Organisation (ILO, 2019) estimates that 7% of 24,000 fatalities occur in the fishing worker. In 
addition, approximately 24 million fisheries workers suffer a nonfatal injury each year (CDC, 2019). It is 
the result of placing a hazardous workplace on a moving, oscillating, and inherently unstable working space 
to the vagaries of the sea, where hazardous tasks under fatigue condition are conducted in slippery, uneven, 
cramped, with operations involving heavy fishing gears (Mcguinness et al., 2013a; Mcguiness et al., 2013b). 
The physical risks faced by fishermen are further complicated by a high degree of financial uncertainty in 
the occupation (Davis, 2012). Therefore, fisheries workers have been major concerns of numerous 
institutions, governments, and non-governmental organizations (Perez-Labajos, 2012).   
 
Despite the availability of many studies regarding occupational fatality and occupational injury of fisheries 
workers, little literature discusses occupational illness and other related abuses simultaneously. O’Connor 
& O’Connor (2006) coded 74 fatalities from Australia Boating Injuries Database over 1992-1998. Similarly, 
McGuinness et al., (2011) analyzed the circumstances of the 281 fatalities reported to the Norwegian 
authorities from the Norwegian fishing fleet over the period 1990-2011. Regarding the occupational injuries, 
McGuinness et al., (2013) also analyzed the injuries in the commercial fishing fleet of Norway 2000-2011. 
Finally, Hetherington (2006) reviewed the literature on safety in three key areas: common themes of 
accidents, the influence of human error, and interventions to make shipping safer. Comprehensive analysis 
regarding occupational injury, illness, fatality, and work-related abuses is required for prevention measures 
of immigrant fisheries workers.

with compensation before returning to Indonesia. Unfortunately, 3 workers were reported runaway. If the 
workers were reported runaway, he would lose the right of getting a new employer and it is more difficult 
for IETO for mediation for getting his final salary or finishing the contract. Therefore, it is extremely 
important to educate the fisheries workers not to choose runaway form the employer since he would lose 
the right for mediation including getting the final salary.

Fishermen who had been involved in a serious accident/incident showed a significantly more positive attitude 
to rules and regulations (Håvold, 2010). Therefore, it is extremely important to educate fisheries workers 
through intensive training prior to the employment period. In addition, a constructive dialogue with Taiwan 
Fisheries Bureau is very essential. Taiwan Ministry of Labor is also responsible for achieving fisheries safety 
legislation and practices. Finally, it is also required to take further actions through a constructive dialog 
between Taiwan Fisheries Bureau, Taiwan Ministry of Labor, agencies or brokers, and Indonesian Economic 
and Trade Office to prevent future occupational injury, illness, fatality, and work-related abuses. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Fisheries worker is constantly mentioned as one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. The 
purpose of this study was to analyze the pattern of 50 cases of Indonesian fishing immigrant workers in 
Taiwan from 2013 to 2014 using a cross-sectional study. The cases consist of occupational injury, illness, 
fatality, and work-related abuses which were coded up to four causes for each case. In addition, the outcome 
of each case was also analyzed. Based on our study, occupational fatality was found to be the most frequent 
case and it can be further classified into six patterns: crushed by another vessel, poisoning gases, jump from 
the vessel during parking, hit the sea coral, hit by fishing wire, and huge wave. For occupational injury, 
three workers were stuck in the fishing wire with a significant finger injury and one worker was reported 
heavily injured due to a gas explosion. For occupational illness, one worker was reported that his left brain 
contaminated with bacteria and another one was reported had an intestine problem. Finally, for work-related 
abuses, there were twelve patterns which include: excessive and undefined working hours, food problem, 
non-payment or delayed payment by the employer, physical abuse, non-payment or delayed payment by 
the agency, job mismatch with the contract, threat by the agency, agency still find a job, non-payment or 
air ticket, psychological abuse, abuse by other workers, non-occupational fatality, and stealing employer’s 
property.

Abstract 
Building defects are a key concern in the construction industry. Defects represent not only a loss to the 
project but also hamper the smooth operation of a building. The UAE construction industry accounts for 
heavy defects during DLP (Defects Liability Period) that lead to significant rework, delays in project 
handover, disputes and construction claims t among construction parties. This paper presents preliminary 
findings of a research study which is investigating defects management practices in the UAE. The paper 
presents an overview of construction defects, defect types and main causes of construction defects. The 
research findings are drawn from a literature review, and semi-structured interviews, which encapsulates 
UAE construction LAW and its implications in managing defects during defect liability period for different 
stakeholders. The paper highlights that future research is needed to investigate construction defects in 
relation to relevant work disciplines to identify root caused and remedies, which will improve overall defect 
management practice in the UAE construction industry.

1. INTRODUCTION
Defects in construction projects are a persistently worrying problem despite continually improving technology, 
education and legislation. Construction defects can be the result of design errors by professionals, a manufacturing 
flaw, defective materials, improper use or installation of materials, not conforming to the design by the contractor or 
any combination of the above. Construction defects account for cost overruns, claims, handover delays and disputes 
among construction stakeholders. However, construction defects are often not recorded, and resolved on an ad-hoc 
basis, ignoring the causes and effects of such defects for future improvements.  
The UAE construction industry is a key contributor to the UAE’s economy. According to Deloitte & Touche (2017), 
the UAE construction industry was awarded projects of over 45 billion USD in the year 2017. Previously, the UAE 
construction industry has completed approximately 70 billion USD construction projects between the year 2015 and 
2016 (Deloitte, 2016), which were mostly residential and commercial high rise building projects. Construction projects 
in the UAE often face commercial pressure to complete and handover on strict timelines by property developers and 
project owners. Therefore, building defects becomes a key concern at the handover stage, as well as during the 
operation & maintenance stage. These defects lead to significant rework, delays in project handover, unsatisfactory

• 
If the defect was due to misuse of items by the client. 
• 
If the claimed inconvenience was not a defect, and in fact was a result of the consultant’s design.  
• 
If another contractor who had been appointed by the client during the DLP maintained the equipment without 
prior notice to the main contractor  
 
Moreover, interview respondents explained that UAE construction laws protect the client from any defects during the 
DLP period, however, the terms and conditions of DLP depend upon the contract, which is usually drafted by 
consultants. Respondents stressed that the UAE shall adopt terms and conditions for DLP management for all projects 
to protect clients from inexperienced consultants. 
 
4.4 Role of the Contractor and Consultant during DLP  
The UAE civil code defines defects responsibility on the contractor but also include consultant if the defect is a result 
of the consultant’s negligence. In the UAE, Federal Law No 5: 1985 (The Civil Code) Articles 880-883 of The Civil 
Code impose upon the contractor and architect strict joint liability for a ten-year period from the date of delivery of 
the work. This covers any defect in the structure part, designed by the architect and built by the contractor that threatens 
its stability or safety. Article 880 (1) of the UAE Civil Code states that if the subject of a contract is the construction 
of buildings or other fixed installations, the plans for which are made by an architect to be carried out by the contractor 
under their supervision, they shall both be jointly liable for a period of ten years. During this time they must 
compensate the employer for any total or partial collapse of the building or installation that they have erected and for 
any defect that threatens its stability or safety unless the contract specifies a longer period.  
 
Article 880 (2) of the UAE Civil Code states that the obligation to make compensation shall remain regardless of 
whether any defect or collapse arises out of a fault in the land itself or that the employer consented to the construction 
of the defective buildings or installations.  
 
This indicates that any defect in the land must be clarified by the contractor prior to the beginning of the work. In case 
the contractor starts to work and there are any defects in the land, the contractor will bear the full responsibility because 
in the beginning, the contractor hid the land defects. Article 880 (3) determines that the ten-year period will start from 
the time of delivery of the work. Depending on the terms of the contract, the ten-year liability provision could exclude 
the contractual defects liability period, therefore possibly extend the overall liability time.  
 
The role of contract in managing defects starts with rectifying any defects before the handover, including (1) Cracks 
in the building; (2) Any leakage in the building; (3) Any defect in the electrical system; (4) Any defect during the final 
finishes; and (5) site cleanliness. In case of emergency or high inconvenience, the contractor must be present within 
24 hours from the official request. If the contractor has replaced the defective item with an item that doesn’t comply 
with the contractual specifications intentionally, the client may hire a third party. Each independent case is handled 
according to its conditions. In addition, the contractual “specifications” which are signed and stamped at the beginning 
of the project determines the quality of rectified defects.  
 
5. Conclusions and Future work 
 
Management of construction defects during the defect liability period is a key concern for contractors as well as 
construction clients. This paper has presented an overview of construction defects, and defect management during 
DLP in the context of the UAE construction law. Construction Law in the UAE following DIFIC contracts general 
terms and conditions which are applied to defect management during DLP, and clearly defines contractual 
responsibilities of construction clients, consultants and contractors in managing defects during DLP. The types of 
defects that appear during DLP vary in their nature and intensity, which is a separate research topic. There are limited 
studies that investigate defects and its relation to the work disciplines such as architectural, structural, mechanical and 
electrical, and the defects inherent in them. Recognizing this, future research is needed to investigate the causal 
relationship between the types of defects and their root cause within each work discipline involved. The study of 
defects identified during the DLP can be very significant as a control mechanism to ascertain the validity and reliability 
of a project’s implementation process.

Wave energy has the most important renewable energy sources with many advantages compared to other 
types of renewable energies. The objective of this study is to provide an up-to-date investigation of the 
wave energy harvesting technology with emphasis on the main barriers and drivers of the wave energy 
converters development and utilization. The goal is to locate the best spot for wave energy converter (WEC) 
in the Red Sea region. The outcome of this study is to identify the most suitable converter system to harvest 
wave energy based on the most important criteria including wave depth, amplitude, wavelength, and 
frequency of the waves. These parameters along with environmental factors, sustainability development 
goals (SDG#14), and site constraints, have been assessed to develop a WEC device site-specific screening. 
Technical and social impacts were found to be deciding factors for the viability of wave energy exploitation.

1. Introduction
To shorten greenhouse gas discharge and to safe admissible for all countries, it is visible that renewable power sources 
will assume a key job. Universally, fossil fuel utilization is ~78.3% of the all-out part energy utilization, trailed by 
sustainable power sources with 19.2%. Customary biomass represents 8.9%, while the current sustainable power 
source has a level of 10.3%, controlled by sunlight and air. Internationally, the sustainable energy division between 
2004 and 2013 (barring hydropower) expanded from 85 to ~560 GW. Representing the division was the wind industry 
with development from 48 to 318 GW, trailed by the photovoltaic segment from 2.6 to 139 GW (Rusu & Onea, 2018). 
Globally, the renewable energy sector between 2004 and 2013 (excluding hydropower) increased from 85 to ~560 
GW. Leading the sector was the wind industry with growth from 48 to 318 GW, followed by the photovoltaic sector 
from 2.6 to 139 GW (Swenson, 2020). The growth in the renewable sector was due to several factors including political 
support, financial incentives, and reduction in the costs of technology making renewable energy cost-competitive. As 
the name implies, wave energy is the energy of the waves, collected and transformed into useful energy. It is

Abstract 
 
This study examines the effect of family ownership on risk-taking activities in a corporation. 
Family ownership may lead a corporation to adopt a risk-averse attitude and risk nepotism (where 
inappropriate family members occupy positions of top management), which can lead to business 
inefficiency. On the other hand, family owners have a socioemotional endowment with a 
corporation (Gomez-Mejia et al. 2007) that enables them to behave altruistically and pursue 
sustainability for the sake of their employees and community. In this situation, family owners 
promote top managements to take risk-taking behaviours to stimulate R&D investment and 
innovation.  
This study supposes the effect of family ownership toward risk-taking is not constant and 
hypothesizes that the contingency factor could affect the relations between family ownership and 
risk-taking. In the context of Japan, where family ownership in listed companies exceed 50 percent 
and is in the exposure to pressure by institutional investor, this study considers institutional investor 
ownership as the mediator between risk-taking and family ownership. 
 This study examines the effect of family ownership using panel data in Japanese listed 
companies. I also adopt the system GMM estimators the system GMM estimator proposed by 
Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) for the analysis to solve the endogeneity

Abstract 
The solar water purifier is an advancement of the current water purification system. It has been introduced 
to meet up demands of pure drinking water using renewable energy. It takes solar power as an energy 
source and stores it in a battery which is a free source of energy. Then using this energy, a low-cost 
heating coil heats water up to a certain temperature (below boiling temperature). After condensing cold 
water is further purified through the filtering chalk. In this stage, water is condensed again and gives 
water at room temperature. Through this process, we get pure drinking water. We followed almost all the 
phases of a product development process which started with collecting customer requirements and ended 
with finalizing the design. Cost analysis had also been done from the viewpoint of mass production of the 
product. We optimized the overall process using a metaheuristic approach for heating process, cooling 
process and purifying process. This product, if used properly, can eradicate the scarcity of pure drinking 
water.

1. Introduction
Water is one of the fundamental elements of human life. The need for fresh water is increasing day by day.
Nowadays water purifiers are a must in our daily life. A water purifier purifies impure water. But as a driving
force, it requires a source of energy. The most common energy sources used in such purposes are electricity,
heat, chemical reactions etc. But in our water purifier, we have planned to utilize solar energy as the driving
force. Solar energy is the most available renewable energy that is found in ample anywhere which is also
inexpensive. We can create a voltage difference from solar energy by using solar cells. By accumulating
several solar cells, we can create a solar panel. Then it is connected to a battery to store the energy in the
absence of sunlight in case of cloudy weather. Then the energy is transmitted to a conductive coil to heat water

4. Conclusion 
 
The scarcity of pure drinking water and scarcity of energy are two of the most booming problems of 
Bangladesh. Our solar water purifier offers a perfect solution for both of these problems. We followed all the 
steps of product design from customer surveys to the manufacturing processes. Afterward, the purified water 
quality was tested against different parameters and it was observed through the results that although the 
purification system does not have a significant impact on pH values, it decreases COD, BOD values and other 
parameters. However, the design is effective for only domestic uses. It needs to be refined and amended to 
increase its output for usage in industrial sectors effectively. We can also explore the possibility of removing 
arsenic from drinking water, which is a silent killer toxin in Bangladesh. Due to arsenic poisoning, hundreds of 
people are dying every year in Bangladesh and many water sources have been marked unusable due to this. If 
we can mitigate arsenic levels from water through purification, this can have a revolutionary effect in terms of 
social benefits. These can be scopes of future studies in this field. In Bangladesh, this type of water purifier is 
yet to be introduced in the market. So, we think our solar water purifier, if implemented efficiently by 
removing limitations, will attract customers of all sectors inhabiting in both urban and rural areas.

Abstract 
Transportation plays a vital role in logistics which is an inseparable part of today’s supply chain 
management. An effective transportation network can optimize the supply chain to a great extent by 
reducing total cost, total time as well as maximizing profit. In this paper, we deal with one stage (supplier 
to manufacturer) multimodal fixed cost transportation problem (FCTP) of a local paper mill. Here we have 
formulated three different models which are road transportation model, rail transportation model and a 
combination of road and rail transportation models using linear programming to analyze and select the most 
optimized one for the case. For solving the case, we collected data for keeping the capacity constraints of 
each source and the demand constraints for each destination. We have used an excel solver to solve the 
models and the results show that the Rail route is the most cost-effective, but it leaves some of the demands 
unfulfilled. But the combination of both road and rail routes provide the most cost-effective solution 
satisfying the demands of the destinations. Henceforth, we compared the results by conducting cost analysis 
to select the most optimized one for the organization.

1. Introduction
The transportation problem is defined by distributing any commodity from any group of suppliers, called sources, to any 
group of receiving centers, called destinations, in such a way as to minimize the total distribution cost or total 
time even to maximize profit.  It deals with sources where a supply of some commodity is available and 
destinations where the commodity is demanded. In general, the transportation problem uses a matrix with the 
rows representing sources and columns representing destinations. The algorithms for solving the problem are 
based on this matrix representation. The costs of shipping from sources to destinations are indicated by the entries 
in the matrix. If a shipment is impossible between a given source and destination, a large cost of M is entered. 
This discourages the solution from using such cells. As in the example, the classic transportation problem has a 
total supply equal to total demand. Each source has a certain supply of units to distribute to the destinations, and 
each destination has a certain demand for units to be received from the sources. The transportation cost consists 
of a fixed cost for a certain destination, independent of the amount transported. 
 A transportation chain is divided into three segments: pre-haul (or first mile for the pickup process), long-haul (door-to-
door transit of containers), and end-haul (or last mile for the delivery process). In most cases, the pre-haul and

5. Conclusion 
The transportation problem compares three models that incorporate rail and road transportation systems for single stage 
transportation network optimization. After a thorough cost analysis, it is evident that the multi-modal network 
provides the most efficient results for the supply of raw materials for the respective company. This type of 
optimization network model can also be utilized in varieties of other segments of the logistics network. The 
problem can also be further worked on by developing multi-stage models that incorporate a broader view of the 
supply chain network. Further improvement in the accuracy of the results can also be attained by introducing 
uncertainties in the case.

Abstract 
Global warming has a range of ecological and health impacts, including extreme weather events. 
Increasing energy related carbon emission is a key causing factor of global warming. In order to mitigate 
energy related carbon emissions, buildings tend to adopt renewable energy. Grid-Tied Photovoltaic 
(PV) technology is a globally accepted renewable technology used for built environment. Grid-Tied PV 
systems are progressively attracting the attention of academia and industry as an alternative power 
source. This technology is a solution to increasing energy demand and helps to limit environmental 
pollution. Accordingly, adoption of grid-tied PV system considered as promising alternative to shift 
from fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, objective of this study is to deliver an overall understanding 
of grid-tied PV system in order to promote its application. This communication present a comprehensive 
review on application, benefits and strategies of grid-tied PV system. As the key findings, 
environmental, economic and social benefits and strategies of grid-tied PV system were determined and 
presented through a conceptual framework. In response to the increasing concern on renewable energy 
technologies, this paper proposes to use the developed framework as a basis to understand the benefits 
of gird-tied PV system, in order to promote application of grid-tied PV system.

Abstract 
This paper describes the way of protecting human tissues from the electromagnetic waves by using portable textile 
protecting shield on garments. The shield consists of yarn of stainless steel and a dyed yarn of metallic aluminum 
particle. The Protective shield can be assembled with the garments easily and can be used as a portable shield to use 
it in different garments. Technical textiles are used instead of conventional textiles material because of its excellent 
performance. Human Comfort has been kept in mind. The efficiency of the protective Clothing is good and the cost 
is low for general people, which is less than 2 USD.

Introduction: 
The electronics industry has grown rapidly than any other industry in the whole world. We are using the electronic 
equipment in our daily lives and the electromagnetic interference (EMI) exposes to us as they operate in close 
proximity as radiation level of different electronic devices is shown below in table 1(Chudasama, 2013)(Brzeziński 
et al., 2009).

The multifunctional flexible fabrics have lightweight and they have the resistance to electromagnetic radiation. They 
also contain the basic properties and structures of textile material(Amiet, Nahavandi, & Kaynak, 2007). When staple 
fibers 
are 
mounted 
with 
stainless 
steel, 
they 
show 
good 
resistance 
towards 
electromagnetic 
interference(Nanocomposites, 2012). Now, the electromagnetic inference has become a potential health hazard and 
by the cumulative exposure, various diseases like increased risk of DNA, RNA deformation and brain tumor can be 
a threat(Apreutesei et al., 2014; Deprospero & Picard, 1990). There is research going on all over the world of 
preventing radiation. The radiation cannot be prevented at a time but the level of radiation can be lessened by using 
a protective shield.

Abstract 
Football is played by approximately 250 million people, and draws approximately 1.3 billion in audiences worldwide, 
making it the most popular sport in the world. Being a competitive sport, football teams are naturally interested in 
improving the performance of its players, improving its standing in their respective regions, and gaining a competitive 
edge over opponents. This paper analyzed the offensive and defensive efficiencies of Southeast Asian football teams 
that competed in the AFF Suzuki Cup 2018. This was achieved by mathematical optimization method, in particular 
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), to compute for the frontiers of offensive and defensive efficiency. The results 
from DEA yielded some interesting findings. First, the researchers found that on average, the offensive efficiency of 
the teams is greater than their defensive efficiency. Second, the researchers also found the teams to be more efficient 
at home than when playing away.  Third, the researchers found that the best strategy to produce points and goals for 
SEA football teams in the AFF is to improve the defense when playing at home, and to improve the offense when 
playing away from home.

1. Introduction
Football is one of, if not the most popular sport in the world. In 2018, Nielsen published a report on football statistics 
in the days leading up to the FIFA world cup. Football drew far bigger numbers in terms of popularity and audiences, 
with more than 40% of the population claiming to be interested in the sport (Lovett, 2018). On the other hand, the 
football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of 
the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in 
football.  In 2010, a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the 
quadrennial month-long World Cup finals (Alegi, Joy et al, 2018). 
The governing body of football in Southeast Asia is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Football 
Federation or more commonly known as the AFF. The AFF hosts its Championships (otherwise known and from this 
point will be referred to as the Suzuki Cup) biennially since 1996. There are three stages in the AFF: the qualification 
round or play-offs, the group competitions or stages, and the semi-finals and finals (ASEAN Football Federation, 2018). 
In the group stages, the teams are split into two groups, wherein at the end of the group stage, the two top-performing 
teams from each group advance to the semis and the finals. Based on the AFF tournament regulations, the scoring 
system is as follows: three (3) points are awarded to the winner of each match, one (1) point if the match concludes in 
a draw, and none (0) for the defeated team. 
In football, even one goal can spell the difference between victory or defeat. Team coaches employ different tactics that 
they feel will best utilize the abilities of the team’s players (Zambom-Ferraresi, Rios, et al, 2018). A study by Zambom-
Ferraresi et al (2018) names player selection and design of strategy as the biggest decision factors or variables. Another 
study by Villa and Lozano (2016) stressed the importance of football teams using their resources effectively to secure 
a win.

The regression model for the goals at home consist of only one independent variable: shots on goal. This independent 
variable account for an 73.61% of the variability of the regression model as indicated by the coefficient of 
determination, R2 or 70.31% as indicated by the adjusted R2. The regression equation is: GoalsHOME = 0.508 + 0.671 
Shots on Goal.  Usually, the team that plays in their home ground has more attempts, off or on goal. More shots taken 
by the players could boost the team’s confidence in creating a threat that would ensure that the shot will land in the 
back of the net, scoring a goal.    
 
The regression model of points generated by football teams for all matches away consist of three independent variables 
comprised of ball possession, blocked shots, and goal saves. These independent variables account for an 84.38% of 
the variability of the regression model as indicated by the coefficient of determination, R2 or 76.57% as indicated by 
the adjusted R2.  The regression equation is:  PointsAWAY = -4.37 + 9.26 Ball Possession + 1.054 Blocked - 0.574 Goal 
Saves.  As shown in the regression equation, the increase in ball possession and blocked shots result to an increase in 
points, while a decrease in goal saves result to an increase in points. A common strategy in an away game is 
maintaining ball possession of the teams, blocking shots, and preventing goal attempts as much as possible. 
 
Finally, the regression model for the goals generated by football teams for all matches away consist of only one 
variable: fouls. The regression equation is:  GoalsAWAY = 7.32 - 0.387 Fouls.  As shown in the regression equation, 
the decrease in fouls result to an increase in goals. In matches away from home, the abilities of both teams are uncertain 
in terms of execution of playing strategy thus, outcome is unpredictable. For the away team to secure victory they 
usually tighten their defensive abilities, like blocking shots, standing tackle etc. Thus, unintentionally they can commit 
fouls that aims to prevent the home team from scoring a goal. 
 
4.  Conclusion 
 
This paper  evaluated the technical efficiency of Southeast Asian football teams that competed in the AFF Suzuki Cup 
2018 using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), under the CCR assumption (constant returns to scale) and with an 
output-orientated approach. The researchers chose the DEA approach to calculate the efficiency frontier – that is, the 
maximum achievable performance of each team, to identify which teams are offensive and defensively efficient in 
their strategy with respect to the chosen input variables (ball possession, goal attempts, etc.) and output variables 
(points and goals produced). With DEA, the researchers were able to benchmark the football teams in order to discover 
the best-performing teams and identify gaps in output for the inefficient teams, in line with similar football DEA 
studies (Villa and Lozano, 2016), (Bosca, 2009), (Rubem, 2015). Finally, the researchers were able to identify the 
relationship between input and output variables and how they interact with and affect each other, to find out which 
variables contribute significantly to a team’s success.

Abstract 
In this work, the demand pattern of readymade garments of a knit garments factory in Bangladesh was studied and factors 
influencing the demand pattern were identified. An accurate sales forecast is a prerequisite of achieving an accurate and 
effective supply plan of complete garments. A Fuzzy Inference System based algorithm was developed to predict the sales 
of garments according to the sales influencing factors. The developed algorithm is mainly a quantitative method of 
forecasting but also takes into account some qualitative issues. The developed model was compared with the actual total 
sales found by traditional seasonal forecast with trend adjustment. The seasonal factors for the two cyclic demand patterns, 
January – June, and July - December of each year were calculated and the Linear Regression trend was followed to 
calculate the traditional forecasting. The developed model showed better prediction as it matches closely with the actual 
sales. The Root Mean squared Error (RMSE) and Mean absolute deviations (MAD) are 3.605 and 3.081 in the developed 
fuzzy model which is within the standard limit. Thus the obtained result showed by the Fuzzy model yields better demand 
prediction taking into account the inherent uncertainties and with less error and thus the efficiency of the proposed Fuzzy 
model was verified.

1. Introduction:
Sales Forecasting is the process of estimating what our business’s sales are going to be in the future. Sales forecasting is an 
integral part of business management. Without a solid idea of what our future sales are going to be, we cannot manage our 
inventory or our cash flow or plan for growth. The purpose of sales forecasting is to provide information that we can use to 
make intelligent business decisions Ward (2013). The objective of sales forecasting is to provide consummate information 
that we can use to make level-headed business decisions. Without forecasting sales volume, it is very tough for us to guide 
the company in the right direction. Businesses are forced to look well ahead in order to plan their investments, launch new 
products and decide when to close or withdraw products and so on. The sales forecasting process is a critical one for most 
businesses. Sales forecasting is used to serve a variety of functions in a company such as coordinating operations, 
smoothing production, achieving economic scale, improving logistic performance, reducing inspection & packaging cost 
etc. Maintaining an inappropriate forecast is a costly exercise, generally regards this as primary evil from managerial point 
of view. 
Gardner and McKenzie (1988) tried to guide in identifying exponential smoothing models with non-seasonal data in Fuzzy 
rule extraction directly from numerical data for function approximation. They highly recommended to select the models at 
first where exponentially smoothing model will show a better result without applying it everywhere. (Gardner Jr & 
McKenzie, 1988). D. W. Cho and Y. H. Lee (2013) considered seasonal factors that affect the demand of a product which 
causes a highly fluctuating situation in the supply chain.(Cho & Lee, 2013). Roberts (1989) worked on formulating short 
term sales forecasting and introduced a range of Fuzzy models of considerable importance. He suggested using simple 
combined forecasting models with more accuracy as benchmark rather than a complex combination(Clemen, 1989).Claudio 
S. Bisso and Carlos Patricio Samanez (2014) used Fuzzy Logic approach for determining the distribution of a particular
item and model developed by considering the alternatives.(Bisso & Samanez, 2014) R.J. Kuo and K.C. Xue (1998)
attempted to develop an intelligent sales forecasting system using Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Fuzzy Systems which
pointed far improved result than conventional autoregressive moving average (ARMA) method. They also supported the
suitability of their combined Fuzzy Artificial Neural Network (FANN) model  comparing with single ANN method.(R. J.
Kuo & Xue, 1998) Byoung Chul Lee et al. (2009) (Lee, Park, & Kim, 2012). R.J. Kuo (2001) developed GFNN (a fuzzy
neural network model with initial weight developed from genetic algorithm) to forecast  sales of a convenience store (CVS)
company which showed reasonably better outcome in case of fluctuating internal and external environments like special
offers, promotion, etc. (R. Kuo, 2001) Sarwar et al. (2015) developed an Artificial Intelligence (ANFIS) model for forecast
the Natural Gas consumption. (Ferdous Sarwar, Rashid, & Ghosh, 2014) G. Peter Zhang and Min Qi (2005) investigated
the issue of how to effectively model time series with both seasonal and trend patterns with Genetic Fuzzy Predictor
Ensemble. They have established their conclusion with experimental results that a combination of data pre-processing
approaches- De-trending and De-seasonalization and then developing a forecasting model with artificial intelligence

Figure 5. Comparison of Sales forecast with fuzzy model and traditional Approach 
 
The graph in the figure 5 shows the difference between the fuzzy model forecast and the traditional approach forecast of 
corresponding time period. Curve representing traditional and fuzzy model forecasted sales show very little discrepancies 
between the fuzzy model forecast and traditional occurrence. From the actual sales data, related performances measures 
were calculated to validate the Fuzzy model. The Root Mean squared Error (RMSE), Mean absolute deviation (MAD) and 
Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 3.605, 3.081 and 10.03% respectively. 
6. Conclusion: 
As an effective sales forecasting tool, multivariable fuzzy logic model can be used as demonstrated by our results. The 
fuzzy model performed best because of its ability to identify nonlinear relationships in the input data. However, the 
correlation was better for short-term forecasts and not as good for longer time periods. A much more comprehensive model 
can be built by taking into account other factors like climate, percentage price change, marketing strategies etc., which 
would be an extension of our work submitted in this paper. 
In this research work, the demand pattern of RMG of a DBL Group was studied and factors having influence behind the 
demand pattern were identified. In order to achieve an accurate and effective supply plan of RMG it is prerequisite to have 
an accurate sales forecast of it. As newer forecasting models are being invented with the passage of time, our textile and 
clothing sector should adopt some modernized method to forecast RMG demand. So, an algorithm that will able to forecast 
RMG demand with respect to our country environment with more accuracy will play a major role in the development of our 
clothing sector. A Fuzzy Inference System based algorithm was developed in this research in order to predict sales of RMG 
according to the condition of the sales influencing factors in Bangladesh. Sixteen input nodes namely Design, Shade 
Variation, Finishing, Cotton specification, trims & accessories etc. were considered as inputs to predict one output which is

amount of sales of RMG. The developed algorithm is a mainly a quantitative method of forecasting but also takes into 
account some qualitative issues.  
The developed model was compared with the actual total sales found by traditional seasonal forecast with trend adjustment. 
The forecasting error of the developed Fuzzy model is found to be very low. The error found is only 3.605%. Obtained 
result shows that the Fuzzy model yield better demand prediction taking into account the inherent uncertainties and with 
less error.

Abstract 
In a competitive environment, it is crucial for organizations to know how efficiently and effectively they are 
operating compared to similar organizations. The challenge is to somehow draw helpful insights from all these 
numbers that will lead to improvements in the performance of the organization. Efficiency measurement is one 
aspect of organizational performance. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique is considered the most 
appropriate tool for evaluating the performance of a set of comparable homogenous organizations under some 
predefined conditions. In real-life problems, values for input and/or output variables include uncertainty, this 
uncertainty may be randomness or vagueness in nature. The purpose of this study is the using of some theoretical 
results to develop a unified DEA model to handle different uncertainty types, the developed model allows various 
natures of variables (vagueness, randomness and deterministic) depending on the nature of uncertainty in the 
variables. Implementation of the model was presented through some cases to illustrate the model functionality. In 
addition, the results are compared with three other different DEA models; a Combined fuzzy/deterministic model, 
a Combined stochastic/deterministic model, and a deterministic model. Managers can rely on the developed model 
to assess relative efficiency in business complex systems associated with different uncertainty natures.

1. Introduction
One of the most important principles in any business is the principle of efficiency; where the best possible 
economic effects (outputs) are attained with as little economic sacrifices as possible (inputs). In order to assess 
the relative efficiency of a business unit, it is necessary to consider the conditions and operation results of other 
units of the same kind and to determine the real standing of the results of such a comparison. DEA is a powerful 
quantitative tool that provides a means to obtain useful information about relative efficiency and performance of 
firms, organizations, and all sorts of functionally similar, relatively autonomous operating units, known as 
decision making units (DMUs). The DEA objective is to assess the relative efficiency of each DMU in relation to 
its peers. The DEA result is a classification of all DMUs as either “efficient” or “inefficient”. Not only classifying 
the DMUs, but also determining the level of inefficiency and the corresponding amount to enhance the 
performance (El-Demerdash et al., 2013).  
Usually the investigated DMUs are characterized by a vector of multiple inputs and multiple outputs. A main 
advantage of DEA is that it does not require any prior assumptions on the underlying functional relationships 
between the input and output variables (Cooper et al., 2006). However, one of the most weaknesses in traditional 
DEA models is that it does not allow uncertainty variations in input and output data, although many important 
reality observations either stochastic or fuzzy in nature. As a result, DEA efficiency measurement may be sensitive 
to such variations Cooper et al. (2011). A DMU which is rated as efficient relative to other DMUs may turn 
inefficient if such uncertainty variations are considered, or vice versa. In another word, if the collected data for a

measure improvement in efficiency), and provide performance indices or measures for comparing efficiencies, 
and rate bonds. 
7. Conclusions 
Since exact data may not always be available in real life problem performance assessments due to the existence of 
uncertainty. As a result, DEA efficiency measurement may be sensitive to such variations. A DMU which is rated 
as efficient relative to other DMUs may turn inefficient if such uncertainty variations are considered, or vice versa. 
In another word, if the collected data for a variable is not represented in the correct form nature, then the resulting 
efficiencies will be erroneous and misleading because of the high sensitivity of the efficiency scores to the realized 
levels of inputs or outputs. 
 Therefore, a unified input-oriented DEA model is proposed to conduct performance assessments in uncertainty 
environments that able to deal with either input and/or output cases simultaneously, while the variables have 
vagueness or randomness in nature and the remaining variables are deterministic in nature. The model is tailored 
for fuzzy variables with triangular membership functions and has been handled using the α-cut approach, while 
the chance constraints programming approach was used to handle the stochastic variables. 
Through the illustrative example, it is noticed that the nature of the variable has an influence on the resulting 
relative efficiency levels and could toggle the status of the DMU from efficient to inefficient and vice versa. 
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the nature of the variable from the beginning and apply the appropriate DEA 
model to achieve reliable results.

Abstract 
Markov chain traffic assignment (MCTA) is a relatively recent approach for modeling traffic conditions 
in a road network. It results in traffic density measurements that express congestion levels in the 
network at the road level. While the stochastic approach is powerful analytically, the resulting traffic 
density does not readily lend itself to emissions estimation. Typically, average-speed emission models 
are utilized to estimate emissions on an aggregate network level. However, while this is easily done in user 
equilibrium (UE) models using the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) relationship to derive vehicles’ average 
speed from traffic flow, no such relationship exists for traffic density. We highlight the mathematical 
challenge here and propose an approach to estimate vehicles’ average speed based on traffic density 
obtained from MCTA. The average speeds are then used to estimate vehicles’ Greenhouse Gas 
emissions using average-speed emission estimation models. This approach can be applied on a road level 
or aggregated to a network level. We utilize the BPR relationship to build a linear piece-wise 
approximation function and illustrate its use through two widely used average-speed emission estimation 
models: TRANSYT-7F and COPERT v5.

1. Introduction
The ever-growing demand on transportation resources to facilitate increasing mobility requirements and human 
activities continues to place mounting pressure on transportation networks. This is reflected in the number and 
frequency of studies considering the transportation network design problem (NDP), and the many modeling 
and solution approaches proposed to address it over the years. In essence, the NDP is the problem of 
designing a transportation road network to reduce some cost or improve some benefit. Many studies use total 
travel time, total vehicle miles, construction costs, or congestion as their cost objective. Different design 
approaches are adopted in studies to achieve these objectives, they include street capacity expansions, scheduling 
traffic lights, traffic turning or direction restrictions, and determining road tolls. A review of transportation 
network design literature is found in (Farahani et al., 2013). 
In recent years a new alternative approach to the User Equilibrium (UE) traffic assignment model was proposed by 
(E. Crisostomi, Kirkland and Shorten, 2011). The new approach utilizes Markov chain theory to model vehicle 
traffic on the network stochastically and estimate vehicles’ distribution on the network establishing its’ traffic 
assignment, and as such the approach is referred to as the Markov Chain Traffic Assignment (MCTA) model. The 
MCTA approach is used in (Salman and Alaswad, 2018) to model traffic assignment as part of their NDP model, 
where roads’ traffic direction restriction is used to convert two-way roads to one-way roads to alleviate congestion.

4. Conclusion
While a closed-form mathematical relationship relating average vehicles’ speed to traffic density is not possible, we 
propose piece-wise approximation function to bridge this gap. The approximation function can satisfy most practical 
emission estimation applications. We tested the approach using two widely used average-speed emissions estimation 
models: TRANSYT-7F and COPERT v5. The model can be deployed to road level as well as network level 
estimations. 
This work opens the door for NDP models using MCTA to consider environmental objectives in its optimization 
through GHG emissions. An NDP model such as the one proposed by (Salman and Alaswad, 2018) can be extended 
into a bi-objective optimization model which simultaneously considers network congestion and its environmental 
impact. This research direction is the subject of another paper that is currently under review.

Abstract 
The resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (RCMPSP) has predominately been addressed 
in deterministic environment. Yet, uncertainty is inherent to real-life problems and the rise in adopting 
projects and portfolios in managing business organizations has initiated growing interest in considering 
stochastic aspects when developing a resource schedule. Priority rules (PR) is a common approach to 
solving the RCMPSP avoiding its computational complexity. Since the performance of PRs is highly 
dependent on project context, it is necessary to study the performance of PRs with real-life cases. The 
current study presents an application of 17 priority rules to a portfolio of deep-water construction projects. 
The results confirm previous results obtained from the literature and gives project and portfolio managers 
insights about the adequacy of different PRs with respect to schedule quality and robustness.

1. Introduction
A common issue for contemporary enterprises is the simultaneous management of multiple projects in a portfolio 
through sharing limited resources. Hence, resource related decisions are one of the prominent aspects of multi-project 
environments (Beşikci, Bilge, & Ulusoy, 2015). On the top of those decisions is the determination of a schedule that 
satisfies the activities precedence and resource constraints while minimizing the projects duration (Z. Chen, 
Demeulemeester, Bai, & Guo, 2018). This problem is called Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem 
(RCMPSP). 
Due to the dynamic nature of the real-world environment, project scheduling is subject to considerable uncertainties. 
For example, the project scope may change, weather conditions may cause delays to some activities (Z. Chen et al., 
2018), activities may take longer or shorter than preliminarily expected, resources availability may vary, new activities 
or projects may have to be included or dropped (X. Wang, Chen, Mao, Chen, & Li, 2015), material may arrive behind 
schedule, due dates may have to be changed (Zheng, Shumin, Ze, & Yueni, 2013). Therefore, it’s essential to include 
uncertainty when developing project schedule. Uncertainty in project management have been classified according to 
their sources as internal and external uncertainty (Hazır & Ulusoy, 2019). The former relate mainly to the project and 
are highly affected by the organization, while the latter are generated by uncertainties in logistics and procurement, 
environment, socio-political circumstances, market, and technology. This work mainly focuses on uncertainty 
internally generated.  
When dealing with multiple projects, two approaches have been used: (1) a single-project approach, using dummy 
activities and precedence arcs to combine the projects into a single mega-project with a single start and finish node or 
(2) a multi-project approach, considering a separate critical path with a distinct start and finish node for each project.
Based on literature analysis, it is obvious that the second approach is more realistic, has received less attention, and
presents a greater opportunity for improvement (Browning & Yassine, 2010). Thus, the multi-project approach will
be used in this research.

Figure 6. Performance of quality and robustness measures Q2 and R2  
The current results have been compared to the results obtained by (Browning & Yassine, 2010). In their work only 
one objective related to delay has been considered to reflect project manager and portfolio manager perspectives. Thus 
only results from quality measures Q1 and Q2 can be compared. For a project configuration similar to the current case 
study related to network low complexity and front-loaded resource distribution and low resource contention, they 
identified the following PRs as performing best in terms of project delay: MINWCS, MAXSP, TWK-LST, MINSLK, 
MINLFT, EDDF, MAXTWK, and MOF. In terms of portfolio delay the following PRs have been identified for best 
performance: LALP, MS, MCS, MINSLK, and MINWCS. It is noticed that similar results are obtained. Furthermore, 
results have been compared to (Y. Wang et al., 2017). It is observed that values for R1 and R2 in the current study are 
generally higher than those reported by (Y. Wang et al., 2017). This is due to two reasons. First, the higher uncertainty 
level in the considered case study; in fact, the average deviation from planned value reached +148% and -43% on 
average. Second, while the activity duration in (Y. Wang et al., 2017) were generated by a random number ranging 
from 1 to 9, the activity duration in the current case study show a high variation level (Table 2). This high variation 
in activity duration among project activities is one of the most influencing parameters on the obtained result with 
reference to Q1 & Q2. 
Therefore, a rule that performs well under most cases is recommended. Thus, MAXSLK and MINTWK are 
recommended for both project and portfolio level. 
In conclusion MS wins for Q1, which seems to be acceptable because each activity has a relatively higher 
number of successors, while MAXSLK dominates for Q2. The unexpectedly good performance for this rule is due to 
the activities with high slack need more resources than the critical activities which not required a lot of resources. For 
robustness measures, MCS performs well for R1, whereas SOF delivers the best for R2. In addition, MAXSLK and 
MINTWK considered as the preferable rules with respect to Q1 and Q2. These results show that the performance of 
priority rules differs significantly according to the desirable objective. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
This work presented a case study for applying PRs to solve the RCMPSP considering uncertainty in activity duration. 
A set of 17 PRs have been compared to test the performance of the individual project and portfolio in terms of schedule 
quality and robustness. In order to identify the PR performing best, a trade-off has to be made. An evident conflict 
may be identified between the selected objectives as well as the viewpoints of project and portfolio managers. The 
presentation of results and analysis for the specific case study for the company gives managers insights about the 
performance of the different PRs and allows to arrive at a compromise satisfying both objectives and viewpoints 
within the defined company strategy. Since, no PR is ranked best under different circumstances related to project and 
resource characteristics, such a case study is vital to help managers solve the RCMPSP under uncertainty inherent to

the real-life cases. The applied approach is advantageous due its simplicity, low computational requirement and the 
application of commercial project management software. 
Finally, this study is subject to the following limitations.  First, we considered a relatively small set of projects (three 
projects), and each project consists of only 34 activities. In real-life cases project size and the number of projects 
included in the portfolio may be larger. Second, the study does not consider the dynamic arrival of projects. Finally, 
the resources are constant and uniformly distributed during the total portfolio execution duration. 
Recommendations for future work include the consideration of other sources of uncertainty related to resource 
availability and dynamic project arrival. Additionally, other priority rules designed for the stochastic environment may 
be further analyzed and compared to the performance of the 17 PRs presented in this work.

Abstract 
The objective of this paper is to investigate the opportunities, perspectives, and risks of employing biocides 
in Saudi Arabia using qualitative and quantitative parameters of the market. In solving the problem of the 
impact of biocides on health and environment, prior consideration must be given to the safety of agricultural 
products, as in excess of 90% of the total amount of biocides that enter the human body from the 
environment originate from food. The ecological safety of agricultural products can be achieved by 
compliance with the principles of “greening” of agriculture, developing hydroponic cultivation of crop 
products, and cleansing the soil of biocides.

Moreover, the process needs to be monitored using analytical techniques and tools to inhibit contaminants from 
spreading into the environment.  
Ongoing research aims to eliminate the use of traditional biocides or replace them with green, environmentally friendly 
biocides. Jie et al. (Jie Wen, Zhao, Gu, & Raad, 2009) introduced a green biocide enhancer, 
ethylenediaminedisuccinate (EDDS), for the treatment of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) biofilms on carbon steel 
surfaces using glutaraldehyde. Experiments were conducted on 100ml anaerobic vials with carbon steel coupons. They 
found that EDDS reduced the glutaraldehyde amounts significantly in the inhibition of SRB biofilm establishment 
and the treatment of established biofilms on carbon steel coupon surfaces. Jie et. al. also (J Wen, Xu, Gu, & Raad, 
2012) used a mixture of three green biocides, namely tetrakis-hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate (THPS), 
glutaraldehyde, and ethylenediaminedisuccinate (EDDS) for the treatment of the planktonic sulfate-reducing bacteria 
(SRB) and to eliminate established SRB biofilms. It was inferred from their experiment that biofilm removal was 
achieved when 50ppm glutaraldehyde combined with 15% methanol and 1,000ppm EDDS. Omran et. al. (Omran, 
Fatthalah, El-Gendy, El-Shatoury, & Abouzeid, 2013) developed three green biocides from readily available natural 
non-edible domestic waste for the treatment of the aforementioned SRB. These three green biocides consisted of the 
hot water extracts of orange, mandarin peels, and water extract of lupine seeds. Such natural extracts express good 
biocidal activity against SRB. Silva et. al. (Silva, Rosado, Teixeira, Candeias, & Caldeira, 2015) proposed the 
formation of green biocides based upon combined methodologies that utilize antifungal tests, chromatographic 
techniques, FTIR-ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared – Attenuated Total  Reflection) spectroscopy, microscopic 
approaches, and simulation assays that permit the detection of antifungal potential and rapid identification of ground-
breaking bioactive compounds. Thus the proposed green biocides indicate great potential for future applications in 
cultural and built heritage rehabilitation and in being green substitutes to the biocides currently used. 
 
6. Limitations of Using Green Biocides 
 
There is a need for novel green biocides derived from natural products that are easily biodegradable. The desire for 
safe biocides that are green to the environment is both a primary and policy concern in the USA, Canada, and Europe. 
The strict US EPA regulations may result in the removal of a large number of biocidal products that are incompatible 
with the environment. Green biocides may be somewhat less effective than conventional biocides, and regrowth may 
occur. Moreover, there is concern that bacterial, fungal, and algal species may develop resistance against a commonly 
used green biocide. 
 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
Biocides are highly significant in many technical, economic, agricultural, and industrial applications in which they 
are dosed to avoid any complications associated with microbial, fungal, and algal growth. However, biocides are toxic 
chemicals that can harm human beings and the environment. Therefore, there is a great need to develop novel types 
of biocides that are green and environment-friendly. This paper discussed types of traditional biocides, their effects 
on humans and the natural world, their limitations and how they ought to be replaced by green biocides that are 
environmentally safe.

Abstract 
Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP) addresses the primary sources of carbon emissions, which is distribution. 
This paper aims to fulfill the demand for a set of customers using a fleet of vehicles originating from a single depot 
with the primary objective of minimizing carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. This work defines a mixed-integer 
linear programming model that considers heterogeneous vehicles, customer time window constraints, service time at 
each customer, and vehicle capacity constraints in GVRP. The model is studied on a real-life case study using three 
objectives functions; the classical vehicle routing problem objective of minimizing the total travel distance, 
minimizing the deviation of a fleet of vehicles’ traveling speed from the optimum traveling speed, and directly 
minimizing the total amount of emissions produced. This work also studies the effect of varying vehicle velocity and 
distance on the amount of emissions produced. The computational results show that up to 9% and 21% reduction in 
emissions and fuel consumption can be achieved compared to distance-oriented solutions and velocity oriented 
solutions, respectively.

1. Introduction
Green Logistics has lately received a great deal of attention from governments and business organizations all over the 
globe (Lin et al., 2014). This scope of attention is a part of almost every modern supply chain network, where 
transportation and logistics operations within a city, region, or even among nations have caused severe global climate 
changes (Demir, Bektaş and Laporte, 2014). The Keeling Curve in (The Keeling Curve, 2019) shows that the 
concentration of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq ) emissions in the atmosphere has been growing in the past half-
century and even faster in the last decade. The transportation sector is one of the most significant contributors to total 
emissions. According to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990–2017, transportation 
accounted for the largest portion (29%) of total U.S. emissions in 2017 with 83% of these transportation emissions 
are due to road transportation (Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 2019). 
Thus, considering emissions in the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) problem will ensure the sustainability of 
mother earth due to the dire results of the greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, choosing the right selection of routes, 
that will meet ever-growing environmental concerns while still considering the economic aspect, is the main objective 
of the GVRP problem. Considering emissions may lead to quite different logistic plans for customer assignments, 
route selections, and schedules than the classical VRP. Although research in the field of classical vehicle routing 
problem (VRP) has been studied over the past decades, only after 2006, Green VRP (GVRP) became a hot topic in 
the field of research. Therefore, environmental dimension has been added to the economic dimension in the VRP, 
trying to find the right balance between these two targets. Green logistics activities include assessing the impact of the 
different distribution strategies on the environment, reducing the energy usage in logistics activities, and reducing 
waste and managing its treatment (Sbihi and Eglese, 2010). 
According to an extensive survey of the GVRP problem by (Lin et al., 2014), related studies on VRP from the 
perception of reducing emissions produced are rarely found. Furthermore, the traditional VRP objective of reducing 
the total distance is considered by most researchers since it is believed that routing decisions leading to minimizing 
total travel distance lead to a decrease in emissions and fuel consumption. (Lin et al., 2014) also noted that variants 
of the classical VRP problem, since it was introduced in 1959, have been applied to the GVRP model to make it

5.5 Comparison of the Three Experiments 
The average results of the performance measures on the three time-domains are shown in Figure 3. Since the third 
objective considers both distance and velocity deviation minimization, it does not choose the shortest congested route 
of (340.6 km with average velocity 38 km/hr) nor the longest less congested route of (438.3 km with average velocity 
49 km/hr) but it puts both objectives into consideration by choosing a longer route than experiment 1 by an average 
of 7% and a less congested route than experiment 3 with average velocity less by 10%.  Therefore, the total deviation 
decreases from the distance minimization experiment by 23% but increases by 15% when compared with the velocity 
deviation minimization experiment. Therefore, it decreases total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and fuel 
consumed by 15% than the first experiment and by 21% than the second experiment.

6. Conclusions 
In this paper, we present a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming model for heterogeneous, capacitated 
green vehicle routing and scheduling problem with time windows in order to minimize CO2eq emissions and fuel 
consumed. Distance minimization, velocity deviation minimization and directly minimizing the emissions produced 
are the three objectives studied in this work. Distance minimization experiment generates routes of minimum total 
distance; however, this routing decision making leads to the selection of routes with more significant deviations from 
the optimum traveling speed. On the other hand, velocity deviation minimization model results in the longest routes 
with vehicle velocities closer to the optimum, regardless of the distances associated with these routes. However, 
emissions minimization model considers distance and velocity by choosing an intermediate route, longer and less 
congested than distance minimization model where the vehicle can travel on a speed near optimum and still shorter 
than velocity deviation minimization model resulting in the least travel time, emissions and fuel consumed. Comparing 
the three objectives shows that there is a trade-off between the total distance traveled and vehicle velocity. The 
experiments prove that minimizing distance objective does not always achieve optimum results. Therefore, managing 
trade-off is crucial to achieving least amount of emissions and fuel consumed. The model generated is implemented 
on a real-life case study, where feasible and optimal routes for the different model objectives are generated, proving 
the applicability of the developed mathematical model and its usefulness in proving implementation ready solutions 
to decision-makers. Results of all experiments show that shifting departure times to more congested time-periods 
decreases traveling velocities on all possible routes, increasing the deviation from the optimal travel speeds and, 
consequently, increasing both emissions and fuel consumed compared with departure times at less congested time-
periods. In future work, developing better estimates for fuel consumption rate rather than being merely a linear 
function of the emission rate might be considered. Also, investigating whether the emissions caused by refrigeration 
should be taken into account in temperature-controlled transportation and whether will it affect the routing decisions.

Abstract 
Water is a vital part for all creatures, however, huge variation exists between countries in terms of clean 
water availability. Most countries suffer from extreme shortage in water resources along with fast increase 
in population. This resulted in even more complicated problem that has a direct impact on the economical 
and development aspects of countries. This paper employs the Preference Selection Index (PSI) in selecting 
the most suitable water desalination process for different types of feed water. Seven water desalination 
technologies were compared: The electrodialysis, reverse osmosis, multi flash distillation, multi effect 
desalination, vapor compression, ion exchange and nanofiltration. A total of 12 criteria were considered in 
evaluating the selected desalination methods, these were related to the technology cost, lifespan, simplicity, 
reliability, quality and environmental impact. Results showed that the ion exchange is the most suitable 
desalination technology.

Multi criteria decision making, Water desalination, Water shortage and Clean water 
1. Introduction
A wide variation exists between countries in terms of the availability of clean water (Hajeeh & Al-Othman, 2005). 
Several water desalination processes are currently used to treat saltwater and enhance the limited freshwater supply. 
These technologies are categorized into the Membrane-based, thermal based technologies and ion exchange 
(Ghassemi & Danesh, 2013). In membrane-based technology, many types of membranes could be used to separate 
dissolved solids from water. The two most commonly used technologies in this type are the reverse osmosis (RO) and 
electrodialysis (ED). In the thermal based processes, water is transformed initially into vapor and then returned into 
the liquid state. A variety of cost efficient technologies are currently used in the thermal based processes such as multi 
stage flash distillation (MSF), multi effect distillation (MED) and vapor compression (VC) (Afify, 2010). In the ion 
exchange technology, an exchange of ions between the solution and resin is accomplished (Galama, 2015).  
Every water desalination technology has its advantages and disadvantages, which make the process of selecting an 
optimum and most suitable water desalination for a specific location a complicated task. This is because of having 
multiple objectives and constraints, which might contradict with each other at some levels and should be optimized 
simultaneously. In addition, the lack of sufficient data to select between different techniques is another problem. This 
kind of decisions, selecting water desalination process, is considered one of the Multi Criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) methods, where many choices are compared and ranked (Ghassemi & Danesh, 2013).  
Decision-making and judgments are essential requirement of the average person’s daily life. Human judgment 
received considerable attention in and out of the psychology science (Anderson, 1970), (Dawes, 1971), (Louviere, 
1974). For some decisions, one criterion can be the focus of the decision maker, while other decisions rely on multi-
criteria, simultaneously.  MCDM tools are used to evaluate candidate alternatives for the purpose of ranking, choosing 
or sorting based on a number of qualitative and/or quantitative criteria and is associated with different measuring units

6. Conclusions 
 
In this paper, seven water desalination technologies were compared based on 12 criteria. The PSI multi criteria 
decision making technique was considered as a novel tool to judge between water desalination technologies. Published 
literature was the main source for data collection. The PSI concluded that the most favorable water desalination 
methods was Ion exchange, followed by vapor compression, nanofiltration, electrodialysis, multi effect desalination, 
multi flash distillation and then by reverse osmosis. 
As a future study, the seven water desalination technologies that have been studied could be compared using different 
multi criteria decision making tools to validate the PSI results.

Abstract 
In this paper, an oral solid dosage (OSD) packaging unit in a reputed pharmaceuticals company of Bangladesh is 
thoroughly investigated for its present availability level and a practical approach to improve the same is pursued. 
Such work is a new practice from the context of the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh. Availability is one of 
the three factors upon which overall equipment efficiency (OEE) depends. It is found that lower availability of 
machines acts as the main culprit behind the overall lower availability value in OEE for the considered OSD 
packaging unit. However, machine availability – defined as the ratio of machine uptime and the summation of 
machine uptime and machine downtime – depends on many external factors that are liable for unfavorable machine 
downtime and uptime. Maintenance personnel index (MP), task severity index (TS), and daily maintenance index 
(DM) are identified as the external factors crucial to the availability of the Blister packaging machine in the 
considered OSD unit. The interpretations of these three indices are in detail demonstrated for the considered 
packaging section. For determining the complex relationship between the mentioned three indices and machine 
availability, a model trained by an artificial neural network (ANN) using field data is used. Using the trained model, 
the values of these three indices that result in the various availability values in the desirable range are determined. 
Finally, which values of these three indices can be practically attained with respect to their present values are 
discussed briefly.

1. Introduction
In this competitive business environment, companies are always trying for performance improvement. One of the 
factors on which the companies always hunt for is the availability and performance of their production machine 
equipment. In developing countries like Bangladesh lack of skilled machine operators and maintenance personnel 
hamper the quality of maintenance activity which results in low performance and availability of machine equipment. 
Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) gives information about the performance and productivity of a production 
process. The improvement in the effectiveness of the equipment can also be monitored through OEE. Literature 
considering OEEE is not so vast. Lesshammar et al. (1999) studied the OEE measure, but evaluated it from the 
overall systems level and developed a framework for evaluating overall manufacturing performance measurement 
systems. Dal et al. (2012) performed a practical analysis of OEE as an operational improvement in  Airbags 
International Limited. Besides, Eti et al. (2004) implemented total productive maintenance (TPM) in a Nigerian 
company to improve OEE. These are some of the very few literature focusing on OEE evaluation. OEE is calculated 
by multiplying the three OEE factors: availability, performance, and quality. Availability takes into account all 
events that stop planned production; machine failure is one of them. Thus, machine availability is one of the factors 
of availability while calculating OEE. Machine Availability or production uptime is the part of active time during 
which a machine equipment or system is either fully operational or actual production is going on. A case study on 
the reduction of the machine downtime on engine cylinder block production line by analyzing and improving the 
available PM schedule and thus improving operational availability of machines was performed by Tejas S. Kolte et 
al. (2017). Reineke et al. (1999) showed a way to deal with the problem of determining the appropriate age 
preventive maintenance policy for a complex system that has high availability requirements. However, the 
techniques to improve machine availability also include storing more spare parts, better training of workers and 
engineers, usage of high-reliability instruments, computerized on-line techniques, expert systems/artificial

that level of expertise. And a similar conclusion can be drawn from other index values also. A low TSI value of 5.5 
can be achieved through substantial financial investment. Further decisions lie solely on the upper management and 
the company stakeholders. 
 
Here, one mention-worthy issue that although MP intrinsically entails the effect of maintenance delay time and 
MTTR for maintenance, the supply delay time is not directly included in the ANN training to eventually obtain the 
desired targeted availability; because it is yet to be defined how to incorporate the same. However, the unavailability 
of the spare parts resulting from the supply delay may directly hamper machine availability. How the required spare 
parts can be calculated for the determined target availability, though not explored in this paper, is expected to 
disclose in our future work in the same context.  
  
4. Conclusion 
 
The study demonstrates that how the improvement of some external factors of machine availability affects the 
desired machine availability level. This study is pursued for a packaging section of a reputed pharmaceutical 
company in Bangladesh. For such exploration, initially, the current availability of the system is determined. To find 
out the principal causes behind the present low availability, Pareto analysis is performed. This analysis finally shows 
that specific machine components are mainly responsible for the overall lower availability of the studied packaging 
section. Having defined the three external factors, namely personnel index, daily maintenance index, and task 
severity index, from the pharmaceutical company perspective, we have gathered their values for the last twenty-four 
months. However, these values were not directly available. Their values are shaped by utilizing the corresponding 
historical data available regarding the performance and operations of machines as well as the manpower required to 
maintain them.  To establish the complex relationship between these external factors and corresponding machine 
availability, we have taken the help of artificial neural network that yields a trained model. This model is then used 
to obtain the target value of those external factors for the desired machine availability level. Moreover, how much 
machine availability can be attained from the current perspective of the company is discussed. In the future, 
extending this study, the researchers can determine the complex relation of machine availability influenced by the 
availability of the spare parts too.

Abstract 
Public transportation is defined as transportation by a conveyance that provides continuing general or 
special transportation to the public. As public transport organizations grow older and matured, the quality 
of service dwindles down with public being left with no option but to accept what is offered with the current 
economic status. In conducting the study on how to effectively examine a certain type of public transport 
service is by using quality service metrics and identifying the various failure points within the whole service 
process. It is said that high-volume consumer is equal to a high degree of innovation. Transport service is 
always evolving and companies have always an idea on how to create a service that is efficient and well 
suited to the modern technology. The satisfaction people experience when using motorcycles as transport 
services is influenced by (a) Road Traffic, (b) Road Accidents and (c) Service Quality. Solving these matters 
will affect and decrease the potential risks that occur within the process of service delivery. The researchers 
used a conservative approach with a conscious effort to avoid any subjective tendencies when assigning 
value to both costs and benefits for the purpose of a cost-benefit analysis. The researchers may conclude 
that even if the costs incurred in the process of implementing the said plan of actions: (i) Motorcycle Taxi 
Booths, (ii) Personal Protective Standardization, (iii) C2X Software, (iv) Training Programs for Safety and 
Security as well as Training Programs for Health and Hygiene increases per year the benefit will increase 
as well. With the overall findings, the significance of patronizing motorcycle hailing applications with best 
service quality will be very viable among every citizen.

1. Introduction
Public transportation is defined as transportation by a conveyance that provides continuing general or special 
transportation to the public. (Tran &Kleiner, 2015) Economic globalization has developed the course of residential 
suburbanization, and the increase in household revenue. It is said that nowadays, economic growth is related to 
transport demand, and this also influences transport safety, as, simply put, if traffic on the roads is higher, then, sadly, 
the probability of an accident is also higher. Relationships between driving behavior on how drivers cope with traffic 
and road accident occurrences are proposed as results of data analysis. The accident mechanisms of specific accidents, 
in which the subject ranked careless driver involved, can be explained in terms of driving behavior, which is 
determined by his cognition and/or judgment when he is facing specific environmental situations. (Masaru Ueyama 
and Sumio Ogawa, 2001) One of the main reasons of motorcycle accidents was traffic congestion.

5. Conclusion 
 
The findings have shown the relationship with the in-demand motorcycle hailing applications in our society today. 
Among the significant variables is how our existing road traffic affects the behavior of drivers, which may lead to 
road accidents resulting to low satisfaction rate for motorcycle hailing applications due to risking the safety and 
security of customers. One of the main reasons of motorcycle accidents was traffic congestion. Mixed traffic between 
trucks and cars in a same road is what causes a heavy traffic. Motorcycle riders would then go between vehicles to 
avoid being stuck in a lane. Road traffic is in addition to the energy sector and the industry one main source of air 
pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Although most countries and manufacturers agreed to environmental 
regulations to reduce the pollutant emissions, particularly in urban areas with high traffic density, the impact of road 
traffic emissions on the environment and human health has been growing in importance steadily. Motorcycles show 
potential as a more sustainable mode of transport than cars in that they utilize less space and fuel and emit fewer 
harmful emissions. Motorcycles show potential as a more sustainable mode of transport than cars in that they utilize 
less space and fuel and emit fewer harmful emissions. From this perspective, it is tempting to promote motorcycles 
as a substitution for car trips, with the aim to improve the sustainability of the system.  
 
Based on the results, it is evident that using motorcycle hailing applications travel faster and cheaper than using car 
hailing applications. The researchers gathered time data showed the time travel difference between travelling with the 
use of motorcycle versus car. After looking at the road traffic factor that affects the travel time, the researchers now 
gathered data on how customers rate the service quality of the said motorcycle hailing applications. The researchers 
used the RATER survey to be more specific and precise on what identifying what category needs alternatives and 
improvements. The result showed negative values on Tangible, Reliability, Assurance and one factor with Empathy. 
With the said results and the will of researchers in improving the service quality of motorcycle hailing applications, 
here are the alternatives and improvements that should be considered by motorcycle hailing application companies.  
 
With the overall findings, the researchers may conclude that decreasing the existing road traffic rates will also 
decrease the road accident rates. One of the factors of decreasing road traffic is decreasing the number of private 
vehicles and the use of 4-wheeled vehicles, wherein the significance of patronizing motorcycle hailing applications 
with best service quality will be very viable among every citizen. Establishment of a motorized lifestyle provides 
convenience and allows cheaper accommodation and decreased in travelling time (Knoflacher, 2013).

Abstract 
 
Radiologist now use filmless soft-copy Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) which needs 
ergonomic intervention on the different tasks it needs to perform on the radiology department. The four main 
objectives of the study were: (1) assess the current design of equipment and tools and check if the Musculoskeletal 
Disorder (MSD) exists in the workers of radiology department; (2) identify tasks that causes MSD which affects the 
performance of radiologist; (3) recommend the suitable ergonomic interventions or design in radiology department, 
and; (4) perform risk assessment on the different intervention in the Radiology Department. The study was conducted 
in public hospitals within Metro Manila with the same services for the patient like the X-ray, Ultrasound, MRI, and 
CT-scan. Using the CMDQ questionnaire, different MSDs were identified that affected their body while doing their 
tasks. Ergonomic principles such as RULA and anthropometry to determine if the equipment used in the task fit the 
workers. The highest prevalence of body pains are in the shoulders (93.75%), back (80.95), neck (75%), forearms 
(70%), and wrist (62.5%). Different ergonomic interventions were assigned on different task of the department and 
risk assessment was done on the different interventions.

1. Introduction  
 
One of the special medical doctors in the healthcare industry is the radiologist. Radiologist specializes in interpreting 
diagnostic imaging test and interventional procedures, they can explain the medical problems or symptom of the 
patient through the observation of images that are taken from different parts of the body (Goergen, 2015). Without the 
consultation of radiologist there was a 7.7% rate of significant discrepancy of interpretation. With a definitive 
diagnosis, the second opinion consultation was accurate in more than 84% of studies. Patient care benefits more with 
review of outside studies (Zan E. et al, 2010). Another scenario in the emergency department is when the radiologist 
is unavailable in interpreting the result, it can lead to 16% of plain films and 35% of cranial computed tomography 
being misread (Berner, 2008).  
 
The doctor benefits from second opinion rendered by the radiologist. Service studies show doctors and patients 
benefits from second opinion services on radiology scans, including X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan, and MRI. 
A second opinion requested by a patient or healthcare provider not only reduces the chances of a misdiagnosis or an 
unnecessary procedure resulting from an inaccurate reading, but allows the physician to focus on the most accurate 
and comprehensive diagnosis and treatment possible according to (Zan E. et al, 2010).

procedure to help identify every possible failure mode of the chair, vertical arm support, electronic bed, cushion, 
mobile hoist and electronic table.  
  
5. Conclusion  
  
The following tools were used to determine if MSD exists in the task of the radiologist, the RULA and anthropometric 
measurement were able to identify which of the following task in the department MSD exist. Through the use of 
RULA, the researcher was able to identify which task affects their performance. In the x-ray task, the workers scored 
7 when it lifts the patient to the table. In the ultrasound the workers scored 7 when looking at the monitor while sitting 
down. 5 when examining the patient using the transducer, and 6 while the radiologist is using the keyboard of the 
machine while sitting down. Both in the task of MRI and CT-scan had a RULA score of 3 when they are using the 
computer in examining the patient. From the result of the CMDQ survey and RULA analysis, wrist, forearm, 
shoulders, back, and neck are the most affected parts of the body of the radiologist. The researcher came up with an 
intervention that helped lessen the discomfort the workers feeling on their task. Interventions such as vertical arm 
support, cushion, mobile hoist, electronic bed, ergonomic chair and electronic table proves lessens the discomfort the 
workers feels on their task. The different risks on the intervention and new design chair in the radiology department 
were assessed using the FMEA tool. The different causes of the risk were determined and what are the effects of it. 
Contingency plans were made on the different risks that may arise on the new interventions.

Abstract 
A Dissolved Air Flotation System was optimized using factorial experimental design at different turbidity conditions. 
Using cluster analysis, historical water quality data was classified into low (0 – 181 NTU) and high (182 – 323 NTU) 
turbidity cluster. A multiple regression analysis was performed for each of the cluster which revealed that for low 
turbidity cluster eight factors are significant while only three factors were significant for the high turbidity cluster. 
Using this knowledge, a factorial experiment was performed for both clusters. A model was generated with R2 
adjusted = 86.25% for low turbidity cluster and R2 adjusted = 67.34% for the high turbidity cluster. The accuracy of 
the models was tested on actual conditions and showed 92.60% accuracy for the low turbidity cluster and 88.12% 
accuracy for the high turbidity cluster.

1. Introduction
Clean water is one of the basic necessities of human beings. Although there is more than enough supply of water to 
support the increasing world population, access to sanitary water is limited. This is mostly caused by the pollutants 
released in bodies of water through the wastes of human activities, specifically agricultural, domestic and industrial 
wastes. According to Hu et al. (2014), the increase in urbanization results in the increase in the waste discharges in 
the water sources. This is especially true for countries surrounded by large bodies of water such as the Philippines. 
Most of its region is within the medium to high risk in terms of water quality (World Resource Institute, 2018). In 
Manila, the most urbanized area in the Philippines, clean water source is scarce and could only support 6 million out 
of its 12 million inhabitants (Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, n.d). This was a problem as well as an 
opportunity to look for obscure water sources. One such water source is the Laguna de Bay. Laguna de Bay is located 
in the southwest part of Metro Manila. It is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia with an approximate surface 
area of 90,000 km2, average depth of 2.8 m and maximum depth of 6.5 m (Tamayo-Zafaralla, Santos, Orozco, & 
Elegado, 2010). It has a high volume ratio which makes it turbid with spikes in ammonia and manganese during the 
major part of the year caused by the polluted inflows coming from various rivers. (Santos-Borja, 1994).

4. Conclusion 
 
The study confirms the difference in the efficiency of dissolved air flotation system at different turbidity levels. Using 
cluster analysis, water quality data from June 2017 to November 2018 was separated into two groups: Low Turbidity 
cluster containing influent with turbidity values ranging from 0 – 181 NTU and High Turbidity cluster containing 
influent with turbidity values ranging from 182 – 323 NTU. 
 
Using multiple regressions on historical data, 8 significant factors were identified to have an effect on the %turbidity 
reduction for low turbidity cluster: a) turbidity, (b) influent flow rate, (c) pH, (d) temperature, (e) dissolved oxygen, 
(f) KMnO4 dosing, (g) ACH dosing, and (i) recycle flow rate. For the high turbidity cluster, three (3) parameters 
showed significant effect on turbidity reduction: (a) TDS, (b) dissolved Mn, and (c) influent flow rate.

All of their effects were furthered scrutinized and identified as a factorial experiment was performed on the significant 
factors for both turbidity clusters. For the low turbidity cluster, five main factors, six 2-way interaction and 2 3-way 
interactions show significant effect in the %turbidity reduction. The regression model generated has an r2 = 95.12%. 
For the high turbidity cluster only 1 2-way interactions show significant effect in the %turbidity reduction. The 
regression model generated has an r2 = 81.34%.  
 
The models were tested on actual conditions. Low turbidity cluster showed 92.60% accuracy on the predictions and 
high turbidity cluster showed 88.12% accuracy on the predictions. 
 
Overall, this paper proved that at a certain level of inlet turbidity, the dissolved air flotation system would not be as 
effective. At lower turbidity levels, the system had many options or factors that it could control or adjust to get the 
optimum turbidity reduction. At higher turbidity level, the maximum reduction that can be achieved was 69%. 
Adjusting other factors would only increase the operational cost.

Abstract 
The global and local business environment is varying at a different pace. Due to this variation, complexity 
in the transportation system is becoming a vital issue to be addressed. Literature in the domain of intermodal 
freight transportation suggests several drivers including globalization, variability in demand patterns and 
recent advancement in facilitation technologies i.e. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). 
To address these issues with an aim to improve freight transportation system performance, it is critical to 
incorporate synergized IT system and decision system with a pragmatic approach. In developing country 
like India, where expansion of inland waterways along with inland and global regulations requires research 
intervention. This paper will attempt to propose and analyze DIS-IFT framework in the Indian context. 
This novel framework will incorporate decision and information flexibility scenarios. The DIS-IFT 
framework will facilitate transport operators, planners, designers, policymakers etc to strategize synergy in 
the intermodal freight transportation system.

1. Introduction
The business environment is being uncertain, competitive, dynamic, unpredictable which results in more complexities. 
Quick response time with lower costs can only support the organization to sustain in such a complex business 
environment. The first trend which is forcing the business to be more flexible is globalization. Business firms are now 
trading with partners worldwide with ensuring the communication opportunities (Manders, Caniëls, & Ghijsen, 2017). 
The globalization influenced competition across worldwide and led the organization to focus on its core competencies 
while outsourcing non-core activities (Christopher & Mangan, 2005). Due to such aspects, flexibility becomes a 
pivotal element to pacify the business’ operational performance. The second most important societal change is the 
introduction of emerging Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The emerging technologies such as 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), etc. are facilitating the business firms 
in exchanging the information within the system quickly. This rapid exchange of information leads to reacting quickly 
to gain its advantages, in other words, the technological advancements influence the organizations to desire flexibility. 
The disruptions such as earthquakes, floods, strikes, highway accidents, etc. can damage the whole transportation 
network. Such disruptions occur very frequently, and its impact is much significant. The logistics managers face 
difficulties to take actions to mitigate or avoid the negative impact of such disruptions on the operational performance. 
Thus, it is essential to increase the transport flexibility to make the decision making during and post-disruption easily. 
Also, the uncertain demand induces the supply chain to increase its flexibility to perform better. Nowadays, customer’s

5. Conclusion & Managerial Implications 
 
The term flexibility is an equivocal term which is required to be redefined in an intermodal transportation context. 
Some authors used “flexibility” interchangeably with versatility and adaptability, while some asserted that flexibility 
is an antecedent of agility. Paper has enriched domain by proposing framework flexibility-enabled Intermodal 
Terminal decision framework. This model can simplify decision making and improve performance under uncertain 
conditions prone intermodal transportation system with further real-time data supplemented by the shipping industry 
in India. This study is in infancy and being supported by the Ministry of Shipping Govt of India. The potential success 
of flexible intermodal transportation will depend on competing actors, but also on the decision of competing modes, 
the shipping transport sector in particular. It is striking that with the emergence of cost-effective inland ports facilitated 
by Indian Government initiatives like Sagarmala and Bharatmala Projects. The decision makers still require improving 
their productivity by achieving a competitive position towards flexible intermodal transport in emerging scenario. 
Performance improvements can only be accomplished with more intelligent (flexible) planning systems and 
agreements. The proposed DIS-IFT will framework will surely benefit transport operators, planners, designers, 
policymakers by upbringing more clarity in understanding the flexibility of shipping transportation. Furthermore, the 
proposed model will assist to redefine coordinated flexibility capabilities. Finally, this framework can benefit 
managers to set their goals and develop strategies related to internal and external flexibilities to gain its competitive 
advantages.

Abstract  
 
The active hospital is aspiring to accelerate services to patients and to reduce the burden of doctors and 
nurses by reducing the number of mistakes. The main purpose of this study is to develop a Nurse Robot 
(NR) system that acts as a diagnostic device that is programmable with a multi-function manipulator 
designed to help doctors and help patients recovering better.  
The main contribution behind this paper is to deliver a multi-functional robotic system that works on 
reading human vital signs. The system will be implemented using Arduino Uno that enables us to use 
multiple sensors for the reading pins. The output pins are used for the robot interaction with the patients, 
based on the input data. Using the speaker as output sound will be the way of interaction. While using 
infrared (IR) sensors to enable the robot to read the human availability, that is, IR is used to recognize if 
the patient stands in front of the robot, using IR light beams, and Near-Field Communication (NFC) 
technology to read the patient tag provided by the hospital as his identity.

1. Introduction  
As technology continues to advance and becomes competitively cheaper and more accessible, its applications are 
increasingly benefiting human workers in the healthcare industry (Alvarez et al. 2018), (Li et al. 2017), (Devol 2011),  
Medical professionals are experimenting how robots can grow fast and become more important in healthcare 
environments (Iwata and Sugano 2009). Nurse robots started rising in Toyohashi University of Technology which has 
developed Terapio (Figure 1) (Tasaki et al. 2015), a robotic medical cart that can make hospital rounds, deliver 
medications and other items, and retrieve records. The robot can follow a specific individual, such as a doctor or nurse, 
who can use it to record and access patient data. Terapio isn’t a humanoid, but it does have expressive eyes that change 
shape and make it seem responsive. This type of robot will likely be one of the first to be implemented in hospitals 
because it has fairly minimal patient contact, works with staff, and has a benign appearance. Robots like Terapio are 
also useful in nursing homes or other caretaking situations which is very helpful in healthcare industry. Prototypes 
resembling “robot nurses” could have both negative and positive impacts. A drawback of robotic nursing aid is the 
lack of “human touch”.  It is more likely that the aid of robotic nursing will just allow nurses to fulfill more meaningful 
duties and work stressors would decrease. Robotic nurses will have the ability to triage patients in clinics, emergency 
departments, and via telehealth services in order to streamline care and provide standardized approaches to symptom 
management with far fewer resources. Robot nurses will help us scheduling tasks during our nursing shift and 
prioritizing our care with the click of a button. Charting will become less of a burden and less time-consuming for 
nurses because most will be automatically delegated to Artificial Intelligence.

3.6. Survey results 
 
To make this project stand on a strong basis, we made a survey that aims to collect people data about the nursing 
robots. The survey stands on a number of questions that help us to point whether users can get benefit from NR or had 
a previous trial with this kind of nursing robot and if they feel comfortable in using NR functions. The results came 
with negative answers that are related to a number of factors namely, 
 
The users never tried this kind of services. 
 
The users are afraid to try new automated services style. 
In all cases, this survey gave us incentives to complete this project since most of those who participated in the survey 
have not previously dealt with a system like NR. From this, we can conclude that NR will provide a novel system to 
most of the people who never tried this kind of medical services using robots and help them to make an accurate 
nursing services to ensure that their health is in a save hands. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
       From the previous discussion, it is clear that using NR is considered an important multi-functional vital-signs 
measurement that will help hospital nurses in fulfilling regular check up on new patients. The adopted system will be 
installed in hospital patient's waiting room in the aim of creating a direct interaction between the patient and NR. The 
main reason is that NR is considered to be a very secure way to measure the patient vital-signs through measurements 
based on electronic sensors that are directly attached to the patient’s body. Hence, NR will help in performing better 
services to both the hospital and the patients. 
        
The main strength of NR resides in how NR is stable and reliable in fulfilling its duties. Others strengths will rely 
on the cost effectiveness, the quality assurance and productivity improvement, the work in hazardous environments, 
and the data collection and patients monitoring. So, emergency case such as heart failure, high blood levels, and low 
oxygen rates could be avoided when directly and quickly sending the patient reports to relevant doctors. The 
weaknesses of the project however come from the implementing of NR functions, the potential job losses, and the 
high initial investment costs. In comparison with human being, many people do not feel comfortable when dealing 
with robots as the robot can never be compared to a human.

Abstract 
As electricity demand increases, different renewable energy sources were continuously explored to cope with the 
rising demand of an eco-friendly and affordable energy source. The concept of Hydroelectric Generators was 
considered and the researchers developed a Pico Hydroelectric generating device which is called the Aqualite to 
provide households with an alternative power supply. It is a device that powers 3 basic essential household appliances 
with the use of water. The initial design of the prototype was made but the goal of this experimental research is to 
optimize the performance of the device by determining significant factors affecting its output in Watts and Lux and 
by testing different combinations of fittings and pipes to get the best design for the device.  The researchers have tested 
36 combinations and run 30 trials for each and have collected 1,080 values for the Watts output and another 1,080 
values for Lux output. These values were analyzed statistically and the researchers have found the best and optimal 
design for the pico hydroelectric device. This could help the inventors to develop the device and be more functional 
effectively and efficiently. With this invention and supporting research, the community could have a sustainable 
alternative source of energy

1. Introduction
With the increasing number of demand for electricity generation, it is directly proportional to the supply. As the 
demand for this energy rises, the government compensates it with the supply and spend years of research solely for 
ways of electricity generation.  
The 2017 nation’s top demand resulted to 13,789 MW. Compared to the year 2016, 2017’s total peak demand was 
5.17 MW higher than the 13,272 MW of 2016. Then again, the all out power supply, as far as introduced limit, 
developed by 6.1% from 21,425 MW in 2016 to 22,730 MW in 2017. New capacities which resulted to a total of 835 
MW were added to the nation’s supply base in 2017 which incorporate coal-fired (630 MW), solar (127 MW), oilbased 
(77 MW), and hydropower (1 MW) (Department of Energy of the Philippines, 2017) . As far as offered by network, 
Luzon contributed 392 MW or 47%, Mindanao at 337 MW or 40% and Visayas at 106 MW or 3%. Luzon supplied 
392 MW, Visayas at 106 MW and Mindanao at 337 MW which is designated of share by grid. The year likewise 
observed the end of the regulated demand in Mindanao which developed by 6.5% or 107 MW from 1,653 MW in 
2016 to 1,760 MW in 2017 (Greentumble, 2017) Having only 1 MW on hydropower in the Philippines, it is evident 
that the government does not prioritize this industry. Knowing that the country is surrounded by huge amount of body 
water, lots of commercial and residential establishment in different provinces can benefit from these resources.  
 Access to electricity (% of population) in Philippines was reported at 90.98 % in 2016, according to the World Bank 
collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources   Access to electricity (% of rural 
population) in Philippines was reported at 86.26 % in 2016. According to Helmenstine (2018), different energy 
production methods generate both positive and negative impacts to the environment. The continuous use of non-
renewable energy has clear implications for our health and wellbeing, both of which are intimately connected with the 
impacts of non-renewable resources on our environment.

5. Conclusion  
  
The researchers have set a long term goal to reduce the electricity cost of households and commercial establishments 
by using a newly invented pico hydroelectric device. Based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 1,080 values 
of Watts output and 1,080 values of Lux output, it can be concluded that there are significant differences among the 
combinations of different components/parts in producing electricity supply in watts and in lux. From this analysis, the 
researchers have determined that water temperature, water type, the number of turbines and number of motors have a 
significant difference in output both in Watts and in Lux. When temperature rises, water molecules becomes stagnant 
and helps the stability of its flow inside the pipes giving it a higher output in terms of watts. Also, it was proven that 
having different types of water into the system has varying values. Increasing the number of turbines increases the 
number of output in Watts but not in LUX. The number of motors coincides with the pressure of water inside the 
system so the number of motor has a direct proportionality with Watts and in LUX. So therefore, the researchers 
conclude that these factors significantly affect the performance of the newly invented micro hydroelectric device, 
Aqualite. It is a suggestion to the makers and inventors that they should use the  best and optimal  design that was 
proven in this research. This result prompted further research of our system.  
 
Reduction of electricity cost for household and commercial establishments can be achieved by using the newly 
invented pico hydroelectric device with the estimated savings of Php 14, 547.73 / year for a conservative use of LED 
bulbs, electric fan and phone charging.  From the different assessments done, the researchers have developed 
recommendations for future improvements which includes: (1) research for optimizing motors and turbines, (2) to 
have an ergonomic casing for the device and (3) to have a better output rating, higher than what this research 
established.

Abstract 
The study is coming from the premise that the prevalence of standards associated with the male gender role hinders 
most of the young women to consider building a career in the field of engineering. In line with this epistemology, the 
study posits that most young women in the Philippines are more drawn to a specific type of engineering program 
rather than considering a variety of engineering discipline as a career option. Using qualitative research method, 
specifically thematic analysis, the study aimed to highlight the prevailing stereotypes of undergraduate students taking 
up industrial engineering from two of the premier professional technological institutions in the national capital region 
of the Philippines. With an end in view of understanding what shapes the outlook and mentality of students to consider 
industrial engineering as a degree program, themes gathered from two focused group discussions were used to give 
meaning to the experience of students in selecting an engineering major in tertiary education. Results of the study 
revealed that students do have a speckled perspective on industrial engineering. The study suggests that generalizations 
about industrial engineering as a discipline shapes the decision of an incoming undergraduate student to properly 
identify a suitable engineering program to pursue. The study contributes to the growing number of literature in the 
fields of engineering education and training, women in non-traditional areas, gender and development, and in general, 
women in engineering.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND 
1.1 Introduction 
It is known that engineering programs are male-dominated profession rather than women. Most students are interested 
in taking engineering over other courses. Women, on the other side are taking business-related and social science 
programs like Accountancy, Business Management, Marketing, Education, etc. Schools nowadays particularly college 
universities are also seeking women to take engineering programs. On the study of Brawner et.al (2012), Industrial 
Engineering program is warmth, flexible, and has more feminism among other engineering programs. Engineering 
consists of mathematics and sciences and girls have found to be as strong as boys when it comes to those courses. In 
this study, women are analyzed why are they choosing industrial engineering over other engineering programs. 
Stereotypes about industrial engineering are being supported with other perspectives and studies. The purpose of this

of a Women in Engineering Organization that is launched in 2015 in line with Gender and Development initiatives as 
the study was made in relation to it. 
Between the two options of Conceptual Framework given in Chapter 2, the researchers decided to use the Correlational 
type of Framework as the analysis clearly shows that there is a two-way or cycle relationship between the three parts. 
The said parts are namely: (1) Stereotypes of Women in Industrial Engineering, (2) Reason of Women for Choosing 
the Industrial Engineering Program and (3) All About Industrial Engineering Program. The correlational relationship 
between the three parts means that the stereotypes affect the reasons of women for choosing I.E. in the same way these 
reasons affect the women to have these stereotypes. The same relationship happens between the stereotypes and the 
knowledge of women about IE as well as the reasons for choosing IE. 
Using the existing literature and data from the focus group discussion done in chapter 4, the researchers are able to 
come up with three sets of analysis, one set for each part of the conceptual framework. Each set is also divided into 
three more specific analysis (1) based on related literature and studies, (2) based on the focus group discussion data 
and (3) comparison for 1 and 2. The anlaysis shows that certain similarities were found between the existing literature 
and the gathered data from the respondents of the study. Afterwards, the researchers conducted the thematic analysis 
that are gathered from two focused group discussions wherein they were able to find out minor themes that are later on 
are categorized into major themes that were used to give meaning to the experience of students and by making sure 
that these meanings are connected with the objectives of the study. 
 
General Objective: To identify the factors that contributes as to why the undergraduate women are drawn to 
industrial engineering over other engineering majors in the Philippines. 
The conceptual framework of this study as well as its analysis has paved the way for the researchers to consider that 
the three parts involved in the conceptual framework also belong to those factors that contributes on as to why the 
undergraduate women are drawn to industrial engineering over other engineering majors. The identified factors are 
the following:  
 
1. 
Stereotypes About Industrial Engineering 
2. 
Reasons for Choosing the Industrial Engineering Program 
3. 
Knowledge in all about Industrial Engineering 
 
Specific Objective: To identify the various stereotypes about industrial engineering that affects the students to 
be drawn to the program. 
Through thematic analysis, the researchers indeed found out twelve (12) prevailing stereotypes of undergraduate 
women that affects the students to be drawn to the program. Such stereotypes are categorized into themes that are 
explained in the interpretation found in the chapter 4 of the study and these are: 
1. 
easy 
 
 
 
7. 
Femininity 
2. 
fun  
 
 
 
8. 
Flexibility 
3. 
sociability 
 
 
9. 
Opportunity 
4. 
comfortability 
 
 
10. 
Encouragement 
5. 
Belongingness 
 
 
11. 
Women Empowerment 
6. 
Active and participative 
 
12. 
Women Development 
 
6.2 Conclusion 
It is evident by the results displayed in the analysis and interpretations for this study that the prevalence of standards 
associated with the male gender role indeed hinders most of the young women to consider building a career in the 
field of engineering. The researchers came with an end in view of understanding what shapes the outlook and mentality 
of students to consider industrial engineering as a degree program using the themes gathered from two focused group 
discussions were used to give meaning to the experience of students that made them drawn to a specific type of 
engineering program, which is revealed to be Industrial Engineering. The proponents conclude that undergraduate 
female students really do have a speckled perspective on industrial engineering. 
 
 
6.3 Recommendations 
1328","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Results of this study show that women are indeed drawn to a specific type of engineering program and the researchers 
recommended that institutions and organizations should create programs that will focus on women empowerment 
particularly for other engineering fields. It is a kind of need that women should feel the belongingness in other 
engineering programs not just a specific one to eliminate the gender inequality in engineering that exist in education. 
Women in engineering organizations will be of great help as interpreted in the study and such organizations should 
also have continuous or rather more activities and events in the future supporting women that will further encourage 
them to be drawn to engineering.

Abstract 
For many years, researchers improve the maintenance system of all aquaculture technology including the best idea 
for water maintenance and sustainability. The study is coming from a premise that the prevalence of certain factors 
such as pH and temperature affects water quality for pond and aquarium system. With this epistemology, the study 
posits that the idea of combining five different existing filtration technologies to create a new filtration technology 
system that will minimize the effort of performing manual maintenance procedure of keeping freshwater ornamental 
fish. The logic behind this idea is to choose the best characteristics of existing design of filtration system and eliminate 
characteristics that contribute to the negative side. Using experimental method, the proponents considered material 
selection and system design in order to improve the potency of a design filtration unit which greatly affects amount 
of energy consumed and huge volume of water consumption. Testing was performed to validate the efficiency of 
materials along with their characteristics. Results of the study revealed that waste water can be renewed with the use 
of filtration media classified as mechanical, chemical and biological. The results of the study were contributory to 
improve the effectiveness of water treatment by introducing additional treatments in the mechanical filtration, 
proposing a chemical treatment in one of the stages, and boosting the biological absorbance of waste nutrients by 
applying Phytoremediation. The study suggests that water quality is the key to a healthy livestock.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND 
1.1 Introduction 
     Aquaculture in the Philippines has a long history that involves many species and farming practices in diverse 
ecosystems. It is a controllable and manageable production system (Aypa 1995). Most of the production comes from 
the farming of fish and other marine organisms. Philippines is also known for breeding different ornamental fish which 
are later on used as pets, home decoration and as well as for business purposes. However, according to FAO, the

With the combination of the selected filtration, there are significant decreases in frequency of water change per week 
and volume consumed as per the filtration system is concerned. 
 
CHAPTER 5 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1 Summary of Findings 
 
The researches have seen the importance of having good and proper filtration materials and system. The first finding 
is that the nitrogen containing compounds (Nitrate, nitrite, ammonia) is decreased more than the tolerance level if the 
proposed materials as mentioned in chapter 4 is combined in one (1) system. This leads to lesser consumption of water 
because water parameters are more stable and clarity is maintained. The results prove that it is an efficient upon 
activating the filtration on the second week and later on improves as good bacteria continues to culture in the biological 
system of the filtration. The plant which serves as the phytoremediation tool grows lush and fast indicating that it 
completely absorbs the nitrogen containing compounds and other nutrients found in tank water. TDS value also had 
significant changes which contributes on the benefit of the effect. 
 
General Objective: The overall aim of the study is to create an innovative filtration technology system that will 
minimize the effort of performing manual maintenance procedure of keeping freshwater ornamental fish. 
The conceptual framework of this study as well as its analysis has paved the way for the researchers to consider that 
the several parts involved in the conceptual framework also belong to those factors that the researchers considered in 
performing this study. The identified factors are the following:  
 
1. 
Selection of the best materials and features from existing filtration units 
2. 
Effects of the design filtration system in managing toxic nutrient levels in water 
3. 
Reduction of water consumption for keeping fish 
 
This implicates that choosing the right filtration for a specific water condition is very important because some materials 
can affect other water parameters like pH and hardness which is not suitable in some other aquatic organisms. 
Checking the market for availability of materials as well as the function of that specific materials must also be 
considered to achieve full scale efficiency of the product.

Specific Objectives:  
a. To construct an aquarium filtration system that combines vital features of existing water treatment 
technologies. The researchers were able to produce a prototype based on combining the following features of 
existing water treatment technologies, such materials were able to treat water from the aquarium used in 
Aquaculture: 
 
b. To minimize the excessive use of water and provide better water quality. By the use of this design, it is 
visible that in several weeks of cycling water, the volume of consumption has significantly reduced from one 
hundred (100) percent down to almost zero amount of water. 
c. 
To stabilize TDS in water. The designed filtration was able to minimize the Total Dissolved Solid( TDS) in 
great amounts. 
d. To reduce the presence of toxic nitrogenous compounds from water. The levels of Ammonia, Nitrite and 
Nitrate was almost undetectable down to the most tolerable values 
 
5.2 Conclusion 
 
From the current study, researchers conclude that used water from aquarium can be renewed with the use of filtration 
media classified as mechanical, chemical and Biological. The selected materials such as Lava ring, Honey comb Matt, 
K1-media, are the best used natural-biological removal of Nitrogen compounds such as Nitrate. In the chemical 
filtration, Addition of carbon and Resin can improve water quality. Phytoremediation in terms of using the POTOS 
plant is really effective because the fast growth of plant indicates absorbance of toxic nutrients. Lastly, it is best to use 
different types of filtering materials in the mechanical part of the filtration since particles have different sizes and a 
specific mesh is design to capture base on the size present in water. Water quality is the key to a healthy livestock. 
With this design it can help improve the Aquaculture society on the given problems. 
 
5.3 Recommendation 
 
We highly recommend this study to be used in designing filtration or water maintenance system because of its 
efficiency of removal. We strongly suggest that there should be more students who conduct research that includes the 
fusion of biological science and engineering concepts. The world needs to have advanced inventions that helps 
improve the quality of environment since nowadays, the major concern is the detrimental effects of pollution 
specifically, water pollution. If ever the design will get thorough improvement, there are such points that it could be 
a solution to this problem.

Abstract 
PT. Diva Mitra Bogatama is a company engaged in seasoned flour industry. One of its products is crispy retail. In 
the production process, PT. Diva Mitra Bogatama does not use quantitative calculation methods in planning and 
controlling raw materials, thus, the company often has problems and losses of the availability of raw materials. 
Therefore, it is necessary to use an application program for planning and controlling raw materials. Through this 
application program, the company can be facilitated in calculating the planning and control of raw materials so 
that losses due to excess raw materials, and delays in delivery due to hampered production processes can be 
reduced. Forecasting method chosen based on the smallest error is cyclic. The MRP methods are LFL, EOQ, 
LUC, POQ, and Silver Meal. Another calculation method is continuous review (Q, r) backorder method. The 
chosen method is the method that has the smallest cost.The cost of wheat flour using the continuous review (Q, r) 
backorder method is Rp 106.371.229 and the cost of corn flour with continuous review (Q, r) backorder method 
is Rp 24.609.342.

Abstract 
The aim of this study is to identify stakeholders in project life cycle of capital projects in a State-Owned Enterprise in 
South Africa. The research was conducted in a bulk water supplier state-owned enterprise and it has found that 
identification of stakeholders is a known phenomenon in the enterprise, but that the process has not fully matured yet. 
Despite the effort by the Project Management Body of Knowledge to update the 4th and 5th addition by adding 
stakeholder management as knowledge area, it is not fully practiced in industry. The study presents a stakeholder 
identification framework and recommends that the organization improves the internal stakeholder identification 
processes by employing the framework for reduced project delays and cost minimization. Furthermore, the framework 
represents foundational work to study and advance stakeholder identification within the capital project environment.

Stakeholder Identification, Capital Projects and State-Owned Enterprise 
1. Introduction
The South African Government infrastructure projects are aimed at water, oil, gas, energy and minerals as a Strategic 
Investments Projects (SIP) for state owned enterprises (Bond, 2014).  Infrastructure represents fundamental facilities 
and systems that serve a country, a city or area, and it plays a significant role in promoting economic growth and 
function. (Snieska and Simkunaite, 2009).  State owned enterprises (SOE) are organizations or bodies partially or 
entirely owned by the government to perform specific functions (Kowalski, Buge, Sztajerowska and Egeland, 2013). 
SOEs contribute significantly towards promoting and supporting urban growth and development especially with 
transportation, energy and bulk infrastructure therefore effective and efficient implementation of SOE projects is 
important given the extent of their influence  (ibid.).  
In South Africa SOEs are responsible for mega capital projects, for example the coal fired utility plant known as 
Medupi (2005 - 2040) built by Eskom with an estimated budget of $10 billion and the Transnet expansion of the 
country’s mineral-energy-petroleum rail pipeline port complex with an estimated budget of $25 billion.  Despite the 
mega capital projects executed and managed by SOEs, it is still challenging to ascertain the methodology employed 
to identify stakeholders and to keep them engaged throughout the life cycle of the project (Bond, 2014). These 
identification procedures assist in controlling and preventing deviations to the scope of a project and ensuring that 
project milestones are met, since all stakeholders are involved in the project (Amoatey and Hayibor, 2017).  
The challenges currently being faced by SOEs include projects not being able to be completed for years or projects 
not being handed over after completion due to unhappy end users (Eskerod and Huemann, 2013). The concept of state- 
owned enterprises in South Africa is broad hence it will be difficult to assess all the SOEs per sector. The current 
research only focuses on a water supply SOE based in Johannesburg with the aim of identifying its stakeholders in 
capital projects and evaluating the process used in identifying stakeholders to develop a framework for stakeholder 
identification and analysis throughout the project life cycle.

4.3 Stakeholder Identification in Capital Projects in an SOE 
 
The study indicates that most project stakeholders are identified during the execution phase; and that stakeholders are 
not involved during the initiation and planning phases of the project. Consequently, the organization identifies 
stakeholders based on the issues that arise during the project, and not all projects held stakeholder registers. 
 
Stakeholder identification is a known activity in the organization but as an important project requirement it has not 
fully matured in the organizational project management procedures. A summary of the findings is indicated in Figure

5. Conclusion 
 
This study presented a framework for stakeholder identification by an SOE throughout the project life cycle of its 
capital projects. The findings indicate that there are gaps between the framework derived from literature and the actual 
process followed in the organization. 
 
This study has shown that identification of stakeholders is a known phenomenon in the SOE.  However, the process 
has not fully matured as in practice it is not executed. Stakeholders are important throughout the life cycle of a project 
and their identification is a significant step in the project lifecycle since all stakeholders have the ability to influence 
project delivery and outcomes. The identification process in the initiation and planning phase was not conducted, thus 
ignoring some of the potentially influential stakeholders. Therefore, despite the effort by PMBOK to introduce 
Stakeholder Management as a knowledge area in the PMBOK 4th and 5th edition, the process is still not fully 
implemented in practice.

6. Recommendations
A project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations of the stakeholders. This 
success is directly related to the perception of stakeholders for the value created by the project and the nature of the 
relationship with the project team. Failure to apply proper stakeholder management principles and coordination will 
potentially result in project failure which is related to either the project not being signed off or accepted by the end 
users, or the project not meeting its timelines. It is recommended that a similar study be conducted in different SOE 
environments to ensure that effective stakeholder identification is implemented in SOEs.  Furthermore, it is highly 
advisable that the organization integrates the stakeholder identification framework in their project management 
processes.

Abstract 
The emergence of different hotels that fundamentally offers the same lodging services have made 
marketing strategies an integral part of the hotel industry. This study focuses on resolving the 
problems encountered by the RVA Budget Hotel by exploiting the opportunity to use marketing 
strategies and plans to achieve the company’s targeted increase in service income. The researcher 
utilized different Engineering Management tools in order to analyze the current situation of the 
RVA Budget Hotel. These tools include the RATER survey model that determines the expectations 
and perceived experience of the customers through numerical rating, the Job Evaluation that 
classifies the performance ranking of an employee, the 7P Framework that examines the marketing 
mix of a company and the Competitive Profile Matrix that compares the operational performance 
of a company against its competitors. The results from the tools revealed the root causes presented 
in the Why-Why Diagram and influenced the nature of recommendations used in the How-How 
Diagram. The expenses incurred from these recommendations that involves plans and marketing 
strategies were outweighed by the monetary gains that increased the service income of RVA 
Budget Hotel by 92% as shown in the Cost Benefit Analysis.

Introduction
The Philippines adopted the use of motels to meet the shortage of accommodation for travelers after World War II. 
Since then, the concept of motels in the country transformed from lodging areas to venues that were used by partners 
to have sexual affairs. In 1970, motels initiated an effort to remodel the image of the industry and renovated their 
facilities to give their customers a hotel- like ambiance. (Dennis Villegas, 2011) Motels or budget hotels differ from 
a hotel in a way that the unnecessary services are removed to cut costs. Hotels are focused on offering their services for 
the upper social class while budget hotels cater to all walks of life. Cleanliness, comfortability and convenience are the 
core values of budget hotels that attracts customers to patronize their establishments. (Shen Han, 2006) 
To be able to satisfy customers, there are important success factors that need to be recognized and applied by the 
management of a budget hotel. One of these factors is security as it is associated to both the safety of life and property 
of the guests. Another significant component of a budget hotel is the speed of service delivery and cleanliness of the 
rooms that signify that the management gives importance to customer experience. Brand differentiation serve as 
another factor for success for budget hotels as this distinguish one establishment from another. Uniqueness in design, 
ambiance and discounts for loyal customers create brand loyalty and differentiation. Location and reservation system 
also play a role as a factor of success for budget hotels as it determines the number of potential guests that may avail 
the services of the establishment through walk-ins or virtual payments. (Wen Hua, Andrew Chan, and Zhenxing Mao, 
2009 
After the analyzing of the success factors of a budget hotel, the importance of facility management, service quality 
and marketing were found to be vital in achieving an edge against competitors.

Abstract 
Demand for agricultural products will grow by nearly 70 percent in 2050 and high volume of chemical pesticides and 
agricultural fertilizers along with considerable waste in this sector induces serious environmental concerns. Hence it 
is not a priority but a necessity to modify unsustainable procedures to make them sustainable. The aim of this study is 
developing and analyzing a multi-objective (MO) linear mathematical model for sustainable close-loop agricultural 
supply chain (CLASC) with a deteriorating product to determine (1) the optimal flow to every echelon and (2) the 
optimal location of some facilities to achieve three objectives: reducing costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
throughout the proposed supply chain (SC) network, and increasing the responsiveness. Finally, a numerical example 
is used to evaluate the optimization model.

The test problem is solved in GAMS software with CPLEX solver by 0considering six different combinations of 
weights. All computational work was performed on a personal computer (64-bit operating system, 2.6 GHz CPU, and 
12.00 GB). The model was resolved in less than 4 seconds, and optimal solutions were obtained. In the table 4 the 
values for all three OFs are given by different weights. When the goal is only to minimize the cost OF (W1=1), the 
model nullifies all network flows and yields the lowest cost, $131702, which is the total cost of waste destroying. 
When the goal is only to maximize the responsiveness OF (W2=1), the model tries to meet all of demand and reach a 
value of 1, regardless of cost and CO2 emissions. Only then will new distribution centers and composting centers be 
established.  
 
The third case is when the goal is to minimize the emission, which yields the same logical solutions as the first as 
expected. While the weights of all three OFs are equal, the model tries to reach the minimum values of cost ($154385) 
and emission (717037kg CO2-eq) with the highest response (0.917). The fifth case simulates when the environment is 
the top priority for decision-makers over the other two goals. The emission OF is of greater importance (W3=0.5) than 
the other OFs in this case that causes the emission value (687993kg CO2-eq) to be higher than the third case and lower 
than the fourth case. 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, a five-echelon sustainable agricultural closed-loop supply chain model for apple fruit in a region of Iran 
was proposed. It is a Tri-objective model and seeks to meet the three sustainability indicators in the supply chain, 
which are to minimize total supply chain costs, to minimize CO2 emissions from different network activities while 
maximizing responsiveness to customers' demands in each market. The proposed model was transformed into a single 
objective function by a weighted-sum method and was solved by giving different weights in GAMS software. The 
model was solved by considering a test problem and obtained rational optimal solutions confirmed the validity of the 
model. 
There are some potential future works. This model can also be solved by considering stochastic demand. Other 
methods of solving multi-objective optimization problems such as Weighted Tchebycheff and ԑ-constraint methods 
can be exerted. Since our model is NP-hard, solving this model for large problems requires the use of specific 
algorithms such as genetic and Scatter Search, because it is hard to solve large problems in a reasonable time. Finally, 
using the model proposed in this research in real cases and analyzing achieved results will be very valuable.

Abstract 
The modeling and digitization of a supply chain are important assets for optimizing the functioning of this 
chain. However, these modeling and digitization operations are not always easy, especially if they take 
into consideration, in addition to economic aspects, other aspects such as environmental aspects. In order 
to facilitate the implementation of these modeling and digitization operations, we propose a preliminary 
audit of the supply chain before starting the modeling and digitization processes. This preliminary step 
ensures that a set of criteria has been respected before starting to develop a model or project to digitize the 
chain. In this paper, we will focus on the case of a distribution supply chain for a company operating in 
the production of equipment for the automotive industry. We consider the case of an international 
company with several production plants, implemented in several countries, and with several distribution 
warehouses and several car manufacturing customers.

Introduction
As part of this study, we are interested in the cases of international Alpha companies that manufacture equipment for 
Beta companies in the automotive industry. For reasons most often related to the reduction of production costs, these 
Alpha companies most often relocate their production plants to countries offering advantages allowing these costs to 
be reduced (labor, tax advantages, offshore area, etc.. ). However, these offshoring operations are most often 
accompanied by an increase in logistics costs, particularly in terms of transport. In addition, and due to the 
remoteness of the production sites of Alpha companies compared to Beta customer companies, the environmental 
impacts, mainly related to transport, are expected to be higher. Optimizing the supply chain then becomes a major 
imperative in order to control the costs, deadlines and environmental impacts of the chain. 
2.
Companies’s interrelation Alpha and Beta
In this paper, we will focus more specifically on the logistics distribution component of Alpha companies. In this 
component and for this type of international car equipment manufacturing company, the production plants are 
generally implemented in different countries. Alpha’s warehouses are often located in areas close to customers, who 
are the car manufacturers. We consider the specific cases where Beta customers are located in European countries 
and Alpha production sites located in countries of Eastern Europe, Africa or Asia. In order to facilitate the provision 
of products for their customers, Alpha companies often set up warehouses or distribution platforms in Europe in 
order to reduce the time taken to make products available to Beta customer companies. 
For an Alpha company, we can associate the production plants with the term Mi (i varying from 1 to imax), with 
warehouses the term Ej (j varying from 1 to jmax) and with Beta customer companies the term Ck (k varying from 1

Conclusion 
 
In this article, we presented a study on a real case of an Alpha company. In particular, we examined the distribution 
component of a supply chain and examined the case of a manufacturing company operating in the automotive sector. 
We have shown its distribution network, in particular the Criteria for the Audit of the distribution chain. This 
preliminary step makes sure that a set of criteria has been met before starting to develop a model or a digitalization 
project for the chain.

Abstract 
This study aims to find the model of entrepreneurship on small and medium scale which is reviewed from 
business volume, business age, number of staff and product innovation in Sidoarjo regency. The research 
method, this study uses quantitative descriptive, research data using secondary data, including business 
scale data and attributes of small and medium businesses in the district Sidoarjo. Data analysis technique 
use t test and F test for model under study. The results of the study found that the existence of small and 
medium sized businesses in the district of Sidoarjo received the greatest support from product innovation 
and number of members. while the age of business does not contribute significantly to the viability of the 
entrepreneur. The findings of this study are the findings that business continuity on small and mid-sized 
scale is not dominated by business age but is supported significantly by product innovation owned by 
entrepreneurs.

INTRODUCTION 
Number of Micro Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Sidoarjo regency amounted to 171,264 businesses, consisting 
of micro scale of 154,891 units, small and medium scale as many as 154 units and large scale as many as 16,000 
businesses. Micro, small and medium enterprises are the solution to low-income and low-income employment in low-
income society. Employment difficulties resulted from the fact that in recent years some companies have reduced 
labor and limited new employment. SMEs provide a good contribution to economic growth, studies in Ghana and 
South Africa, SMEs in Ghana contributed to absorb 85% of the workforce and 70% of GDP. In Africa south of SMEs 
contribute to GDP advance of 52% to 57%, and absorb a workforce of around 61% (Abor & Quartey, 2010) support 
regional development (Setiawan et al., 2018).  
Entrepreneurs are designed to grow and develop so as to provide benefits to business owners and labour. In addition, 
an effort is expected to be able to accommodate more manpower by increasing the business volume or by opening a 
business network. 
Entrepreneurs make a good contribution to the improvement of a country's economic growth. Entrepreneurs contribute 
both tangible and intangible which contribute equally to the growth and stability of the country's economy.(Gulsevim 
Yumuk Gunay, 2016). Micro-scale entrepreneurs, managed by families and family groups, the continuity of business 
is strongly influenced by the role of parents and families in encouraging their children to become entrepreneurs 
(Rachmawan, 2015). A person has a strong desire to entrepreneurship if it has the character and social culture that 
support to become entrepreneurs (Singh, Verma, & Rao, 2016). Rewards and supportive environments provide a 
positive influence on entrepreneurial interests (Sampedro, Fernández‐Laviada, & Herrero Crespo, 2014). Wider 
entrepreneurship in developed countries like japan (Paul & Shrivastava, 2015).  
Emotional intelligence and the ability to manage emotions provide a positive effect on entrepreneurship. While 
confidence applies as a mediation between emotion and entrepreneurship (Mortan, Ripoll, Carvalho, & Bernal, 2014). 
Research that focuses on the role of gender finds that men have a stronger desire in entrepreneurship (Escobedo & 
carlos Diaz Casero, 2014). That someone who has enough skill and knowledge tends to have a high willingness of 
entrepreneurship. otherwise it is necessary to collaborate and communicate with colleagues who have been in business 
(Moog, Werner, Houweling, & Backes-Gellner, 2015).

CONCLUSION  
The conclusion of this study which aims to see the opportunity of entrepreneurship that can be developed and that 
will grow, as a reference society in the process of becoming an entrepreneur or will develop the business. Sidoarjo 
regency has changed from agrarian area to region with business on trade sector, hotel and restaurant and industrial 
sector. The field of agricultural business is still much cultivated by the community but the volume of business and 
assets is minimal, so that the business in agriculture will be limited and not developed. Other areas of business that 
are likely to flourish are in the areas of services, transportation and industry, because the field is related to the growing 
field of trade and restaurants, so that novice entrepreneurs can start with the business sector.

Abstract 
The research of factors that related to the  voting behavior on PILKADA (local election) Kabupaten Sula 
2015 is interesting for two reasons; firstly, because of the tradition of disputes election passed from election 
to election, and secondly because sociological factors such as religion and ethnicity are not determinant of 
victories the canditate (Hendrata Thes) as minorities in religious and ethnic on Sula Regency. In this 
research using quantitative method through survey with structured questionnaire with 200 respondens, 
which is proportionally distributed in Sulabesi Island and Mangoli Island as island in Kabupaten Sula. 
Furthermore, the data are used descriptive and correlation statistic analysis. The research finding that the 
rational-choice determine of voting behavior such as party’s and candiate’s program on PILKADA 
Kabupaten Sula 2015.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Sula 2015 Regional Election or Pilkada, which was won by Hendrata Thes, has enough attention from the public 
and researchers in the field of voting behavior, because of an unusual event in Indonesian political culture where 
minorities are the winners. Hendrata excels from the other candidates between Rusmin Latara and Safi Fauwah. Safi 
and Rusmin are representing moyoritas in Sula regency using both religious and ethnicity based. During this political 
culture in North Maluku, sociological factors are always dominant in determining the behavior of voters, but not 
applicable in Pilkada Sula 2015 due to minority Hendrata and be a winner. Therefore in this paper, will answer how 
the voting behavior and what factors correlate with the voting behavior of sula’s voter in 2015. 
There are three approach models that are often used in voting behavior studies. First sociological model (also known 
structurally), second psychological model and third rational voter model (G.Niemi et.al 1984). These three approaches 
were born as a reaction to the previous approach, or even as an anti-thesis of the approach, but the these approaches 
are complementary to each other. 
The sociological model is a well known early approach in the study of voting behavior, it’s assumed that voting 
behavior determined by sociological character, religion, ethnicity, social status and so on. But scientists in this 
approach often place particular emphasis on certain aspects, such as Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokka in 
viewing voter behavior with more emphasis on social identity, such as work and social status as influential factors 
(Lipset at Norris 2004). 
The psychological model assumed that voter behavior is determined by emotional closeness, for example in the form 
of support for a Party Indentification (PI)  and candidate based on emotional. According to this approach, social class, 
ethnicity, religion in sociological model, does not describe social group because too abstract. So that the  identification 
of voters of the party is more due to ""feeling"" or emotional connection (Zuckerman, 2005). This approach is the first 
model used by the Michigan Survey Research Center in 1952 in election elucidation (G Niemi 1984). 
The Rational Choice Model is highly responsive to dynamic changes such as political-economic change (Mujani et 
al. 2011), so that voters in determining choice will seek information as a counterweight to obtain the benefit of existing 
circumstances.

Educational variables have a significant correlation to voting behavior, because the level of education can affect the 
critical point of a voter. At Pilkada Sula 2015, those who made the choice based on the candidate program amounted 
to 35.5%. This means that those who can assemble program differences between candidates are critical, and the 
potential is in voters who have better education. 
Further variables are party identification, voters who feel closed or associated themselves with a particular party will 
have a tendency to vote for the party. The average Hendrata voter is to have a close relationship with the party both 
because of the party management as well as because of the family background which hereditary selects the party. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
Based on data voting behavior in sula’s elections 2015, those who are rational voter about 35.5%  said that choosing 
candidate based on their program. Furthermore, based on correlation test results, the variables of education and party 
indentification also determine for rational voters with their respective significance; .028 * and .000 **.

The purpose of this study is to describe the potential and obstacles related to the implementation of 
education based on local wisdom in SDN Burengan 2 Kediri City. The research method used is 
descriptive qualitative with research location SDN Burengan 2 Kediri City. Data collection techniques 
used are interviews, observation and documentation, while data analysis techniques using triangulation

1. Preliminary
Indonesia has a wealth of nature and culture are very diverse. The diversity contained in human social life gave birth 
to plural society (Herimanto, and winarno, 2010: 99). This plurality makes the distinctive characteristic of each local 
culture in Indonesia, better known as local wisdom. Local wisdom is everything that characterizes a region, whether 
in the kind of food, customs, dances, songs and regional ceremonies. According to Alfian (2013: 428) local wisdom 
is defined as a view of life and knowledge as well as a life strategy tangible activities undertaken by local 
communities in meeting their needs. Meanwhile Setiyadi (2012: 75) states that local wisdom is custom and habits 
that have been traditionally done by a group of hereditary community that until now still maintained by the 
customary law community in certain areas. So that local wisdom can be interpreted as a view of life, knowledge and 
life strategy embodied in customs and habits that have been rooted and maintained by a particular group of people. 
The form of local wisdom in society can take the form of knowledge system, social system and cultural system. This 
is reflected in environmental management, customs and cultural results of artifacts such as properties rules, 
materials and residential architecture, styles and styles of clothing, furnishings, and ceremonies (Maryani & Yani, 
2016: 116). Examples of local wisdom that is currently being promoted a lot of the development of herbal medicine 
which is a heritage in the medical field. Currently the development of herbal medicine has been perfected with 
applicable pharmacology standards (Fajarini, 2014: 129). This is because to fulfill the needs of people's lives always 
make adjustments to the natural conditions, social environment and religion, so that merged local wisdom that 
became the character of a community group. Along with advances in technology and access to information that has 
been worldwide, led to changes in the way of view and way of life of the community. The lack of selectivity in 
receiving information from the outside leads to a cultural shift that is more culturally oriented popular. Popular

integrated manner with the character values that will be developed. Fourth, the learning environment is naturally 
arranged, meaning that students are given the opportunity to gain a real learning experience in the community 
related to the noble values that develop in society. In accordance with that opinion, the program and learning 
activities that have been designed in SDN Burengan 2 Kediri has been in line with the model of education based on 
cultural values or local wisdom. If the concept of local wisdom-based education is designed more systematically by 
involving all relevant stakeholders, then it is very likely that local wisdom-based education can be implemented 
consistently in SDN Burengan 2. 
 
3.3. The Obstacles of Implementation Education based on local wisdom 
Implementation of local wisdom-based education should be designed in accordance with the needs of the school. 
Menururt Asmani (2012: 70), the process of implementing local wisdom-based education in the start of the 
establishment of an implementing team in charge of carefully designing all matters related to this program. Both 
partnership with village officials or community leaders, this is aimed at the effectiveness of the program, so that the 
program is really compiled according to the actual circumstances and needs. 
Third, Preparing Software and Hardware. Software in the form of curriculum programs, and faculty, while the 
hardware in the form of facilities and infrastructure that become facilities to support the implementation of the 
program should be prepared neatly. Fourth, prepare Implementation Strategy. This program requires an appropriate 
implementation strategy, whether it is incorporated into activities in intracurricular or extracurricular. Fifth, 
conducting comparative studies on institutions that have successfully implemented the concept of education based 
on local wisdom. The next stage is looking for investors, opening markets, preparing skilled students, preparing 
home company and engaging the surrounding community. 
Of all the processes that have been described, certainly not all steps can be applied at the elementary school level, 
because the concept of educational implementation based on local wisdom in primary schools is more to the effort 
of cultural recognition and characterization of local wisdom values. SDN Burengan 2, although it has integrated the 
values of local wisdom in its learning activities, but has not yet had a special team that is designing related to the 
implemenntasi of local wisdom in the learning process. The special team in question is a team that members of the 
school both teachers and principals who work together with the school council, related agencies and leaders who are 
experts related to local wisdom contained in the city of Kediri. Determination of education policy based on local 
wisdom is of course not only be the authority of the school, but it is necessary to involve guardians, school 
committees and education offices. So it takes the similarity of views related to the urgency of education based on 
local wisdom. So far there has been no massive discussion related to the implementation of education based on local 
wisdom in SDN Burengan 2 Kediri City. 
The involvement of community leaders and village officials requires continuous communication. The idea of 
implementing local wisdom education must be in line with the existing programs in the area where the school 
stands. So in need of time, energy and mind to continuously establish communication and cooperation with the 
relevant government officials. Also if the team consists of teachers who have teaching tasks at school, then this will 
further increase the burden of teacher performance, so need to look for solutions to keep the program running 
without disrupting the teaching and learning activities.Preparation of curriculum based on local wisdom is not 
necessarily made by the school, because it is related to the competence to be achieved by the students, it is necessary 
involvement and approval from the education office so that the curriculum does not overlap with the applicable 
curriculum standards. In addition it requires experts or professionals who can assist in the process of curriculum-
based preparation of local wisdom. So schools have a clear curriculum direction in implementing local wisdom-
based education. 
To provide an initial overview of education-based education of local wisdom, a comparative study is needed to the 
institution that has implemented the education-based local wisdom. In the city of Kediri, there are no primary 
schools that have declared themselves to implement local wisdom-based education, so it is necessary to conduct a 
comparative study with schools outside the city of Kediri. Things that need to be taken into consideration when 
conducting comparative studies are the suitability of the intended school to the expected criteria, and the possibility 
of inter-school collaboration. Comparative study activities of course require time, energy and cost of its own budget, 
so this needs to be planned carefully by the school. 
 
4. Conclusion 
SDN Burengan 2 is a school that has an annual program by integrating local wisdom values in school learning 
activities. The potential of implementation of education based on local wisdom is the existence of programs that can 
be a means of planting cultural values, such as the program of character and character cultivation, learning outside 
the classroom, inspiration classes, partnerships with school committees and parents, as well as extracurricular

Abstract 
The condition of the current economy has created a tough competition between industrial companies.The 
tight competition are demanding the company to further improve performance and innovating with products 
that are owned, in order to be better known by the public. In highly competitive environments era, 
companies must choose the cheapest way, in executing investment plans and to maximize the company 
value in order to survive. The perception of investors on the level of corporate success is reflected through 
the value of the company. Increased corporate value due to high stock prices will make investors believe 
the performance of the company and its prospects in the future. The result of  this research is company’s 
size has strong influence to the determination of profitability and value of manufacturing company in 
Indonesia, while profitability has no effect to value of manufacturing company in Indonesia, nor with 
company size through profitability to company value have no influence, this proves together the size of the 
company and profitability have no influence on the value of the company, this is caused by profitability 
that has no effect on the value of the company.

INTRODUCTION 
The tight competition that emerge requires the company to further improve performance and innovate with its products 
to be better known by the public (Cheng & Tzeng, 2011). The company will consider the size of the company in 
determining its debt policy (Handayani, Agustono, & Rachadi, 2009). Company’s size is the size or amount of assets 
owned by the company (Kurshev & Strebulaev, 2007). Companies that belong to the size of large companies, seek to 
obtain, acquire, develop, utilize, maintain and disclose strategic resources to the fullest. Saffold, (1998) “The view 
that the contribution of strong culture to performance is conditioned by the nature of the industry, firm size and 
environment” 
Profitability is the company's ability to generate profit in the future and is an indicator of the company's operational 
success. Gitman, 2003) states that the company's ability to earn profit is one indicator of the company's ability to pay 
dividends that show the quality the value of the company. Corporate value is a value that can be used to measure how 
much the importance of a  company is viewed from the perspective of some parties such as investors who associate 
the value of a company from the stock price of the company (Hermuningsih, 2014)i Maximizing the value of the firm 
is the same as maximizing stock prices and that's what the company owner wants, because high corporate values 
indicate high shareholder wealth (Brigham, 2006; 10, Gultom,et al, 2013)

The diversity of data that can be explained by the model is 14.70% or in other words the information contained in the 
14.70% data can be explained by the model while 85.30% is explained by other variables not yet contained in the 
model and error.

CONCLUSIONS 
The results of this study show the following: 
1. 
The size of the company has a strong influence on the determination of the value of manufacturing 
companies in Indonesia, this proves that the larger the size of the company the greater the value of the company 
2. 
The size of the company has a strong influence on the determination of the value of profitability of 
manufacturing companies in Indonesia, this proves that the larger the size of the company the greater the profitability 
of the company concerned 
3. 
profitability has no effect on the value of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, it proves that no matter 
how the value of profitability will not affect the value of the company 
4. 
The size of the Company through the profitability of corporate value has no influence, it is proved jointly 
company size and profitability has no effect on the value of the company, this is likely caused by profitability that has 
no effect on the value of the company.

Abstract 
Employee’s discipline is an essential factor in achieving corporate objectives, however numerous 
managers are not able to adapt ideal leadership behaviour, reward and punishment to improve employee’s 
discipline. Based on present study analysis, reward and punishment have a positive and significant impact 
towards the non-physical environment which could be seen from the positive result of coefficient value 
which is around 0.2165 with T-statistics more than 1.96 around 2.059. It can be concluded that 
punishment influences non-physical environment since it affects psychological condition of the 
employee. Besides, reward and punishment also play important role in improving employee discipline. 
Fair treatment of the manager in regard to reward and punishment depicts manager’s ability to be 
objective in enforcing corporate regulations. The present condition creates a comfortable and stable 
environment for the employee in performing their duty. Non-physical working environment is based on 
four indicators which are: monitoring, working environment, reward and fair treatment. The indicators 
mentioned above influence positive and significant impacts toward work discipline. Corporate managers 
need to consider psychological characters of the employee in implementing reward and punishment 
scheme as the improvement to enhance discipline of the employee.

INTRODUCTION 
Change is a significant process experienced by a corporate to survive in the competitive market environment. 
(Kanter & Mirvis, 1989) defines change as past analysis process which is shaped to be a stepping stone required for 
the future. In order to achieve this goal, the corporate leaders should sustain their existence in the business world by 
initiating changes that have a constructive impact on improving the quality and productivity of employees. 
That every change that occurs within an organization is a dynamic movement projected to maintain its 
balance(Torang, 2013). Changes which take place in Human Resources Management environment are tendencies 
which cover workforce diversity, technology, globalization, and shifting in work and position (Dessler, 2011). Thus, 
to achieve success and sustainability of a business, leaders must preserve and advance the capabilities of human 
resources as a company asset, as well as maintain employees’ discipline. Leaders should also embrace other vital 
functions of understanding the problems encountered by their subordinates as well as comprehending their feelings 
while facing that problem, colleagues, and work environment (Terry & Rue, 2010). Therefore, a leader must own a 
competence or knowledge (in terms of managerial and strategy), a positive behavior, capability to influence or direct 
others, accountable decision, good manner in ideas delivery, fine judgment in encouraging and motivating, and

The Table 6 presents the influence of leadership style to shape work discipline has a positive result of coefficient 
value which is around 0.1990 with T-statistics less than 1.96 that is equal to 1.5477. It explains that leadership style 
has no significant effect on work discipline. Table 6 also displays the influence of reward and punishment on work 
discipline has a positive result of a coefficient value which is around 0.1279 with T-statistics less than 1,96 that is 
equal to 1,1416.  It describes that reward and punishment have no significant effect on work discipline. After that 
the non-physical work environment has a positive and significant effect on work discipline as it is seen from a 
coefficient value which is 0.3913 with T-statistics more than 1.96 that is equal to 2.6044. Leadership style has a 
positive and significant effect on non-physical work environment as it is seen from a coefficient value which is 
0.4160 with T-statistics more than 1.96 that is equal to 4.3205. Reward and punishment also have a positive and 
significant effect on non-physical work environment as it is seen from a coefficient value which is 0.2165 with T-
statistics more than 1.96 that is equal to 2.0594. Although leadership style is admitted to be running well, the results 
of the analysis prove it contrary, in which leadership style has no significant effect on work discipline. Of the overall 
statement items of leadership style, it appears that the statement which says that leaders always supervising 
subordinates who have the lowest score of 2.74, and then the statement of leader expecting subordinates to comply 
with the corporate regulation receives a score of 2.98. These two facts, the lack of supervision from leaders and the 
leaders’ expectations for subordinates to comply with the corporate regulation, are related to work discipline, which 
means the solid actions of leaders are expected so that subordinates will always follow all company’s applicable 
regulations. 
Judging from work discipline variables, specifically on duties and obligations accomplishment indicator, the 
statement item which states following the instruction /command of leader obtained the lowest score that is equal to 
2.80. Non-physical work environment indicator with statement item that says work is supported by environment 
score the highest of 3,20. A good, positive, and warm working environment will indirectly affect the behaviour of an 
organization. Furthermore, in a good environment, employees also feel a satisfaction that potentially improves their 
positive contribution as expected by the company, mainly in obeying all applicable policies and regulations. 
From the research, it is found that leadership style has a significant effect to work environment. The role of leader in 
the work environment is expected to be a role model for every subordinate. Leaders provide oversight of 
subordinates performance. The research indicates that the participative leadership style indicator has the highest 
score of other leadership style indicators that is 3.22. This leadership style involves subordinates in formulating a 
solution and policies in the company. From the analysis result, it can be seen that reward and punishment variable 
have a positive and significant effect to the non-physical working environment variable as it is seen from a 
coefficient value that is  0.2165 with T-statistics more than 1,96 that is equal to 2,0594. This is supported by 
research conducted by(Vaden, 2004) which affirms the result that the punishment stimulates catcall and unfair 
treatment from the manager. It can be concluded that punishment has an effect on non-physical environment 
because it affects employee’s psychology. According to (Rivai, 2005) Reward and punishment is method that is 
both, liked and hated by employees.(Ching, 2012) His study argues that Reward and punishment has a positive 
discipline effect.

CONCLUSIONS 
In order to improve the non-physical working environment and work discipline, the strategic model that are able to 
be applied are: 
 
The appliance of participative leadership style by involving employees in formulating company rules. 
 
The establishment of a good, positive, comfortable and safe working environment with rules enforcement 
through an effective reward and punishment system. 
 
The application of reward mechanism is based on employees favored preference they are 1. clear career 
development, 2 psychological rewards, such as praise, 3.The reward of salary / bonus / incentives should be al least 
equivalent to the received payment.  
 
Meanwhile, punishment method should be executed based on the employee detested penalty, such as 1. 
Repressive punishment stages e.g: reprimanding, warning and suspension. 2. Preventive punishment in the form of 
socialization of regulations, appeals and threats. 
 
Establishment of work environment through regularity of employees in carrying out duties and obligations in 
accordance with the applicable company regulations..

Abstract 
Sustainable development driven in Indonesia, especially for green roads has also begun. In some previous 
research papers have been done to get a picture of readiness both the government and business actors 
contractors and consultants are ready. But still encountered some obstacles in such a limited budget; lack 
of regulation; no government incentives for construction industry actors; expensive initial investment in 
technology; lack of technical specifications and implementation guidelines; lack of socialization of green 
road assessment system; lack of exercise; lack of expertise in government, contractors and consultants; lack 
of understanding and willingness; no request; Lack of tools that use environmentally friendly energy. This 
paper aims to provide a comparison of several types of materials such as Bio-asphalt, Coconut Shell 
Distillation, and Plastic Waste to reduce the use of asphalt in terms of construction, economic and legal 
aspects so that it can serve as a guide for evaluation. Bio-asphalt from algae can be used as a substitute for 
asphalt or used to reduce, while the Distillation of Coconut Shells and Plastic Waste can only be used to 
reduce the use of asphalt from petroleum. The future expectation of all road infrastructure development in 
Indonesia has a good green road rank

INTRODUCTION 
In the era of President Joko Widodo has been committed in an effort to improve the sector of environmentally 
sustainable development, as well as the transport infrastructure, especially roads and bridges. In addition to 
infrastructure, efforts are also made to promote the use of renewable energy such as electric motorcycles and to build 
a common electric charging facility (SPLU).

CONCLUSIONS 
Selection of materials that can reduce the use of asphalt from oil and renewable plastic waste should be used with the 
right percentage so that in addition to reducing plastic waste pollution and can provide economic value (cheap), also 
can be justified by law or rules that apply in Indonesia. 
For bio-asphalt and coconut shell distillation still need refinement of its manufacture technology that can produce 
material with cheaper, so that can be used as a substitute for asphalt from petroleum.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to prevent further misunderstanding regarding hijab for Moslems in 
Surabaya, understanding the correct knowledge of hijab will affect hijab manufacturers to produce hijab 
in accordance with Islamic Shari’a. This research is causal conclusive type with quantitative approach, 
since it aims to test specific relations. Analytical technique used in this research is logistic regression 
analysis to reveal the strength of prediction on knowledge level towards hijab purchasing decision. The 
results that the level of customer knowledge in hijab purchase is still at the level of know-how, which is 
not yet at the know-why level. Customer’s buying decision of hijab is based on the quality and color of 
the fabric, then whether the brand is famous or not. Afterwards, customer generally gains more 
knowledge regarding hijab and prefer hijab that is complying Islamic Shari'a.

INTRODUCTION 
The trending hijab model nowadays for Moslem women is a square hijab, since it is more practical, which 
unfortunately makes the essence of wearing hijab blurry in terms of customer’s comprehension and knowledge. A 
hijab which complies to the Holy Quran and the Hadith of the prophet is the one that covers the whole body except, 
face and palms, thick, loose, does not look like men’s clothing, does not resemble infidel women's clothing, not for 
the purpose of beautifying oneself and fame(Al-Albani, 2002). 
The use of improper hijab will give a negative impact to the users themselves. Applying hijab requires knowledge 
because failure to comply to Islamic Shari’a makes the use of hijab to be invalid or simply regarded as wearing a 
general women’s clothing and therefore cannot be considered employing Shari'a attire principle. This is in line with 
the results of Institute for Assessment of Food, Drugs and Cosmetics of Indonesian Council of Theologian (LP POM 
MUI) which stated that customer’s knowledge regarding what are haram items is very low. Hijab attributes that have 
been put into customer’s consideration are the model, types, and fabric, besides brand, price, and other elements. 
While customer take these attributes into account, they will utilize their knowledge about hijab, infact in choosing a 
product, consumers will experience several processes that hierarchically occur step by step, from the cognitive, 
affection, to the decision-making process and finally conduct purchase action(Feinberg, F. M., et al., 2012). In the 
cognitive stage, the role of consumer knowledge plays a vital role to influence the processes on the next phase, until 
the selection of the right product to meet consumer needs. Previous studies showed that product selection is 
influenced by the level of customer’s knowledge(Kolyesnikova, N., et al.,2008; Devi, V. C., et al., 2013; Husaini 
Usman, 2013; Utami, D., & Suherni, 2015). Moslem population in East Java on 2016 reached 39,657,788 
inhabitants with a percentage of females amounted to 50.6%, thus number of Moslem women in East Java is 
estimated at 20.082.062 people which is a large market for hijab(BAPPEDA JATIM, 2017). Surabaya as the capital 
of East Java province becomes the main target for manufacturers of hijab, based on economic census in 2013 that

CONCLUSIONS 
We Model of consumers knowledge level in the purchase of hijab is still in the “know –what” level and “know-
how”, but has not arrived at the level of “know-why”. The stages of hijab purchase decision is selecting a good 
fabric and color, whether the brand is famous or not,  until the time when consumers have an increased knowledge 
about hijab and understanding to cover the aurat correctly and being aware to wear hijab fabric that is thick and 
opaque, consumers could then be regarded have been properly following Islamic Shari’a.

Abstract 
This research aims to explain the effect of personal development and networking on entrepreneurship 
interest with supervising lecturers’ ability as the intervening variable. Our respondents are participants of 
student entrepreneurship program of STIE Mahardhika Surabaya. Based on data from 180 students, we 
find three major results. First, personal development significantly affect entrepreneurship interest, as 
indicated by p-value of 0.047. This implies that personal development dominantly affect entrepreneurship 
interest without having to directly affect supervising lecturers’ ability. Second, networking does not 
significantly affect entrepreneurship interest, as indicated by p-value of 0.272. This implies that the 
networking variable is not dominant in affecting entrepreneurship interest unless affecting supervising 
lecturers’ quality first. Third, supervising lecturers’ ability significantly affect entrepreneurship interest, 
as shown by p-value of 0.05.

INTRODUCTION 
Since the 1997 monetary crisis, Indonesia has been under rising educated unemployment risk. Current global 
economic crisis worsens the unemployment risk. It even also increases the unemployment risk to the less educated 
population. Slow employment growth and low level of capital inflow force schools and higher educational 
institutions to equip their graduates with entrepreneurship in order that their graduates do not necessarily focus on 
finding jobs, but more importantly, strive to create their own jobs. 
Indonesian higher educational institutions are constantly challenged to produce highly qualified graduates with high 
level of knowledge and skills, professional attitudes, good social ability, and stable emotional mastery(Bok, 1986). 
Although Indonesian educational institutions have tried much to equip their graduates with entrepreneurship, facts 
indicate that there are still many graduates do not utilize or develop this skill. Possible explanations are graduates’ 
limited abilities to develop their selves, graduates’ limited social networks, or ineffective mode of entrepreneurship 
teaching or more specifically supervising lecturers’ lack of ability.  
This research aims to investigate the relationship between personal development and networking on 
entrepreneurship interests with supervising lecturer’s ability as the intervening variable. We use entrepreneurship 
program at STIE Mahardhika Surabaya as our research setting. 
2 
METHODOLOGY 
We use a quantitative exploratory research. Sugiono explains that explanatory research is a research that explains 
causal relationship between variables that affect hypothesis(Sugiyono, 2013). Our targeted population is all STIE 
Mahardhika Surabaya students who enroll entrepreneurship course. Hair in Ferdinand  suggests that sample size 
depends on the number of indicators in all latent variables(Ferdinand, 2007). Further, it is suggested that the 
minimum sample size is 5-10 observations for each parameter estimation.  
1992","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Dubai, UAE, March 10-12, 2020 
© IEOM Society International 
The second finding of this research does not confirm that networking significantly affects entrepreneurship interest. 
Our results show that networking does not have a significant effect on entrepreneurship interest. The findings also 
weaken Murphy & Peck’s theory (Alma, 2004) on getting things done with and through people that suggests that 
working together with other people enable goal achievement. This is the essence of management, namely science or 
art of using other people’s efforts to achieve predetermined objectives. The indirect effect value is greater than the 
direct effect. These show that the networking variable is not dominant in affecting entrepreneurship interest unless 
affecting supervising lecturers’ ability first. These imply that supervising lecturers’ ability must be high enough in 
order that students’ entrepreneurship interest is achieved.  
Our third finding confirm statement that lecturers’ ability significantly affect entrepreneurship interest. This research 
is supported by Novita Erliana Sari and Aprina Chintya that find that lecturers’s ability in delivering 
entrepreneurship course affects students’ interests in engaging entrepreneurship activity.

CONCLUSIONS 
Our research is about the effect of personal development and networking on entrepreneurship interest with 
supervising lecturer’s ability as the intervening variable. Our respondents are students of STIE Mahadhika Surabaya 
who participated in the entrepreneurship program.  
In general, we find that: Personal development has a significantly positive effect on entrepreneurship interest. This 
can be seen from positive coefficient of 0.155 with CR value of 1.904 and p-value of 0.047 which is smaller than 
significance value α of 0.05. These imply that the personal development variable significantly affects 
entrepreneurship interest. The indirect effect value is smaller than the direct effect. These show that the personal 
development variable is dominant in affecting entrepreneurship interest without having to affect supervising 
lecturers’ quality. 
Networking does not have a significant effect on entrepreneurship interest.  This can be indicated by the positive 
coefficient of 0.142 with CR value of 1.099 and p-value of 0.272 which is higher than significance value α of 0.05. 
These imply that the networking variable does not significantly affect entrepreneurship interest. The indirect effect 
value is greater than the direct effect. These show that the networking variable is not dominant in affecting 
entrepreneurship interest unless affecting supervising lecturers’ ability first. In other words, supervising lecturers 
must be well-qualified before students can develop their entrepreneurship interest. 
Supervising lecturers’ ability has a significantly positive effect on entrepreneurship interest. This can be seen by the 
positive coefficient of 0.219 with CR value of 1.958 and p-value of 0.219 which is higher than significance value α 
of 0.05. As a result, the supervising lecturers’ ability variable significantly affect entrepreneurship interest. These 
results support our fifth hypothesis that predicts that lecturers’ ability has a significantly positive effect on 
entrepreneurship interest.

Abstract 
This study aims to evaluate the substance: context, input, process, and product of the implementation of 
the policy of the Higher Education Quality Assurance System (SPM Dikti) in the Faculty of Teacher 
Training and Education Mulawarman University (FKIP UNMUL) in an effort to improve the quality of 
FKIP UNMUL in the national policy of education Indonesia. The method used in this research is 
qualitative research method, data collection technique is triangulation. The data analysis is inductive 
studying related to the document of quality assurance system policy in FKIP Unmul, substance analysis, 
implementation and result of SPM policy Dikti in FKIP UNMUL The evaluation research model used is 
the Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) model developed by Stufflebeam The result of the 
research shows that SPM Dikti in FKIP UNMUL is seen from three system that is PD Dikti, SPMI and 
SPME as a whole is running well in accordance with the standard set, but there are 5 programs that still 
show the data of lecturers and students in PD Dikti still not inputs, there are 2 average courses of study 
duration of students above the standard. The recommendations of this research are: (1) FKIP Unmul 
should regularly conduct internal quality audit in accreditation, (2) need attention concerning comparison 
of number of students and lecturers according to standard, (3) increase the funding budget for faculty 
improvement by empowering the Faculty's Quality Assurance Units (GJMF) and Quality Assurance Unit 
Study Program (UJMP) to conduct continuous monitoring.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background 
Universities in Indonesia, including Mulawarman University in general and faculty in particular face no small 
challenges. The biggest challenge faced is the wave of economic globalization, information and communication and 
rapid technological developments.  
This condition requires universities, especially faculties and study programs to make fundamental managerial 
changes. Then, there is a change, pressure, awareness, and customer demand about the quality of graduates of the 
study program that requires university managers to make changes in policy, especially commitment to the

Evaluation in product component is done to measure the success of achievement of policy/program objectives made 
by FKIP UNMUL in the application of SPM DIKTI include student satisfaction, student achievement of GPA and 
length of student study in applying SPM DIKTI consisting of accreditation result of BAN-PT to study program at 
FKIP UNMUL. 
Student satisfaction in education, can be seen from IPK based on graduation competency standard consists of: With 
praise (cumlaude), very satisfying, satisfying and enough, good vocational program, scholar, profession, master and 
doctor. 
Based on the result of research until August 2017, it is found that the average GPA of students who graduated for 
Bachelor program, the average GPA = 3.37, S2 = 3.60, and S3 = 3.65 So that when viewed from the predicate of 
graduation either S1, S2 and S3 has a very satisfactory predicate. 
Study duration for undergraduate program average 4 years 6 months (4.5 years), average S2 duration of study 2 
years 7 months (2.58 years) and average S3 3 years 9 months (3.75 years). 
The implementation of Quality Assurance System Policy at FKIP Mulawarman University has been running, but its 
implementation to the study program has not been running well, because there are still many obstacles, especially 
the commitment of the faculty leader and the activeness of the Head of Quality Assurance Unit of Study Program 
(UJMP) and the Quality Assurance Team of Faculty GJMF) Faculty. 
The accreditation result of BAN PT based on Accreditation of Study Program in 2017 has issued accreditation for 
Chemistry Education S1 Program (accredited B), Study of Geography Education (accredited B) and Chemistry 
Education S2 Program (accredited C), and still waiting for accreditation result again for 6 study programs namely S2 
Management Education Studies Program, Undergraduate Study Program S1, Study Program PLS S1, Prodi 
Pendidikan Indonesia S1, S2 Biology Teacher Training Program and Prodi PGSD S1. 
FKIP Mulawarman University already has 1 National Assessor of BAN PT and 10 Internal Quality Auditor that can 
be used to assist in the preparation of accreditation form of the study program in FKIP UNMUL. 
 
4. Conclusions and Recommendations 
4.1. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the study and discussion and considering the limitations of the policy evaluation it can be 
concluded as follows: 
4.1.1. Evaluation of the Policy in Context Components 
The background of the urgent need to implement the Higher Education Quality Assurance System (SPM-Dikti) in 
FKIP Mulawarman University through three sub-systems, each of which is also a system, namely: (a) National 
Higher Education Database (PDPT); (formerly EPSBED); (b) Internal Quality Assurance System (SPMI), and (c) 
External Quality Assurance System (SPME), has been running well. 
Prime Service Standards are the technical specifications on the service benchmarks provided by FKIP UNMUL to 
the community have not been fully audited and evaluated. 
The work program of Faculty Quality Assurance Group (GJMF) in preparing SPM-Dikti implementation in the 
faculty can support to socialize the culture of quality to the academic savitas 
, so academic savitas have a commitmentto improving the quality of FKIP UNMUL 
Vision, Mission and Objectives FKIP UNMUL has been understood and then describes it in making the basic 
framework and curriculum structure to improve the competence of graduates in the world of work after the students 
plunge in spaciousness. 
The Strategic Plan of FKIP UNMUL in 2016-2020 is prepared by trying to optimize all the potential possessed by 
the faculty. All aspects of the faculty's activities are analyzed and included in the preparation of the next 4-year 
strategicplan and need to be supported by the commitment of the executors. 
 
4.1.2. Evaluation of Policy in Input Components 
FKIP Unmul curriculum refers to the regulation on the curriculum at the university level. FKIP Unmul always takes 
into account the quality aspects of its graduates, constantly reviewing the feasibility of the curriculum over time. 
Curriculum development policy at policy-oriented FKIP at Mulawarman University which refers to Decree of 
Minister of National Education Republic of Indonesia Number 091 / O / 2004 about Statute Unmul, hereinafter 
described in FKIP Unmul Strategic Plan and currently being adjusted again with KKNI which is regulated by Rector 
Regulation No.05 Year 2015 on the Implementation of Education Mulawarman University. In 2016 FKIP Unmul

Abstract 
Smart Campus has emerged as an important concept of embedding technology in education. In recent years, 
it has gained an enormous amount of attention from professionals, academics, and researchers from multiple 
disciplines. However, still, the concept has not been developed as a whole and lacks framework. This study, 
therefore, conducts intensive research to revise the recent accomplishments in the field of smart cities in 
general and smart campus in particular. The research proposes and defines the underpinning criteria for 
developing a smart campus and propose a strategic framework for its components. The findings suggested 
that the framework was based on IoT and cloud computing as the main supporting infrastructure which 
includes eight main criteria and 25 sub-applications such as: Smart Card or E-Card, Smart Classrooms, 
Energy Management, Adaptive Learning, Smart Transportation, Security & Safety, Optimization & 
Analytics Data Center and Smart Facilities Services.

1. Introduction
Current emerging technologies have improved the living standards of individuals and enhance the quality of their 
lives in many aspects. However, the critical factor in developing societies is a good education, which plays a vital 
role in building future generations and cultivating the way they think. Therefore, there appears a current need to 
integrate the recent development in technologies into the existing education institutes. Moreover, with the ongoing 
need to utilize sustainable resources, merging educational institutes with new technologies is not the only solution. A 
combination of current technologies with sustainable and environmentally friendly resources together can only act as 
the catalyst to reshape the present educational institutes by the concept of smart cities in general and smart campus in 
particular. As (Harrison et al., 2010) in the IBM journal of research and development defined smart cities as “urban 
areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and 
public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services.” To have a more in-depth view of smart campus; 
(Villegas et al., 2019) applies the concept of smart cities to define smart campus as an integration of three fundamental 
axes which includes: Data acquisition using IoT, Data centralization and use of big data for the management and 
analysis. The integration of axes allows the traditional campuses to be able to effectively manage the information 
generated within the campuses.  
Recently, due to the promising expected results of applying these principles in real life, universities and research ins
titutes have focused their studies on smart cities and sustainable development. 
Similarly,the United Arab Emirates has recently become an incubator for applications for smart cities aimed at placi
ng Dubai or UAE on the map as the world's first smart city (Kumar, 2016). Following the same agenda, American 
University of Sharjah (AUS), which ranks 376 worldwide and 7th in the Arab region (“Top Universities,” 2018) have 
recently launched focused Doctoral programs on ‘Smart Cities Management’ and ‘Sustainable Construction 
Management’ (“Ph.D. in Engineering,” 2018). Therefore, as a part of the recent global focus on smart cities, it became 
inevitable to facilitate those cities with smart educational facilities, called “The Smart Campus.” This research, 
therefore, intends to present the concept and architecture of ‘Smart Campus’ with a focus on defining the underpinning

Abstract 
Transportation is one of the necessities in our life today.  Along with the increase in the number of cars and 
roads being made is the increase in the demand for driver's licenses.  With the numerous land transportation 
offices, few issue new driver's licenses and therefore has to serve many applicants who exert a lot of time 
and effort to complete the application process which normally takes more than four hours to be completed. 
Time, being a very important factor in our daily decisions, is the concern of this study.  This study aims to 
lessen the total time to complete the process and so is the minimum waiting time of 46% by designing an 
appointment system developed and tested using simulation and system improvement.  Sensitivity Analysis 
was used to see how waiting time and running time was affected under various realistic circumstances. 
Results have shown a decrease in waiting time to 9%.  To further improve the results of the study, research 
on the factors affecting and degree of punctuality of license applicants and change in the utilization 
employees after the application can be made.

1. Introduction
Ease of transportation in a country is one of the signs of economic status. Each day, thousands of motor vehicles are 
being used to get to the destination, especially in capital regions.  Private vehicle use has grown rapidly during the last 
decades and around 80% of these vehicles were primarily used for personal transportation, i.e., cars and motorcycles 
(Steg 2003). Along with the increase in the number of cars and roads being made is the increase in the demand for 
driver's licenses. In the Philippines, issuance of driver's licenses and renewals are under the jurisdiction of the license 
processing office.  In 2015, a total of 1,424,410 permits and licenses (25 percent) were issued in the National Capital 
Region, according to the data from the License Processing Office Annual Report (2016). 
There are three types of driver's licenses in the Philippines, which are student's permit, non-professional license and 
professional license.  Based on the data from the license processing office, NCR has handled the most license cases 
with 26.6% of the total (LTO 2016).  Not all branches handle the issuance of the new driver's license because of 
different limitations.  As a result, more transactions are held in these few branches. Many people complain about the 
handling of the processes in LTO.  Getting a driver’s license means spending hours waiting to complete the process 
which is something that most people resent doing.   
A lot of studies covered different techniques on how to lessen waiting time in queue. For every study, a different 
approach was used with different methods of analysis and testing was applied.  In a study by Chen et al. (2015), a 
computer simulation software was used while Mashhour’s (2008) Design of Experiments was used to test relationships 
of factors and derive optimal formulas. Zonderland et al. (2009), studied existing models and theories which were 
simply modified to fit the needs of a specific setting then applied simulation to see the effects on the performance 
indicators.

2010","Examination.  It was maximized to one hour for all applicants resulting in finishing the test by members of a batch at 
the same time.  The third case is having a delay by one hour in the arrival of the first batch and the last batch.  The 
first case worsened by adding a delay at the later part of the process to see how badly it affects the simulation time.  
 
Table 6.  Results of Different Delays on System 
 
 
The best models chosen were all from accumulating 5 while varying arriving batch quantities which were 5, 8 and 10. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In a system where applicants arrive on their preferred schedule, there is a possibility of not being able to finish the 
process and be asked to come back on the next day or not being accommodated at all. Unscheduled arrival also renders 
applicants to longer process and waiting time. In the current license application process, waiting to be accommodated 
in the lecture room and approval station brings the highest waiting time in the system with an average time of 68 
minutes and 20 minutes, respectively. With the proposed system, only 6 minutes on the average will be the waiting 
time of each applicant for the lecture and 9 minutes for the approval, while time in queue for validation is 0.33 min, 
1.26 for Picture and Signature AMPI, 0.28 min for cashier, 2 min for approving and 0.11 min for releasing. 
 
To achieve this, the application and evaluation of different scheduling rules on the process were done by varying the 
arrival batch size, accumulation size, changing the arrival sizes depending on time and changing the distribution of 
arrivals in these schedules.  The study was able to decrease the waiting time by more than 25% and ensuring the 
completion of the process on the same day of starting the process.  With the improved model, with the same quantity 
of applicants being accommodated, time in the system was reduced by evenly distributing arrivals giving room for 
more applicants, as having a fixed arrival schedule gives the applicants knowledge of the allowable arrival times. 
 
To strengthen the accuracy of the results of the study and improve the schedule to better suit the time preferences of 
applicants coming in LTO, it is recommended to have research on the factors that affect their time of arrival, delay, 
and decision on their planned time of arrival.  For future studies, the information system for the appointment system 
can be made.  A more detailed study can also be made about the idleness of employees and the effect of having noon 
break and identify if other internal factors can attribute to the present waiting time and possibly affect the proposed 
model.  A detailed study on the behavior of the demand for license processing for all kinds of the license can also 
contribute to helping better understand the reasoning behind the arrivals of customers, thus establish even more 
stability and better prediction of demand for the process.

Abstract 
The high energy consumptions in buildings has been reported as one of the key contributors to global 
warming since the energy is mostly generated from fossil sources which is responsible for large 
emission of carbon dioxide. Hence, there has been series of awareness on the need for an energy 
efficient building that can drastically reduce energy consumption.  In this study, the performance of a 
tropically adapted passive building (PB) was investigated in real hot tropical climate of Malaysia. 
Two mock-up buildings were built to represent a “green”, made of clay brick double-glazed PB and a 
conventional, made of concrete “red” building (RB). The ambient temperature of PB was found to be 
always lower than RB throughout the 7-days experiment during typical sunny/cloudy weather 
constellations. Besides that, the double-glazed windows installed in PB could better withstand the 
radiation effect of the sunlight hence maintain a much lower window IST than the single-glazed 
windows in RB. The average ambient temperatures of PB and RB are 29.9 oC and 31.6 oC 
respectively while the average window ISTs of PB and RB are 31.6 oC and 33.8 oC respectively. The 
study concludes that PB provides a better protection against thermal discomfort and the window is 
one of the critical contributors that affect ambient temperature in a warm tropical climate.

1. Introduction
The quest for energy efficiency in building has placed a demand for designing and modeling energy efficient 
buildings. During the designing stage of a building, thermal efficiency is often evaluated in terms of energy 
consumption in order to determine how best energy efficiency can be achieved. The primary objective of every 
building is to provide essential comfort in the indoor environment. Achieving this will require a good 
understanding of the external environment such as severe temperature, wind, rain, and so and how these external 
environments influence the comfort of the indoor environment. Series of parameters that influence the energy 
performance of residential buildings has been reported by Zhao et al. (2015) using a case study of a Chinese 
climate zone. Parameters such as window to wall ratio, shading coefficients, thickness of EPS board, heat 
transfer coefficient of window were found to have varying effects on the energy demand for cooling in the 
building.  
Several authors have also reported the influence of the external environment on the indoor environment comfort. 
Dhaka et al. (2013) reported the effect of building envelop on the thermal environment conditions of a naturally 
ventilated building block in tropic climate. The authors measured the building envelop such as the roof U-value,

Based on the results of this preliminary study, we received indications that the well-insulated, almost airtight 
and optimum shaded PB is always cooler than RB during the daytime. Under the weather conditions of tropical 
Malaysia with a residential comfort level of not exceeding 28.6 °C, the passive design will work best in a 
combination of nighttime usage of green cooling (i.e. forced mechanical ventilation), and daytime airtight and 
shaded – best of course without occupants as interfering heat generators. If an air conditioner was used, a lot of 
energy can still be saved by using an energy efficient, inverter-type air set-pointed conditioner or a non-inverter 
type in combination with a simple smart power interrupter system. 
 
 
Conclusion  
The configuration of the façade was found to have a tremendous impact on the ambient temperature thus the 
overall energy consumption of the building. Window commonly presents a small area of a building, but it has a 
significant effect on the immediate heat inflow to the building. Whereas this work so far measures the impact of 
double-glazed window, moving forward, the impact of other parameters such as the floors, walls, ceilings, and 
even shadings are being investigated by the research team to determine the contribution of all these building 
enclosures in order to achieve tropical residential thermal comfort. The challenge is to bring all these relevant 
parameters into play in different weather situations for a more sustainable green living in the age of global 
warming.

Abstract 
One of the problems faced in production facilities is the material handling, which may account between 20-
50% of total costs of manufacturing and distribution. Material handling is directly related to facility layout. 
In many instances, wrong facility layouts result in excessive handling costs, which could be eliminated or 
minimized through effective layout procedures. In this paper, we present a case application of a facility 
layout for a furniture factory, which has a wood and a fabric sections, with fourteen and fifteen departments 
respectively. About 23 types of sofa models are produced in the factory, where excessive material and 
personnel flows and backflows were observed during a detailed study. Facility layout models were used to 
estimate total material flow for both the current and the improved layouts. It was found that by using 
appropriate layout techniques, unnecessary flows could be eliminated, and total material flow costs could 
be minimized. Interdepartmental distance matrices, material and worker flow matrices, and weighting 
factors were used to quantify the total costs of flow between departments. By using quantitative relations 
and a facility layout algorithm in excel, layouts of departments were restructured, and total flows were 
minimized. The proposed new layouts resulted in a significant reduction in material handling costs.

1. Introduction
Facility planning is concerned with the design, layout, and accommodation of people, machines and activities of a 
system or enterprise within a physical spatial environment. Facility layout problem (FLP) is formally defined as the 
placement of facilities in a plant area, with the aim of determining the most effective arrangement in accordance with 
some criteria or objectives under certain constraints, such as shape, size, orientation, and pick-up/drop-off point of the 
facilities. Facility planning and layout is very important in manufacturing processes due to its effect on achieving an 
efficient product flow. It is estimated that between 20%-50% of the total costs in manufacturing is related to material 
handling. This cost can be reduced by nearly 70% through an effective facility planning procedure. Proper analysis of 
facility layout could improve the performance of production line such as decreasing bottleneck rate, minimizing 
material handling cost, reducing idle time, and raising utilization of labor, equipment and space. Many research studies 
have been carried out to determine optimum facility layout for a given system.

436","By implementing the optimum layouts, total savings is expected to be 28,303 $/year. The current layouts are relatively 
easy to redesign by exchanging the locations of departments and expected to cost the company less than 30,000 dollars, 
which can be recovered in about a year. The results of CRAFT algorithm above were compared to relationship 
diagramming procedure of qualitative facility layout results for both the wood and the fabric sections. Optimum 
material flow costs obtained from relationship diagramming were comparable to those obtained by CRAFT. 
Relationship diagramming procedure and the results could not be reproduced here due to space limitations. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
This paper attempts to improve layout of a sofa furniture manufacturing facility to minimize total material flow costs 
in a real system by applying engineering tools related to facility planning techniques. Current layouts are analyzed, 
and related material flow costs are calculated. Next, CRAFT facility layout algorithm, which is available as excel add-
ins, is utilized to determine optimum layouts corresponding to minimum material flow costs. The procedure followed 
in this paper proved to be effective in reducing total material flow costs in the facility studied. This study can be useful 
guide for facility layout and production engineers to minimize material flow costs in their facilities. The procedures 
and the results of this study also show that material handling costs due to wrong layouts should not be overlooked. 
Total annual material handling costs due to wrong layouts can be substantial and related savings, by using appropriate 
layout tools, can be significant.

Abstract 
The literature of technology mapping or Roadmapping, as a one of the elements used in technology 
management, reviewed in this research to understand how technology mapping has been developed, define 
technology mapping, identify the types, and applications of technology mapping. This has been done by 
analyzing the various studies in technology mapping. It has been proved in this research that technology 
mapping went through three different phases namely product technology Roadmapping, emerging 
technology Roadmapping, and innovations Roadmapping. Technology mapping or technology 
Roadmapping both terminologies used to describe the methods used in generating technology roadmaps to 
support decision-making process and organization strategic planning. Three types of Technology 
Roadmapping identified in this research namely “based on purpose”, “based on format”, and “based on 
use”. For applications, three applications only identified in the current research namely Sustainable new 
product development decisions, Fuel cell sub-technologies’ identification, and Foresight studies. However, 
it was stated in the literature that technology mapping could be applied and used in different fields. The 
analysis conducted on the technology Roadmapping literature highlighted many challenges and feature 
research directions which we discussed in this research.

1. Introduction
Technology can be defined as “the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry” 
(Prima, Oktaviani and Sholihin, 2018). It was stated in the literature that scientists usually generate the new knowledge 
and then the technologists apply it and it was assumed that engineering covered all technologies. Therefore, technology 
can be viewed as a field that involves ideas and techniques and, on the other side, things that exist because of designs 
(Layton, 1974). In fact, it was stated in the literature that “technology” has two dimensions, the first one is knowledge 
about the man-made world and the second is the community of people that includes engineers, scientists, inventors 
and craftsmen that participate in the creation of knowledge (Wise, 1985). Management can be defined as a set of 
activities and principles used for administration of an organization (Fabus, Kremenova and Fabusova, 2017). Hence, 
technology management can be defined as a “set of management disciplines that allows organizations to manage their 
technological fundamentals to create competitive advantage” (Chen, Huang and Chen, 2012). It was stated in the 
reviewed literature that “technology management addresses the effective identification, selection, acquisition, 
development, exploitation and protection of technologies” and is required for maintaining a place in the market and 
meeting with the company’s objectives (Phaal, Farrukh and Probert, 2004). One of the important issue in the 
technology management discipline is maintaining effective linkage between technological resources and the 
company’s objectives, however, it is still one of the big companies’ challenges. To support this, communication and

mentioned that technology Roadmapping is not a mature concept and is in an exploratory phase of research. 
Furthermore, the relationship between technology mapping and other initiatives in the organization is in a blur phase, 
those initiatives include knowledge management and communication skills, which are somehow related to technology 
mapping. Although companies have shown more interest recently in the concept of technology mapping, there is lack 
of papers related to technology mapping. However, publications have started increasing since 2004 (Carvalho, Fleury 
and Lopes, 2013). In addition, there is a lack of documentation when it comes to the best methodologies of technology 
mapping and the tools and practices related to it. Moreover, Carvalho, Fleury and Lopes (2013) mentioned that in the 
literature review there is a lack of addressing the relationship between technology Roadmapping and other initiatives 
such as innovation and corporate strategy. Actually, companies struggle in applying technology Roadmapping because 
there are many forms of roadmaps available (Phaal, Farrukh and Probert, 2004). 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
Technology mapping or Roadmapping is a tool that combines innovation and communication in the technology 
management field. Technology mapping applied in different organizations to achieve effective strategic objectives 
with technology, to support strategic decisions, for long-range planning, provides a way for companies to explore the 
future, scan the environment and to track the individuals’ performance. It has been proved in the literature review that 
technology mapping went through three different phases, which can be seen as generations: the first generation of 
technology Roadmapping focuses on the product technology roadmap, the second generation is the one focusing on 
emerging technology Roadmapping, while the third generation of technology Roadmapping is the one that puts an 
emphasis on the innovation roadmaps. It has been proved in this literature review that technology mapping or 
technology Roadmapping both terminologies used to describe the methods used in generating technology roadmaps. 
Literature review showed as well technology Roadmapping methodologies or tools can be categorized to three types, 
which are based on purpose, based on format and based on use. Regarding the applications of technology mapping, 
researchers in the current research were able to identify three applications only. However, it was stated in the literature 
that technology mapping could be applied and used in different fields. Literature review showed a struggle in 
implementing technology Roadmapping, only 10% of large organizations have implemented it (Phaal, et al., 2004). 
The reasons vary from the confusion of which form the company should use, to the fact that there is not enough 
practical support and knowledge sharing in this field. Furthermore, when it comes to the best methodologies of 
Roadmapping there is a lack of documentation, lack of tools and practices, and there is a lack of addressing the 
relationship between technology Roadmapping and other initiatives. It has been proved in the literature that having 
more primary information would have been helpful in terms of understanding the different concepts and methods by 
relating them to practical-life situations. We can conclude that technology mapping carries significant scope for future 
researchers, as it would enable them to think of the elements to be reconsidered in the future. Based on the literature 
review, it can be seen that technology mapping can provide a competitive advantage to organizations but those 
organizations need to pay attention to the importance of innovation and communication within the organization itself. 
Technology mapping can be considered as a planning tool and it is a method in which organizations can improve. 
Implementing technology mapping is not the ultimate solution; rather organizations should keep the map alive by 
updating it and adding more criteria, fields and tools to it throughout the years.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of the study is to determine how web design and interface can affect the purchasing decision of consumer 
at group buying websites. With the growing e-commerce industry, businesses assume that websites are a big key to 
their success when there is an increased number of visits and purchases. Based on statistics and industry analysis, 
there is a growing population of consumers transferring to digital purchases in the Philippines, but they need to keep 
up with the demands of the customers and prevent unsuccessful purchases that leads to a loss of profit for the website. 
To proceed with the study, the researcher had (1) to assess the current performance of existing business to business to 
consumer e-commerce websites; (2) to identify the significant factors that affect the decision of design and interface 
development of B2C e-commerce websites; (3) to integrate those factors into developing a suitable webpage design 
and interface for business to business to consumer B2C e-commerce websites. ANOVA and regression were used as 
the statistical treatment of data. The study was able to confirm through the comparison of usability tests that the 
proposed website has significant improvements that can be used to improve the webpage in terms of web design and 
interface. The study will benefit online shoppers, entrepreneurs and the future users of the website.

1. Introduction 
 
Technology on its own has a wide range of growing influence in society nowadays. With the rapid growth of 
opportunities using the Internet, everything imaginable will sooner or later be immediately available. Opportunities 
offer a vast range of information resources and services, such as applications of e-mails, file sharing and the World 
Wide Web. Websites have many functions that are used in various ways like communication through social media, 
company corporate websites, and they even transform ways of doing business nowadays. One of the fast-rising 
business opportunities today is online shopping. Electronic commerce is a relatively new business channel, which 
entails selling and buying goods and services using a technology channel, namely, the World Wide Web or the Internet 
(Thananuraksakul, 2007) Being inexpensive and easy to use, electronic commerce has been rapidly growing each year 
and is currently utilized for shopping, information search, bills payment, news, weather reports, and online games. 
Online shopping can be a great resource for shoppers that are looking to expand their choices of products to buy and 
increase their way for saving money (Montaldo, 2018).  
 
Internet World Stats (2017) stated that the most numerous Internet users in the world were in Asia, accounting for 
49.2% of the world population. Next is Europe, with 17.3%, and Latin America, for the same period, with 10.5%. 
International Internet users ranking were was topped by the Chinese with 738 million users, second is India with 463 
million users, third is the United States with 286 million users and, with 57 million users, the Philippines ranked the 
14th (Internet world Stats, 2017) Activities included surfing the Internet at home for various activities such as shopping 
online, using electronic mail, paying bills, downloading software/game/music, chatting, playing games, and searching 
information for job-related tasks, for job searches, for products and services details, for education details, and for news 
reports.

Figure 1. House of Quality Translating the Customer’s Desires into Goals and Technicalities 
 
From the results of the House of Quality (HOQ), the researchers were able to analyze which factors are deemed 
important by the users and what they can provide to meet those needs and wants of the users. They used the results as 
their bases for building a website that is suitable to the taste of the users. The researchers randomly selected 50 
respondents from their previous group of respondents and made them try the newly designed website. They let the 
users navigate the website as they pleased and then, afterwards, the researchers conducted a post-usability test to help 
them identify the different reactions and insights of the users with regards to the current B2C websites vs the integrated 
and newly design website which was proposed by the researchers.  After the post-usability test, the researchers 
conducted another ANOVA analysis to determine if there are significant differences among the five websites. They 
were able to conclude that the users preferred to use the new website rather than the current websites of the four B2C 
e-commerce websites Although the scores of the proposed website were not that far from the score of the top ranking 
website in each factor there was still a significant difference in it. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Initially, the assessments of four current e-commerce websites were discussed. With that, the researcher found that 
those websites were only rated as “average” by the usability test answered by respondents. Also, certain strengths and 
weaknesses were discovered in each website as the results of important ratings from the survey were analyzed. Both 
online and in person distribution were used in the methodology. The use of ANOVA was also observed to further 
analyze the data gathered from the users.  After which, the data on hand were translated to the target specifications to 
be used in the webpage development. The researcher was able to utilize HOQ, a QFD tool to ensure that users’ 
requirements are taken into consideration. Preceding with the webpage development itself, and the specifications 
formulated, a proposed website was made.

Abstract 
 
Generation of work shifts is an important issue in Bus Rapid Transit Systems, due to the impact caused by 
the costs of hiring drivers to carry out the routes. The generation of shifts consists of putting together work 
schedule blocks, in order to cover the operation of the routes specified by the transport system, in this case, 
the routes of the Colombian West-Center Metropolitan Area. To solve this problem, a two-phase solution 
methodology was proposed, based on a Column Generation Algorithm that combines the work blocks, 
minimizing the number of shifts. The Table 1 presents a comparison of the results obtained with the manual 
programming and the proposed methodology in real-world instances (Megabús, Colombia). The Table 1 
also shows that the methodology reaches feasible solutions in reasonable computing times, and outperforms 
all the proposed solutions by skilled practitioners, decreasing the total number of shifts. Moreover, the 
algorithmic solution allows the coordinators to focus in the contingencies presented during the operation of 
the massive transit system; as shown in Table 1, a task requiring approximately 8 hours of coordinator’s 
work (feeder and main routes), the methodology schedules the daily operation in 8 minutes. Note that the 
algorithm generates less work shifts than the manual programming, reducing the operational costs of the 
company. Additionally, the number of mixed shifts is also reduced, a scenario where drivers with the most 
expensive license (C3), will be scheduled for services requiring only C2 license.

Abstract 
Rolling process is implemented in the production of structures that are regularly utilized in vast applications such as pipes, 
frames, shells, and discs. Flat rolling is one of the widely used rolling processes that involves reducing the thickness of a metal 
sheet by feeding it between two rollers that are separated by a pre-specified distance, and this can be done under hot conditions 
(hot flat rolling) or cold conditions (cold flat rolling). Due to the significance of flat rolling applications, optimizing this process 
became a crucial necessity in today’s industrial revolution. In this paper, Simufact Forming Simulation Software was utilized 
to extract critical results such as effective plastic strain, effective stress, lateral spread, and maximum rolling force under 
different rolling conditions such as the rotational speed of the rollers and the friction between the rollers and the workpiece to 
identify their effect on the process. The general trends of the extracted data showed either a linear or a quadratic relationship 
between the parameters verses the rotational speed and the friction. Finally, the trends were used to characterize the best 
conditions for flat rolling applications.

1. Introduction
Rolling is one of the common metal forming process which is used to manufacture structural I beams, rails, and different kinds 
of stocks such as channel stocks and angle stocks and many other applications. One of the basic rolling processes is flat rolling 
in which a piece of metal stock such as steel, aluminum, etc. is pressed against two or more rollers and the thickness of the 
stock gets reduced to a desired value. Depending on the working temperature, rolling is divided into either hot or cold rolling. 
The temperature of recrystallization is the one used to classify them (hot rolling: Trecrystallization > Tworking, cold rolling: Trecrystallization 
< Tworking). A schematic of the process is displayed in Figure 1.

Figure 13: Relationship between friction coefficient and maximum effective stress, effective plastic strain  
 
On the other hand, the friction plays another role in the fluctuation of the stress and strain of the rolled workpiece. Both 
parameters follow a positive quadratic function trend as the friction coefficient changes from 0.3 to 0.5. Then again, 
intermediate values of the friction coefficients resulted in the lowest stress and strain values (0.35 to 0.45) as Figure 13 
illustrates.  
 
6. Further Research 
 
As for future research, further exploration of other important parameters of the flat rolling process can be studied such as the 
effect of the rollers diameter, initial force that pushes the workpiece between the rollers, workpiece initial thickness and the 
maximum thickness reduction. All of these parameter can have a significant impact on the flat rolling process and can affect 
the integrity of the material and the final product. Furthermore, multi rolling passes and their enhancement of the rolling process 
can be another area of research. Understanding their influence on the rolled specimen and the production rates of products 
along with their cost can be beneficial on an industrial level. In addition to that, studying different materials behavior during 
flat rolling processes can be of high importance in automobile and aerospace applications. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, this researched focused on the simulation of multiple flat rolling processes which were run under different 
conditions of rolling speed and friction coefficient. The aim was to understand the behavior and the state of the workpiece 
during and after the each process. The results of each run that includes the effective stress, effective plastic strain, strain rate, 
lateral spreading and the rolling force were extracted after the simulations were done. These results were summarized in graphs 
to understand basic trends and relationships. It was found that the best conditions to perform the flat rolling process for the 
studied material is at speeds of 70 to 90 RPM with friction coefficient between 0.35 to 0.45. These conditions resulted in 
reasonable values for the measured stresses, forces and deformations. The trends were characterized by a positive linear 
relationship or a positive quadratic relationship. From that, it can be concluded that increasing the speed or the friction 
coefficient to high values or decreasing them significantly can be a disservice to the production of sheet metals by flat rolling.

1. Introduction
The office of harbor mastership and port authority is technical implementation unit of the directorate 
general of maritime communications and transportation which shall be established the main tasks and functions of 
this office which in the performance of its duties is directly responsible to the Directorate General of Sea 
Communications. In order to arrange the smoothness and security of transport carried out through these waters, there 
are several government agencies assigned, one of them harbormastership Office and Port Authority Tarakan Class 
III. 
As an organization, the office of Harbormastership and Port Authority of Tarakan Class III, it is of course 
not related to human resources management, it is very closely related to the management of other resources. The 
better the management of human resources the better the management of other resources, otherwise the worse the 
management of human resources then it results in the less good management of other resources. 
Good governence is a requirement for government agencies in order to realize the people aspirations and achieve the 
goals and ideals of the nation. Employees are required to work professionally based on good morals, efficient, clean 
and prioritize the interests of society and can serve the community as well as possible. However, in the 
implementation, service problems and supervision is often questioned, it is because there are still many employees 
who have not been able to maximize its performance, it is marked by the achievement of performance targets that 
have been determined in the implementation of basic tasks or additional, the accuracy of employees in completing 
the work, of course it shows that the organizational culture of employees has not been as expected. 
In order to create optimal performance, it requires an optimal work enhancement and able to utilize the potential 
human resources owned by employees in order to create organizational goals. In this case, it is necessary for the role 
of the organization in improving the organizational culture and creating a good working environment in order to

and regulations and work discipline are adhered to and carried out by employees with full responsibility; justice in 
the distribution of compensation; leaders always solve problems through employee meetings; the amount of 
compensation given in accordance with his / her performance; there is no sense of the sentiments of fellow 
employees in the office in terms of providing compensation; and leadership influence and determine the behavior of 
employees in achieving office goals.  
 
5.3. The Influence of Organizational Culture on Employee Performance through Working Environment at the Office 
of Harbormastership and Port Authority of Tarakan Class III 
The results of this study indicate that the influence of organizational culture indirectly through the work 
environment have a positive and significant impact on the employees performance of Harbormastership Office and 
Port Authority Class III Tarakan. These results indicate that the weakness of organizational culture will result in 
employees comfortable with satisfaction and results of work, so that can work environment factors can raise 
employee performance.  
Good organizations are always conscious to set up an organizational culture that is able to generate enthusiasm and 
passion for employees. At work place, it is impossible to expect enthusiasm to arise without setting up the best 
organizational culture. The best governance set-up, guidelines on best practice, clear and decisive leadership, a 
professional and friendly work environment, dependable competence and quality, and fair leadership behaviors and 
employee attention will make the work environment a fertile place to foster enthusiasm for work employees.  
When employees enjoy what they do in the workplace, then they become a great force to produce the best 
performance and performance. Enthusiasm, high motivation, confidence, and strong beliefs will encourage 
employees to work and serve the organization in the best possible way. In this case, the management and leadership 
must always be aware of themselves not to practice bad things that can reduce employee morale. Thus, over time, 
management and leadership must be able to maintain and improve all situations and realities, potentially reducing 
the culture of hard work in the workplace. A strong organizational culture creates a work environment that 
encourages employee enthusiasm and confidence to serve wholeheartedly.  
 
6. Conclusions 
According to the results of the research and data analysis, it can conclude that:

INTRODUCTION 
The development of technology and information in Indonesia has grown rapidly particularly internet access. Internet 
becomes a need since by using internet various kinds of information are easy to be accessed and explored. The use 
and utilization of internet are also able to increase the competitiveness potential of a college or an educational 
organization. The changing pattern of information consumption from traditional into digital and easy access to the 
internet make students are easier to obtain information through the digital world which provides various types of 
information that is constantly updated (Qamar, Purwanto and Karim, 2013). The digital world is experiencing rapid 
development as a means of communication that is not limited by distance and time. This is an opportunity to 
conduct marketing communication which aims to provide information to the students, to improve brand recognition 
and awareness, as well as to get students. 
The main challenge for a college or educational organization is to understand the needs of students and detailed 
information on each of these educational organizations. Weak information about an educational organization 
damage the image of the educational organization itself. It is important that an educational organization assesses and 
improve the quality of their information, so as to contribute to the trust of students and be able to compete with other 
educational organizations. Therefore, colleges or educational organizations create sites to introduce and promote the 
institutions. Site in a college or higher education has some purposes such as: to provide information about the 
profile, academic programs, facilities and infrastructure, activities that had been done or will be done, achievements 
that have been obtained and so forth (Sari, 2016). The website also allows users to get information without coming 
to the location directly. 
This paper employed Webqual method to assess the quality of website of the University of Kanjuruhan Malang, 
www.unikama.ac.id. The Webqual method has evolved since 1998 and gradually was started to conduct research on 
Webqual. In 2000, Barnes and Vidgen in they journal, Webqual: An Exploration of Web Site Quality, discusses the 
quality of websites in UK business schools. in their research, only assessed the Information quality of websites 
(Barnes and Vidgen, 2000).  
This paper was conducted to find out the relationship between website quality and the decision of respondents to 
register at an educational organizational website, that is Kanjuruhan university's website. 100 students were 
employed as respondents to assess Kanjuruhan university's website. Instruments used in this paper were 
questionnaires for webqual by Barnes and Vidgen (2000). Instruments used in this paper changed the qualitative 
perceptions of respondents into quantitative metrics to determine the effect of website quality on the decision of

Abstract 
Road accidents are increasing every year. According to the world health organization, the Percentage of 
cyclist’s victims are 5% and motor cyclists’ victims are 23%, and the most Accidents happened between 
4:00 pm to 11:59 pm when the sun is setting. These numbers indicate the importance of finding a solution 
to reduce these accidents for the cyclists, so that we keep the cyclists safe. 
We aim at having a safety system that will capture the cyclists intended actions by using switches and send 
this information to the microcontroller (Arduino) which, in turns, will send the proper signal to the actuator 
which is basically the LED Matrix (Figure 1 and 2). The LED Matrix will display a message to the drivers 
near the bicycle to inform them with the intended action of the cyclists. The message may be an arrow 
indicating that the cyclist is going to turn to a specific direction, etc. This system will help making the 
drivers more attentive to the cyclists and will help reduce the percentage of cyclist’s victims. The topic will 
include features for the rider which are a mobile phone charger and GPS tracker. Electric power supply is 
obtained using a DC Generator to both recharge the battery and supply power to divers’ components.

Abstract 
With an ageing population and more efficient treatments, demand for cancer care is rising; leading to long 
waiting times and a significant increase in delays in chemotherapy clinics. Chemotherapy operations 
planning and scheduling is a multi-facet problem due to numerous aspects such as the variety of 
chemotherapy treatment plans, the flow of patients, and the interdependence between the departments. 
Patient flow is affected by many delays at different stages; doctors’ and pharmacy’s delay, referral to 
specialist, and waiting time for chemotherapy. The aim of this work is to improve the waiting time of 
chemotherapy patients by studying the flow of patients from the register time until departure time. The 
typical characteristics of outpatient chemotherapy are detailed in this paper based on a real-life case study 
in Alexandria, Egypt. The data collected showed that 66% out of 144 studied patients arrive earlier than 
scheduled, which results in a FIFO flow that affected the scheduling system. Hence, most planning and 
scheduling efforts are ineffective. A simulation model is built using the data collected to analyze the flow 
of patients. Two scenarios are proposed, tested, and compared to the base model and show that 
improvements can be attained by reducing unnecessary delays.

1. Introduction
When people think of the deadliest diseases in the world, their minds jump to the fast-acting, incurable ones that grab 
headlines from time to time. But in fact, many of these diseases do not rank in the top 10 causes of worldwide deaths. 
Cancer, according to the World Health Organization, is the second leading cause of death globally; in Egypt, cancer 
rates are expected to increase three times the current status by 2050, according to the National Plan for Cancer Control 
(Ibrahim et al. 2014).  
Cancer has several treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal treatment, and surgery. Chemotherapy 
is one of the most important interventions in the cancer treatment, it can be proposed to the patient as a standalone 
treatment, in parallel or in sequence with radiotherapy or surgery (Lamé, Jouini, and Stal-Le Cardinal 2016). Due to 
the severe increase in the number of cancer patients subjected to either of the treatments, the demand for chemotherapy 
is increasing, and oncology clinics are experiencing higher workloads that can result in tremendous system delays. 
In November 2018, a case study was performed in the oncology department in Hospital X in Alexandria, Egypt. The 
hospital started taking in an approximate of 45 patients per day in 2006 and increased up to 800 patients per day in 
2018. Chemotherapy patients accounts from 60 to 70 patients per day. This study is focused on breast cancer patients 
who receive chemotherapy treatment which accounts for 20 percent of daily patients visiting the clinic. 
Moreover, considering chemotherapy patients who come to the clinic according to their appointment times for 
chemotherapy treatment, and go through multiple stages (receptionist, oncologist visit, lab, pharmacy, and 
chemotherapy administration) require multiple resources (oncologists, nurses, chairs, and pharmacists). Each stage of 
the process exhibits uncertainties that occur during a typical clinic day, such as unpunctual arrivals, delays in 
laboratory and pharmacy areas, increase or decrease in treatment durations due to side effects or dose changes, 
cancellations, and add-ons. All these uncertainties affect patient flow and staff workload.  
Hospital X Head of the nursing staff is the one responsible for scheduling the patients according to several factors 
such as the personal requirements according to the patients and the common treatments gathered at the same time to 
assess the pharmacy to batch several drug preparation for an objective of cutting down costs. However, the data

6. Conclusions 
 
Long waiting time for chemotherapy patients occur frequently in oncology clinics and this does not only affect the 
patient satisfaction, but also affects the efficiency of the drug provided in the chemo and subsequently affects the 
whole treatment process. Operation Researchers have studied this field using assumptions due to the several number 
of departments that are involved in the process and the high variability. Simulation have been identified in literature 
as one of the key tools to address the complexity of these systems and to handle the stochastic nature of the different 
variables affecting the performance of healthcare processes in general.  
A real life case study of an oncology department in a hospital located in Alexandria, Egypt has been selected. Actual 
data has been collected and analyzed for a considerable number of patients. Also, data about the different process, 
resources, and operation of the oncology clinic have been identified. Although the hospital treats patients with all sorts 
of cancer types; yet, the study has been limited to breast cancer patients only. 
A base discrete event simulation model representing the current operation of the oncology clinic has been developed 
using ExtendSimTM v10.0.4 and analyzed. The model included the different resources identified; in addition, the 
pharmacy and drug preparation time are considered in the model; however, without including the detailed operation 
of the pharmacy. Average length of stay of patients reported from the base model has been analyzed to identify its 
different constituents. The largest contributor to the ALOS that can be feasibly reduced are identified. Two different 
scenarios were developed to test the effect of the proposed solutions on the different performance measures. Results 
show that the different performance measures can be actually improved without the need to modify any of the current 
resources. 
Furthermore, although other activities contributed to the ALOS of patients with greater values; however, these 
activities cannot be altered due to the fact that the duration of these activities is a clinical variable that cannot be 
changed, such as the chemotherapy, line, and the premed injection times. Drug preparation time was also one of the 
major contributors to the ALOS; yet, due to the restricted access to the pharmacy, detailed modelling of pharmacy 
operations and resources was not possible at this stage of the research. Hence, it was not possible to actually estimate 
or identify any possible reduction in drug preparation time. 
Future research work will focus on modelling further details of the pharmacy operations and resources to determine 
whether the drug preparation time (one of the major contributors to the ALOS) can be reduced or not and whether this 
reduction will lead to an overall improvement of the oncology clinic performance or not. Furthermore, alternative 
patients’ schedules are to be modelled and analyzed to test their effectiveness in improving patients’ ALOS and 
resources’ utilization.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to develop a preventive maintenance strategy for a group of solar panels 
interconnected in series. The approach was to determine the optimal number of solar panels to replace, as 
well as the optimal replacement periods in order to minimize the total cost of maintenance, over a finite 
time horizon. In addition, it has been considered that the replacement of solar panels improves the reliability 
of the system. In case of failure, a minimal repair is carried out. This intervention has no impact on the 
reliability of solar panels. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the contribution of the proposed 
modelling approach and to discuss the different results obtained.

Abstract 
The oil and gas (O&G) industry have complex supply chains across the various processes involved in 
extracting, refining, and distributing oil and gas. The supply chain involves multiple locations (wellheads, 
production facilities, and refineries) and many companies supplying the material and equipment required 
at these locations as well as support services such as project and contract management and logistics. 
Moreover, lower oil prices are reducing the operating margins of the Oil and Gas companies forcing them 
to review their organizations and supply chains to improve efficiencies and reduce cost. This can be 
achieved not only through vertical integration but also through a horizontal merger between two or more 
companies. Therefore, strategic and tactical planning and optimization of the main activities in the O&G is 
challenging and continue to attract researchers and practitioners.   
In this study, we present a novel mathematical model for strategic and tactical planning of the upstream 
O&G supply chain. The O&G supply chain is composed of production areas for oil and gas, processing 
plants, and demand terminals (tank farms for oil and downstream gas processing). The proposed model 
assists decision-makers in studying how to manage the O&G supply chain after a merger. The model 
introduces a framework for the evaluation of advantages associated with horizontal mergers through supply 
chain network integration and optimization.  
A case study based on real data from the UAE is provided to show the applicability of the model. Besides, 
a sensitivity analysis related to the volatility of oil and gas prices is conducted to derive managerial insights. 
The initial results show that merger decisions and related costs (shared services and logistics cost) have an 
impact on how to meet the demand, minimizing costs, and maximizing revenue. Finally, experimentation 
of the proposed model for two scenarios pre- and post-horizontal mergers is presented for the quantification 
of potential gains associated with the merger.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on examining the risk factors associated with Text Neck syndrome (TN) among 
individuals using smartphones. TN syndrome has many side effects that may harm the users’ health by 
causing musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) to be the riskiest among anything else. This paper experimented 
with all possible scenarios that an individual would use their smartphones. As it was applied for both 
genders, three different percentiles, three possible postures, and three possible levels of usages using digital 
human modeling. JACK software was used for modeling all possible postures to analyze the effect of 
texting on the neck area. In addition, a survey was done with 722 respondents in order to measure and 
analyze the pain level associated with the main factors of TN occurrence. Also, Minitab software was used 
to analyze both the survey’s data and RULA scores to show the most significant factors affecting the neck 
pain. Solutions and recommendations were given in order to reduce the pain level and ergonomic risks on 
the neck.

Introduction
Text Neck syndrome (TN) is a present-day term that combines the symptoms of repeated neck and head pain caused 
by prolonged texting or gazing down at the cell phone or any other portable electronic device. In addition, (Ali et al., 
2017) in a recent study stated that “79% of the population between the ages of 18-44 have their cell phones with them 
almost all the time, with only 2 hours of their working day spend without their cell on hand”. Any abnormal curvature 
in the cervical spine influences the head, neck, and entire spinal cord is known as TN. It is derived from 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) that affects the physical health of an individual. MSDs are associated with the 
unusual behavior of the muscles, bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, and nerves that are connected to form the physical 
system of the human being. Prolonged exposure to Forward Head Posture (FHP) is a result of TN that can lead to 
degeneration in the structure of the cervical spine because the head exerts extra weight on the shoulders and neck 
obligating them to carry the extra load. (Ali et al., 2017) The wrong position will lead ligaments holding the vertebrae 
and muscles to be tensioned and consequently loosening on the long run. Increasing the pressure could lead to disks, 
inflammation, injuries, and severe pain. Repeated performance of texting on a smartphone causes from tolerable to 
severe neck pain experienced by a user while bending their neck. Users often adjust their physical posture based on 
the smartphone to be able to use it easily and not vice versa. (Anna et al., 2018) showed that 66.7% of people who 
used the smartphone for 3 hours or more while seating or standing experienced neck pain. 
Digital Human Modeling (DHM) is a reliable method to visualize and analyze the major concern of this paper which 
is the TN syndrome. JACK software will assist in measuring the effort exerted on the neck in different postures by 
DHM. It has several assessment tools that will help in measuring outcomes like Rapid Upper Limbs Assessment 
(RULA) and Comfort Assessment tool. Identify Critical factors affecting the neck  
Billions of people in the world have access and use smart devices on a regular basis; therefore, this paper will help to 
raise awareness of the importance of correcting smartphone usage postures. As the critical factors affecting the neck 
will be identified. This paper will also focus on reducing the neck pain caused by the prolonged usage of smartphones.

6. Conclusion  
 
To conclude, this paper focused on the ergonomic risk and neck pain due to the TN syndrome problem that affects 
people that is based on gender, postures, level of usage and height percentiles. The TN is associated with exponential 
growth and development of technology that has many side effects on people. Other than that, the head flexion angle 
was a matter of concern that was measured. Based on the survey that was developed, hours spent using a smartphone 
and people ages have a significant effect on the neck pain level. Digital Human Models with different scenarios were 
built using JACK software to show the risk associated with the prolonged usage of a smartphone. The results proved 
that both genders’ outcomes showed a riskiness level that needs further investigation and other high risky levels 
outcomes that required immediate changes. Therefore, alternative solutions were suggested such as chair arm support 
and prism glasses. Based on all outcomes, prism glasses were the optimum solution as RULA and neck scores 
decreased and the head flexion was zero, this means that the neck will not be bent that minimizes the vulnerability to 
experience/ get text neck.   
On the other hand, some recommendations might help in reducing neck pain due to the usage of smartphones such as: 
using the correct texting techniques by raising the smartphone closer to eye level with a straight back while sitting or 
standing. For tall people from (50th to 95th) percentiles, it is preferred to use the smartphone in sitting posture, it is 
necessary to make sure that both arm and hand are well supported by anything like a chair, table, briefcase or others 
supporting arm techniques. One important thing is to avoid using the smartphone while walking; however, in case of 
something urgent it is preferable to take care of the usage level and neck posture. Lastly, it is important to have frequent 
breaks with stretching and do some exercises that will help in easing muscle pain.

Abstract 
Due to the explosion of multimedia quantities such as archived TV broad cast videos, various multimedia 
resources released on the Internet, intense work in multimedia retrieval domain has aimed to provide 
efficient and accurate functionality for users to access the desired information. The rapid access to these 
huge multimedia resources and automatically assess day similarity or an experience from this collection of 
unstructured egocentric data presents major challenges that require efficient algorithms. As everything is 
nowadays automated, the main goal of this work is to apply a new method to automatically assess day 
similarity using a real image dataset called Egocentric Dataset of the University of Barcelona (EDUB) of 
4912 daily images acquired by 4 persons in order to evaluate the performance of our system.

1. Introduction
The earliest motivation behind automatic generation of personal digital archives can be traced back to 1945 when 
Bush expressed his vision that our lives can be recorded with the help of the technology and the access can be made 
easier to these ‘digital memories’. This new way of autobiography generation has become more and more realistic 
recently, with the advances of lightweight computing devices and highly accurate sensors. Mobile devices are 
approaching a more capable computing ability, dwarfing the most powerful computers in the past. The low price and 
the embedded nature of smaller and lightweight sensors (cameras, GPS, Bluetooth, accelerometers, etc.) make 
computing devices portable or even wearable to enable life recording to be done unobtrusively. The large volume of 
data storage and high-speed wireless networks needed for this help the mobile platform to turn into people-centric 
sensors capturing multidimensional sensory inputs besides spatial and temporal data. Lifelogging is the term 
describing this notion of digitally recording aspects of our lives, where the recorded multimedia content is the 
reflection of activities which we subsequently use to obtain the meaning of daily events by browsing, searching, or 
querying. 
In order to create a mapping between the digital world and the real world, numerous context scan be recorded for the 
capture of the true meaning of daily activities. Here, contexts refer to the information which can be used to characterize 
a situation. A huge variety of contexts can be used in lifelogging such as textual photos, information, video clips and 
audio, environment information (temperature, pressure, light, etc.), bio-information (galvanic response, heart rate, 
etc.) and special information (acceleration, co-presence, location, etc.). These contexts are dynamically changing, and

Abstract 
 
According to the United Nations report, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion people by 2050. As a result, 
there must be an increase in food production by 70 % to meet the world’s growing demand. Food supply chains expand 
from agriculture activities, production, transportation to consumption. The efficient management of agricultural 
activities is indispensable to secure food production. The main challenges faced in this respect are the limited 
availability of natural resources (land and water). In this study, we applied an integer linear programming model to 
solve the crop planning problem in a small farm while considering limited water availability. The crop planning model 
relies on the delineation of rectangular management zones to identify the optimum crop pattern based on the physical 
and chemical properties of the land. The model has been applied to a small farm in Egypt. The results help the decision-
maker in identifying the optimum crop pattern for maximum profit and also to decide on the economic feasibility of 
different irrigation systems. 
 
Keywords  
Crop planning, irrigation, linear programming, and management zones.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
Securing food for the growing world population is among the highest priorities for governments and international 
organizations. Managing agricultural activities given the limited land and water resources is challenging. Hence, 
optimizing crop pattern for maximum yield and profit is a problem attracting the attention of practitioners and 
researchers. Limited water availability in arid and semi-arid areas calls for efficient use of irrigation water. The 
requirement for irrigation water varies according to soil properties. Hence, the delineation of rectangular management 
zones ensures the homogeneity of the land characteristics and, thus, irrigation requirements. 
This research considers a case study for a crop planning problem in an old agriculture land for a command canal 
area located on the north coast of Egypt. This planning problem aims to help the farmer to identify the right crop pattern 
to maximize profit. To this end, the approach proposed by  Cid-Garcia et al. 1  is adopted. The approach calls for 
identifying crop pattern based on the chemical and physical soil properties which affect yield and irrigation requirement, 
respectively. The model aims to achieve maximum profit while considering various cost elements (sowing cost, seed 
cost, and irrigation cost).  
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section2 presents a literature review. Section 3describes the 
adopted methodology and mathematical models. A case study is presented in Section 4. The results obtained are 
presented and discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and future research directions are indicated in 
Section 6.

6. Conclusion and Future Research 
 
In view of limited water availability in arid and semi-arid areas, optimizing crop planning is one way of efficient 
utilization of land and water resources. This work has presented the application of a crop planning model based on the 
delineation of rectangular chemical and physical management zones to a small farm in Egypt. Apart from the model’s 
capability to identify optimum crop patterns to maximize profit, it is used to compare different irrigation systems. This 
latter use of the model will aid farmers in identifying the more economically viable irrigation system. In the current 
case, a combination of surface and drip irrigation leads to the maximum total profit over the planning horizon. The 
application of the model gives insight into the different cost components and gives the decision-maker the flexibility to 
choose an adequate irrigation system. The model is generic and applicable in arid and semi-arid areas.   
The study of the economic feasibility of the use of modern irrigation systems and smart water and moisture sensors 
using the internet of things for data acquisition to collect data from the field for the optimization model is suggested to 
be investigated in the future.

Abstract 
This study is conducted to explore the applications of lean manufacturing (LM) practices in textile 
industry. It is observed that unlike other industries like pharma and automobile very few studies are 
conducted to explore the applications of LM practices in textile industry. The rigorous search is 
conducted for sufficient relevant data from research journals, books, conference proceedings, magazines 
and internet. The data is scrutinized on the basis of relevancy and authenticity to conduct initial data 
analysis. The detailed analysis is conducted then and LM practices are identified in the context of textile 
industry. The LM practices are short listed on the basis of their frequency and the scope of applications in 
textile industry. Most relevant and suitable case studies are also discussed to explain applications of these 
selected LM practices in the textile industry. In the conclusion, the most notable LM practices in the 
context of textile industry are identified and discussed in detail. Also, the applications of these LM 
practices in the textile industry are discussed with the help of suitable examples and related case studies. 
The key findings of the study mentioned that various authors commented that the LM research should be 
widened in various ranges of industries, and specifically in the process industries where it has hardly been 
studied. In addition, it is also found that there are numerous studies on discrete manufacturing but very 
few in process industries. A closer investigation reveals that JIT and Kanban tools are applicable in 
process industries. SMED principles to reduce set-up time are applied in two case studies. Goforth 
investigated cases from textiles and found that lean practices 5S, Kaizen, VSM and visual control were 
used in maximum cases. Lee discussed the transferability of JIT and TQM to Indian textile industry. 5S 
and TPM are useful lean practices to minimize the wastes in the textile organizations. Lean practices like 
cellular manufacturing, Kanban, mistake proofing, policy deployment and rapid improvements were 
rarely used in textile industries. Lean practices and lean wastes investigation is new to textile industry. 
Only one waste is considered in most of the studies and among them the defect wastes considered in more 
than half of the studies. Only 1 or 2 appearances of other 6 wastes in all the studies. Lean Six sigma is the 
most popular practice in the yarn manufacturing industry for the analysis of defect waste. After that 5S 
and TPM are the most popular practices and these are also considered as the foundation for the 
implementation of LM. Automation and SMED are also getting importance as the technology is 
continuously improving and the lead time is affected by the setup changes. All the other practices are

Abstract 
The importance of occupational safety and health is one of the subjects that cannot be neglected. In our 
project, we focused on ensuring a safe work environment for the workers and designing a better layout that 
smooths the flow between the areas in a construction site. That was done by considering safety concepts 
and layout optimization concepts. The main aim of this project is to develop a site layout that insures better 
safety conditions for the workers. Kuwait International Airport Expansion- Terminal 2 which is one of the 
huge projects of ‘‘New Kuwait Vision’’ was chosen to apply this project. The terminal is expected to be 
completed in 2023 and only 36% of the project has been completed yet, thus it needs an improved layout 
for their construction site. The study proposes a modified SLP (Systematic Layout Planning) approach for 
generating layout alternatives by considering both material flow data and safety risk factors. The 
alternatives were generated using MCRAFT algorithm based on closeness ratings obtained from material 
flows between areas of the construction site. The risk factor related to each site area is determined using 
(FMEA). The layout alternatives are then simulated to determine the material handling utilization using 
(TECNOMATIX) software. In the evaluation step of the SLP approach, a multi-objective point rating 
method is used to consider, risk priority number, material handling cost, safety risk factor and utilization 
criteria with different weights. All alternatives are evaluated based on the values obtained for each criterion 
and the highest lowest index is suggested for implementation.

Women work to help the family and economy as well as the main breadwinner in the family. On the other 
hand his role in the affairs of the household (domestic) being reduced due to the division for a long time, 
which is used for other activities outside of the household. The community has a role sikka respectively in 
each of his works as an example is a woman trader acted to suffice the needs in household income. The 
town of maumere had the traditional market, known as market alok. Traders in the market, an awful lot of 
alok sell goods clothing, food and board, such as convection (suits, veils, underwear, socks, shoes and bags, 
bumbon, meat, produce, glassware, accessories, tools electronics, service, fruits, etc). This research was 
conducted in the market alok. maumere, sikka R & D road. in July 2018. Determination of the sample using 
the formula slovin (Husein 2011) and the degree of error of 15%. Methods of analysis used in this study is 
qualitative and quantitative methods. The tool that is used to retrieve data using the author field school 
questionnaire and test by using a test of the validity of the test, reabilitas test, normality. The data was 
processed using statistical parametik multiple linear regression and correlation. Based on the results of 
research income is Idr respondents average. 15,388,000 with range Rp 4.500.000 – USD 15,000,000. then 
average income family member respondents is Rp. 996,666 with a range of Rp.500.000 – Rp.1.5 million. 
Total family income respondents average is Rp. 14,391,334 with a range of Rp. 4,000, 000 – Rp 13,500, 
000. It can be concluded also that average family income respondents are also on top of the UMP (Provincial 
Minimum Wage) of Rp. 1,660, 000.00. with the contribution of income respondents against his family's
income is high. The results of the regression analysis shows analysis I calculate a woman's role is of 3,573

Abstract 
Poverty is a reality facing by every nation and country in the world. Islam concerned its people to have 
the ability and excellence in the economic field. One of its ways is that zakat, infak and shodaqah can be 
developed or accommodated to meet the needs of consumptive as well as the development of productive 
enterprises. This research was conducted to find out the supporting and inhibiting the factors in the 
implementation of zakat management profession. The research location in Zakat collecting Unit (UPZ) 
Badanamil Zakat (BAZ) Tegalsari district Banyuwangi regency East Java Indonesia. This type of research 
is a case study. Interactive model analyzer. The result showed: the factors supporting the implementation 
of zakat management include the presence of scholars (Ulama) and community leaders, the existence of 
Law No. 23 of 2011 on Management of Zakat, and also the local Government Regulation. The obstacels 
include the lack of trust of civil servants to UPZ, so that the civil servant prefer to distribute themselves or 
directly, most civil servants are not aware of the obligation of how zakat should be issued, and some even 
choose not to pay zakat.

1. INTRODUCTION
Islam does not forbid its adherents to seek wealth, only when someone has managed to gain property, it should be
remembered that in one’s possessions that are some rights that must be given to those who are less fortunate and
entangled in poverty. It is affirmed in God’s Word Surat Az-Zariyat verse 19:
 ِ وَﻓِﻲ أَﻣْﻮَ اﻟِﮭِﻢْ ﺣَﻖﱞ ﻟِﻠﺴﱠﺎﺋِﻞِ وَ اﻟْﻤَﺤْﺮُوم
“And in their property was a portion due to him who begs and to him who is denied (good).” (QS. Az-Zariyat:19). 
The problem of poverty is not merely an economic problem, but it is also a multidimensional problem, which is in 
touch with the various dimensions of human life in social, political, cultural, and religious. Therefore, to alleviate 
the poverty is the most difficult challenge from year to year. If referring to the BPS release that the number of 
poverty in Indonesia as of September 2016 reached 27.76 million or 10.7 percent of the total population. That 
number was down 0.89 percent compared to March 2016 period which reach 28.01 million or 10.86 percent of the 
total population. Nevertheless, when compared to the period of September 2015, the decline reached 1.22 percent 
(Saputro, 2017). 
Poverty can lead to complex problems, besides to an unemployment being a clear-cut impact on education, resulting 
in poor people unable to reach because of limited costs, health, violence everywhere, as well as social conflicts due 
to the discontent and disappointment over the poverty conditions(Lestari, 2015).Seeing so much of the danger that is

Abstract 
The objective of this study is to obtain IT process that related to the GUG principles (accountability, 
transparency, nonprofit, quality assurance and effectiveness & efficiency) and expected level for each 
GUG principles. This paper is a theoretical exploration based on a literature review, expert judgement that 
has experience with COBIT 5 and also lecturer in higher education. This research focusing on finding the 
IT Process in COBIT 5 that has relation with the GUG Principles and the expected level for each GUG 
Principles. The limit in here is only focusing on GUG Principle based on Law in Indonesia (Law no. 12 
year 2012) because case study for this research was one of polytechnic in Indonesia. With this research 
there would be model for audit in higher education with GUG principles that based on law in Indonesia 
(Law no. 12 year 2012). Until now there is no research that has a list of IT process in COBIT 5 that 
related to the GUG principles and the expected level for each GUG principles. The application of GUG is 
important because of the need for conformity with government regulations and preparing models for 
future research about audit  based on GUG Principles.

INTRODUCTION 
Business strategies are policies and guidelines that define how a company competes in an industry (Craig & Grant, 
1993). The most frequent problem in organizations is the inappropriateness of IT implementation with organizational 
goals (Johnson, Kavanagh, & Mattson, 2003). With such incompatibilities, the IT that should provide benefits, didn’t 
give any benefit, it can even be a burden to the organization (such as: expenses and maintenance costs of IT). 
Therefore every organization needs a good IT governance. With the existence of good governance, then IT will be 
able to provide maximum benefits and also in accordance with organizational goals.  
Good University Governance (GUG) is a derivative concept of Good Governance that focuses on higher education 
(university) governance. The university as the organizer of higher education and as the center of science and 
technology development is expected to increase its role in promoting and accelerating national development. Today 
almost all organizations use IT to support their business processes, as well as higher education. The two main IT 
Governance issues are: how IT can deliver sufficient value to the business and how existing and emerging risks of IT 
existence can be managed (Manual, 2010). This is the underlying need for governance in college.  
For universities, IT is an important aspect for supporting higher education in educational, research, administrative, 
and community service processes (Yanosky & Caruso, 2008). Based on this, the Government in Indonesia has a law 
that regulates high education, namely Law No. 12 of year 2012 (Indonesia, 2012). This law regulates policies for

CONCLUSIONS 
The Results here would be the list of IT Process that need assessment and the expected level of GUG based on the 
law No. 12 Year 2012 made by Indonesia government. The result would be applied to polytechnics that used as a 
case study. If from the result the implementation level is still small and has a gap between assessment and the 
expected level then it needs an improvement or addition to improve the level of implementation of GUG. 
In this research, there are still some shortcomings of research that has conducted. one of it is the need to do gap 
analysis to find out the recommendations of each existing IT process based on COBIT framework 5. With the gap 
analysis, the researcher can make some recommendations to improve the existing IT processes in higher education. 
If the level of capability of the IT process increases then this will also improve the level of GUG implementation. 
From this research also found there is research gap from some research which have been done by other researcher 
before. the gap is there is no methods to give priority to the overall recommendations given, so for the 
implementation of the recommendations are still unknown priority level. If there is no priority level then this will

Abstract 
Knowledge base is generally given through structured data or documents that can be given through 
database, XML documents. In a research developed by the author associated with nusantara culinary tour 
agency, knowledge base with culinary tourism domain is necessary. Culinary tour information today is high 
and easy to find either through printed or online media and becomes a strength for this research to be 
developed, to enrich knowledge base of culinary tourism conversation agent media needed to capture such 
abundant information by using information retrieval in accordance with the keyword ""isA, location, partOF, 
hasA"", the result of this information retrieval will then become knowledge base of the culinary tour agent 
presented in Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) PostgreSql. This research will contribute 
as an alternative media to enrich the knowledge base of culinary tour agent which is generated from free 
text using keyword for its search by using information retrieval (Information Retrieval).

INTRODUCTION 
Culinary tourism today is very popular. Changes of lifestyle in society also contribute AS People eat not only to satisfy 
their stomach, but also look for atmosphere and service as part of the dish of food ordered. Many regional foods serve 
different flavours on the tongue and many also understand the details of the typical regional food.  
An agent is a person or something that has the ability to perform a particular task/job in accordance with his capacity 
for something or someone else (Romi Satria Wahono, 2003). Conversation agent is expected to be an alternative 
presentation of information needed by the community associated with culinary tourism. 
Most conventional interfaces are based on direct manipulation where the user is solely responsible for monitoring  and 
executing all tasks. However, indirect management interfaces are now being developed which allow the user to 
delegate some tasks to an interface agent(Beskow & Mcglashan, 1997) 
In the previous research it has been concluded that Indonesian Free Texts can be used as basis to add knowledge base 
of agent with Information Retrieval (IR) module which generate it automatically (Cahyono et al., 2008). 
Generally agent knowledge base can be given by entering directly from the database and use the knowledge of the 
agent or any other process that is from structured sources e.g XML and relational data. 
Knowledge Base (KB) approach uses mechanism of cause and language of query ontology to retrieve source of 
information. Document is one of the sources in retrieving information(Ceri et al., 2013). 
The most widespread applications of IR are the ones dealing with textual data. As textual IR deals with document 
sources and questions, both expressed in natural language, a number of textual operations take place “on top” of the 
classic retrieval steps. 
Focus of this research is to generate an agent's knowledge base from an abundant source of information on culinary 
tourism in the form of free text into the knowledge base of postgreSql RDBMS-shaped agents. 
Most information retrieval systems point to documents or parts of documents, giving physical access, or at maximum 
bibliographic access via representations(Logan, 1993).

CONCLUSIONS 
processes in generating knowledge base of culinary agent of archipelago uses information retrieval (IR). There are 
three process in ir including parsing, semantic and translation analysis. In  parsing process there are two query function 
of parshing_kalimat and parsing2, in process of semantic analysis using one query function ie urai_kalimat_v4, while 
the translational process translates the results from the semantic analysis into agent knowledge base. 
Information Retrieval (IR) uses keyword base parsing where the determination of keywords for parsing is crucial in 
the process of retrieving relevant information from the free text given in accordance with the domain of nusantara 
culinary tourism. 
From trials with free texts there are 6 indexes decomposed, from 6 indexes there are 5 indexes that become candidates 
entered into agent knowledge base, means 83.3% of free text is selected into knowledge base agent. 
Free text with bigger sentences in it need to be tested to see the accuracy of the results of this research. Keyword 
selection in relations becomes important in generating agents knowledge base.

Abstract 
The construction industry in the UK within the last decade has seen an increasing demand for housing and wider 
concerns over the need to improve performance. Comparatively, other UK industry such as car manufacturing has 
rapidly developed and modernised itself. Offsite technologies seem reluctant to be adopted by the construction 
industry. Several surveys have been carried out to examine the limitations and explore remedial actions however, 
house builders are uncertain in their views, hence are reluctant to embrace this innovation in helping to meet the 
current demand for new homes. This study has been carried out to understand the benefits and barriers of modular 
construction and the level of satisfaction with the modular construction over the traditional construction. The 
investigation was carried out through using 3 case studies, within which a combination interviews, questionnaires, site 
observation and document review were used for data collection. The results suggested that in comparison with 
traditional construction, modular construction will offer a better quality finished product, significant savings in 
construction programme, improved health and safety and increased end-user satisfaction. The projects reviewed have 
shown excellent market achievement. The authors have hence concluded that given changing client perception, 
improved design and procurement, and increased awareness, modular techniques will be the future home construction 
trend. To achieve this, increased awareness and training opportunities in modular techniques are necessary to enlighten 
traditional builders about the potential benefits of modular techniques.

1. Introduction
The construction industry in the UK, as of 2018, contributed £117 billion to the UK economy, 6% of the total economic 
output, where the growth was bolstered by demand for housing, commercial, infrastructure, other public and industrial 
sectors (Rhodes, 2019). Despite such huge growth, the industry in the UK continues to underperform in some critical 
areas of the industry such as productivity, the certainty of delivery on time, skilled labour and data transparency. 
Housing accounted for highest value of new orders in 2018: £21.6 billion, 35% of all new orders. The government has 
an ambition to deliver 1 million homes by the end of 2020 and to deliver half a million more by the end of 2022 
(Rhodes, 2019).

6. Conclusions 
 
The modular construction method is a significant innovation that aims to offer the construction industry modern 
methods of building residential homes efficiently and speedily to meet current demand. Traditional contractors are 
reluctant to adopt off-site modular construction techniques mainly due to its poor previous perceptions. Cost was often 
seen as an obstacle to off-site activities due to increased initial cost required during the planning and design phases 
inaccessible by traditional builders. However, the primary data conducted using 3 case studies show that there are 
considerable benefits in terms of time, cost and quality aspects, if adopting modular construction over traditional 
construction. Barriers were identified too as poor perception, transport difficulties, lack of coordination and 
collaboration. In addition, other barriers such as lack of knowledge and regulatory guidance, lack of industry and 
product awareness, shortage of skilled workers have hindered on traditional builders’ unwillingness to embrace this 
innovation. These can be overcome by increased industry knowledge and awareness of the successes of modular 
techniques

Abstract 
Many countries are now entering the stage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, also referred to as Industry 
4.0, in which technological advances enable disruptive changes in the industry. Industry 4.0 development 
changes the way people work and the work is organized. Currently, there is a lack of qualified workers 
capable of undertaking the jobs of the Industry 4.0 and unfortunately many schools and universities are still 
training students behind the Industry 4.0. 
The new industry 4.0 developments have created requirement of new cross-functional roles on the emerging 
knowledge and skills combining information technology (IT) and production. Therefore, it is important to 
understand the characteristics of knowledge and skills required for the future of jobs and engineering 
profiles to determine the emerging patterns in the delivery of new education requirements of Industry 4.0.  
This work aims to address how the future of higher education should be towards Industry 4.0 developments 
for engineering faculties. We also aim to present what the technological trends in education as well as how 
the universities are required to integrate the new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches in teaching 
and, how to stimulate entrepreneurial and digital skills in higher education, and boost curricula adjustments.

1. Introduction
Digitalization is one of the innovative results of recent Industry 4.0 developments improving quality of life, increasing 
the productivity of labor. Although it requires much-needed investments and economic prosperity, companies are 
eager to adapt digitalization and make the associated changes in their working environment to increase their 
competitiveness. Digitalization results with change of workforce structure and their qualified requirements. Namely, 
new jobs are to appear while some others are to disappear (WEF Report 2016, 2018). Employees will therefore, have 
to adapt their skills to keep pace as well as to develop new skills and meet new challenges. With the recent Industry 
4.0 technological developments, employees are to be replaced by automation (e.g. robots, Artificial Intelligence 
implementations) resulting with decreased number of employees in the working environments. This development will 
not only lead to a reduction in the number of employees but also, it is expected that there will be a shift towards higher 
quality and more intellectuality in employee structure. Specialist knowledge, self-management and creativity are 
estimated properties to increase for employee demand than ever, contributing to lifelong learning through continuous 
professional development. This employee structure is becoming the key success for businesses to remain competitive

By integrating in the digital teaching resources, it has become possible to measure and trace the student learning levels 
in real time and allow students and professors to adapt their behavior based on the outcomes. This method is usually 
referred to as data analytics or predictive analytics powered by the information bites being created in classrooms every 
minute of the day.  
 
By collecting and analyzing data about student performances, more personalized advising and course delivery could 
be managed. The science behind these advising systems is the same one that drives the algorithms developed for 
customers to better appeal to their buying habits recommending music on Spotify and movies on Netflix. For example, 
by this approach colleges will know that a student who does not do well in statistics during his or her freshman year 
is not likely to finish a degree in economics. For instance, Stanford University’s, the Open Learning Initiative’s (OLI) 
offers innovative online blended courses to anyone who wants to learn or teach (http://oli.stanford.edu).  Their goal is 
to create high-quality courses and contribute original research to improve learning and transform higher education. 
The OLI involves data analytics in it as well. 
 
In a recent trend, new generation of students tend to create their online learning paths by ignoring passive lecture 
classes following the “sage on the stage. Instead, the future is unfolding on campuses such as the University of 
Michigan and Case Western Reserve University where professors already track how often and for how long students 
watch videos in “flipped classrooms”. They also track which parts of the lecture might be causing them difficulty. 
 
Conclusion 
 
In this work, we aim to provide a study to address how the future of higher education should be towards the recent 
Industry 4.0 developments. Although we aim this work to be specifically focusing on engineering faculties, the content 
provided would also be valid for any faculties of higher education. We present the future of higher education from 
two perspectives by considering, the skills that the students should gain during their higher education, and the new 
methods and technologies to be utilized in a student-oriented education. We present what the technological trends in 
education as well as how the universities are required to integrate the new, innovative and multidisciplinary 
approaches in teaching and, how to stimulate entrepreneurial and digital skills in higher education, and boost curricula 
adjustments.

Abstract 
The Manufacturing sector is considered to be an engine of economic growth for most of the developing nations. At 
the same time, issues related to environmental sustainability cannot be ignored. Therefore, every aspect of 
manufacturing activities needs to play its part in ensuring the sustainability of overall manufacturing. To ensure, 
optimal use of manufacturing facilities, the use of maintenance function is very important. Most of the time, 
maintenance is considered to be a reactive function. It does not find many places in sustainability-related discussions 
of manufacturing. It is found that world-class organisations have started considering maintenance as a strategic 
activity. It is expected that maintenance management will find a place like quality management. When maintenance 
is to be strategic/ proactive function, it requires to be performed in sync with sustainability aspects. Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM) is a futuristic maintenance strategy that will give a holistic concept of strategic maintenance. The 
performance of organisations on TPM can be evaluated using Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Research has 
suggested that OEE is not sufficient to capture the sustainability aspects of maintenance. This study has proposed a 
concept of Green TPM, which can take care of sustainability and maintenance simultaneously. Maintenance activities 
may release hazardous chemicals, defected/ unrepairable spare parts, and other components that can negatively impact 
the environment. This paper explains the concept of Green TPM as a future-oriented vision that follows the philosophy 
of customer-orientation, environmental concern, mass production with customization and sustainability. It is an 
integrated approach that covers elements like green training, green maintenance, and green lean six sigma. This 
approach is not only helpful in achieving higher manufacturing performance but also environmental performance. 
Keywords- Green TPM, Maintenance, OEE, Sustainability, TPM.
1. Introduction
The manufacturing sector is facing a lot of turbulence in its field because of the global market changes, which creates 
significant attention towards the process capability and better machine functionality to achieve the less process 
variation and high quality. These features have created special attention to regain the original performance of the 
machine to get better production demands to honour the commitments. Performances of machines are not 
insurmountable, and it affected as the machine comes in use but depends on the type of use. So maintenance comes in 
the picture to restore and repair the original performance of the machines to get the desired output in a certain period. 
But maintenance timing is a big problem, means it is always a debatable question that the maintenance should be 
before or after the damage.   
Breakdown maintenance versus preventive maintenance, the debate has gone much beyond, and now people have also 
started looking maintenance from the strategic point of view, and the concept of TPM is developed for strategic 
management perspective, but it is again limited only to the manufacturing aspect like shop floor activities, which 
explore the better output at the shop floor. 
TPM has given a suitable playground to maintenance to play an essential role in making a better organisation in terms 
of profit and competition. It also used as a valuable weapon for other quality philosophies like lean manufacturing and 
total quality management (TQM) to achieve the different functional priorities (Ahuja and Khamba 2008).   
Linking this with the broader issues related to sustainability will give more impetus to maintenance activities in the 
organisations. Now only professionally managed organisations are looking for TPM type of concepts. In India, over 
some time, there is a good amount of increase in organisations adopting TPM philosophy, they are getting more and

 
It will lead towards the outcomes such as zero rework, zero accident, zero discharge, zero pollution, less 
energy consumption, and other green outcomes. 
 
These outcomes will help to achieve economic development because of the right use of resources and 
customer satisfaction. 
 
This economic prosperity of the organisation will help to achieve the social developments of the organisation 
by using green training and other pillars. 
  
This way, it leads towards all the three main dimensions of sustainability as per the TBL’s approach with the help of 
green TPM framework. 
 
3. Conclusions 
The conventional competitiveness is determined on your abilities to offer a superior quality product at low cost with 
faster deliveries. With more aware customers, the expectations are now moving into intangible aspects, particularly 
environment-related issues. The focus of maintenance has chased from a cost centre to strategic investment activity 
but adding ‘green’ aspect will help an organisation to achieve sustainability through green TPM. The efforts of 
different functional areas to help in achieving sustainability will create a more synergistic environment in the 
organisation. This synergy will be a very important enabler for competitiveness in coming times. 
There will be a continuous requirement of spreading this synergy from internal-organisation level to inter-organisation 
level. The conventional TPM will be scaled up to green TPM using some of the green pillars coming from different 
functional aspects. This GTPM will open the door of economic, environmental, and social sustainabilities and this 
will become an important enabler for the competitiveness of the organisations in a period which is characterised by 
very frequent change of product designs, frequent change of jigs and fixtures, and frequent change of dies etc. 
4. Limitations and Future Scope 
This framework is being proposed on the basis of literature review and experts survey. So there is the future scope of 
the study to empirically validate the proposed framework. In this proposed framework, it is possible to have a few 
case studies as well as data collection from different organisations.

Abstract 
Traditional shipyards in Indonesia have produced lots of wooden fishing boats in various gross tonnage sizes. 
Efficiency in material costs has been concerned for creating competitive advantage. However, traditional shipyards 
encounter various barriers in developing sustainable supply chain. In this study, we investigate the barriers and 
enablers experienced by traditional shipyards when developing sustainable supply chain by using Analytical 
Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that the top five barrier factors are lack of information, fund constraints, 
high cost, and lack of visual and statistical control during green lean implementation, and poor quality of human 
resources. On the other hand, the top five enabler factors are risk mitigation, top management commitment and 
support, monitoring and auditing supply chain partners, availability of financial support, and recognition. By 
incorporating the sustainable supply chain principles into the traditional shipyards’ business models, the owners 
agree that the recognition of environmentally friendly shipyards can increase their sales growth and reputation

1. Introduction
East Java province in Indonesia is set by government as one of shipbuilding industrial cluster.  Most of
fishermen build the wooden fishing boat. The supply chain of material used in the traditional shipyard has a critical 
role for developing sustainability. To the best of our knowledge, the sustainable supply chain in these traditional 
shipyards has not been studied. 
Sustainable supply chain has become a challenge for the competitive advantages. Sustainability consists of 
economics, environment, and social benefits. In economics sector, there are financial benefits in the production 
process. In environment sector, there is an environmental friendly for greening the production ones. Meanwhile in 
social sector, there is a specific intervention to improve social well-being (Rizos et al. 2019, Miemczyk and Luzzini 
2017). 
In developing sustainable supply chain, there are barriers and enablers for the implementation. We review some 
literatures about those barriers and enablers from Rizos et al. (2016), Cherrafi, et. al. (2017), Piyathanavong et. al. 
(2019), and Kumar and Rahman (2017). Subsequently, we explore the traditional shipyards in building traditional 
fishing boats using those barriers and enablers. In this study, we aim to prioritize and analyze the barriers and 
enablers of sustainable supply chain in building the traditional fishing boats in East Java province, Indonesia. We

Based on the Table 4, there are top five enabler factors consisting of risk mitigation, top management 
commitment and support, monitoring and auditing supply chain partners, availability of financial support, and 
recognition. In mitigating risk, most of the traditional shipyards conveyed the education on waste treatment 
management and working accident insurance. Besides, the support and direction from the top management is very 
important to implement the environmentally friendly production process. In monitoring and auditing supply chain 
partners, all the traditional shipyards will evaluate the wooden supplier. If the wood quality does not meet their 
requirement, they will bargain the price or change to other supplier. Moreover, all the traditional shipyards have 
financial support availability, but some of them are reluctant to modernize the devices to support the greening 
production process. Meanwhile, they all agree that recognition of the society as environmentally friendly traditional 
shipyard affects to the sales growth and organization’s reputation. By greening production process, the number of 
wooden needed is very efficient.  
 
5. Conclusions 
We have discussed the barrier and enabler factors for developing sustainable supply chain at traditional 
shipyards in Indonesia. By using AHP method, we found out that the top five barrier factors are lack of information, 
fund constraints, high cost, lack of visual and statistical control during green lean implementation, and poor quality 
of human resources. Meanwhile, the top five enabler factors are risk mitigation, top management commitment and 
support, monitoring and auditing supply chain partners, availability of financial support, and recognition. The 
insights derived from the barrier factors are most the traditional shipyards invest on wooden logs to anticipate the 
fund constraints and increasing material price. Furthermore, the intelligent quotient of workers and the number of 
training are important to master in all fishing boat building activities. On the other hand, the insights from the 
enabler factors are that the support and commitment from top management to implement the environmentally 
friendly production process is very necessary. Moreover, the traditional shipyards owners agree that the recognition 
of environmentally friendly shipyards can increase their sales growth and reputation. This is because the number of 
wooden material consumed will be less as the shipyards implement the greening production process. Future research 
can be done by modeling the industrial ecosystem of wooden fishing boat building.

Abstract 
Sidoarjo regency regional regulation number 6 of 2009 concerning Sidoarjo Regency Spatial Planning 2009 
- 2029, Sedati sub-district is included in: (1) Rural areas; (2) residential residential areas; (3) Small Urban;
(4) SSWP I, with the main function of Settlement, Industry and Trade on a local, regional and international
scale; (5) SSWP V, with the main function of fisheries cultivation and tourism areas; (6) Industrial zones;
(7) natural coastal tourism area; (8) residential housing areas; (9) Use of Area Mix, with a composition of
40% housing (50% built and 50% open space), 20% industry (50% built and 50% open space); Services
and Trade 35% (60% built and 40% open space), and 5% warehousing (50% built and 50% open space).
Industries that are approved to be developed in this region are only industries that support the agricultural
industry; (9) Coastal Strategic Areas; (10) People's port development program. Based on Sidoarjo Regency
Regional Regulation Number 6 of 2009, then at a macro level, Sedati sub-district was developed into a
residential, industrial, service and trade and warehousing area. In Sedati sub-district, the contribution of
land use is ponds / ponds with an area of 3646.09 ha (2013) due to the number of residents who use work
as fishermen, increased land use for settlements and ponds / ponds, so participation in the transfer of land
use can be used for ponds, which is expected to help flood. robbed, with the village with the least amount
of inundation was Banjar Kemuning with an area of 145.89 ha, while the land use area was ponds and
settlements. Banjar Kemuning Village, as part of Sedati Subdistrict, Sidoarjo Regency is one of the villages
in the coastal area, with a northern boundary. The village of Segoro Tambak, the eastern boundary of the
Madura Strait, the southern border of Juanda (AL) which is currently used for the Juanda airport. Utilization
of marine products has become a daily activity of the community in the village of Banjar Kemuning.
Catching activities that continue to be carried out unwittingly have an impact on fishery resources that have
a decrease in catches. In the past 50 years there have been changes in catches and changes in the size of
shellfish. Fishery Capture Results Decreased in 2014-2015 compared to the previous year. Famine season
makes fishermen switch to fish and shrimp. In the past fishermen could get 1 (one) ton of shells every day,
but now 100 kg is the most and the size is smaller than what has been taken. Shellfish resources will occur
due to uncontrolled capture. Banjar Kemuning Village has a coastal tourism potential, with boat access to
the Eduekowisata Sea. Potential access to tourism and its coastal rivers as well as a variety of processed
processed yellow mussels are the leading economic tourism destinations in the village of Banjar Kemuning.
The decline in marine products has an impact on the decline in fisheries yield, so a new business strategy
is needed for the Banjar Kemuning village community. The change of land use change from the pond or
pool area to the settlement area will directly affect the economic level of the Banjar Kemuning community,

Abstract 
Sidoarjo Regency is an area in East Java with an area of 714.24 km2. Having a very strategic position, 
bordering Surabaya as the second metropolitan city in Indonesia, Sidoarjo has a positive impact on the 
growth of its region (sidoarjokab.go.id). Banjar Kemuning Village Sedati District Sidoarjo Regency is one 
of the villages in the coastal area. Utilization of marine products has become a daily activity of the people

1 INTRODUCTION 
The Sidoarjo Regency fishery sector relies on shrimp and milkfish as superior commodities which are used as the 
mascot of Sidoarjo Regency. Of the total aquaculture production in Sidoarjo Regency, the production of these two 
commodities reaches more than 85% and around 70% is milkfish production. The number of Sidoarjo pond farmers 
reached 3,227 people with a total area of 15,530 hectares. Most areas have milkfish ponds, one of which is in Banjar 
Kemuning Village, Sedati District, Sidoarjo Regency (wpi.kkp.go.id). The total milkfish production in Sidoarjo in 
2009 reached 16.03 thousand tons, up 1.13% compared to the previous year. In 2010, production of tiger shrimp and 
milkfish cultivation in Sidoarjo increased despite weather anomalies. The production of milkfish in Sidoarjo in 2010 
increased to 19,839 tons, while shrimp production in 2010 jumped to 3,725 tons from 3,465 tons (wpi.kkp.go.id).

the factors causing the decline in catches of fishermen. Solarcells portable freezer technology product is a means of 
processing and or preserving fisheries production, especially in the freezing process, can increase economic added 
value that can be enjoyed by fisheries businesses in the region, in the form of fisheries commodity price stabilizers 
and contributors in reducing unemployment through labor absorption work. The existence and operation of Freezers 
is believed to be able to create various job opportunities such as traders, laborers and employees. Freezer is one of the 
supporting tools that serves as a storage area for fishermen's catches in order to maintain the quality of the catch. 
Freezer viewed from the function and use has an important role to maintain the quality of the catch of fishermen before 
finally being distributed to consumers, so the role of Cold Storage can also keep the selling price of fishermen's catches 
do not decrease when the catch is declining.

Abstract 
Market demand changes have led to the emergence of cloud ERP solutions that have become the growing trend nowadays 
as that they bring new processing capabilities without making significant changes in the existing system. But it alone does 
not provide businesses with all necessary and best functionalities as different businesses have different requirements. So, 
integrating multiple best-of-breed applications with cloud to build or fortify a near-custom ERP will automate processes 
and increase revenue for the business. A survey done by AMR research with 639 companies on integration requirements 
of SaaS customers shows that 70% of the companies expect to integrate their on-premises legacy applications to the SaaS 
solution. Also, states that application integration strategy will play the key role in post-modern ERP market. Though 
integration has been around for over a decade and there are many integration approaches between the two systems, they 
result in a brittle environment and a progressively more complex architecture as new integrations are added over time. 
This study analyses whether technological integration, business integration and socio-organizational integration affect 
the successful integration and aims to develop a model based on the findings for successful integration.

1. Introduction
1.1. Research Background
So far implementing an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system was seen as a strategic capital investment. The 
demand for better IT solutions for a business keeps changing as it grows. As the market demand changes there will be 
a change in enterprise solution. This evolution led to the emergence post-modern ERP era. “Post-modern ERP is a 
situation where companies abandon the traditional practice of using single, monolithic ERP platforms for several 
unique tasks and instead adopt a collection of individual standalone programs” (www.gartner.com). It’s described as 
a “loosely coupled decentralization” of traditional ERP suite systems by experts. In recent years, large enterprises 
have been benefiting from transitioning some of their application portfolios to computing clouds and integrating their 
applications due to the fact that they bring new processing capabilities without making significant changes in the 
existing system. Cloud ERP uses SaaS (Software as a Service) Concept. Though the complete transition from a 
conventional system to a cloud system is successful, business wise, it’s a hard decision to make. Also, complete 
transition from on-premises system to Cloud services does not provide businesses with all necessary functionalities 
as the necessities of different businesses differ. So, integrating multiple best-of-breed applications with cloud to build 
or fortify a near-custom ERP will automate processes and increase revenue for the business. Also, businesses will be 
able to select what they actually need instead of going for a whole package. This integration concept breaks the idea 
that you should have one product for all operations and that a business should get all of its enterprise gear from the

Abstract 
The supply chain is among the factors that have contributed in climate change, whether through the 
set of environmental impacts resulting from its activities of transport, manufacturing, distribution 
etc., and due to the enormous number of worldwide companies, which continues to increase, and 
which involves further negative impact on the environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide 
the researcher and decision maker with a set of good practices of green supply chain modeling, and 
some discussions. Indeed, many scholars have carried out theoretical studies in this sense, by dealing 
with a set of methods and tools; but have not provided an overview of the best practices to be taken 
into consideration in order to achieve optimal modeling. The proposed framework is the focus of 
analysis in this paper. Firstly, this paper proposes a brief literature review on the main keywords of 
this paper, then at the end a conclusion with some direction for future research.

Environment, green, supply chain, good practices, modeling. 
1. Introduction
Currently, logistics has become a major concern for the entire process of a company, due to its primordial role 
throughout the main phases: procurement, production, and distribution. The modeling of a supply chain (SC) is 
one of the main lines of supply chain (SC) topic research. ""Modeling is a process of representation which 
allows obtaining an approximate image of real system following an abstraction phase. This process facilitates 
the study and understanding of systems ""(Labarthe O., 2006).. Many literature reviews on green supply chain 
modeling (GSCM) have been conducted as part of some research work (Soda, S., Sachdeva, A., Garg, R.K., 
2016), (Govindan, K et al, 2015). Furthermore, when it comes to modeling the green supply chain (SC), a set of 
elements could be introduced such as cleaner production, waste minimization and recovery, recycling (reverse 
logistics), and green purchasing, etc., also improving environmental performance (Ming K. et al, 2017). 
This present work consists first of all in establishing a summery literature review showing the evolution of 
research in the supply chain (SC) modeling area, then a general framework providing some good practices for 
modeling the green supply chains (SC), and lastly a conclusion with directions for future research.
2. Insights of Green Supply Chain Modelling
For a company, SC modeling could be considered as a set of methods and tools to be integrated into all or 
certain activities, such a way to improve performance and efficiency or solve problems, as well as the 
availability of necessary resources. Then, the environmental aspect further complicated the modeling of SC 
given the difficulty of integrating it on the one hand, and the enormous environmental constraints resulting 
from the SC on the other hand. Different models of GSCM are proposed in literature (Ghadimi, P., Wang, C., 
Lim, M., 2019), with the aim to identify problems, control processes and provide solutions, especially problem 
related to environmental issue, in particular reduction of carbon emission and its cost, (Hariga, M., As’ ad, R., 
Shamayleh, A, 2017) propose to minimize carbon emission, operational cost, as well as environmental pollution

The relationship with suppliers has a direct impact on the SC, in terms of requirements and contracts, therefore 
it is important to ensure that this relationship is based on agreements regarding the environmental axis, the 
same for customer.as the last process of the SC, distribution must also comply with environmental 
requirements, in order to achieve an ideally green product delivery, as suggested in figure 2, transport, 
packaging, storage site are the main elements to be taken into account, as well as being in compliance with  
customer expectations and regulation.

different aims, also a set of good practices of green supply chain proposed in literature. Then a general 
framework is proposed, providing some good practices for green supply chain modeling, based on a set of 
tools and approaches of proposed models, also modeling perspectives according to some areas. We suggest as 
future works: 
• 
To focus on the standardization of green supply chain modeling, regardless of the type of the studied 
supply chain, or the used method; 
• 
To carry out more studies that combine the two dimensions sustainability and greenness.

Abstract 
There is a need to integrate the information systems and also organizational activities of the supply 
chain among the supply chain partners for collective and effective coordination. However, so far 
research in supply chain integration has paid little observation in identifying and developing a 
migration path to know the present position of integration among the supply chain members. 
Therefore the objective of the paper is to evolve a framework for supply chain integration. In the 
proposed research, the informational, organizational and information technology integration is 
operationalized for the evolution of Supply Chain Integration framework for manufacturing 
industries. Developed framework for supply chain integration is validated through a pilot study to 
help the organizations to know the present level and provides a migration path to move to the next 
level of supply chain integration. Present work builds on to the authors who have set forth study in 
the domain of supply chain integration.

1. Introduction
The term “supply chain”, “supply chain management” (SCM), “supply chain integration (SCI)” is not well-
explained constructs. They differ in meaning for many people in different way (Bagchi et al., 2005). Supply chain is 
explained as sequences linking every element from customer and supplier between manufacturing and services so as 
to constructively supervise the flow of material, money and information to cater the needs of enterprises (Pramod 
Shahabadkar, 2012).  SCM has grown as a solution to every industry to enhance the productivity beyond the 
organization’s boundary (Eyaa et al., 2010). The normal insight in most SCM writings is that the additional 
integration will contribute to enhanced performance of the supply chains (Bagchi et al. 2005). The contemporary 
organizations emphasizes that the competition is not between the companies but it is between their supply chains 
(Power, 2005, Handfield et al., 1999, Singh, 2011). In an integrated supply chain, the complete activities covering 
the supply chain is devised as a unit (Lee, 2000). Supply chain integration (SCI) defined as the scope and strength of 
relationship of supply chain processes covering organizations. Supply chain integration is   generally complex 
involving management of individual flows and poses interesting challenges for effective integration (Singh, 2011). 
Supply chain integration (SCI) is simplified by information, operational and relational integration. SCI can be a 
convincing behavioral answer to a few uncertainties, by assisting indirect relations that help cooperating, 
interrelating and steering materials and information (Wong et al., 2015) among members of a supply chain to evolve 
the potentiality to acknowledge to swiftly changing environments. In this context, integration of a supply chain is a 
working idea for integration of supply chain members for improving system profit and responsiveness (Singh, 2011). 
To achieve seamless and boundary-less flows, supply chain partners need to work so as to achieve a united structure 
(Mentzer et al., 2001). When supply chain partners are distinct and individual economic institutions, this plan of 
action has to cover framework for migration path for their integration (Bagchi et al. 2005, Narasimhan et al., 2002). 
Here is a direct correlation connecting organization association and organizational accomplishment (Pandiyan et al., 
2016).

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, an effort is made for developing a migration path as tabled in table1, 2 and 3 and to define new term 
supply chain integration index for identifying the level of supply chain integration in the manufacturing industries as 
Tabled in 4, 5 and 6. Surely many researchers will question its generalization and elements considered here in this 
study.  With marginal changes in the elements and variables detailed in the Table 1, 2 and 3, developed migration 
path   can be used to know the state of integration of a supply chain.  Future research should focus on implementing 
this migration path in the manufacturing industries. So, developed migration path should be operationalized for 
different types of industries like: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Auto Component Manufacturers etc.  
We believe a larger study should be carried out and compared with our work to obtain better understanding of 
supply chain integration index and migration path for SCI.

Abstract
This paper presents the multi-objective optimization aspects of a supply chain with multi-product, multi-
supplier system. The three objectives considered in this work are: minimization of the total cost of the
supply chain, maximization of total quality level of supply chain, and maximization of service level of
supply chain through optimum allocation of the order quantity of each product to each buyer. Various
practical constraints such as product demand, shortage prevention, supply capacity of the supplier, and
available storage space of the supplier are also considered. The optimization is carried out using a recently
developed optimization method known as teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO). The results of
optimization are compared with those obtained by genetic algorithm (GA).

1. Introduction
The operational issues of a supply chain include determination of sales quantity, transportation cost, quantity discount,
production capacity, storage capacity, starting-operation quantity, total service level, total quality level, and the system
costs including purchasing cost, holding cost, and cost due to shortages. To assure that customer demand can be
satisfied without delays, it is necessary to keep inventory in the supply chain, which helps to absorb the impact of
random events. A stream of research has emerged in recent years aiming at the coordination of inventory
replenishment decisions among individual companies to benefit the entire supply network by reducing the total cost
of the system. The integrated supply chain models used to coordinate the supply chain system with multiple buyers
and multiple vendors is usually a multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming problems. Due to the complex
nature of this problem and to overcome the drawbacks of traditional optimization methods, researchers are employing
various meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithm (Liao and Rittscher, 2007; Pasandideh, 2010; Liao and Lai, 2011),
particle swarm optimization (Yang and Lin, 2010; Sue-Anna et al., 2012; Taleizadeh et al., 2012; Che, 2012;
Kedadevaramath et al. 2012; ),  ant colony optimization (Arora et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2018), memetic algorithm
(Pishvaee et al., 2010),  bacterial foraging optimization (Niu et al., 2019; Sinha and Anand, 2019), artificial bee colony
algorithm (Zhang et al., 2019), biogeography based optimization (Yang et al., 2015; Yang and Liu, 2017), harmony
search algorithm (Pawar and Nandurkar, 2018), firefly algorithm (Khalifehzadeh and Fakhrzad, 2019) to solve this
problem.
However, the major difficulty in application of these algorithms lies in their selection of appropriate
algorithm-specific parameters such as crossover probability, mutation probability, scaling function, selection function,
etc. in case of GA; inertia coefficient and acceleration coefficients in case of PSO; and harmony memory consideration
rate and pitch adjusting rate in case of HS algorithm etc. The performance of all the above mentioned algorithms is
greatly influenced by their respective algorithm-specific parameters in addition to the common control parameters
such as population size and number of generations. Selection of suitable values of these algorithm-specific parameters
for a particular application is itself is a complex optimization problem. To overcome this drawback of existing

It is observed from the results that all specified constraints are well satisfied by the results obtained by using TLBO.
It can be seen from Table 5, that the quantity ordered for all products is more than their respective demands mentioned
in Table 3. For example, for the first product the demand in period 1 is 454 and the quantity ordered for product 1
from all suppliers in period 1 is 544. Similarly the demand for product 2 in period 1 is 327 and quantity ordered for
product 2 from all suppliers in period 1 is 442. Also since the service levels are less than 1, although the ordered
quantities seems to be more than the actual demand, considering the specified service levels and service level growth
rate, actual quantities received are exactly same as that of demand. For example, for product 1 in period 1, the demand
is 454, the quantity ordered is 544 but considering the service levels and service level growth rate and using Eq. (11),
the actual quality received is 454 only. Thus the inventory level for product 1 at the end is zero. Similar results can
also be observed from Table 5 for all other products for each period of time. This clearly indicated that the constraint
on end of planning inventory is well satisfied. Moreover, since the quantity received for each product in given period
is exactly same as that of its demand for that period (dit) as mentioned in Table 1, there is no shortage. Moreover, as
the supply and demand are exactly matching, it is just in time strategy making the inventory holding cost and  floor
space requirement is also theoretically zero. The product-wise supplier capacity (Cij) is provided in Table 3. For
example, the supplier 1 can supply maximum 550 quantity of product 1, 570 of product 2, and 825 of product 3. It can
be seen from Table 5 that the sum of all quantities ordered from supplier 1 during all 4 time periods for products 1, 2
and 3 are 549, 569, and 805 respectively, which are less than their supply capacities. Similar results are obtained for
all other suppliers also. Thus, the constraint of supplier capacity is also well satisfied.
6.
Conclusion
In the present work, optimization aspects of supply chain with multi-product, multi-supplier system are considered.
The three objectives considered in this work are: minimization of the total cost of the supply chain, maximization of
total quality level of supply chain, and maximization of service level of supply chain through optimum allocation of
the order quantity of each product to each supplier while maintaining the constraints of product demand, shortage
prevention, supply capacity of the supplier, and available storage space of the supplier. The mixed integer non-linear
supply chain model is considered. It is observed that the results obtained by proposed TLBO algorithm are superior
to those obtained using GA. This is mainly due to the fact that TLBO uses the best solution of the iteration to modify
the existing solution as in PSO and it does not divide the population as in case of ABC.

Abstract 
The road infrastructure being the backbone of the transport system serves as a connection between the 
populace. This keeps the economy of the country flowing thereby establishing a crucial constituent of the 
economic, environmental and social well-being. To understand the approaches to estimating for road 
projects in the construction industry, this study reviewed extant literature using articles downloaded from 
SCOPUS database. It was established from extant literature that estimating for construction project is done 
to ascertain the likely required cost and also to ascertain the likely required time to execute the project. 
These estimates inform the project team on the financial implications of inputs made to proposed projects, 
thereby allowing for proper budgeting and cost control depending on the phase of construction. Reviewed 
literature revealed that categories of construction estimates are preliminary estimates, definitive estimates 
and detailed estimates while methods of estimating include subjective estimating, parametric estimating, 
comparative estimating, and analytical estimating. Analytical estimating was adjudged the most accurate 
of the four methods of estimating. It was therefore concluded that analytical estimating should be adopted 
for road projects to achieve the desired accuracy.

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the major assets of a country is a road network as it gives both social and economic benefits to individuals, 
groups of people and the whole country at large. The road infrastructure being the backbone of the transport system 
serves as a connection between the populace. This keeps the economy of the country flowing thereby establishing a 
crucial constituent of the economic, environmental and social well-being. Road infrastructure is important because it 
is the most prevalent means of transportation of goods, people and services from the origin location to the preferred 
location having a single benefit of an added time and value chain. Road networks help over half of the people in the 
world especially in the urban areas which are the centres for business and many other socio-economic activities 
(Forster and Mensah, 2013; Fragkakis, Marinelli and Lambropoulos, 2015). Fragkakis, Marinelli and Lambropoulos 
(2015) opined that transport infrastructure is central to modern-day living by providing means of mobility for 
travelling to work, businesses, leisure and also for moving materials and goods. As the backbone of the transport 
system, road infrastructure serves as a connection between the populace while keeping the economy of the country

arrived at for the proposed infrastructure. However, allowance must be made to cater for some inevitable differences 
such as the time factor of money, geographical location, availability and the proximity to necessary materials for the 
project, among others. In carrying out estimation using this method, the estimator compares salient features of the 
executed project to determine the cost of the proposed project (Lester, 2006; Ogungbile, Oke and Rasak, 2018). 
 
4.4 Analytical cost-estimating 
This method is applicable when the project has been approved for execution on site. Necessary details and information 
concerning the project must be made available for analytical cost-estimating to be carried out which is why it is the 
most accurate of all the estimating methods (Lester, 2006). The infrastructure is reduced to small divisions, 
subdivisions and individual component with each of the components being apportioned the appropriate cost. These 
are then added up to make the total construction cost (Ogungbile, Oke and Rasak, 2018).  
 
5. LESSONS LEARNT AND CONCLUSION 
It has been indicated that estimating for construction project is done to ascertain the likely required cost and also to 
ascertain the likely required time to execute the project. In project management, estimating is considered an essential 
part as it serves as the benchmark for cost control during the project execution phase. These estimates inform the 
project team on the financial implications of inputs made to proposed projects, thereby allowing for proper budgeting 
and cost control depending on the phase of construction. Also, estimates serve three purposes in the construction 
industry. Firstly, at the early phases of a construction project when an estimate of the projected cost is needed so that 
the financial feasibility of the project can be determined. Secondly, once the construction starts, the preliminary 
estimate serves as a benchmark for identifying deficiencies and the contractor taking corrective actions in order to 
sustain profit margins. Thirdly, winning a bid is based on the estimate prepared for the project for the purpose of 
openness. Categories of construction estimates were identified to be preliminary estimates, definitive estimates and 
detailed estimates while methods of estimating include subjective, comparative, parametric, and analytical estimating. 
Analytical estimating was adjudged the most accurate of the four methods of estimating. 
From the reviewed literature, it is concluded that estimation in the construction industry is essential as it serves as the 
benchmark for cost control while executing the project. It informs the project team on the financial implications of 
inputs made to proposed projects which allow for proper budgeting and cost control depending on the phase of 
construction.

Abstract 
The sugar producing industry generates tons of bagasse as a waste product. This bagasse has the 
potential to be converted to bio char. In this study, sugarcane bagasse was converted to bio char at 600 
◦C for 3 hours and a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min using the pyrolysis technology. A bio char yield of 75%
was achieved with a surface area of 500 m2/g and a particle size of <2mm. The bio char was used as an
adsorbent media in sugarcane wastewater and the changes in the pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD),
chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (Tot-N), total phosphate (Tot-P) and the total solids
(TS) were monitored using standard methods. Application of the bagasse based bio char in sugarcane
wastewater treatment resulted in the significant reduction of BOD, COD, Tot-N, Tot-P and TS by
85.1%, 84.8%, 74.8%, 76.5% and 84.7% respectively.

4. Conclusion 
Sugarcane bagasse is a good raw material for bio char production. The bio char produced had good porosity and 
surface area of 500 m2/g which makes it useful as a bio adsorbent. Application of the bagasse based bio char in 
sugar cane wastewater treatment resulted in significant decrease in BOD, COD, TS, Tot-P and Tot-N by more 
than 70%. The bagasse based bio char had good adsorption properties essential in sugar wastewater treatment.

Abstract 
The increasing complexity of most industrial processes always tends to create problems in monitoring and 
supervision systems. Detection and early fault diagnosis are the best way to manage and solve these problems. 
Artificial neural networks (ANNs), by their ability to learn and store a large volume of information, are tools 
particularly suitable for diagnostic support systems. Effectiveness of ANNs for fault diagnosis in  milk 
pasteurization process is presented in this paper. The initial data base used for fault diagnosis is constructed 
using data extracted from FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) tables of milk pasteurization process. 
Indeed, this analysis makes it possible to establish the links of cause and effect between the faulty components 
and the observed symptoms. Three models of ANNs, namely Feed-Forward Back Propagation (FFBP), Radial 
Basis Function based Neural Network (RBNN), and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) are 
developed and compared. The determination coefficient (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean 
Absolute Error (MAE) statistics were used as evaluation criteria of all the models. The comparison results 
indicate that the performances of GRNN model are better than the FFBP and RBNN models. The same neuronal 
models can be extended to any technical system by considering appropriate parameters and defects.

1. Introduction 
The problem of detecting and diagnosing faults in complex industrial plants is strategically important for its 
various implications, e.g., avoiding breakdowns that can lead to major industrial disasters, problems related to 
the workers and plants safety, fast and appropriate response to emergency situations and plant maintenance. For 
example, the following systems represent only a small part of systems where fault detection and diagnosis are 
usually a very difficult but important tasks: chemical and petrochemical plants, refineries, power plants, 
airplanes, ships, submarines, space vehicles and space stations, automobiles and household appliances. 
Generally, in industrial plants, there is a crucial need for checking and monitoring the equipment condition 
precisely since they are mostly subject to hazardous environments, such as severe shocks, vibration, heat, 
friction, etc. So fault detection, fault identification and diagnosis of equipments, machineries and systems have 
become a vigorous area of work. Due to the broad scope of the process fault diagnosis problem and the 
difficulties in its real-time solution, many analytical-based techniques (Isermann ,1997; Leonhardt and Ayoubi, 
1997) have been proposed during the past several years for the fault detection of technical plants. The important 
aspect of these approaches is the development of a model that describes the ‗cause and effect‘ relationships 
between the system variables using state estimation or parameter estimation techniques. 
The problem with these mathematical model-based techniques is that under real conditions, no accurate models 
of the system of interest can be obtained. In that case, the better strategy is of using knowledge-based techniques 
where the knowledge is derived in terms of facts and rules from the description of system structure and behavior  
(Rajakarunakaran et al., 2008). Classical expert systems were used for this purpose. The major weakness of this 
approach is that binary logical decisions with Boolean operators do not reflect the gradual nature of many real 
world problems. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence, Computational Intelligence (CI) 
methods, Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), etc., more and more fault 
diagnostic approaches have emerged as new techniques for fault diagnostic systems (Venkatasubramanian et al., 
2003; Patton et al., 2000) .  
Artificial neural networks, by their ability to learn and store a large volume of information, are tools particularly 
suitable for diagnostic support systems. Neural networks are known to approximate any non-linear function,

Abstract 
Market competition is fierce and has been intensified due to globalization, therefore companies have 
experienced increase pressure to improve cycle and delivery times and achieve a high level of 
customization. Lean principles have been designed and implemented to respond to market changes. 
However, these principles are commonly aimed to aid low-mix high-volume (LMHV) manufacturers. This 
paper aims to develop a systematic approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume 
(HMLV) manufacturing environment. An HMLV manufacturing environment, currently produces a variety 
of products which differs in terms of shape and size and different sequence of operation and as a much 
smaller batch size. Additionally, analysis of the manufacturing assembly shows there is a substantial 
variation in cycle and changeover time from product to product. In this approach, an action based study has 
been completed. This study uses data collection methods to be applied in order to calculate timings to be 
used in a Discrete Event Simulation (DES). The simulation uses lean tools to study material movement and 
facility layout to minimize bottlenecks and eliminate waste from the process. An introduction of lean 
supermarket is considered within the simulation whereby an operator withdraws products in an specific 
amount needed by a downstream process before introducing it across the assembly floor and an action plan 
is created. As a result, a lean manufacturing simulation study has been implemented to evaluate the effects 
of a supermarket concept within the current manufacturing environment. Initial results show a variation 
within the cycle and setup times for each of the different products due to the nature of the process. The 
paper, is limited to applying the approach to a singular production line and a singular manufacturing plant. 
The practical implications to implement this approach into a manufacturing environment is that there should 
be a need from the company. This approach should be driven by senior members within the organization 
as the resistance to change would increase the risk of failure. Another implication of the proposed approach 
is to ensure the accuracy of the data collected and to introduce a series of briefs within each stage of the 
approach. This is important as all stakeholders would need to be kept up-to-date with the project. However, 
the approach is applicable to any organization and can be applied to any sector. This paper, develops a 
systematic approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (HMLV) manufacturing 
environment. The approach is validated in an automotive manufacturing organization competing in global 
markets.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing is the key economic driver for growth and provides added value through the transformation of materials 
into products. Within the EU, manufacturing is responsible for 80%+ of exports and 80% of private research and 
innovation therefore it is one of the key elements of sustainable economic growth (European Union, 2015). Initially 
developed to minimize costs, lean manufacturing has been accepted as the philosophy for management and 
improvement of systems by significantly shifting the trade-off between productivity and quality. It has also led to

5. Conclusion 
This paper presents a lean approach in a high mix low volume manufacturing facility. This proposal 
includes arguments for and against the need to change from a single piece flow into a supermarket concept. 
This paper would show decision makers that by reducing the size of bottlenecks they may have to 
compromise on transportation and storage which could increase costs. Therefore, this paper will help them 
to be better informed to support decision in improving the manufacturing facility. The VSM is constructed 
by using the DMAIC improvement cycle and using stopwatch analysis to measure operators over a various 
shifts.   
 
The paper applies action research, gemba walk and process stapling to create a current value stream map. 
This would then need to be validated with stakeholders before introducing estimations to create a future 
state map that would include a supermarket concept.  
 
The paper applies action research to validate the proposed methodology in a British manufacturing 
organization competing in global markets. Thus, the analysis, development and validation of the 
current value stream map and analysis to change the layout into a supermarket is very beneficial. 
The process of using the supermarket concept to validate the benefits within the organization could 
be further enhanced: 
• Including of CAD software and Discrete event simulation 
• Running trials for various scenarios.  
• Further action research is needed to analyze and implement the methodology in other 
assembly lines and collecting data considering a longer period of time. 
• Validate the DES methodology with data collected from other assembly lines.  
• Create a detailed action plan for the implementation of improvements.

Abstract 
This paper identifies and measures the Lean readiness of the Azerbaijan construction industry. A survey 
questionnaire was utilised to evaluate the Lean readiness of this industry by measuring its quality practices 
and to test three hypotheses. The Lean readiness framework developed by Al-Najem et al. (2013) was taken 
as a basis for this study; however, there can also be seen some adaptations made from the framework 
developed by Diekmann et al. (2003).  The questionnaire was sent to 57 Azerbaijan construction companies, 
from where 20 responses were obtained. The results derived from the questionnaire showed that the 
Azerbaijan construction industry is not ready to implement the Lean methodology. It also found that there 
remains a lack of trust between employee and employer relations. Lastly, it is evident that the size of the 
companies does not play any considerable role on Lean readiness of construction companies and does not 
make any sense for choosing construction prerequisites. This study can be beneficial for those Azerbaijan 
construction companies that are interested in the implementation of Lean construction, or which are 
interested to increase their level of competitiveness.

1. Introduction
With its complex mixture of employees, materials, plant, new technologies and with covering a wide range of 
activities, the construction industry is one of the most difficult industries to understand (Capon, 1990). However, 
despite its complicated structure, the construction industry creates one of the most profitable areas of any country’s 
economy (Nuriyev, 2011). Thus, approximately 7.5% of all Azerbaijan economy consists of profits gained from this 
industry (Khalilzadeh, 2015). Nonetheless, in spite of its essential position in the country’s economy, the construction 
industry with its many prerequisites, e.g. preparation of construction areas, unnecessary payments, which appear 
409",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

between employee and employer relations. Furthermore, three hypotheses were developed and tested through both 
inferential and descriptive statistical analysis to support the research aim. It was found that the size of the company 
does not have any influence on the quality practices. Moreover, Azerbaijan construction companies do not distinguish 
on-site production from one-of-a-kind prerequisite for increasing their level of competitiveness. While measuring the 
Lean thinking level in Azerbaijan construction industry it also suggested to start with applying some simple Lean tools 
such as 5S, 5 Why’s and similar tools that can be easily utilised but can make a significant impact on operations. 
 
6.1 Practical Implications 
This study can be beneficial for the Azerbaijan construction companies that are interested in the implementation of 
Lean construction or who are interested to increase their level of competitiveness. The literature review, more precisely 
sections related to critical success factors and other quality management concepts, can also be very useful for those 
companies. Additionally, answers gained from survey results can also be a starting point to plan and improve their 
operations through the adoption of the Lean approach.  
 
6.2 Theoretical Implications 
This study points to the fact that existing frameworks to measure Lean readiness in the construction industry are 
lacking. It further adapts the framework developed by Al-Najem et al. (2013) as it best fits with the purpose of this 
study. Therefore, it will be right to say that this study will create a basis for further developments. Additionally, the 
results gained from the analysis of three hypotheses contradict with the survey results of other scholarly written 
papers/articles. This further emphasises the need for further development of research in this area.  
 
6.3 Limitations of the study 
Like most researches, this research has its limitations. One of the major limitations is the small number of respondents 
and that is mainly due to the lack of association/central network of the construction industry in Azerbaijan. Existence 
of such network would have facilitated this research by reaching out and collecting more data, as Tezel and Nielsen 
(2013) did through Turkish association of contractors. Thus, these research participants were approached individually, 
placing a time and resource constraint. Secondly, the unwillingness of companies is another limitation as only 20 out 
of 57 companies responded.  
 
6.4 Future Research 
Further research is highly recommended to further validate the outcomes of this study as well as to enrich the 
knowledge of existing weaknesses and by proposing solutions so the construction industry in Azerbaijan and in other 
similar economies could benefit.

Abstract 
This study investigates the potential to valorise woody biomass (saw dust) to make bio ethanol as a 
source of green and sustainable energy at the same time managing waste from the timber industry. A 
sample of 300 g of the saw dust was shredded and then pre-treated with steam at 105 ◦C for 10 minutes. 
This was followed by 1-3 v/v% H2SO4 acid hydrolysis at 90 ◦C for 30 minutes to obtain glucose. The 
glucose was then fermented at 35 ◦C, for 48 hours, pH of 5-6 with 2-6 v/wt. % yeast as biocatalyst. % 
being shaken 100-200 rpm. Optimal glucose concentration of 160g/300g and bio ethanol concentration 
of 60g/300g of saw dust were achieved for 3 v/v% H2SO4; 6wt. % yeast concentration with 200 rpm as 
the stirring rate.

1. Introduction
The energy demand is increasing every day and fossil fuels face a potential depletion. There is therefore a need to 
look for alternatives that are renewable and eco-friendly hence the drive for the uptake of bio fuels as first and 
second generation fuels (Balat et al., 2008). Biofuels from lignocellulose materials have taken the centre stage as 
the source of bio ethanol, a source of renewable energy. Lignocellulose materials are processed to bio ethanol 
using key processes which include pre-treatment, hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation as a product separation 
technique (Vallejos Vallejos et al., 2017). The production of bio ethanol from lignocellulose material involves

4. Conclusion 
Saw dust (woody biomass) provides a good raw material for bio ethanol production. Retention time of 48 hours 
was ideal for high glucose yield of 160g/300g of saw dust and bio ethanol yield of 60g/300g of saw dust. Optimal 
conditions for high glucose and bio ethanol concentration were achieved at H2SO4 concentration of 3 v/wt. %, 
yeast concentration of 6 v/wt.% at an agitation of 200rpm.

Abstract 
This study is entitled an Effectiveness Model of Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on Green 
Spatial Environment in Palembang City. The objective of this study is to find an Effectiveness Model of 
Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on a Green Spatial Environment in Palembang City. This 
study uses a qualitative descriptive approach. Data collection techniques used are observation, 
documentation, and in-depth interviews with the informants. Data analysis techniques used are field data 
collection, data reduction, data categorization, data analysis, and drawing conclusions. The findings of 
this study are:  (1) The Building Permit as a source of local original revenue in the Effectiveness Model of 
Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on Green Spatial Environment  in Palembang City has 
not been successful; (2) The service standards of Building Permit in the Effectiveness Model of Service 
Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on Green Spatial Environment  in Palembang City can be said to 
be fairly successful; (3) The Clarity of Benefits in the Effectiveness Model of Service Policy of Building 
Permit (IMB) Based on Green Spatial Environment  in Palembang City can be said to be fairly successful. 
The suggestion put forward in this study to increase Building Permit as a source of local original revenue 
in the Effectiveness Model of Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on Green Spatial 
Environment  in Palembang City should take some measures, one of which is by picking up building 
permit applications from existing Subdistricts in Palembang City, so that the people in the Subdistricts no 
longer need to carry out the management of Building Permit application in the Office of Investment and 
One Stop Integrated Services of Palembang City. The targets set by the Building Permit authority also 
tend to increase from the previous year's realization, this is because the determination of the target of the 
Building Permit was not determined in the previous year's realization, therefore it is necessary to evaluate 
it to determine its effectiveness.

1. Introduction
Since the reformation era and the ratification of the Indonesian Act number 12 of 2012 concerning regional 
autonomy, the talk of regional autonomy has become increasingly widespread, not only at the political level but also 
at the public level. At the same time, the echo of demands from various regions is increasingly audible with varying 
degrees of demands.  Apart from that, it seems that the implementation of the regional autonomy also saves a lot of 
hopes and concerns of the community, including the sector of public services.

help and facilitate human beings in making, changing, storing, communicating and even disseminating information. 
Technology is a computer network consisting of various information processing components that use various types 
of hardware, software, data management, and the technology of information network. The use of information 
technology can provide benefits to the implementers in terms of saving time, energy, costs and so on. For the DPM-
PTSP of Palembang City, the use of information and communication technology can help implementers in carrying 
out their duties, including coordinating the making of building permits. The Office of Investment and One-Stop 
Integrated Services of Palembang City uses e-mail and cellphone media to communicate and coordinate with the 
Related Offices. The field coordinator of the Office of Investment and One-Stop Integrated Services of Palembang 
City (DPM-PTSP) through an interview said that: ""For clear communication, there is one through email, the second 
by phone, we also have a WhatsApp group for sure. right, and the third is officially in service, there is also official 
service. 
In the implementation of service activities, DPM-PTSP has developed and implemented an electronic data input and 
processing system using the Integrated Licensing Service Information System (SIPPERI). The application of this 
system is limited to the Government To Employees as a media publish which is the electronic government that is 
intended for employee performance activities as community service. Whereas as a media publish which means that 
this activity is one direction, where the government publishes various data and information which can then be 
accessed by parties who have interests online (Potestio et al. 2009). 
The benefit of the technology of the Integrated Licensing Service Information System (SIPPERI) in the coordination 
of making IMB for DPM-PTSP with the City Planning Office is as a media for monitoring the position of the 
existence of the applicants’ IMB files. Through this system, the last position of the applicant’s requesting file can be 
seen and how long the file will be completed at each stage can be known. If the file is still in the City Planning 
Office and has exceeded the specified time limit, the DPM-PTSP through the field coordinator will inform the City 
Planning Office that the file has passed the deadline or issues a warning which means the file must be completed 
immediately and the City Planning Service must immediately send the applicant's file for further processing by the 
DPM-PTSP of Palembang City.  
Based on the explanation, it can be said that the coordinating officers in issuing building permits in the Office of 
Investment and One-Stop Integrated Services of Palembang City and the relevant Office, namely the Palembang 
City Planning Office have used information and communication technology as a form of technology using 
cellphones and email. Then for the working system of DPM-PTSP, Palembang City uses the Integrated Licensing 
Service Information System (SIPPERI). 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Referring to the results of the analysis and the discussion of the Effectiveness Model of Service Policy of Building 
Permit (IMB) Based on a Green Spatial Environment in Palembang City, it was concluded that the Effectiveness 
Model of Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on a Green Spatial Environment in Palembang City has 
been successful. This can be proven by the fact that: IMB as a source of PAD in Effectiveness Model of Service 
Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on a Green Spatial Environment in Palembang City has not been successful; 
The standard of building permit services in the Effectiveness Model of Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) 
Based on a Green Spatial Environment in Palembang City can be said to be fairly successful; Clarity of Benefits in 
the Effectiveness Model of Service Policy of Building Permit (IMB) Based on a Green Spatial Environment in 
Palembang City can be said to be fairly successful.

Abstract 
Coffee waste is rich in organic material and is a potential raw material for biogas production. In this 
study, 5kg of coffee waste was anaerobically digested for 40 days. The changes in the coffee waste 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total solids (TS) was 
monitored every 10 days as well as the biogas production. The amount of biogas produced was 
measured for both mesophilic conditions of 35 ◦C and thermophilic conditions of 55 ◦C. The amount of 
biogas produced increased with increase in time with a 60% conversion to biogas being achieved for 
mesophilic conditions. The enhanced biogas production under mesophilic conditions was related to the 
88%, 91% and 90% decrease in COD, BOD and TS. The biogas produced had an average methane 
content of 70%.

1.Introduction
The coffee production industry generates a lot waste as its by product from the coffee processing. This coffee 
waste is highly organic in nature and if left to naturally decompose can result in the generation of greenhouse 
gases and in overall climate change effects as well as potential volatile gases emissions into the environment. On

The composition of the biogas from the coffee waste is indicated in Table 2. The biogas from the coffee waste 
had a methane composition of 65-70%, which was quite on the high side and presents a great opportunity for 
utilization as an alternative source of energy. The biogas composition fell in the same range with similar studies 
related to coffee waste digestion to biogas (Qia et al., 2013).

production of biogas, a source of green energy. The anaerobic digestion process was optimal under mesophilic 
conditions of 35 ◦C with high biogas yield of 30% being achieved in comparison to thermophilic conditions. The 
coffee waste biogas had a composition range of 65-70%.

Abstract 
The vermicomposting technology is increasingly becoming popular as a bio fertilizer production 
through the aerobic decomposition of waste by earthworms as a bio waste management initiative. When 
vermiremediation occurs, the earthworms consume the bio waste which is then converted to 
vermicompost (solid bio fertilizer) and vermiwash (liquid fertilizer). Several studies have been 
conducted for various bio wastes worldwide using various earthworms over vermicomposting periods 
of 30-120 days in vermi reactors. Vermicompost with nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK) 
compositions with ranges 0.3-4.2%, 0.2-1.6% and 0.2-6.2% respectively were produced. In addition 
vermiwash with NPK composition of 0.1-1.6%, 0.1-7.5% and 0.5-1.3% respectively were produced. 
These bio fertilizers had rich macro nutrients composition that are required by plants and can be used 
as an alternative to chemical fertilisers promoting sustainable agriculture through vermi remediation.

1. Introduction
The vermiremediation process is gradually becoming popular as an environmental remediation through bio waste 
management (Abbasi et al. 2009; Tharmaraj et al. 2011; Gomez-Brandon et al. 2012; Kiyasudeen et al. 2016). 
The vermicomposting process involves conversion of waste to vermicompost due to earthworms’ action 
(Manyuchi et al. 2012; Manyuchi et al. 2013a). During vermicomposting, earthworms ingest the bio waste and 
the earthworm’s act as the bio reactor which converts the bio waste to bio fertilizers through various bio chemical 
reactions (Ansari and Sukhraj 2010; Lim et al. 2011). At the end of the bio conversion process, the vermicompost 
(vermicasts) produced is rich in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK). The vermicasts produced from the 
vermi remediation process can also contain trace elements (Muthukumaravel et al. 2008; Palsania et al. 2008; Lim

Comparative Analysis of Cost Overrun on Road 
Construction Projects Executed by Indigenous and 
Expatriate Contractors

Abstract 
Project implementation arguments on expatriate and indigenous contractors in the Nigerian construction 
industry are based on their performance on construction projects. Expatriate contractors are engaged more 
on large-scale construction projects leaving the indigenous contractors to small-scale projects. The Nigerian 
construction industry is not faced with the challenge to draw foreign contractors but to encourage 
indigenous participation. This study is aimed at determining the cost performance of road projects executed 
by expatriate and indigenous contractors with a view at drawing a comparison to know how efficient the 
two groups of contractors are. The study adopted a qualitative research design approach. This is achieved 
by observing the subject matter in its natural settings and attempting to interpret the pattern and behaviours 
of the subject matter. With the use of pro-forma, archival data on road project cost executed in Ekiti state 
between January 2018 and July 2019 were retrieved from the state Ministry of Works. A total of 61 road 
projects were completed with 28 constructed by indigenous contractors and 33 constructed by expatriate 
contractors. The retrieved cost data were analysed using descriptive statistics. From the findings of this 
study, it was evident that road projects executed by indigenous contractors experience less cost overrun 
compared to road projects executed by expatriate contractors while indigenous contractors execute fewer 
road projects. It was therefore recommended that indigenous contractors should be patronised by clients in 
the construction industry to boost the economy and also improve the employment rate by engaging more 
local manpower.

1. INTRODUCTION
The construction industry is faced with the challenge of cutting cost due to the growing need for construction of 
different types and tight monetary input to the industry. Mendelson & Greenfield (1996) submitted that government, 
institutions, corporations and other stakeholders of the construction industry will be in a survival race towards the end 
of the twentieth century due to the poor economic input into the industry. In order to overcome this challenge, 
participants/stakeholders are on the lookout for methods and processes that enhance the efficient use of construction 
resources in order to achieve cost and time performance thereby guaranteeing value for money. The cost of 
construction for a particular project is expected to be a summation of material and labour costs, plant and equipment 
costs, head office running costs, risk contingency costs, site overheads and profit. Any deviation from the envisaged 
project details results in an additional cost to the contract sum approved for the project. According to Mbachu & 
Nkado (2004), these additional costs pose a threat to the construction project thereby resulting in negative implications 
which affect the industry as well as the key stakeholders. The client, being the owner of the investment incurs less 
return and loss of revenue; the consultants have their reputation at stake being unable to give the client value for money 
which results in loss of confidence; the contractor if at fault, records loss of profit and it can also lead to loss of future 
projects as it reflects on the organisation’s profile; end users also get to pay higher lease/rental costs for the property.

From the findings of this study, it is evident that road projects executed by indigenous contractors experience less cost 
overrun compared to road projects executed by expatriate contractors. Surveys have shown that construction clients 
rather than indigenous contractors choose expatriate contractors (Idoro, 2012). In 1982, the Committee on High 
Government Contracts in Nigeria observed that while engaging expatriate contractors cost more than indigenous 
contractors, they are still engaged in more than 90% of Nigeria's overall construction projects (Idoro, 2012). This 
pattern does not promote indigenous contractor participation, the growth of skills and technological progress and the 
preventable loss of the limited resources of the country, which is a matter of continuous concern to the construction 
industry stakeholders (Idoro, 2010). It is believed that there is a low level of participation from indigenous contractors 
in large-scale construction projects over the years in Nigeria. However, the greater community of construction firms 
in Nigeria are represented by indigenous companies, though their share of the country's development is lower 
(Odediran, Adeyinka, Opatunji, & Morakinyo, 2012). This is evident from the data retrieved for this study as 33 of 
the 61 road projects are executed by expatriate contractors making a total of 54% compared to the 28 projects (46%) 
executed by indigenous contractors. Also, out of the 12 road projects with project cost over N1b, 10 of them are 
executed by expatriate contractors. It is worthy of note that these 10 road projects experienced 18.79% average of cost 
overrun while the two road projects executed by indigenous contractors in the same category did not experience cost 
overrun. This is in agreement with the submission of (Uduaki, 2006) and (Ibrahim, 2012) who praised the increase in 
the performance of construction projects executed by indigenous contractors. They further agreed that broad and 
highly technical projects can still be provided if these indigenous contractors are mobilised and encouraged.  
 
5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
 
The study has been able to determine the cost performance of road projects executed by expatriate and indigenous 
contractors. The study retrieved cost data for road projects executed in Ekiti state, Nigeria and it can be concluded that 
indigenous contractors execute fewer road projects compared to expatriate contractors. Also, indigenous contractors 
recorded fewer cost overrun on road projects executed compared to expatriate contractors. Despite this, expatriate 
contractors are patronised more than indigenous contractors by clients in the construction industry. It is therefore 
recommended that indigenous contractors should be patronised by clients in the construction industry. This will 
promote local content and also reduce the menace of cost overrun experienced on road projects executed in Ekiti state. 
Also, expatriate contractors will always send their earnings to their home country which contributes to income 
generation and distribution shortages, unexperienced indigenous contractors, local construction and material industries 
that are not worthy. For further study, a wider range of cost data can be retrieved to have a general view of how cost 
overrun varies on road projects executed by indigenous and expatriate contractors.

Abstract 
This research was conducted in a manufacturing company that produces high carbon wire. The company 
had issues in fulfilling demand where it had to work on overtime despite having a production capacity that 
is greater than the number of requests. This problem are due to greater actual production time than the 
standard production time and job scheduling prioritization using first come first serve. The purpose of this 
study is to create a job schedule using a bat algorithm in hybrid flow shop for high carbon wire products to 
minimize makespan and hence, to reduce overtime. In this study, a comparison was made between 4 
conditions, namely one condition using time and sequence of work based on production reports (condition 
1), second condition using actual time and sequence of work based on bat algorithm (condition 2), third 
condition using standard processing time and sequence of work based on production reports (condition 3), 
and forth condition using standard time and sequence of work based on bat algorithm (condition 4). Post 
data processing, we found that the condition 1 has a makespan of 551 hours and requires 82 hours of 
overtime; condition 2 has a makespan is 545 hours and requires 76 hours overtime; condition 3 has a 
makespan is 478 hours and requires 9 hours overtime; and condition 4 has a makespan is 439 hours and 
does not require any overtime 4. By using bat algorithm and standard processing time, the company can 
eliminate overtime and reduce makespan by 112 hours from condition 1.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background 
A steel manufacturing industry typically produces four types of products; high carbon wire, low carbon wire, cold 
heading wire and alloy steel wire. This research will observe high wire carbon production only. High carbon wire has 
two types of diameter, 2.24mm and 2.4 mm. High carbon wires will go through two processes. The first process is 
called pickling and coating and the second is the drawing process. The company has one pickling machine for the first 
process and three parallel and identical machines specifically allocated for drawing high carbon wire products. The 
scheduling method applied for high carbon wire is first come first serve (FCFS). FCFS is a scheduling method that 
schedules production based on the time that the orders were received. 
One of the problems faced by the manufacturing industry is continuously having to do overtime to fulfil orders albeit 
having a production capacity that is higher than demand. Through preliminary studies at the company, we understand 
that the problem is caused by 2 factors. The first was the human factor where the operator decreased the speed of the 
machine and increasing the actual processing time to be higher than the standard processing time. The second factor

Based on table 9, we see that the largest rate of decrease happened under condition 4 where standard processing time 
is used and bat algoritm is used as a scheduling method. The decrease of processing time under condition 4 is 20%. 
 
4.5.  Comparison of Overtime 
After comparing the decrease in production time, the last step of analysis is to compare the overtime required in each 
conditions. This step is done to align with the objective of this research of reducing overtime. The following is the 
comparison result:

Based on the above comparison, then we can see that there is a 100% decrease in overtime under condition 4. By using 
the standard processing time and bat algorithm as a scheduling method, the company is able to complete orders without 
overtime. 
 
5. Conclusions 
1. Upon doing research and data processing, the shortest makespan is obtained in Condition 4. 
2. The job processing sequence for Condition 4 is J5, J3, J22, J6, J17, J14, J13, J18, J9, J7, J2, J1, J20, J15, J21, 
J10, J12, J16, J19, J8, J11, J14 for machine 1 and J5, J21, J2, J17, J6, J20, J9, J18, J22, J15, J3, J11, J1, J4, 
J8, J13, J19, J12, J7, J14, J10, J16 for machine2. Total makespan with that processing sequence is 439 hours. 
3. Based on the calculation using bat algorithm for Condition 4, the total production time is reduced by 112 
hours or 20% from the actual production time. 
4. With the decrease of production time by 112 hours, overtime is no longer required to fulfil orders and 
overtime is reduced by 100% from actual time. 
5. The company is able to save production cost of IDR13,972,500,- every month if they apply bat algorithm 
and strictly supervise production to ensure that actual production time is not higher than standard processing 
time. 
6. By applying Condition 4, the company is able to accept more orders due to a 30 hours time saved.

Abstract 
This study examines the issues as regards the development of the Built Environment and discusses the 
thermal performance of Trombe Wall with respect to heating and cooling load profile. The scope of this 
research is limited to Trombe Wall designs that are suitable for a common building structure facilitate the 
comparison and reduce the time taken. Therefore, a good solar building performance will provide good 
selection material by using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) software and go through the process of 
selecting a candidate material (or a range of materials), hence only a few materials able to pass the 
requirements. The result shows that the best materials for Trombe that meets the requirements of the CES 
software are found on Titanium alloys, Stone, Concrete, Silica glass, Soda-lime glass, Brick, Silicon, and 
Borosilicate glass. The research concludes that solar energy produces different energy performances which 
resulted from different building techniques that affected the environment in various ways.

Introducation 
Solar energy delivers total solar radiation, which is absorbed by the earth and its atmosphere at 3 x 1024 J per year. 
This is more than enough energy to meet global demand, even allowing for the conversion, storage and transmission 
losses required when putting this resource to human use. It is believed that solar energy has been used in buildings 
since 2500 years ago when the heat is used to warm the people through solar collection and storage in thermal 
properties of the buildings they constructed. Over the last few decades, solar architecture, which used this solar energy, 
has started to become popular again because of energy conservation issues and nowadays, considerable progress has 
been made promoting solar renewable energy. Several programmers are still being developed to tap the power of the 
sun. In relation to the influence of solar energy in people's lives, it noted that since ancient times, people have used 
thick walls of adobe or stone to trap the sun's heat during the day and release it slowly and evenly at night to heat their 
buildings. Today's low-energy buildings often improve on this ancient technique by incorporating thermal storage and 
delivery system called a Trombe wall. Named after French inventor Felix Trombe in the late 1950s, the Trombe wall 
continues to serve as an effective feature of passive solar design (Torcellini and Pless, 2007). Thus, there is a close 
relationship between the building’s performances and energy consumption with several environmental issues such as 
global warming, the implication of greenhouse gases and carbon intensity of energy supply, carbon dioxide emissions 
and depletion of the ozone layer. Solar energy comprises namely Passive Solar Design (PSD), Photovoltaic System 
(PV), Active Solar Heating and some photoconversion processes. Therefore, this thesis is undertaken to pay attention

Conclusion 
 
A Trombe wall can enable a building envelope to go from a net-loss feature to a net-gain feature. The Trombe wall 
provides passive solar heating without introducing light and glare into these commercial spaces. Overhangs are 
necessary to minimize the summer gains; however, additional means would be helpful to minimize summer cooling 
impacts. TW does not give many influences to the internal temperature. Therefore, it is proved that both materials are 
suitable to be applied in building in terms of comfort internal temperatures. As this study evaluates the progress of 
solar Trombe wall system-wide and the possibility for further use, the analysis shows the different designs of solar 
Trombe wall system that requires elements of passive solar design, the passive solar design principles, the potentials, 
the difficulties, also main environmental and thermal performance strategies of Trombe wall. In this way, the good 
performance of the solar Trombe wall system will be accomplished. Trombe walls save energy by complementing 
conventional heating. In an efficient building, Trombe walls may even replace the need for conventional heating.  The 
innovation of the Trombe wall not widely used in victoria and integration with existing facilities not widely performed. 
Application of Trombe walls can be used wherever building heating is required providing that a suitable north-facing 
wall is available. Consideration must be given to hot summer months. To avoid overheating it is important to provide 
shade over the glass collector and close both the upper and lower vents. Therefore, a good building will provide good 
selection material by using Cambridge Engineering   Selector (CES)  software and go through the process of selecting 
a candidate material   (or a  range of materials)    that find the best candidates for TW selection of concrete, with stone 
and brick as alternatives because from the comparison. 
 
 
Recommenidation for Future work 
Future studies should incorporate theoretical, experimental evaluation and mathematical simulation for the design 
work. Once the theory has been established. It is possible to investigate all the parameters affecting the performance 
so that an optimum size Trombe wall system of the reasonable cost could be established. Future research could also 
be made on the design of the Trombe wall system in Libya, which is a large country in North Africa. Libya has a long 
coastline on the Mediterranean but the greater part consists of the central Sahara desert which is boiling hot. This 
research is regarding its winter system using the annual temperature in North Africa - Libya that can be seen as follows.

Abstract  
 
 
As reported by the World Health Organization, more than 5% of the world’s population suffers from 
disabling hearing loss [1]. This percent translates to a total of 466 million people which is not a small 
number [1]. Deaf and hearing-impaired people face several problems, which may affect their involvement 
and contribution to society. One of these problems is lacking of communication since sign languages that 
use by deaf people are not universal and use by everyone [2]. Nowadays, watching videos has become an 
important element in our life. In fact, society is increasingly being more dependent on technology on a daily 
basis. Every day, they watch videos for many purposes (learning, news, enjoy, etc…). However, deaf people 
face challenge and issue in watching and understanding the content of these videos. These people do not 
take the advantage of the video’s content because there is no available text transcript for all videos [3]. 
Therefore, there is a need for providing a solution that empowering deaf and hearing-impaired people to 
take advantages of any videos’ content to the fullest. Hence, this project will provide an IT solution, which 
is an android phone application that will facilitate and help them to understand the video's content (this is 
one of the communication problems) by providing videos’ transcripts in English and Arabic. “asmeany” 
application will immediately afford the transcript after uploading any video. The application ""asmeany"" - 
in Arabic - means the application communicates with deaf and hearing-impaired people and says to them 
play the video, so I can write the transcript for you.  The adopted development process of “asmeany” is the 
Scrum methodology. The authors will apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially the Natural 
Proccing Language (NLP) to afford the transcripts. “asmeany” will be an IT solution that could assist in 
solving one part of the communication problems that deaf and hearing-impaired people face every day.

Abstract 
Over the year’s Indian economy has been going through continuous fluctuations due to the recent 
government reforms. With reforms are various structural levels, banks were also looked into detail. Even 
though the Indian banking sector are known for maintaining stability at International levels, due to 
operational issues there has been several concerns at the Indian Banks which has led to issues like Net 
Performance Assets (NPA). The merger is a combination of two or more companies with an objective of 
wealth maximization to add more value with a stand of one. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the 
pre and post performance and NPA of the merging banks in the Indian banking industry. The financial 
performance evaluation was based on various financial metrics like profitability and liquidity. In addition 
to financial performance, NPAs are evaluated using various aspects of bank’s financial parameters like Net 
profit, Loans, Advances, Net NPA (NNPA), Gross NPA (GNPA), Enterprise value, Book value, Market 
capitalization, Deposits, Deposits (CAGR%), CASA deposits, Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on 
Assets (ROA).  
The study has employed on a sample size data of 12 banks, where all of them are government owned banks 
and the data has been collected over a period of three years from 2016 to 2018. Through an extensive 
literature review the researchers explored that through the comparison of financial performance it is evident 
that the amalgamation of the banks into a single bank is positively affected in the future. The mergers of 
big banks may fructify over the next 18-24 months. Though the integration is long-drawn it will disrupt 
lending. There will be issues of book dilution, which will happen due to government infusing capital at low 
valuations and issues additional shares to investors of amalgamated banks. The researchers through their

The above shown Table1., Table 2., Table 3., Table 4., Table 5., gives the detailed figures of all the variables 
considered for three years for the financial year 2017 to 2019.   
After the merge, the profitability of public sector banks has improved and the total gross non-performing assets has 
come down to Rs.2.9 lakh crores at the end of march 2019 from Rs. 3.04 lakh crore at the end of march 2018.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Any disruptions during these merger processes could have negatively affected the bank’s performance. Therefore, it 
is essential for banks to mitigate exposures in the areas to interconnect, credit quality, innovation and liquidity, the 
market, regulatory compliance. These risks can be solved by advance planning and due diligence for smooth 
movement. 
 
The public sector banks should also empower and recruit chief risk officers at market linked compensation to attract 
the best talent. These appointed chief risk officers should empower to mitigate the exposures. This will help them to 
position towards global sized banks.

Abstract 
Since there are most challenges and varying in the requirement of Fourth Industrial Revolution nowadays, 
there is a continuous requirement for higher education institute in emerging countries to harness 4IR for 
enhancing its unenhanced educational infrastructure within the universities. In order to ensure the “future 
readiness” of curricula, it call for Universities to cultivate not just required skills nowadays but similarly to 
those that will leverage the technological progresses of tomorrow, therefore there will be robust demand 
for professionals who can come up with a sense of balance between digital and STEM skills with traditional 
mechanical engineers and commercial arrangements data analytical tools to speedily adapt business 
approaches. This paper employ extensive literature reviews to drive the necessity of Universities in 
emerging countries to harness 4IR in order to enhance educational infrastructure. The aim of this study is 
to analyze the 4IR approaches which needs to be implemented within Universities to enhance educational 
infrastructure, the motives behind this and the actual function of 4IR within the Universities system, also 
this study aimed to recommend the most effective 4IR approaches which may lead to the highest satisfaction 
of students needs for the various universities infrastructure within the developing countries. 
Keywords: Educational Development, Fourth Industrial Revolution, Poor Infrastructure, Technology advancement 
1. Introduction
The Fourth Industrial Revolution plays an essential role in varying business models in countless industries. Manyika 
et al (2017) stated that prominent researchers contend that the 4IR’s determination to form the future over its 
influences on government as well as industry. Publics take no control in excess of either expertise or the commotion 
that originates with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, on the other hand, people foresee the prospects that arises with 
the 4IR: lesser obstacles amongst inventors and marketplaces, extra vigorous role for the artificial intellect (AI), 
addition of dissimilar technics as well as dominions (synthesis), enhanced superiority of our lives (robotics) and the 
linked lifespan (Internet).The world economy flourishes on the continuous enhancement of numerous educational and 
training structures that will considerably influence its future workers (Maigida, Saba & Namkere, 2013). As Gray 
(2016) states “Change won’t wait for us: business leaders, educators and governments all need to be proactive in up-
skilling and retraining people so everyone can benefit from the 4IR”. Therefore, the responsibility to generate the 
models and settings to permit it to occur need to be taken, or else we will consume a generation with no lack of skills 
for the new demands of the labor market and that turns out to be a huge problem to society. Horch (2017) opined that 
students requisite to have a deep understanding on how they can relate, practice and spread over dissimilar 
understanding of expanded frameworks, what they actually mean and in what way it can produce collaborations 
amongst dissimilar subjects to produce “something” that links with actual world and this put us to a significant opinion:

Stocking Decisions in a Multiple Location Periodic Review 
Inventory System with Order Crossover

Abstract 
Deliveries in global supply chains are often made through lengthy shipping routes that are subject to many 
delays such as border crossings, inspections and so forth.  Consequently, orders frequently crossover, that 
is, their order of arrival is not the same as the order that they were issued. In this paper we consider the 
window fill rate of a multiple location inventory system with order crossover. Demand arrives to each 
location according to a Poisson arrival process and inventory in each location is reviewed periodically. The 
system’s window fill rate is the probability that a customer arriving to the system is served within her 
tolerable wait. We consider two stocking optimization problems. The first is the spares allocation problem, 
which is defined as finding the optimal allocation that maximizes the window fill rate given a budget of 
spares. The second problem is the optimal budget problem, which is defined as the optimal allocation that 
minimizes the total budget of spares subject to a required window fill rate level. We show that when 
resources are scarce it is optimal to cluster spares to only few locations. In contrast, when resources are 
abundant, then an equitable solution is optimal.

1. Introduction
Inventory system models regularly assume that order lead times are stochastic and independent. Unless very strict 
assumptions are imposed on the lead times distribution, the independence of the lead times implies that orders may 
crossover, that is, orders may be delivered in a sequence that differs from the sequence that they were issued. The 
problem with order crossover is that it makes the tracking of the deliveries very difficult, and therefore, many studies 
analyzing these systems make an approximation assumption that orders do not crossover. This assumption results in 
a reasonable approximation when the lead times are not too volatile, so that the probability for crossovers is low. 
Unfortunately, real-life lead times distributions of international supply chains are in fact very volatile (see Disney et 
al. 2016) and the assumption of no crossovers results in poor estimations.  
In this paper, we consider a multiple location inventory system that may be either an exchangeable-item repair system 
or a make-to-order (MTO) inventory system. In the former, customers arrive with a malfunctioning item and leave the 
system once they receive an operational item either from the location’s stock or through repair. In the latter, customers 
wait until their order is satisfied either by a spare from the location’s stock or through the arrival of a new item from 
an external source. Each location in the system is a warehouse that operates under a periodic review policy. Customer 
arrive to each location following a Poisson process with a demand for a single item and are served by order of arrival. 
While demand is backlogged, it is assumed that customers have a level of patience, i.e., they will tolerate a certain 
amount of wait that we name the tolerable wait. It is the objective of managers that customers are served within their 
tolerable wait and accordingly, the location’s performance is measured as the location’s window fill rate, the 
probability that a customer is served within the tolerable wait.

The SAP algorithm dictates that if there are insufficiently many spares to bring all the locations to their tangent points, 
then spares should be concentrated into few locations. This prescribes that some locations are neglected (see Table 1), 
a prescription that many managers are reluctant to follow. In Table 2 we consider the case that managers insist on 
allocating spares equally among all the locations and compare 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 for this symmetric solution and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 for the 
SAP algorithm’s solution (we report the lower bound). The advantage of the concentrated solution is obvious when 
the budget is limited. There is only one instance in which the symmetric solution is better than the algorithm’s solution, 
due to the suboptimality of the solution (see the distance between bounds for this case in Table 1). Finally, when there 
are sufficiently many spares then the algorithm’s solution and the symmetric solution converge and perform 
identically.

When the system must meet a performance level, the tolerable wait determines the number of spares that must be 
purchased. This is quite common in many service contracts that dictate the time in which service must be rendered 
(e.g. Caggiano et al., 2009). We solved OBP for different values of required performance (𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟) and customer 
patience. Fill rate values of 80% and above are common in the inventory industry and the 50% threshold is presented 
for comparison. The results are reported in Table 3. Our experiments (of which only three are reported in Table 3) 
reveal a near linear negative relationship between the required budget and the tolerable wait. A day increase in the 
tolerable wait results in approximately 11.3 less spares that are needed to maintain a  𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟= 80%. This ratio slightly 
decreases with 𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟. Thus, when 𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟= 95%, approximately 10.7 less spares are required for a day increase in the 
tolerable wait.

4. Conclusion 
 
In this study we describe a multiple location inventory system with periodic review and solve two typical problems 
that managers must solve to reduce costs or maximize performance. We show that when there is a limited number of 
spares, the optimal solution is asymmetric even when the locations are identical. Thus, when resources are scarce, it 
is optimal to concentrate them in few locations rather than distribute them equitably. Customer patience play a 
significant role in the system’s performance and reduces the number of spares needed to meet a required performance 
level. This observation has a practical implication when writing service contracts. System managers may offer 
customers reduced premiums if they agree to longer waits. Understanding how the tolerable wait affects the budget 
size is critical in the design of these contracts. 
 
Our multiple location system’s structure is a flat structure with all locations situated in a single tier and without the 
option of lateral transshipment of spares between locations. Extending the model to more complex structure such as 
multiple-echelon systems is a challenge left for future studies.

Abstract 
As the Indian economy has been going through various fluctuations due to the current government 
reforms as well as structural reforms across various levels, Indian banks have been facing a lot of 
pressures. Though the Indian banking sector are well known for their financial and healthy stability, 
however, due to policy issues at the structural there has been several concerns. Issues such as Net 
Performance Assets (NPA) were further exposed which led to additional pressures. The aim of the present 
paper is to compare the social good of these banks with respect to their NPA ratio. The researchers are 
comparing the social good, measured in terms of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Spend and the 
NPA Ratio, measured in terms of the total number of wilful defaulters and the total amount which has 
been wilfully defaulted. The financial performance evaluation was based on various financial metrics like 
profitability and liquidity. The researchers evaluated the financial performance in addition to NPAs for 
these banks. The NPAs were evaluated using various aspects of bank’s financial parameters like Net 
profit, Loans, Advances, Net NPA (NNPA), Gross NPA (GNPA), Enterprise value, Book value, Deposits, 
market capitalisation, Deposits (CAGR%), CASA deposits, and Return on Assets (ROA). The Social

Findings 
 
The comparison of the data through bar diagram has a clear representation that the banks are socially responsible 
inspite of having the net performance asset (NPA) by spending on social activities which is highly known as the 
spending towards Corporate Social Responsibility.  
 
The NPA is increasing as the default amount is increasing for the previous two years 2017 and 2018 which clearly 
shows the increase in NPA is highly due to defaulted amount. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The increase productivity in banks is clearly due to the kind of services provided to the customers with increasing 
levels of deposits, profitability and lending and decrease in NPAs. NPAs are caused due to the non monitoring and 
disbursement of money at the right levels. A fault in single branch can be regulated but not in the whole country 
which runs in thousands of crores of rupees. In the previous years the stressed credits are converted to assets with 
the help of restructuring. There has been a significant decrease in recovery rates and resolve the NPA problem. 
  
There is a destressing effect on the economy is due to rising NPAs. The causes of NPA may effect the profitability 
of the banks as they do not earn any income from the NPAs, rather they have costs for their maintenance.  But, 
rising NPAs have destressing effect on the economy of the country. The consequences under causing NPAs maybe 
i) the banks profitability effects severely as the banks do not earn any income from NPAs, rather they have future 
losses which incur costs for their maintenance. Banks are also subjected to risks like other businesses which cannot 
be eliminated but can be monitored regularly within the limit.

Abstract 
One of the main security risks is the software vulnerability. The vulnerability when exploited by attacks, can cause 
catastrophic losses to the system. There are a number of vulnerabilities that are explored and discovered in the 
computing system and these vulnerabilities have increased multifold. The security vulnerabilities span across entire 
networks, large organisations and have to mitigated by information security engineers on a regular routine basis. One 
of the key challenges for Information Technology (IT) system administrators is how to tackle these vulnerabilities and 
more specifically which vulnerability to prioritize. All companies recognize the importance and need to prioritize 
these vulnerabilities. It is not only important to prioritize the vulnerabilities; it is imperative to utilize a vulnerability 
evaluation system. The significant role of the vulnerability evaluation system is to separate these vulnerabilities from 
each other through quantitative and qualitative methods. In this paper, we first review through both qualitatively and 
quantitatively the various vulnerabilities within an existing large global multinational company. We explore and 
analyze 30,000 various vulnerabilities across a 3-month time period. The 30,000 vulnerabilities are captured using an 
automated software from individual systems and the network within the company. The software detects the 
vulnerabilities and the various characteristics associated with these vulnerabilities and assigns severity levels based 
on the severity of the vulnerability. The severity is assigned a score from 1 to 5, with 1 being least. The vulnerabilities 
captured span across 20 different lab environments, across different operating systems and these vulnerabilities are 
with various severity levels. The CVSS vulnerability scoring system was utilized for data from one of the biggest

Abstract 
Large organizations across the globe are using advanced security solutions to protect and watch the users information. 
Even with such advanced solutions these companies are not able to protect or attacks. In addition to attacks one of the 
key aspects is users behaviour and detecting anomalies when the users are utilizing the systems on the network as well 
the patterns in their behaviour. Lack of proper monitoring and controls implementation and data breaches are seen. 
The security professionals within the organizations as well as outside are grappling to solve these issues. One of the 
new approaches to information security is User Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA). One of the biggest challenges 
with incident response is the large amount of data that the system environment has generated and how to accommodate 
and analyse the data. Analytics within the area of information security is a new area. Analytics professionals are 
working on creating rules and correlation aspects, in addition to trends and behaviour patterns with respect to the users 
behaviour and their approach. One of the key focus areas of UEBA is on users actions and behaviours. Behaviours, 
users access as well as their usage anomalies are popular and interpretation of these anomalies or malicious activities 
is very critical. UEBA approach is a viable approach in the area of security to detect user behaviour anomalies using 
methods like statistical analysis and machine learning. The paper aims to show how analytics and specifically UEBA 
can help in users patterns and any anomalies within these patterns. With the focus on user behaviours and the analytics 
related to user behaviours the authors look at the insights, benefits and the utilization of resources in the area of 
security. The various parameters analysed for the users are user name, IP Address, time of usage, date of usage. The 
data was analysed over a period of 3 months. The researchers developed patterns using a visualization dashboard and 
used mining, script and processing of raw data before developing visual analytics. The various anomalies were 
highlighted from the different patterns.

1.Introduction
In enterprise security one of the key aspects is to detect the user accounts that are compromised and also the insiders 
within the company whose intents are malicious. The problem gets complicated when we have many scenarios and 
varied networking environments across the company. However, such issues could be tackled if the actions of the 
compromised user are quite different from the users daily duties. However, we could  track the actions of the user’s

8.Conclusions 
 
From the analysis and the data we can observe that the authors focused on the behavior of the users usage of the 
corporate network from various locations. In addition, the authors also explored to find out the different times these 
users were utilizing these locations. The authors also wanted to explore how frequently the users are utilizing these 
corporate services. They also looked at from which locations were these services used and how frequently. The 
authors also looked at the density of users from various locations, using IP ranges and IP addresses.

Abstract 
Functional Leadership approach focuses on addressing specific leader behaviours expected to 
contribute to organizational team effectiveness. The approach argues that the leader's main job is to 
see that whatever is necessary to team needs is taken care of. A good leader must ensure they have 
contributed to team effectiveness and cohesion and these are key aspects in the current 4th Industrial 
Revolution in the mining sector. The application of Functional Leadership in successful operation of 
the mining sector is critical for the positive growth of this sector through optimum team performance.  
Keywords: Fourth Industrial Revolution, leadership roles, Functional Leadership, mining sector, teamwork 
1. Introduction
Leadership is the process of social influence in which a person is able to enlist the aid and support of others in 
the accomplishment of a common task (Dinwood et al., 2014). Leadership is all about creating a way for people 
to contribute to making something extraordinary happen. Leadership is an important element of the directing

consistent affective reactions within a team. Team affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual 
members of the team and refers to mood at the team level of analysis. Teams with leaders in a positive mood 
have a more positive affective tone than do teams with leaders in a negative mood. Level 3-Team processes like 
coordination, effort and strategy. Public expressions of mood impact how team members think and act. Leaders 
signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. Expressions of positive moods 
by leaders signal that leaders’ progress toward goals to be good. The team members respond to those signals 
positively in ways that are reflected in the team processes. 
 
10. Conclusion 
Good leadership skills are essential for the growth of the mining sector during the 4th Industrial Revolution and 
it is important to take cognisant of Functional Leadership. Functional Leadership maximises the benefits of 
good leadership with main emphasis on the team and individual needs as well as the task at hand. Adoption of 
Functional Leadership in the mining sector is critical for its growth.

Abstract 
Internet traffic can be described as a general term that includes the transmission of internet data between different 
devices and systems. The analysis and prediction of internet traffic is a proactive approach to ensure secure, reliable 
and qualitative network communication. Several linear and non-linear models are proposed and tested to analyze the 
prediction of network traffic, including techniques based on regression analysis, artificial intelligence and data mining. 
These interesting combinations of internet traffic analysis and forecasting techniques are implemented to achieve 
efficient and effective results. Timely and accurate prediction of the use of internet data is a topic of great importance 
in the telecommunications industry. In addition, internet traffic data is important for many applications in 
telecommunications management, such as understand customer behavior, optimal planning of the capacity of 
networks, successful decision making and maintaining the quality of services at guarantee level in the future. This 
situation inspires us to rethink data mining with internet traffic forecasting problems. This study provides an overview 
of data mining in telecommunications and proposes a novel model for forecasting mobile internet traffic based on 
artificial neural networks. The analysis of mobile Internet traffic data during the last five years shows that the month 
of August has a higher traffic flow, while the lowest flow was the month of June. The selected model has three layers 
with a determination coefficient of 97.5%.

1. Introduction
Each manager wants to know the exact nature of future events, act accordingly, or plan activities when there is 
sufficient time to execute the plan. The effectiveness of the plan depends on the awareness of future events. But all 
managers are planning for the future, whether or not future events are known. This means that they are trying to predict 
the future based the historical data and on their judgment and experience. In telecommunications companies, the 
managers using historical data to predict the future to understand customer behavior, maintain quality of service, 
optimize network capacity, monitor network traffic flow, network failures, maximize profit, fraud detection, anticipate 
new products and services to improve existing products and services, and much more. Accurate estimation of network 
performance is critical to the success of any type of network, whether voice or data. The two most important factors 
that it needs to consider in managing the telecommunications are service and cost. Quality of service is essential to 
maintain customer satisfaction whilst cost always influences profitability. This study aims to provide an overview of 
data mining in telecommunications and proposes a novel model for forecasting mobile internet traffic based on 
artificial neural networks (ANNs) 
2. An Overview
Recently, the concept of data mining has been increasingly used in various industries. This discipline is primarily 
concerned with designing algorithms to extract new information from large, existing structured data. Data mining, 
also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). KDD was coined in 1989 by Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro 
during the first workshop on KDD (KDD-89). The term data mining appeared in the database community in 1990 
(Fayyad et al., 1996). However, the challenge of data mining is to draw valuable analytical conclusions. Thus, most 
telecommunications companies have realized that the vast volume of data they collect and possess could be effectively 
utilized for solving their business problems by converting them into information and knowledge. Data mining can be 
considered as a technique that automatically generates this knowledge from available data (Joseph, 2013). As a result,

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the shift in community livelihoods caused by agricultural land conversion 
activities in Ngringo Village. This research is a qualitative model using a case study approach, where this 
approach aims to examine how shifts in community livelihoods occur due to land-use change. From the 
results of research that has been done that the initial description of the change of function due to 
economic factors that cause landowners to sell their agricultural land to cover the necessities of life and 
children's education costs. In addition, with the increasingly narrow agricultural land to be cultivated, the 
community is trying to cover their living needs by working outside the agricultural sector, one of them by 
becoming a construction worker. The method is then used to continue to fulfil their daily needs by 
working hard and inviting each other to work outside the village. This phenomenon for researchers is a 
form of economic morale that is owned by the people in Ngringo Village.

1. Introduction
Industrialization became a major element in the 'National Development Ideology' that was widespread in developing 
countries (Damayanthi 2008), so the history of the success of industrialization in many countries encouraged 
Indonesia to begin the process of industrialization through five-year development plans (Repelita) I to VI (Robiani 
2005). Indonesia, as a chain of developing countries, has not been spared the industrialization fever (Sa’adah et al. 
2019). Since economic development began as planned beginning in 1969, Indonesia began to use the 
Industrialization strategy approach. The ideals of national industrialization are to create prosperity for all people, in 
the sense of; needs of goods and services are fulfilled, people have purchasing power, because decent income is 
accompanied by high productivity, and science and technology develops fairly and equitably (Damayanthi 2008).  
On the other hand, industrial development influences economic improvement in Indonesia which has an impact on 
high public demand for vacant land or land for individual or business interests while on the other hand the land 
supply for it is very limited as happened in Central Java Province where the local government has set several a 
location that is directed to be developed as an industrial estate or an industrial location (Regional Office of the 
National Land Agency of Central Java Province). One of the districts that have quite high industrial potential is 
Karanganyar Regency (Umanailo, Pratiwi, and Indah 2019). Karanganyar Regency is included in the Surakarta 
Urban Area, and the City of Surakarta itself is a growth centre for the IV Development Region of Central Java. The 
physically built area has grown and expanded beyond its administrative boundaries (RTRW of Karanganyar 
Regency in 2001) (Syahruddin 2010).

The strong desire to be independent solely by farm labourers considers working time and the results obtained will be 
much better when they are able to hold or control the agricultural land compared to the land controlled by the 
landowner or the company (Retno Damayanthi 2008). The rational calculations of farm labourers for each 
opportunity do not then make work in the agricultural sector the second goal because it is related to the experience 
and the fabric of cooperation that has been built so far. Then it can be ascertained that the strategy used to overcome 
the limited access to work in the agricultural sector is to work outside the agricultural sector such as construction 
workers or selling around the village. 
The action was carried out due to several factors namely; construction workers are still considered as a kind of work 
because they still use labour in the implementation process and do not require a high level of education as in the 
work of factory workers or industry (Wangwe and Rweyemamu 2001). In addition, the network that has been built 
so far makes it easy for them to help one another with the work, Second, small-scale trading is an alternative that is 
considered to be quite easy for them to meet their daily needs apart from being a farm labourer whose results are 
considered to be not commensurate with what is expected. The capital needed can be affordable with the conditions 
they have, the choice to trade small can be considered as an alternative that is quite helpful. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Culture as a community guideline formed in the value system constructs two important things namely, the birth of an 
instant mindset that prioritizes profits in the form of selling agricultural land at high prices and a lack of awareness 
and desire to continue farming business, so the next generation prefers to sell land in the hope of employment 
opportunities in the office or company. While the second is the formation of informal ties between farmworkers to 
help each other and find work outside the agricultural sector. The offer from the industry to buy land at a high price, 
causing most landowners to sell land as assets or capital in developing business and this condition makes the farm 
labourers are in a position of uncertainty about the livelihood resources they have. Logical consequences caused by 
the mindset of landowners have implications for the search for other jobs by farmworkers because of the limitations 
and uncertainty of land to try.

Abstract 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), over the last few decades, has become a buzzword among 
organizations and its stakeholders. Communicating CSR has evolved from a unidirectional mode to a bi-
directional mode, enabling companies build positive reputation with stakeholders – from design phase to 
implementation of any CSR initiative. Penal measures, as stipulated in the amendments to Companies Act 
2013, make it imperative for businesses and academic experts to interpret CSR reporting and 
communications in greater depth. Every company chooses to implement CSR in its own manner based on 
its size, the industry in which it operates, the inherent culture, the demands of its stakeholders and the 
company’s own history. This study examines the communication materials meant for consumption by the 
intended audience of CSR communications (internal/external actors) along with official social media 
presence, CSR communication modalities, including challenges and gaps in CSR communication pertaining 
to Indian Organizations. Qualitative data from one hundred Indian companies across nine sectors are 
analyzed to see how these companies address CSR reporting and communications in arriving at a 
framework for communicating CSR Initiatives.

1. Introduction
Increasing scrutiny by stakeholders on businesses to communicate social responsibility (CSR) has prompted 
organizations to develop CSR activities in favor of their workforce, clients, value chain partners and the community 
in which they function and exist (Matten & Moon, 2008). Rapid consumption of information in this digital and 
connected world has increased the need for making CSR strategies, policies, appropriate financial and operational 
activities by companies publicly available, in order to recognized as responsible businesses. Therefore, an increased 
attention on CSR in communication methods and conventions is now inevitable (Nielsen & Thomsen, 2011). 
Weder and Karmasin (2011) proposed a “quadruple bottom line” postulating that ethics and commitment must be 
understood communicatively, as well. They proposed that “Corporate Communicative Responsibility” be extended to 
the triple bottom line as the fourth dimension, emphasizing that CSR must be communicated responsibly. This implies 
that contemporary methods of reporting CSR such as engaging with stakeholders through dialogues and meetings and 
these details recorded in official or regulatory documents be used as disclosure methods. Engaging and communicating 
with their stakeholders regularly on its CSR initiatives, activities and measurable impacts are considered one of the 
good practices of responsible organizations (Du et al., 2010). Communicating CSR initiatives have been done through

Companies engaged in manufacturing and distribution of textile fibres and finished textile products are usually small 
to medium scale relying on workforce with vocational skills. Workers are prone to occupational illnesses and 
promoting well-being through CSR activities focused on employees and communities is key towards business 
longevity. 8 out of 10 companies directed their CSR communication towards employees as shown in Fig. 9

4. Conclusion 
 
80 of 100 Indian companies directed their CSR communication to investors, not only from financial point of view, but 
also from an ethical standpoint. As shown in Fig. 10. Communicating to customers that the organization is socially 
responsible and ensures the wellbeing of employees and community is a tested measure of establishing credibility and 
building long lasting relations.

Abstract 
For more than four decades, corporates were operating using the principle of “Maximizing Shareholder Value”. With 
this principle, their focus was on profits and share prices, regardless of the consequences to other stakeholders like 
community, customers, labor force, suppliers and others. The free-market ideology of “Shareholder Primacy” was a 
key driver in Indian markets. In this paper, the researchers explore if Indian corporates are replacing “Shareholder 
Capitalism” with “Stakeholder Capitalism” and are striking the balance between stakeholders in allocating the profits 
and capital of an organization towards the society. The researchers revisit the time-tested popular narratives of 
capitalism and the predominant stakeholder in these narratives. In order to promote responsible and sustainable 
businesses for current and future generations, the researchers believe that the fine balance among stakeholders is the 
true constant and this balance can be achieved through communication and the principle of stakeholder communication 
can be meaningful principle of stakeholder capitalism. The researchers through a systematic review of literature and 
elucidation of major narratives, map the stakeholders of Indian corporates using annual reports and to confirm the 
resurgence of Stakeholder Capitalism.

1. Introduction
The meaning of the term stakeholder differs on its usage context. In can, be considered as an equivalent to a citizen, 
anyone contributing to the public welfare. In a limited sense it points to someone who participates in something. In 
business context, it usually refers to a person or groups of people having a direct or indirect effect on an ongoing 
concern and individuals who act in consulting capacity or directly in decision-making capacity as part of management 
of the organization. According to Rhenman (1964) and Priya et al., (2019), a stakeholder is engaged in a reciprocal 
symbiotic relationship with an organization, where the stakeholders rely on the organization to achieve their goals and 
the organizations relies on the stakeholder to ensure its sustainability. Freeman and Reed (1983) posited that 
stakeholders' opinions and interests in the business activities of an organization are legitimate and must be 
acknowledged. 
It was at Stanford Research Institute, now SRI International, where the term 'Stakeholder' was introduced and was 
used to represent “individuals which can affect or be affected as a result of organization attaining their objectives” 
(Freeman, 1984. Prasad et.al, 2019, Ram and Arun 2019). Conversely, individuals who cannot influence or be affected 
by an organization are not considered stakeholders. In some cases, an organization can affect individuals, but these 
individuals have no influence on the organization, they are also considered as stakeholders. Academicians at Wharton 
such as Ackoff, Trist, Emshoff, Mitroff and Mason, and Perlmutter opined on how business could be interpreted in

the stakeholders honoring their clauses of their agreements and accepting responsibility for their their actions. Value 
creation is possible because humans are capable of imbibing different values and at different points and not naïve. 
This principle of complexity enables the trading and sustaining the value created. Business should promote 
cooperation with stakeholders and encourage creation of new sources of value through morality, agreements, trust, 
honesty, and care, which augurs a sustainable organization through continuous creation. By accepting that in every 
interaction a win-win solution is not available, participating stakeholders should strive to seek the win-win solution, 
a situation of emergent competition occurs. 
3. Conclusion
Following the Great Recession in 2008, a renewed interest in stakeholder capitalism was inevitable. Although 
socialism shaped the principal economic and social structure of India for nearly four decades after gaining 
independence, India moved towards a more market-based economy towards the end of twentieth century. Changes in 
organization staffing policies, creation of a lean workforce, spurt in entrepreneurial ventures are some of the factors 
causing realignment of stakeholders’ segments. Changes in consumption behavior, advances in technology has forced 
industrial sector to introspect who are their stakeholders. Freeman concedes that the six principles may not always be 
successful, as exceptions to the rules that there will always exist a small group which will pursue only their self-
interest even at their expense. Growing exposure of frauds have revived the interest and need of stakeholder capitalism, 
especially creation of new sources of value through morals, relationships, teams, trust, honesty, and care which are 
essential for a sustainable organization. We offer the inclusion of seventh principle through Stakeholder Capitalism 
“The principle of stakeholder communication”. It draws attention to consistent and periodic disclosure of the current 
state of meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, communities, employees, and 
financiers. Transparency and communicating regularly to stakeholders can make the difference and offer the necessary 
checks and balances required to exercise prudent choices. We believe that we can do a better job in the course of 
making use of capital and ensuring stakeholder balance using the principle of stakeholder communication along with 
the other six principles.

Abstract 
Mine Managers are responsible for overseeing the overall performance of a mining company. Key 
duties include monitoring and evaluation of production targets, adherence to health and safety issues 
of an organization as well review of new and on-going projects. For effective performance measure of 
the Mine Manager’s subordinates regular appraisals must be carried out. The appraisal system results 
in open communication, improved results and motived employees when they are rewarded.  
Keywords: Appraisals, job description, job specification, Mine Manager 
1.
Mining Manager Job description
A job description is describes the general tasks and responsibilities of a position (Prien and Hughs, 2004). The 
job description specifies to whom the position reports to, the qualifications or skills needed by the person in the 
job, information about the equipment, tools and work aids used, working conditions, physical demands and  the 
salary range. Job descriptions are usually narrative, but some may comprise a simple list of competencies; for 
instance, strategic human resource planning methodologies may be used to develop competency architecture for 
an organization, from which job descriptions are built as a shortlist of competencies.  
A job description is developed by conducting a job analysis, which includes examining the tasks and sequences 
of tasks necessary to perform the job. The analysis considers the areas of knowledge, skills and abilities needed 
to perform the job. Job analysis involves the following steps: collecting and recording job information; checking 
the job information for accuracy; writing job descriptions based on the information; using the information to

4.3 Checking on subordinates strengths and weaknesses 
When the Mine Manager is handing out assignments, it is important to be on top of the situation like 
knowing whose best fitted for the job or who would mess it up completely if they are given the task. 
Having a formal personal appraisal system which regularly tracks an individual’s strengths and 
weakness will be crucial in setting up strong teams with members formally assessed for their 
contributing and noncontributing areas (Arnaboldi and Azzone, 2010) 
4.4 Setting of new goals 
When the Mine Manager conducts the appraisals to the subordinates it helps the organization setting 
new goals from the interaction and also identifying where there is need for improvement. Productive 
employees are goal driven and this is reflected in their performance appraisal. Employees relentlessly 
pursue their goals to achieve results and rewards. The setting of goals can be the high point of an 
appraisal when an employee feels charged to perform and achieve the desired goals (Frauenheim, 
2009). When an employee an employee meets the set targets during the appraisal system it also 
increases their confidence levels. The appraisal system also gives an opportunity for the Mine 
Manager to realign the organization’s objectives if market situations are changing and set goals that 
align to the situation. Formal evaluations through appraisals are also a good time to step away from 
the pressure of everyday duties and reflect on the direction the team is heading towards. 
4.5 To check if the company systems are working well 
The carrying out of the appraisals is a valuable way to gain the necessary skills and knowledge for 
managing human capital in the organization. An efficient human capital is the key competitive 
advantage for organizations (Thomas et al., 2008). An employee evaluation is a key instrument to 
evaluate the effectiveness of human resource personnel in the organization. 
4.6 To check if the company systems are working well 
The carrying out of the appraisals is a valuable way to gain the necessary skills and knowledge for 
managing human capital in the organization. An efficient human capital is the key competitive 
advantage for organizations (Thomas et al., 2008). An employee evaluation is a key instrument to 
evaluate the effectiveness of human resource personnel in the organization. 
5. Conclusion 
The Mine Manager’s position is a critical technical position in the mining industry covering the production and 
safety issues of any mining company. The Mine Manager can assist in organizational growth through the 
performance of appraisals to subordinates. When the appraisals are conducted fairly and efficiently the mining 
organization can get positive feedback from employees and open communication.

Abstract 
This study identified twenty-two drivers that cause the complexity in supply chain. The level of such 
complexity is quantified by using hybrid AHP and GRA method. A case company is studied in order to 
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. The results from the case company were analyzed 
and it is seen that the level of supply chain complexity of the case company is 0.44, which is signifying that 
there is a considerable scope of improvement in terms of minimizing complexity in its supply chain. From 
the study outcomes, it is realized that the case company mainly needs substantial improvement on the issues 
of “government regulation,” “internal communication and information sharing,” and “company culture” in 
order to minimize the level of accompanied complexity in its supply chain.

1. Introduction
In the era of technological revolution, global companies are working in a distributed business environment, where 
they need to keep eye on every aspect of their supply networks. Supply chain (SC) is a complex system, where different 
entities, processes, and resources interact with one another (Khadem et al. 2017). Today’s SC is getting more complex 
due to the advent of customization, innovation, globalization, and sustainability (Blome et al. 2014). Complexity 
creates uncertainties and disruptions to the SC that result in increased cost with lower customer response (Gunasekaran 
etl. 2015). The complexity is further exacerbated when there is a lack of strategical coordination among SC 
stakeholders (Surana et al., 2005). In terms of sustainability concern, SC involves consideration of environmental 
impacts that creates addition complexity (Kaur et al., 2018). In addition, supply chain complexity also arrives due to 
recent political and economic changes such as Brexit (Hunt and Wheeler, 2019) and trade-protectionist policies in the 
U.S. (Lambert, 2019). Such changes in business domain have raised awareness in the supply management. 
There is no universal definition of SC complexity. However, most of the research studies have identified SC 
complexity as a multi-faceted, multi-dimensional phenomenon that is driven by several sources (Piya et al. 2017). 
Bozrath et al. (2009) defined SC complexity as the unpredictability of a system’s response to a given set of inputs, 
whereas, Isik (2010) described it as the quantitative differences between the predicted and real values.  
According to Drzymalski (2015), measuring the level of SC complexity is essential to manage complexity efficiently. 
However, before managing complexity, it is necessary to identify the drivers that create complexity to the SC. 
Serdarasan (2013) define SC complexity driver as any property of a SC that increases its complexity to the whole

5. Conclusions  
This study identified the drivers of SC complexity and developed a quantitative model to measure the level of 
complexity created by these drivers on SC. The identification of the drivers was based on an extensive literature 
review. In order to measure the level of SC complexity, hybrid AHP and GREY method was used. From this hybrid 
method, numerous drivers were identified, which need to eliminate, or minimize to remove or reduce the complexity 
level in SC. In order To validate this hybrid method, it was applied to study on a multinational company. From the 
study, the SC complexity level of the case company was found 0.44, which indicates abundance room of improvement 
to minimize the level of complexity in the studied case company.   
 
The effectiveness of SC is defined based on various performance measures. In Future, this research can be extended 
to determine the effects of identified complexity drivers and their magnitude on various performance measures of SC 
such as cost, supplier responsiveness, and innovation.

The authors focuses on the development of themes and sub-themes using qualitative methodologies. The authors 
developed a comprehensive list of themes and sub-themes as seen on Table - 1. The authors also ensured not to have 
any conflicts or overlaps between the sub-themes and themes, hence all these themes and sub-themes are unique. The 
authors worked on manual process of data extraction and using the data from the existing set of data corpus they 
developed themes and sub-themes. The authors developed a unique process which can be seen on Table - 2. The entire 
process was based on phases, to ensure there is a non-conflicting and a vivid process during the data extraction. These 
themes and sub-themes were also mapped or triangulated using literature reviews and research papers from the past.

Limitations 
The study was taken only for the top-500 companies within NSE-500. The study also focused for only 1 year. The 
final developed themes and sub-themes were proof-read by other authors to ensure consistency. However, the 
subjectivity inherent remains a limitation. Also the authors chose only 1 year of data and only top 500 companies.

Abstract 
Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become important not only to corporations but to society 
and government as well. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase on how these corporations are informing and 
disclosing their social and environmental activities in which they are involved through their company annual reports. 
These annual reports are not only useful for companies but also to government, NGO’s, society and many other 
stakeholders. In the past many of the annual reports were studied manually. But now with internet, there is a great 
opportunity to develop automation through software tools and techniques. Data Mining techniques and related 
techniques and softwares can help not only researchers but also corporations to extract text from multiple data sources 
like word processing documents as well as image documents like an image file or a PDF file. In this paper, the 
researchers first and designed the manual process and also performed the manual process of text extraction from 
annual reports. Having understood and performed the manual process the researchers analyzed the various tools and 
techniques available on net. They explored and analyze all the tools, scripts and software available on the net. The

Abstract 
Need identification is always a challenge for organizations in India, while planning CSR activities. This is mainly due 
to geographical widespread of the country as well as language barriers. The need of the bottom line will be known to 
the regional leaders and other community development activists. This kind of need identification at bottom level is 
required not only for CSR activities, but also for any government funded projects, which normally comes under the 
financial budgets of central and state governments. Kerala, the southernmost part of India, has a proven method for 
dispersing such benefits to the society. In Kerala, these needs were identified at each Panchayats,  through a process 
called “Gramasabha”, where members from each household and the elected representatives along with government 
officials will come together for finding out the genuine beneficiaries, based on the fund allocation for that particular 
financial year. This system is followed for the last two decades and is found to be a successful model as there is not 
much ambiguities. At some points, there will be a gap between the allotted fund and the beneficiaries – that is – the 
government may not be able to fulfill the requirements and demands of the society and to satisfy the bottom line. This 
gap may be efficiently filled using CSR funds.  
Some real needy people may miss out to have their opportunity, while prioritizing the list of beneficiaries, by the 
Panchayats. These ‘miss out’ list may be escalated and integrated at state level and may handed over to the corporates 
to plan and disburse their CSR activities. Thus, Gramasabha can play a significant role in need identification for the 
organizations, across the country. The projects, which are funded by the government are mostly implemented through 
the Self Help Groups (SHGs), which is considered as a homogeneous and non-profit group, with a decentralized 
manner of functioning and having same socio-economic strata, which has its roots along the length and breadth of the 
state, even to the remotest rural areas. The group share their ideas and knowledge to achieve a common cause and 
they help the society by identifying their own problems as well as that of the fellow-people in the community. These 
SHGs can also perform their part by providing feedbacks from the grassroot levels of the village and then passing on 
the information through proper channels; thus, supporting the government machinery in identifying the beneficiaries, 
which otherwise, might have unintentionally missed out by the officials and other elected representatives. Ultimately, 
this can even cover-up the lethargically moving CSR fund allocation process and convert it into ‘smart’ by 
implementing the CSR projects as envisaged and budgeted by organizations during respective financial years itself.

Abstract 
This paper discuss the operational efficiency of Perishable Product Supply Chain (PPSC) in context of Petri 
Net (PN) modeling technique. The operational efficiency is classified into: inventory management, 
logistics, information sharing and supply chain risk among different stages of supply chain with 
coordination and monitoring through traceability and PPSC risk management. This classification of 
operational efficiency will allow the industrial practitioners and academicians to decide on the suitable petri 
net technique for the problem identified. This paper discuss the research directions of application of Petri 
Net in PPSC (operational efficiency). In addition, paper provides future directions for operational efficiency 
in PPSC and are as follows: 1) modelling PPSC with uncertainty, 2) reducing complexity in PPSC, 3) 
integration of PN modelling with emerging technology, 4) PN involvement in information flow and 
traceability and 5) application of PN modelling in decision making.

1. Introduction
Supply Chain Management is defined as the coordination or integration of different stages such as procuring, 
production and planning, logistics, inventory management, information sharing, manufacturing, retailer and finally to 
end-consumer,  Vishwanadham & Raghavan, 2000; Dong & Chen, 2001.  Supply chain is a process oriented approach 
where main objective is value deliver process, Vishwanadham & Raghavan, 2000. Quality is the main constraint with 
optimized price in delivery of products. There are several reasons why so much perishable food is lost which lowers 
the operational efficiency of supply chain:  Biswas, 2014, MOFPI, 2018, fig.1 
Perishable products are short life-cycle products, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, meat, canned products, blood etc. 
These products have uncertain behaviour, such as late deliveries, order cancellation, exploitation of products, 
unnecessary slack time, demand of products, market change, natural hazard etc. Supply chain for perishable products 
are complex and inefficient in nature, thus there is increase in deteriorate rate of perishable products. Modelling of 
PPSC is necessary to increase the performance and reliability. The modelling leads to less deterioration rate of 
perishable products. At operational management and control level design variables are required such as time, accuracy, 
quality pf product and quality of information flow, Van der Vorst, 2000. 
Supply chain are regarded as discrete event dynamic system Vishwanandham & Raghavan, 2000; Arns et al., 2002. 
These system considers time as a factor for determining various discrete events such as product arrival at supplier, 
logistics, transportation, flow of material through stages of supply chain. The state of supply chain changes at discrete 
time, Vishwanadham & Raghavan, 2000.

With emergence new technology such as Internet of Things (IoT), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and 
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Data collected from IoT comes from different sources and data collected can be 
discrete or continuous. Since, PPSC are discrete event dynamic systems. Data collected from these emerging 
technology can improve the decision making and efficiency of supply chain. The modularization and semantic 
integration of these emerging technologies are in high demand. There is need to develop a unified and comprehensive 
modelling for these technologies. Petri Net modelling technique has been considered as an excellent tool for discrete 
event dynamic system. Petri Net incorporate both at system level and item level. Petri Net modelling technique enables 
us to systematically capture and categorize the data collected from these technologies and analyse accordingly.  
1.4 PN involvement in Information Flow and Traceability 
PPSC has uncertain nature and events occurrence are asynchronous in nature. Petri Net have the capability to 
coordinate these asynchronous events in supply chain at different stages and model negotiation process. . Supply chain 
model consists of three types of flow: material, fund and information flow. Dynamic behaviour of demand, inventory, 
cost, quality and delivery at different stages of supply chain can be analysed. Information flow and traceability at 
different stages of supply chain are coordinating actions of units. Petri Net models the traceability issue in supply 
chain which captures the quality of product, process and transformation information through state transition function 
and provide effective decision making. 
1.5 Application of Petri Net in Decision-Making 
Petri Net modelling technique focused on operational characteristics of PPSC, such as state transitions of process, 
product quality, transportation, traceability, information flow, supply chain risk management, inventory and 
production and planning and provides effective decision making. For the future research direction, shall explore PN 
variants for modelling and analysing for effective decision-making.  
5. Conclusion 
This paper had focused on operational efficiency of Perishable Product Supply Chain. It initially discussed the concept 
of PPSC with Petri Net modelling technique and adopted a reference model for the explanation of Petri Net modelling 
in PPSC. It also provided an overview of different PN model types in PPSC. It has been viewed that Colored PN 
model has been maximum used in supply chain. Next step discuss the operational efficiency of PPSC. It has been 
categorized into inventory management, distribution and logistics, information sharing and supply chain risk 
management. It intends to provide the research direction of applying Petri Net modelling technique on PPSC 
(operational efficiency).  
Based on the classification of operational efficiency in PPSC, future directions has been discussed and are as follows: 
1) modelling PPSC with uncertainty, 2) reducing complexity in PPSC, 3) integration of PN modelling with emerging  
technology, 4) PN involvement in information flow and traceability and 5) application of PN modelling in decision 
making.

Abstract 
Multi-criteria decision-making is gaining high popularity in solving decision-making problems in various fields. Decision-makers 
use multi-criteria decision-making methods to solve problems daily due to their capability of decomposing complex problems to 
their simplest form. This paper aims to review the literature from 2015 to 2019 to analyze the most common methods used in 
real-world applications. A review of 89 articles is presented to conclude that Hybrid methods are the most commonly used 
techniques in real-world applications in the period of 2015 to 2019. This paper also discusses the change in the trend of multi-
criteria decision-making methods when compared to Mardani's article.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Decision making is an intricate process in which organizations suffer to obtain the final desired outcome successfully. The 
decision-making process is the act of selecting the most suitable action to fulfill the desired goals and objectives [1]. Because 
decision making is a daily task in our everyday routines, effective tools should be used to analyze all aspects of decision-making 
problems. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a well-structured and multidimensional process developed to tackle 
decision-making problems in different fields and search for the most attractive alternative with consideration of all relevant 
criteria. Due to its powerful tools, it analyzes complex decision-making problems in different fields. This method improves the 
quality of decision-making to become more rational and efficient [2]. Undoubtedly, MCDM has grown recently and been utilized 
in different fields such as sustainable energy[2,3], maintenance management [4,5], construction management[6], tourism 
management [7], machine selection [8], material selection [9], petroleum [10], supply chain management [11], aviation 
[12,13]and risk management [14]. 
 
MCDM methods are considered the most recommended tools when dealing with decision-making problems in various fields. 
Unfortunately, the identification of a single methodology in any field is difficult. Decision-makers can select different techniques 
for the same problem, and different results are approached. This is considered as the main limitation of MCDM [17]. For example, 
in the renewable energy field, Akash et al. [15] used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to select a power plant in Jordan. 
However, Mladineo et al. [16] used PROMETHE to select a small hydro plant.

Abstract 
The eight north-eastern states of India despite being tremendously rich in flora and fauna are mostly 
unexplored. These north-eastern states also have a wide range of tribal and rural products that have 
tremendous potential but are not explored to its full capacity. Unfortunately, attention has neither been paid 
by the central government or the state government to the rural products or tourism due to which these states 
have remained far behind in terms of development as compares to the other states of India. The natural 
beauty of these states attracts domestic tourists as well as foreign tourists. 
Construction of heavy industries is difficult in the north-eastern states because of its geographical location 
which acts as a huge barrier in the path of development, so an emphasis can be laid on rural tourism and 
rural products. In this paper, an effort has been made to study the socio-economic effects of growth in rural 
tourism and growth in sale of rural as well as tribal products through efficient marketing strategies and rural 
entrepreneurship. 
Keywords 
Rural Upliftment, Tourism, Efficient Marketing Strategies 
1. Introduction
India is mostly an agricultural country and 68.3% population in rural areas and in comparison the north-eastern 
states have a combined population of 45,486,784 out of which 32,771,156 live in rural areas. This means that 
72.04% of north-east population lives in rural areas, which is approximately 3.7% higher as compared to all of India. 
So if we want the upliftment of   the north-eastern states as a whole then we have to first focus on the development 
of the rural areas, which is only possible through efficient marketing strategies of rural products and tourism.  
Firstly the north-eastern states are very rich in flora and fauna and have breath-taking natural beauty but it is not 
properly encashed. A lot of revenue can be encashed by tourism in north-east India and there are lots of unexplored 
places to be visited and also the rural products can equally contribute to growth in economy if they are properly 
publicized. There are many places in Sikkim and Meghalaya which are comparable to world tourist hotspots like 
Switzerland and Venezuela. Secondly north-east India is also rich in tribal culture and has many indigenous rural

Abstract 
Sustainable development is a method, which endeavors to save an overwhelming parity state over the long 
haul. It requires the human, monetary and ecological worries to work together to guarantee 'unending life 
for mankind' in the all-inclusive regular framework. This expression talks about maintainability of human 
life by warily balancing social, financial and environmental assets in a persistently altering globe. This 
article reviews the practices of sustainable development in the South African Construction Industry. 
Economical practices are likely to wind up executed if there are discernible welfares for example; cost 
investment funds or endeavors from its inability to act; like reputational harm and lack of market share. 
However, today the construction industry is facing the environmental issues. Therefore, the construction 
industry needs to adjust and produce more sustainable homes to withstand destructive forces such as 
hurricanes and floods so as to avoid large swathes of upcoming populations losing their homes due to 
unexpected weather conditions. Construction enterprises have been moving in new technologies in order to 
stave off environmental catastrophe to push forward the sustainable development.

Introduction 
Construction is a huge, vibrant, and complex industry that portrays a significant role in the state’s economy. The roads, 
houses, workplaces, repairs and maintenances of our nation's physical infrastructure are made by construction workers 
and employees. Construction work includes working of new structures, which may contain exercises included with 
separating land available to be purchased as planning of destinations for new development. Development work 
likewise incorporates redesigns involving augmentations, modifications and fix of structures. 
Sustainable development is, accordingly, the capacity to save and grow all social, natural and monetary frameworks 
of any arrangement so that every age achieves to satisfy its very own necessities and does not compromise the ability 
of up and coming ages to accommodate them. Alban and Cardenas (2007) portray SD as 'following ecological 
insurance and applying social measures, though guaranteeing monetary possibility in modern exercises.' However, 
Bruntland (1987) believes that SD is innovation that experiences the necessities of the current exclusive of trading off 
the merchandising ability of up and coming eternities to discourse their individual matters'. With the end goal for SD 
to prosper, it is vital to receive an all-encompassing methodology in managing all issues that relates to it. As indicated 
by Flint (2007), the range of SD issues is depicted as fusing danger, morals and administration, authoritative 
prerequisites, regular capital/the green condition, social capital/society, human capital or individuals, financial capital, 
human-made capital, backhanded and initiated results, unintended outcomes and total outcomes. SD is a framework 
that subsists on the convergence of the social, financial and ecological circles. Any culpability in one of them causes 
brokenness. A proficient arrangement of administration must direct the three circles of SD. SD is accomplished just

that upsurge regular and human limits (Williams, 2007). Jason McLennan (2004: 4) divided maintainable plan as a 
""structure reasoning that tries to expand the nature of the fabricated condition while limiting or taking out the negative 
effects to the indigenous habitat."" This definition spots of intrigue the key segment of SDC, which is the objective of 
amplifying excellence and limiting undesirable effect. He watched SDC as the ""philosophical premise of the 
developing development of people and associations that actually try to re-characterize how structures are planned, 
manufactured and worked to be progressively capable to the earth and receptive to individuals"" (McLennan, 2004: 4).  
Similarly, Van der Ryn and Cowan (1996: x) accentuated the benefit of limiting ecological effect. This can be found 
in their portrayal of natural structure as ""any type of plan that limits ecological dangerous effects by incorporating 
itself with living procedures"". The principle part of this depiction, adjacent to the plan objective of limiting the negative 
effect to the earth, is the combination with living procedures. This portrayal underscores that one of the approaches to 
attain coordination with living procedures is the necessity to comprehend the setting we are structuring for, regarding 
condition, socio– social viewpoints, and the economy of a specific spot.  
Moreover, Bennetts, Radford, and Williamson (2003: ix) consider reasonable engineering as an ""overhauled 
conceptualization of design in light of a horde of contemporary worries about the impacts of human action"" that 
effectively shields the earth from contamination and debasement started by social exercises. For Bennetts, Radford, 
and Williamson (2003) 'great' plans are recognized from structures that don't attend to the adverse effect of human 
exercises on the earth. The central segment of this portrayal is that it recognizes the reason for natural corruption as 
social exercises. Social exercises are partial by the structures we make and as per WCED (1987) mankind has the bent 
to create (or not to create) advancement maintainable. This relies upon individual exercises with their plans and 
development exercises.  
The investigation acknowledges and swells to McLennan's meaning of feasible plan as a structure logic and 
development methods that seek after to augment the nature of the assembled condition on killing the negative effect 
to the common habitat, financial system and societal welfare. The quality of this description is that it features a crucial 
part of the economic structure logic, in particular this is a way to deal with plan and not a structure style (McLennan, 
2004, Van der Ryn and Cowan, 1996). A structure design can with age inevitably be eliminated or redesigned by a 
different design. Conversely the logic plan can’t leave style and can be suitable in a building. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The main focus of this article was to review on the practices of sustainable development in the South African 
construction industry. It therefore sought to broaden our perspectives that, South African construction industry is 
encountered with a number of threats, which expressively have an effect on its performance in sustainable housing 
construction. The unmet demand, due to incapacitation of the construction industry in provision of housing, is evident 
in the irregular emergence of shacks in cooperation with town and countryside communities in evolving nations. In 
order to obviate continual emergence of shack building, the South African government has legislated a sequence of 
housing rules over the years, many of which were announced to have influenced delivery of affordable housing 
significantly, though the houses built lack the tenet of sustainable development.The aim of sustainable development 
is to supply a bodily, communal and mental atmosphere in which the behavior of the people is amicably amended to 
improve the present and provide for the future. The considerations in this article have shown that awareness of 
sustainable construction is low in countless countries, situations that some authors ascribed to dearth of training and 
education on sustainable building design, dearth of pure conceptualization of sustainability, dearth of vibrant case for 
sustainability aids, and dearth of long-term perception on sustainability.

Abstract 
Learner Management Information System is very critical in the SETA setting, however, past experience 
revealed that if it does not meet the expectations of the stakeholders, services Seta will continue to 
deliver poor services to stakeholder. These poor services as a result will delay the processes because 
accreditation might not be granted on time for all relevant departments. Accreditation will continue to 
take more months than the expected timeframe. The effect of the problem will delay the stakeholder’s 
in applying for discretionary grants, tenders, training of learner’s and getting the learner’s certificate. It 
is important to address the problem now in order for Services Seta to achieve and fulfil their mandate. 
This is a problem because the system unable to meet the mandate of minimizing the timeframe related 
to the process of accreditation. This study tries to find solutions to the system problems of the Services 
Seta Learner Management Information System.  The main objectives of this study is in the direction of 
examining in what way to improve the system failure of the Learner Management Information System 
for Accreditation of Training Providers. With the main objectives, the specific objectives are:

Introduction 
Learner Management Information System is very critical in the SETA setting, however, past experience revealed 
that if it does not meet the expectations of the stakeholders, services Seta will continue to deliver poor services to 
stakeholder. These poor services as a result will delay the processes because accreditation might not be granted 
on time for all relevant departments. Accreditation will continue to take more months than the expected 
timeframe..  
Tahir and Khan (2017), did a study on intelligent reliability management in a software based cloud ecosystem 
using AGI at the National College of Business Administration and Economics in Pakistan. They conducted the 
research by ensuring that the service consumers can access these services across the networks. The population 
used was based on the service providers and other countries in order to be able to access the resources they wanted 
at any time. The strategy used was based on making sure that the cloud ecosystem was accessible and beneficially 
to all. The methods that they proposed, in the intelligent reliability management in software based cloud 
ecosystem, will work in an autonomous way and they used qualitative research methodology. They used the 
measures of framework computing. They were not supposed to give out the access to everybody because people 
could hack into other peoples’ profiles and they should have the limits. The researcher found that, there are many 
factors that could generate on problems related to the Network failure, browser crush. When users are facing these 
types of faults, they usually resubmit their requests. They did not address the weaknesses, but they did identify 
them.

learner information management system. Exploratory Factor Analysis shows respondents ranking of zone picking 
benefits in South African manufacturing industry.  
The objective of this research study was to improve the system failure of Learner Management Information 
System: Case Study of Training Providers at Services Seta. This has been accomplished by recognizing models 
and techniques by using questionnaires to see what needs to be introduced and what challenges are there to be 
rectified. Therefore, the following conclusions were drawn from the research study 
Without a digitized functional system for learners, Service Seta will not be able to fulfil orders or render its service 
to clients within agreed deadlines. Once a firm fail to honour its obligations to its clients, it runs the risk of 
tarnishing its image in the marketplace. In order to hedge the firm against such risks Service seta need to invest 
in latest learner information management technologies. These technologies ensure that client information are 
processed in real-time.  
 
Internationally most service provider’s activities are driven by advanced Information management systems. These 
systems are credited for delivering one of the world acclaimed data management systems. It is without doubt that 
the USA runs one the most sophisticated information management service system in the world. This make the 
USA model a good example to follow or emulate. 
 
In Africa, generally lack of technology is still a major factor and in order to grab market share from these resourced 
rivals such as the ones in USA etc., African-based service organisations need to embrace the digital revolution. 
The digitalization of the learner information management system in Africa is long overdue. The future of this 
sector lies in its ability to modernize its internal infrastructure as well as its ability to strengthen the skill sets of 
its champions.   
 
Recommendations 
 
It is recommended that Improved Learner management information system (ILMIS)be introduced, it is a software-
based application that is used to manage, control and manipulate data processes, procedures in a way that deliver 
greater cost efficiencies to a service organisations. Africa as a whole can benefit a lot especially looking at how 
this system is utilized globally. 
 
Recommendations to Future research 
Some participants with intimate knowledge on the factors that can improve the system failure of Learner 
Management Information System in Service Seta failed to complete the questionnaire and the focus was also in 
Gauteng province. Further study can be made in larger research area and more respondents in order to gain deeper 
understanding.

Abstract 
Despite limited research into postponement strategy in the supply chain as customer’s satisfaction enablers, 
there has been significant interest from the role players in adopting postponement strategy especially in the 
automotive industry. The digital age and the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution has change the business 
landscape substantially. Customers are more demanding and their demands are growing exponentially with 
technological advancement and globalization. Those changes has constrained business to compete over 
supply chain, which is the heart of many successful business strategic decision. As South Africa desperately 
need economic growth to curb the high unemployment (30%). As a major contributor to the GDP and 
employing up to 457 000 (Smith; 2019) people in South Africa, increasing the current market share and 
ensuring customer retention and loyalty is crucial in achieving these objective. This paper explore how 
customers satisfaction can be enhance by using their input at the customers decoupling points, so that the 
customers perceived value of the products and services can be equal or greater than the expected value. A 
cross sectional quantitative research  was conducted among south Africa car owner, of which out of the two 
million registered owners, a random sample has chosen 484 respondents, which is slightly higher that the 
recommended size recommended by the Slovin’s formula at 95% confidences level. It was hypothesized 
that more customer output in the supply chain service and product in the automobile increase customer 
satisfaction which hypothesis was accepted. More customer input trough the postponement strategy, at the 
customers decoupling point increases customers perceived value, leading to improve satisfaction. The main 
finding has shown that there is positive correlation all along between customers inputs trough the 
postponements strategy and customers satisfaction level, the association of the customers' input and the 
respondent genders was not significant and thus suggested that when correlating customers satisfaction and 
postponements strategy, the gender should not use as the mitigate variables. This study has found that 
postponements strategies in the automobiles supply chain in South African can be used as a main catalyser 
for services quality improvement, as more value gets added by customers inputs in the and the process 
leading to customers expectation been met, making them satisfied. The supply chain should thus grape the 
opportunity of the 4IR, the connectivity to establish better communications focusing on the end users, to 
grow the industry and achieved customers' satisfaction, retentions and loyalty. E-commerce is here to stay, 
and, everything can be purchased online; hence, globalization has removed the majority of trade barriers. 
The local market first, followed by the regional market as many south African neighbouring countries are 
still purchasing second hand and new vehicles from abroad and finally to their marketing to the continental 
level

South Africa automobile supply network; however, the most critical component of the chain, which is the end-users 
has not been given the attention it deserves. Engineer To Order, Manufacturer To Order, Assembly To Order have so 
far been well implemented. Unfortunately, the Make To Stock, the variable of full speculation is not a real 
postponement strategy because there is no substantial input from the end-users, as the 4IR give the end-users more 
choices, measures should be taken to accommodate this critical component of the network.  Understanding it would 
have been difficult to achieve considerable input to the process and product design from the end-user, the 4IR offers 
an opportunity that can be used to reach customers and has more input but also that can be a threat if not properly 
managed, given the extensive networking.  These actions should be carried out on a regular customer satisfaction 
survey, market and marketing research as the most appropriate mass communication with the customers.  
The inputs from the customers will give the supply network and the industry more knowledge of customer's what 
expectations for what segment of clients.  Understanding customers' expectation is the cornerstones of customers' 
value add, customer retention and loyalty and satisfaction. As proposed by the framework offers by this study on how 
to enhance customer satisfaction using postponement strategy across the supply network.  Since improving satisfaction 
trough postponement strategy is income level specific, job status specific and age range specific, the automotive supply 
network needs to deploy more resources and emphasise more on the middle-income level, working adult age from 25 
to 45 years old and. Full speculation should be revisited to realigned the end-users expectation and organisation 
strategy while using the technology to remain affordable on the market the network services and to explore the new 
market. 
 
6. Conclusion  
South Africa is still struggling with rising unemployment, the inequality that has been exacerbated and is going to be 
pressurized by the fourth industrial revolution, which impact can be adverse on the labour market that is already 
struggling to grow the economy. The primary purpose of this research was to design a framework for customer 
satisfaction using the postponement strategy. Service and operation excellence in the automobile supply chain of the 
country is one of the main catalysers of value add across the chain, customers retention and loyalty.  Customer loyalty 
and retention should be trough satisfaction and not the lack of choice from the customer perspective. As the major 
contributor to the country economy, the South Africa automobile industry is at the centre of job creations and economic 
growth, thus addressing many social ills such as inequality, unemployment's, poverty and crime to name a few. It is 
therefore imperative to satisfy the customers to expect growth of the industry, which translates into job creation and 
economy growth and life improvement 
This study has found that postponements strategies in the automobiles supply chain in South African can be used as a 
main catalyser for services quality improvement, as more value gets added by customers inputs in the and the process 
leading to customers expectation been met, making them satisfied. Postponements strategies results in customers 
inputs in the process or product they acquire at the customer decoupling point, enhance values add perceptions of the 
clients on the supply chain 
At the dawn of the 4IR, taking into considerations its adverse impact on the untransformed current South Africa labour, 
the postponements strategies should be entranced in the supply chain strategy to achieve higher satisfaction and 
retention of its customers base and growth more customers base as it grows its industry. The supply chain should thus 
grape the opportunity of the 4IR, the connectivity to establish better communications focusing on the end users, to 
grow the industry and achieved customers' satisfaction, retentions and loyalty. E-commerce is here to stay, and, 
everything can be purchased online; hence, globalization has removed the majority of trade barriers. The local market 
first, followed by the regional market as many south African neighbouring countries are still purchasing second hand 
and new vehicles from abroad and finally to their marketing to the continental level. The demand is enormous, and 
the jobs demand too is hiking, so fulfilling customers’ demand they will translate into economic growth and jobs 
creation.

The South African automotive manufacturing capacity has not been reached, the company import more than its 
exports, which paint a bleak picture for the South Africa balance of payment (BOP). This should be an opportunity 
for South Africa to tap into to solve some of the problem currently encountered in the society, of which job creation 
should be the priority of the aim, in line with the economic growth. This study was conducted using a concurrent 
mixed method to offset the disadvantage of the mono-method; however, the South Africa automobile supply network 
does not start in South Africa and does not end in South Africa only; hence many are from imports and many from 
exports as well. As the study sample was drawn from South Africa alone, it is recommended that future research 
should incorporate customers from other sections of the supply network.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the model of job demands and resources on employees’ job performance by 
using factor analysis approach. Using a sample of 183 employees, the study investigated four variables of 
job demands including quantitative, problem solving, attention and responsibility demands and five 
variables of job resources including skill variety, task significance, task identity, job security and 
feedback via factor analysis approach. Confirmatory factor analyses in the sample supported the 
superiority of the proposed model and the results suggest that the scales of model are valid instruments 
for testing the model of job demands and resources.

Job Demands, Job Resources, Employees and Factor Analysis Approach. 
1. Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model
The job demands-resources (JD-R) model is an occupational stress model that suggests strain is a response to 
imbalance between demands on the individual and the resources he or she has to deal with those demands (Moodie 
et al., 2014). The JD-R model became highly popular among researchers (Moodie et al., 2014). The current version 
of the model proposes that high job demands lead to strain and health impairment (the health impairment process), 
and that high resources lead to increased motivation and higher productivity (the motivational process). The JD-R 
model developed by Demerouti and his associates (Demerouti et al., 2001), the JD-R model can be used as a tool to 
manage human resources in organizations because it can be applied to a wide range of occupations to improve 
employee wellbeing and job performance (Bakker et al., 2013).  
JD-R model argues that the factors or characteristics salient in a work environment determine the performance of 
employees at work (Moodie et al., 2014). According to this model, there are two general categories of work 
environment i.e. job demands and job resources study (Moodie et al., 2014; Bakker et al., 2013). Job demands are 
the physical, psychological, social and organizational factors which require constant physical and psychological 
efforts or skills and are therefore linked to physical and psychological costs whereas job resources are the physical, 
psychological, psychological, social and organizational aspects of a job which enable the achievement of goals and 
objectives while at the work place, reduce the negative effects associated with job demands to encourage personal 
growth, learning and development” (Luo et al., 2015).  
The model also proposes two psychological processes that take place as a result of the existence of perceived job 
demands and resources (Michelle, 2013). These processes relate to health deficiency and motivation. The health 
impairment process occurs when jobs are designed badly or those whose demands chronically deplete a worker’s 
mental and physical resources which reduce energy and degrade health situation (Michelle, 2013). The motivational 
process is where job resources brings forth their motivating potential and cause the workers to show high levels of

The third factor (task identity) consisted of four items and explained 13.696% of the variance in job resources 
construct. The fourth factor (task significance) consisted of four items and explained 9.709% of the variance in job 
resources construct. The last factor (skill variety) consisted four items and explained 7.840% of the variance in job 
resources construct. However, two items of skill variety such as item 2 and 4 loaded below .50 and were dropped 
from further analysis. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The present study showed that the instruments that are broadly used to measure job demands and job resources are 
meaningful, when these instruments are used. The factor analysis results from SPSS suggest that job demands and 
job resources are valid instruments for testing the model. In addition, the findings of factor analysis provided 
evidence supporting the reliability and the-factor structure of the JD-R model Scale for employees when evaluated 
with a Somaliland Telecommunication employees’ sample in this study. Thus, it is appropriate to use the JD-R 
model for the assessment of the job demands and job resources of the employees.

Abstract 
 
In this era of the modern business environment, organizations have to constantly adapt and react to new ecological 
challenges. Therefore, it is critical for organizations to adopt various eco-friendly practices and processes and 
involve their employees in such practices; thereby achieving organizations’ environmental goals. The objective of 
this paper is to investigate the impact of Green Human Resources Management (GHRM) practices as a bundle on 
environmental, economic, social and operational performance within the manufacturing sector of Palestine. The 
paper employs a quantitative research methodology. Data collected through surveys from 121 Palestinian 
manufacturing firms to test hypotheses using partial least square of structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The 
statistical analysis revealed that GHRM bundle practices have a positive influence on the four dimensions of 
organizational performance. The findings of this study can help manufacturing firms in identifying efficacious 
tactics for adopting GHRM practices that take part in sustainable development.

1. Introduction 
 
Growing attention towards environmental sustainability has been inducing stress for firms into being more 
conscious of their environmental effects. Such a phenomenon is especially faced by highly contaminating industries, 
which are particularly pressured with these issues (Masri and Jaaron, 2017). It has been found that previously green 
human resources management (GHRM) focused on individual practices (Longoni et al., 2016), this study perceived 
GHRM practices as a “bundle” that can improve the sustainable performance of a firm. Basically, this is 
corresponding with the study of Renwick et al. (2013) which calls for more studies to be conducted in investigating

Abstract 
Waste reduction practices are applicable to virtually any construction and demolition project scenario. The goal is to 
divert materials from landfill disposal to the greatest extent practicable under any circumstances. There are two 
opinions about whether this is a realistic expectation under real world project conditions. One is that waste reduction 
processes cost money, and the other is that waste reduction saves money. As with any construction project, planning 
and project management will ultimately dictate whether the waste reduction is accomplished within the established 
cost, schedule, and quality parameters. Considering the waste reduction cost to disposal variances, this study is aimed 
at determining the impact of construction and demolition waste reduction techniques employed in the various projects 
on construction sites so as to actualizing green building attainment. A well-structured 100 structured questionnaires 
were constructed and distributed, while a rational number of 78 data were collected. A mean-item score and standard 
deviation were used to identify the levels of impact and rank each waste reduction techniques accordingly. There are 
seven-7 categories of indicators of waste reduction or management called the “Zero Waste Hierarchy 7.0” which were 
developed to carry out an impact analysis. Furthermore, the impact analysis was used to determine how waste 
reduction practices could impact green building projects in Gauteng, South Africa. In the findings, the categories of 
waste reduction indicators used to indicate that avoidance of complex design and detailing, developing resilient 
secondary material recovery, and optimizing the waste management system is one of the greatest waste reduction 
techniques that have a huge impact on green building projects delivery in Gauteng, South Africa. Thus, an 
understanding of the waste reduction system implemented, response to waste management policy, and ultimate 
evaluation of the performance of the construction industry in utilizing waste reduction techniques on-site is discovered. 
Also, the challenges or obstacles to the utilization of waste reduction techniques are identified. Also, with the 
knowledge of the waste reduction techniques practiced in Gauteng province, this study makes known the optimality 
of these waste reduction techniques with potentially huge environmental benefits that could be obtained in using them. 
This indicates whether the waste reduction techniques are an optimal option and as such highlighted how it can impact 
green building projects delivery for achieving a balance in the economic, social and environmental impacts of 
development in South Africa. Moreover, the need for Africa developing countries to shift from the usual culture of 
landfilling to more sustainable waste reduction techniques is endorsed.

1. Introduction
The construction industry is an important investment-led sector that contributes greatly to the growth of any
economy in the world. It provides physical infrastructure and services that stimulate and enhance economic activities 
and enable social development (Ekanayake and Ofori, 2000). The industry has evolved from the ancient labour 
intensive industry that produced relatively simple buildings that were material intensive and designed rather

4.3 Interpretation of results 
In the findings, the categories of waste reduction indicators show the various reduction techniques practiced and how 
its impact various green building projects in Gauteng, South Africa. The respondents indicate that avoidance complex 
design and detailing with 0.790 standard deviation has the greatest impact on green building project in category-1. In 
category-2, selection of materials that maximize the usable lifespan and opportunies for continuous use with 0.906 
standard deviation has the greatest impact. In category-3, developing resilient secondary materials markets with 0.856 
standard deviation has the greatest impact. In categogy-4, maximizing material recovery with 0.861 standard deviation 
has the greatest impact. In category-5, minimizing negative impact on the environment with 0.964 standard deviation 
is the greatest indicator of the impact of waste reduction on green building. In category-6, optimization of waste 
management system with 1.009 standard deviation and in category-7, awareness among clients and contractors with 
1.058 is indicated as the greatest impact of waste reduction practices on green project in Gauteng, South Africa. The 
indicators rank-1 is considered the indicator having the greatest impact. Therefore, such waste reduction practices are 
considered the best to be utilized in order to effective achieve a green building project delivery. 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
In South Africa, green building is considered the highest eco-friendly practices which can eliminate waste and the 
government encouraged every stakeholder in the construction industry embraces the culture. The waste reduction 
techniques indicators used can as well be a performance evaluation tool for determine how optimal the waste 
management system is and as well be able to identify possible future area where an improvement might be considered. 
Also, with the knowledge of waste reduction techniques practiced, the optimality of these waste reduction techniques 
with potentially huge environmental benefits that could be obtained in using them is identified in this study. From the 
results, every indication point to the facts that the waste reduction techniques practiced is an optimal option and as 
such can impact green building projects delivery for achieving a balance in the economic, social and environmental 
impacts of development in South Africa. Moreover, there is a need for other Africa developing country to shift from 
the usual culture of landfilling to more sustainable waste reduction techniques some which is identified in this study. 
In conclusion, the other waste reduction techniques should not be ignored as its highly dynamic and as well has a great 
impact on green building projects. Therefore, further studies should consider optimizing waste reduction techniques 
on construction sites to assist decision and policy makers on the best way to manage waste on sites.

Abstract 
Reading is a complex process involving many different parts of the developing brain. Language 
acquisition, symbolic representation, and the ability to hear and discriminate between sounds are all 
developmental abilities that are acquired over time and cannot be forced or rushed.. The aim of research is 
to find out how far the word card media was effective to improve early reading skill of group B students 
at TK Kemala Bhayangkari Kota Ternate. This research applied classroom action research. It consisted of 
20 students of first semester academic years 2017/2018. The quantitative data collected using rate of 
percentage and qualitative data collected using observation, interview technique and analyzed 
descriptively. From this research, it was concluded that the students reading skill was improved after the 
implementation of word cards media in class. It could be seen in average score for each test that showed 
improvement from 60% (12 students) to 80% (16 students) from 20 students. In addition, 8 students failed 
in the criteria of success in reading on their first evaluation, finally they success on their second 
evaluation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the implementation of word media can improve the young 
learners reading skill.

more information by the print on the page (Brown 2001:299). In early reading activity, kindergarten students are not 
only reading the text, but also trying to be aware of words, to increase their intelligence as well as their vocabularies. 
Being able to apply the exact word to communicate what we mean benefit both speaker and listener or reader. At 
any time, they can expand the content on the word card to include part of the speech, synonym, antonym or other 
features.  
Early childhood education is the basic education aimed to stimulus students from birth up to the age of six by 
providing education to help the growth and development of physical and spiritual so that students have readiness in 
entering further education held on formal, informal and informal. Kindergarten is an early childhood education 
institution on formal education that organizes education programs for students aged 4-6 years. Children are in the 
process of the growth period, namely the development of all aspects of the physical ability, cognitive, language, 
social and emotional growing rapidly. Moreover, the child is an individual who has a particular characteristic of 
every aspect of its development especially language skills.  Based on observation conducted in TK Bhayangkari 
Kota Ternate, that in general, learning to read is done is to follow the orders of teacher a child with a task in a work-
sheet even by having children write and read the words on the board. Students at the group B had difficulties in early 
reading, because they are not familiar with certain words, less understanding of the meaning of words and also less 
interest to read. Moreover, the way of teachers in teaching seems monotonous and the learning process does not 
vary, less maximizes the use of learning media so that students quickly feel bored. In this case, their ability deal with 
early reading ability is still low. It can be seen in answering some related questions to the reading contain.

of the evaluation of cycle I. From 20 students, which reached the Number result of 16 students (80%) and 4 students 
(20%), they are AR, TR, IQ, and NL due the student just understands some letters that have not been able to read 
them. 
 
 
 
3.2. Discussion 
From the finding in cycle I and cycle II, it shows that by using word card media can improve the kindergarten 
student ability in early reading  skill especially class B2 TK Kemala Bhayangkari Ternate academic year 2017/2018. 
This can be seen from the results obtained at the end of the cycle to measure the success achieved. The rate 
percentage of students in cycle I is 60%, 4 students (20%) got very good (BSB), 8 students (40%) got the (BSH), 
and 8 students (40%) got (MB). The improvement of students in cycle I is good enough, but not in accordance with 
the indicators to be achieved. In this case, there are still some students who have not understood the material 
submitted by researchers due to students less attention and play alone, they cannot know the letters so that they are 
less interested to read. There are still students who are reluctant and shy to guess the word card shown, because they 
cannot read well. In addition, in guessing and reading the word card, students are assigned to connect card with 
words. Some students have not been able to complete the task given, there are students who are lazy, they do not 
understand the task given, they want to color the picture only, and also they have not been able to recognize the 
writings.

Figure I prove that the completeness of students’ early reading is good. In  cycle I, it reaches 40% and decreases in 
cycle II 20% while the completion in cycle I reaches 60% and 20% increase in cycle II, it reaches 80%. The 
improvement has reached the expected indicator that is 75% of the success rate of students. It also supports the 
opinion of Doman in Aulia (2012: 94); the use of word cards is one of the media that can be used to stimulate the 
coordination of the eyes and ears of students, so as to increase the student's teaching learning. In conclusion, the 
ability of students in class B of TK Kemala Bhayangkari Ternate  in early reading is good, so it does not need to 
continue in next cycle.

Abstract 
Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA) jointly published 
a FMEA handbook to be used by automotive suppliers to assist them in development of FMEA. Since the 
handbook newly published in June 2019, there are several issues in adopting the reference manual.  This 
paper explores the common issues and benefits in developing the Process FMEA by using the the AIAG-
VDA handbook through two case study. The output of this paper provide the commentary of strength, 
benefit and issues in developing PFMEA through AIAG-VDA FMEA handbook.  
Keywords: 
Risk Assessment, Risk Management, FMEA, Operation Management, IATF. 
1. Introduction
The reference manual that outline the guideline for Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) published by Automotive 
Industry Action Group (AIAG) 4th edition in year 2008, has been updated with new handbook. The new handbook 
was published jointly by AIAG which is based in United States of America and Verband der Automobilindustrie 
(VDA) which is based in Germany in June 2019.  In 2017-2018, we conducted case study in implementation of FMEA 
and determined that there are seven issues in implementation of FMEA and concluded as followed (Ramly and Atan, 
2018): 
PFMEA is proven risk assessment methodology to prevent defects. However, there are seven issues that face by the 
organization and the team that develop the PFMEA for their manufacturing process. The issues include determining 
whether to develop the design FMEA or process FMEA, setting up the objectives of PFMEA, determining the 
processes, determining the severity score, listing the causes, determining occurrence score, determining control and 
prioritizing the improvement. Each of the issue have the proposed solution as discussed in previous paper. The future 
research should focus on linking the PFMEA and other quality improvement tools such as cause and effect diagram, 
control plan and application of PFMEA in quality improvement initiatives such as six sigma and lean manufacturing. 
Hence this paper conducted additional case study with two organization in order to study and provide commentary: 
-
The main difference between the AIAG 4th Edition FMEA handbook vs AIAG-VDA 1st edition handbook;
-
The benefit of implementing the PFMEA according to AIAG-VDA FMEA handbook;
-
The issues and limitation of the AIAG-VDA FMEA handbook;

3. Discussion 
 
Apart of benefit, strength and limitation in comparing with previous study result, additional strength and limitation of 
AIAG-VDA FMEA handbook were found. The additional strength and limitation are discussed below. 
 
1. FMEA Success Factors  
 
In addition, the handbook outline the success factors in section 1.3 of the handbook. Section 1.3 outline the success 
factors in integration of FMEA in the company that include, 1) several potential considerations of the FMEA i.e. real, 
true, realistic, complete; 2) Senior Management Commitment, 3) Know-How protection and 3) development of 
foundation and family FMEAs. However, the example is limited and further study on the FMEA development and 
implementation critical success factor is highly recommended. 
 
2. Implementation/ Adoption Strategy 
 
There is no specific transition period to adopt the 2019 AIAG/ VDA FMEA framework especially for IATF certified 
organization. Several car makers specified to their supplier should adopt the new FMEA framework when there is a 
new project. From the case study conducted, both organization are not bind by their customer to adopt the new format. 
Hence, for the start, the team agreed to use the new framework for the purposed of solving customer complaints on 
their quality issued.  
 
3. Linkage to other quality tools and techniques 
 
2019 AIAG/ VDA FMEA handbook provide no clear linkage several important quality and techniques such as linkage 
to control plan, cause and effect diagram, and process approaches turtle diagram. However the handbook outline the 
linkages to AIAG Advance Product Quality Planning (APQP) and VDA Maturity Level Agreement (MLA). The 
handbook also outline in step 1 of planning and preparation to determine the tools as part of five “T” in project plan 
which are intent, Timing, Team, Task and Tools. 
 
4. Level of detail in PFMEA 
 
Due to number of steps to develop the PFMEA increase in the 2019 AIAG/ VDA FMEA framework, more space 
required especially if the organization used the worksheet software such as excel. The information cannot be presented 
on single page. Hence it is difficult to present the information in the PFMEA. Same goes to the level of detail to work 
elements. Even though there is no solution provide by the team, the used of guided software application is highly 
recommended by the team to provide clear guide to determine the information required by PFMEA and recommended 
the space to store the information for future use.  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
2019 AIAG/ VDA FMEA handbook provide the systematic framework to conduct technical product and process risk 
assessment to prevent defect.  Potential Failure Modes and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes 
(PFMEA) is an important preventive method for quality assurance, and through it informed action priority 
methodology provide decisions based on the severity levels and probabilities of occurrences and detection of the 
failure modes. The framework also can be effectively applied for problem solving techniques.  Both version of PFMEA 
have been develop according to AIAG (2009) and AIAG VDA (2019) version have been developed, review and tested 
in case organizations. However, there are several issues that potentially face by the organizations that implement 
several management systems such as there is limited specific tools and techniques provided, limited space to fill in 
the format provided, and limited example of intent and adoption strategy.

The future research should focus on linking the PFMEA framework with other quality tools and study the effectiveness 
through the result and the performance improvement after adopting the FMEA. More case study is required on 
different context of organization, different industry and sector, difference business process and difference size of 
organization.

Abstract 
In this project paper, the authors are going to utilize and use the knowledge, techniques, and skills of the 
industrial engineering department courses that can be applied to design and implement an automated parcel 
sorting system that utilizes OCR (Optical Characteristic Recognition), ASR (Automatic Speech 
Recognition), and robot arm. The Authors are aiming to improve the productivity and the efficiency of the 
sorting process and provide an economic and ergonomic system. Also, the Authors are going to improve 
the recognition accuracy since the OCR work very well with flat objects, but the performance decreases 
and the error rate increases with the parcels (due to curvature). The Authors are going to combine between 
the OCR and the ASR to improve the accuracy. In addition, in order to reduce the high cost of manual 
workers the Authors are going to utilize a robot arm, which is faster, efficient, and functional. 
Key Words: Automatic mail sorting, postal automation, optical character recognition, automatic speech 
recognition, robot arm.  
1. Introduction
Nowadays, E-commerce has become widely used and the orders from the E-commerce increase in every day in 
proportion to its popularity. Moreover, because of the increase of the orders, the sorting of the parcels become such a 
hard process especially at the annual events when the orders multiply such as the Pilgrim day and Eid's events. In 
addition, as the manual way in sorting the parcels has a high error rate, low productivity, low performance rate and 
uncomfortable for the worker. For example, according to Saudi post four workers sort 200 parcels in one hour. The 
Authors are going to design and implement an automated parcel sorting system that will replace the manual parcel 
sorting system in order to increase the productivity, performance rate, decrease the error rate and increase 
comfortability. This system can be classified as an artificial intelligence system by utilizing OCR, ASR, and Robot 
Arm. 
The system the authors proposing start with the OCR process. The OCR will take a photo for the label address in the 
parcel. If the input of the OCR is recognized, the robot arm will deliver the parcel to the destination shelf. If the input 
from the OCR is not recognized, the robot arm will deliver the parcel to the error shelf. The system will keep working 
and all the parcels that are not recognized will be hold in the error shelf. As it is shown in the figure.

The figure shows histogram that the time for the test of OCR per frequency and the maximum time was 1.75 s and 
minimum was 0.50 s. 
 
Figure 12 Histogram of OCR processing time 
 
4.3 Processing time of Robot arm  
After the parcel get recognized by OCR or ASR the robot arm function comes next. As mentioned above according to 
Saudi post four workers sort 200 parcels in one hour. But here after did a real experiment by using an educational 
robot arm in the process of parcels sorting the Authors found that the robot can sort 863 parcels in one hour with mean 
processing time equal 2.9 second. 
5. Simulate the System 
By using Arena software, which is a software can simulate any system; the authors built the system 
model in the Arena and used all the data from the experiments on the ASR, OCR and the robot 
arm. This step is done to simulate the system for eight hours since the experiments is done while 
having a lack of resources. And from the Arena results we found that the sorted parcels in the eight 
hours shift is 7123 parcel, and the value added time for each parcel is 5.6 seconds. 
6. Conclusion  
In this project paper, the authors has described clearly the importance of automatic sorting process. It is more 
productive, ergonomic and functional than the manual sorting. Also, the authors has represented a multimodal system 
for an automated parcel sorting system which includes OCR, ASR, and Robot Arm. In addition, the Authors has done 
some experiments related to processing time and error rate for ASR and OCR in order to find statistical data using 
Minitab software. Also the authors used Arena software to simulate the system for eight hours since the experiments 
is done while having a lack of resources.

Abstract 
Since 9/11, Muslim students are easily grouped and engaged each other to share knowledge, resources, 
and soft skill, as a response to reject negative stereotypes from their surroundings. This study aims to 
analyze the engagement of Muslim students to their organizations based on personality and intrinsic 
motivation. A comparative study using consecutive sampling between two groups of student 
organizations; public organization (PO) and religious organization (RO). Personality traits were measured 
using a big five personality construct with 12-items Newcastle Personality Assessor (NPA-12). The 
engagement was measured with the 12-items engagement questionnaire (ENG-12). Both questionnaires 
were validated and reliability tested in Bahasa Indonesia. Intrinsic motivation about the organization was 
elaborated through essays in three questions; expectations, facts, and future plans. The confidence interval 
was 95%. Questionnaires are feasible to be used in this study. The number of engaged students between 
the two groups was significantly different, PO members are more engaged than RO. Engagement in both 
organizations is affected by conscientiousness. After intrinsic motivation was added in the regression 
model, it has a mediation effect on engagement; neuroticism is affecting engagement negatively, while 
intrinsic motivation is affecting positively. Muslim students are more engaged in public organizations.

INTRODUCTION 
The rising of middle class Muslim has become a major issue in this country. This growth is marked by increasing 
Muslim attention for their religion, and increasing awareness of Islamic education. Many Muslims are united and 
assembled to join the religious organizations. This spirit is transmitted to Muslim students attending public schools. 
Although they are in a public school, their passion for carrying Islamic values will not fade. They not only want to 
excel in common values, but also their Islamic values (Azra and Jamhari, 2006). 
Student organization was labeled as “other education” played a big role to facilitate students to learn soft skills they 
did not learn from university curriculums. Research showed that the more students engaged to their organizations,

main reason, why students are more engaged to public organization compared with religious organization. Public 
organization provides more chance to get together with different people, resources, and experiences. 
The effect of intrinsic motivation is becoming the main finding in this study. As it is added to regression model, 
conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness are not taking effect to engagement anymore and replaced by 
neuroticism. Regression model shows that the higher value of neuroticism, the lower score of predicted student 
engagement, while intrinsic motivation is otherwise. Neuroticism is a trait that related to anxiety and emotional 
exhaustion (Azeem, 2013). This finding supports Western research about religion, which neuroticism is linked with 
perception about God as punitive instead of loving, while agreeableness is linked otherwise (Smither and Walker, 
2015).  
This study shows that people with intrinsic motivation tends to be easy to experience anxiety, similar with extrinsic 
motivation that related to anxiety and lack of self-independence. Previous study shows that Muslim may be 
vulnerable to anxiety in their attachment to God (Ghorbani et al., 2016). A dogma in Muslim’s belief, that sin and 
mistake will be forgiven and blessed with multiple rewards through act of service to other (Khan et al., 2015), 
including activities in organization.  
The need for attachment to significant figures, in this case God, is a simple description of intrinsic religious 
motivation. In various cultures, including in Indonesia always can be found temples of worship such as candi, as the 
evidence that humans are always looking for the “supreme existence”. This “God-attachment” type seems anxious 
and not self-determined as Western researchers find among Christian. This anxious God-attachment is correlated 
negatively with avoidance behavior, means that the more Muslims anxious, the more they get closer or in other 
words, the more they “surrender” to God (Ghorbani et al., 2016). 
As long as the need of God-attachment has not been integrated as self-determination, this need will be perceived as 
demands of necessity that cause emotional exhaustion (Aghababaei and Tabik, 2013; Ghorbani et al., 2016). God 
will be projected as external object and not integrated in self. Another dogma in Islam that religion is not sourced 
outside but inside (fitrah), believed that God is All-understanding of human needs, and all human need to do is 
“believe, surrender, and do the good deeds”. 
Because the interpretation, perception to experience, and commitment about God and religion sometimes influenced 
by culture (Watson, Chen and Ghorbani, 2014), further research of personality traits that linked to religious 
orientation and motivation among Indonesian people is needed.

CONCLUSIONS 
Muslim students are more engaged to public organization. Personality traits alone can predict student engagement 
through conscientiousness, but intrinsic motivation has mediation effect together with neuroticism to student 
engagement.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has prominent roles in today’s world, it helps with the widespread deployment of practical 
speech identification, device translation, autonomous machine, and household robotics. It is a great deal of empirical 
progress, specifically in the enhancement of probabilistic learning, machine learning, internet appliance, and computer 
vision. The advancement of AI has even been portrayed in popular culture, such as in Steven Spielberg’s film titled 
A.I. Artificial Intelligence showcases how a robotic boy is capable of expressing emotions and feelings of love to his

the field of agriculture UMG IdeaLab offers an integrated and smart logic solution starts from planting, informing 
seed availability, providing information about labor, production, and quality control by utilizing AI technology.  
 
UMG IdeaLab has supported 33 affiliated companies that are considered innovative and provide solutions for 
Indonesia. UMG IdeaLab's efforts to focus on Indonesian startups were shown seriously by providing funding to 
startups, such as PT. MSMB (agricultural AI solution), Widya Wicara, Widya Robotic (AI Robotic), Frogs 
(Autonomous Drone), Artificial Intelligence Center Indonesia (AICI – AI education in university), Bahasakita (Speech 
Engine in Bahasa Indonesia), Botika (Chatbot AI), Skiloka (for AI Training and Workshop).  
 
PT. Mitra Sejahtera Membangun Bangsa (MSMB), UMG IdeaLab’s affiliated company, created integrated software 
and application to enable farmers to sell their product to the customers, increase farming productivity, and provide all 
farming data information. MSMB won in many start-up competitions in Indonesia and worldwide, including being 
the finalist of Intellectual Property Innovation and Entrepreneur Competition Global (IPIEC Global) in Shanghai, 
China. PT Mitra Sejahtera Pembangunan Bangsa (MSMB) which was established on February 15, 2018 has a vision 
to be a technology pioneer in agriculture, animal husbandry, fish farming and farmers education of technology in 
Indonesia. MSMB is one of the startups chosen by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Bappenas as partners in 
implementing the Leveraging ICT for Irrigated Agricultural Extension program in some cities, such as Pasaman at 
West Sumatra and Sukabumi at West Java in Indonesia.  
 
In agricultural AI solution, the data from the RiTx Water Discharge Sensor is processed to determine the right water 
treatment and planting system that is in accordance with the amount of water available in real time. Water Debit Sensor 
can detect, measure, and record water levels and water currents and send data to a server to make the information 
accessible through mobile application in real time. This RiTx Soil and Weather Sensor can inform the accurate soil 
conditions and current weather forecasts for the next eight days. This tool can detect the temperature, soil moisture, 
pH (acidity) of the soil, EC (electrical conductivity) of the soil, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed and 
direction, and even rainfall to determine the appropriate treatment of the land. Sensors can also accurately record data 
about the condition of agricultural weather (agro-climate) and agricultural land (soil). Therefore, by making this 
information available on mobile application, farmers will able able to tend the needs of its plantation and anticipate 
situations for successful harvests.  
 
RiTx Drone Surveillance from Frog Company is also making it easy for plantation mapping, agriculture, and mining. 
You can map land fertility and crop conditions, crop density on the land, irrigation paths and landslide potential, as 
well as agricultural potential. RiTx Drone has the ability to determine whether the land is suitable for rice, oil palm or 
corn fields. It is equipped with RGB and NIR cameras that can produce 2D and 3D maps as well as soil and plant 
fertility maps. With RiTx Drone Sprayer, fertilizers and pesticides can be spread on an area of 1 ha in just 15 minutes, 
which is more effective and efficient compared to manually doing it with hands. The drone can carry as much as 20L 
fertilizer, and it can cover 1 ha in 10 minutes. The spraying effectiveness is at 70 percent, and thus, it can reduce the 
cost of spraying services up to 30 percent. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been helping humans doing many jobs more efficiently. The fact 
that AI applications can be used to optimize farming, manufacturing, medical care, household work, and education 
indicate its significant role in our today’s society. The UMG IdeaLab has been supporting the enhancement of AI in 
order to solve humans’ problems in many sectors, including business and agriculture. The affiliated company, such as 
PT. MSMB, for instance, is capable of providing the software and applications to help the farmers increase their 
agricultural productivity. UMG IdeaLab also has Crowde application, a peer-to-peer lending platform, which enables 
people to invest in local farmers. The startup companies funded and supported by UMG IdeaLab has won many 
awards, both nationally and internationally. In the future, UMG IdeaLab aims to help university students to learn more 
about artificial intelligence, such as robotic, startup business, and applications.

 Abstract 
Corregidor Inn is a hotel and accommodations company that handles trips, ferries, food, and lodging to 
Corregidor Island, a historical tourist destination in the Philippines. The company has observed a steady 
decline of annual visitors to the island and consequently experienced a hefty opportunity loss. To stay 
competitive in today's service industry business, a strategy for this annual opportunity loss is analyzed to 
recuperate the expected profit of the company. Various analyses were used to diagnose the problem 
observed, including a stream diagnostics chart, regression analysis, a Pareto chart, and causal analysis. It 
has been found that poor room management and food and beverages services were the main cause of the 
loss of customer loyalty. The researchers conducted a series of analyses on the proposed alternatives that 
are further tested using cost-benefit analysis and integrated by risk analysis. An SOP procedure for the 
company service model is also proposed for augmenting the current management. With the solutions that 
are analyzed, rectified with cost-benefit analyses and risks assessed for its implementations, a viable 
approach for overcoming the steady opportunity loss is considered a prime course of action as its solution.

1. Introduction
Service Industry is a business or commerce that is part of the economy that creates services rather than tangible 
products. The Service Industry has been one of the strongest and fast-growing sectors of the Philippine economy that 
grows by an average of 6.3% on its gross value-added contribution from 2000 to 2014 (Noland, 2013). Service Industry 
has a lot of branches that contribute to its sector as it continues to grow and develop. Some of the examples that branch 
out of Service Industries are Information Technology, Hospitality, Travel, Transportation, Media, Entertainment, 
Sports, Healthcare, Wellness, etc. Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) data shows that Information Technology, 
as well as Travel & Hospitality, are the highest growing competitiveness between the other branches in the Service 
Industry. This gives an indication that both Information Technology and Travel & Hospitality in the Service Industry 
may have a comparative advantage in other countries (Tsai, 2008).  
The Philippines is gaining traction in terms of providing outsourcing services not only for customer support but also 
for outsourcing tech services to different foreign businesses (Alejandria-Gonzalez, 2016), Business Process 
Outsourcing (BPO) has become one of the country's leading generators of income. The boom in the Information 
Technology Industry is because of the innumerable employment opportunities it provides for the Filipino people 
including tech jobs. The demand for IT support (calls, internet usage, maintenance) is significantly increasing each 
year and is currently becoming more popular. Also, in the Philippines, the booming tourism industry is prompting 
more investments in the hospitality sector since foreign tourists' arrivals grew by 7.6 percent in the first quarter of 
2019 (Alejandria-Gonzalez, 2016). Filipinos are also valued as a strong market for the industry with 60 million 
domestic trips made by locals every year.

5. Conclusion 
 
For 31 years, Corregidor Inn's years of service in the historical island of Corregidor is a proof of their dedication to 
introduce and connect the history of yesterday to today's generation, as they provide an unconditional service and 
reliability to their customers. However, a summary of visitors in Corregidor Inn, as well as Corregidor island, are 
declining every year. The researchers wanted to know the factors as to why the number of customers who check-in

the hotel decline, and if it affects the number of visitors who visit the island as well. Peak months of Corregidor Inn 
are from January – May of each year and the total number of opportunity loss gradually decreases each month from 
January to May. After analyzing the data, the researchers identified a poor management system as the root cause of a 
reduction of accommodation by 14.11% that resulted in an average total opportunity loss of ₱17,205,000. 
 
Three alternatives were considered for the determined root cause. All three alternatives were evaluated through a cost-
benefit analysis. To help determine the factors that affect the number of visitors declining, the researchers used a 
Pareto analysis and identified the major complaints of customers. The chosen plan of action, to acquire and implement 
a hotel management system, improve employee skills through proper training and the introduction of standard 
operating procedures, and acquire better and less outdated room amenities, were analyzed.  
 
Furthermore, the alternative selected is feasible and involves a major risk. The problem encountered by Corregidor 
Inn was addressed by solving the root cause. Also, the researchers conclude that the number of customers affects the 
number of visitors on the island and vice versa. In line with this, the number of customers is expected to increase by 
at least 969 transactions and generating an additional profit of PHP 3,580,500.

Abstract 
The production facilities have started to use the most advanced manufacturing techniques using technology. Factory 
based on equipment, automation based on process, factory, logistics, energy, product development, collaborative 
supply chain is all interconnected with ICT which has resulted into a Smart Factory. All these automations with 
ICT enables the system to be intelligent, optimized and efficient. The “Smart Factory” phenomenon has already 
influenced every aspect of business value chains, and hence it has been analyzed by management scholars 
worldwide. Despite being part of the rhetoric in several recent industrial government plans, industry 4.0 and smart 
factory has not been systematically reviewed to date. In this study, the researchers have leveraged a systematic 
qualitative literature review and a qualitative methodology. This study provides a clear picture of the current 
technologies, case applications and challenges of smart factory in management studies. The researchers explore to 
understand the technical architectures, involved and the emerging technologies utilized which are embedded or 
integrated into the smart factory environment. The researchers verify the key technologies and all the associated 
applications which are effective to the overall equipment leading to smart factory. The researchers develop a clear 
framework based on the above aspects as well as the extensive literature review. This framework can be used by 
management scholars to understand the studies surrounding smart factory.

Abstract 
 
Cirrhosis of liver has become life-threatening for the human being all over the world. It is the result of 
long-term continuous damages of the liver. In this paper, we have developed a compartmental model of 
liver cirrhosis to study the dynamics behavior of this chronic disease. We have formulated the model in 
terms of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), based on the characteristics of disease 
transmission. The aim of this study is to take a close look at the transmission dynamics of liver cirrhosis. 
The model is developed with the focus on the concentration of the basic reproduction number and related 
stability analysis for the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. Finally, Numerical simulations 
have been performed to illustrate the disease behavior. Our analysis reveals that infected and liver 
cirrhotic individuals continue to grow up and the recovered individuals start to decrease as the disease 
transmission rate and acute infection rate increase. As a result, the disease becomes progressive.

1. Introduction 
 
Mathematical modeling is playing an incredible role for providing quantitative insight into multiple fields. It has 
already contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms of various non-communicable diseases nowadays. 
Mathematical modeling has gotten attention because modeling and simulation of any physical phenomena allows us 
for rapid assessment. So it is mainly used to describe the real phenomena which lead to design better prediction, 
management and control strategies. Mathematical modeling and optimal control are strictly related to each other. 
Optimal control is the problem of finding a control law for a system so that a certain optimality formula is achieved 
by maximizing or minimizing a particular cost functional (a function of state and control variables). An optimal 
control problem requires a mathematical model to be controlled. So a mathematical model works as a basis for 
formulating an optimal control problem. 
 
Liver cirrhosis has become a major health problem worldwide as it leads to 1.34 million deaths every year (Global 
hepatitis report 2017). There is an extensive body of work to develop mathematical models and optimal control 
policies of infectious diseases. Biswas (2014) (see also Biswas et al. 2014) investigated and analyzed the treatment 
of most devastating infectious diseases independently in which mathematical modeling and optimal control strategy 
was the key tool. Celechovska (2004) studied a simple mathematical model of the liver by applying Bellman’s 
quasilinearization method and observing clinical data. Pratta et al. (2015) developed a mathematical model showing 
the metabolic response to a variety of mixed meals in fed and fasted conditions with emphasizing on the hepatic 
triglyceride element of the model.Vaccination and treatment can control hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection which is 
also presented by formulating a mathematical model and applying optimal control strategy (Kamyad et al. 2014). 
Kumar et al. (2017) also presented a mathematical model showing that in a liver cirrhosis patient when hematocrit 
increases then blood pressure drops. In short, hematocrit is inversely proportional to blood pressure drop. Hao et al. 
(2014) presented a mathematical model of renal interstitial ﬁbrosis. Wang et al. (2017) formulated a computational

Figure 12. Variation of recovered individuals for different values of acute infection rate β . 
Figure 12 represents the variation of recovered individuals sizes for different values of acute infection rate β . Since 
the exposed, infected and liver cirrhotic individuals increase with the increase of acute infection rate β  (i.e. β  goes 
from 5 to 15), recovered individuals decrease with the increase of acute infection rate β .   
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. It affects millions of patients all over the world. 
Liver cirrhosis occurs throughout the world irrespective of age, sex, region and race. It is time to get rid of this fatal 
disease. Investigating the model (1), we have noticed that when the disease related terms i.e. disease transmission 
rate and acute infection rate increase then the infected individuals and liver cirrhotic individuals continue to grow up 
and the recovered individuals start to decrease. So, disease progression can be possible to reduce only if the disease 
transmission rate and acute infection rate can be controlled.  
 
We can conclude that the global human life is still under threat due to the chronic disease liver cirrhosis. Liver 
cirrhosis is a disease characterized by the long-term continuous damages of the liver. These damages may be 
occurred by the progression of viral diseases (hepatitis B and hepatitis C) and other liver diseases which have a 
development period within the liver of the body. So that early detection of these diseases has a positive impact on 
the reduction of liver cirrhosis transmission. But after the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, we should provide treatment to 
the infected individuals according to the underlying causes from which liver cirrhosis has been developed so that 
they can relieve from the disease. Since cirrhosis is not curable, the aims of treatment are to slow the progression of 
scar tissue (which called fibrosis) in the liver and also to prevent symptoms and complications of it. Moreover in the 
early stage of cirrhosis, it may be possible to minimize damage to the liver by treating the underlying cause. So it is 
time to take proper steps to make sure of the optimal combination of vaccination and treatment among the 
individuals to prevent hepatitis B infection and to reduce the liver cirrhosis incidence.

Abstract 
Transport authorities who are dealing with drivers’ training procedures are interested in improving 
drivers’ skills to enhance public transport productivity and promoting road safety. The present research 
work has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of written examination based training courses on 
freight drivers’ reaction, learning, behavior, and reduction on their accidents and traffic violations, so the 
well-known model of Kirk-Patrick has been utilized. Tehran province, the capital province of Iran, has 
been selected as the case study where gathering data process has been done through filling out a standard 
questionnaire composed of 45 pre-designed questions. Commercial freight drivers, consignees, goods 
owners, and experts filled out the questionnaires and results revealed that the written examination based 
training courses do not have significant effects on drivers’ reactions, learning, behaviors, and 
performances in freight transportation.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades, science and technology have advanced more than any other period in human history. This 
transformation has termed the present age of the information when in the period in which half of all human 
information is replaced by new information every few years (Brown and Duguid, 2017). Many organizations are 
formed based on specific goals, and ultimately are achieving them by meeting the needs of communities. In other 
words, the existential philosophy of any organization is to provide diverse services to the community for the 
purposes in which it is intended. Nowadays, the most important factor for achieving the predefined goals in 
organizations is to have knowledgeable, efficient, innovative, creative and responsible human resources. In this 
regard, the role of continuous and in-service training to acquire the above-mentioned skills seems to be clear and 
necessary in advance (Bahmani, 2006). Implementation of the education programs itself raises the issue of 
evaluating courses and curricula, which is one of the most fundamental stages of educational planning. Evaluation of 
educating programs enables decision-makers and practitioners to get a big picture of how activities are being done 
and how to use educational systems to improve the quality of knowledge and skills of human resources in response 
to individual and community needs (Rovai, 2003).

5. Summary and Conclusion  
Since transport authorities are interested in evaluating the performances of written examination based training 
courses taken place for truck drivers, a survey has been conducted based on four-level of Kirk-Patrick efficiency 
model in which truck drivers, consignees, customers and experts who work in Road Maintenance and Transport 
Organization (RMTO) have been interviewed through filling out a standard questionnaire modified to transport 
courses. Four levels of reaction, learning, behavioral changes, and organizational performances have been 
considered for data gathering and analyzing processes, in which organizational performances has been defined as the 
reduction on drivers’ accidents and traffic violence. Hypothesizes are defined to check the effectiveness of training 
courses on all levels of the Kirk-Patrick model. The interview has been applied in Tehran province (Iran) where 260 
filled out questionnaires successfully returned from freight drivers, 81 from goods owners, and 55 from experts. 
They have been analyzed based on the well-known statistical test of normal sample mean in which the mean of five 
domain Likert scale’s responses have been compared to (µ=3). Z-Stats and P-Values for all tests have been 
calculated and compared based on the confidence interval of 95% (Z-Stat for Null Hypothesis = 1.645). The results 
revealed that the training courses designed based on written examination do not have significant effects on freight 
drivers skills as desired in four levels of reaction, learning, behavioral change, and traffic violence and accident 
reduction. 
 
For further research, it is recommended to investigate the effects of four levels of the Kirk-Patrick model through 
indirect methods of data gathering, where drivers’ reaction and learning are checked by practical tests and behaviors 
and performances checked by before-after studies.

Abstract  
 
This study will discuss the Sri Lankan consumer’s perceptions towards healthy food consumption, pre-order based 
food delivery solution for small-medium scale restaurants in the city, Jaffna. Although the city Jaffna was highly 
affected by the prevailed civil war in the country, at present Jaffna is immerging as one of the fast-developing cities 
with various infrastructure projects like highways, airports, ports etc. The scope of the project is to pave a digital 
platform and to introduce the digital business approach for the small-medium scale restaurant businesses which run in 
Jaffna. This proposed solution will support and automate the manual tasks carried out by the major stakeholders with 
minimal energy wastage with an ecofriendly, digital business approach. The research demonstrates the theoretical 
background of the topic, and it shows the present situation of the small-medium restaurants in Jaffna with primary and 
secondary data. The primary research contains, the result of the conducted questionnaire with a sample of 14 small, 
medium scale restaurants and from 172 potential customers. Also, this study contains 6 in-depth interviews with 
selected restaurant managers, who elaborated their opinions about the importance of healthy food consumption and 
the social responsibility towards eco-friendly delivery system.

1. Introduction 
 
Technology has played a big role in revolutionizing the food delivery service from phone-based to online ordering to 
satisfying consumers’ demands. Technology has also contributed to the changes in consumer preference to perform 
everything online including getting cooked meals delivered to their doorstep (See-Kwong, 2017). Food is the basic 
need for survival (Vootla, 2018) and the food consumption method differs from culture to culture. Small medium scale 
restaurants are a part of the food business which mostly operates from home. Also with technology and connectivity 
evolving, ordering foods through mobile apps or online has become the most favorite mode to order food (Saratha, 
2017) and with the initial pilot study, the consumers from the Northern region are lacking a technically strong delivery 
service. In the Sri Lankan context, the majority of the delivery services are not focusing on the empowerment of small 
medium scale food businesses, reduction of energy wastage and eco-friendly delivery green business approaches.

Convenience - Convenience is the biggest factor driving online food ordering, followed by affordability, a new study 
by primary research firm chrome data analytics (“Home furnishing: Convenience, the biggest factor driving online 
shopping: Study - The Economic Times,” 2007) said, Consumers do not have to leave their home nor travel to find 
and obtain food online. This factor plays a vital role in influencing the consumer in using online food services, as 
improper convenience becomes the major bane which hinders the consumers into actually going and buying food. 
 
Easy accessibility - Perceived ease of use, refers to the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system 
would be free of effort. Also the major importance of online food ordering is that due to its easy accessibility (Rathore 
and Chaudhary, 2018) in nature, within just a few clicks you get what you want onto your door step, Opening the 
application in the mobile phone or browsing through the browser on your laptop and order in no less than 2 minutes. 
Though some areas still do not contribute much to online food ordering due to some reasons which may include, 
improper internet availability in rural areas (Anderson, 2018). 
 
Flexibility - All of the applications and web browsers are being designed with adjustments according to the consumer’s 
needs and making their experience as flexible as possible. The introduction of various features in the concept of online 
food ordering like that of cash on delivery, door delivery, customized food order is adding to the context of 
the food ordering. Consumer attitude towards online purchasing is defined as the extent to which a consumer makes 
a positive or negative evaluation of buying food online and providing flexibility helps in inclining on to the positive 
side (Rathore and Chaudhary, 2018). 
 
Ease of payment - People avoid using online services is mainly because they do not want to get entangled in the 
conundrum of payments (Rathore and Chaudhary, 2018). Introducing various method of payment has led in getting 
people’s trust and thus enhancing the business of a lot of companies. Methods such as Cash on delivery, Payment by 
online money wallets, by debit and credit cards etc. 
 
Technology integration - Technology can be used in sales promotion which includes tools for consumer promotion in 
the form of coupons, cash refund offers prices off, premiums and prizes. Offers and discounts are the ones which 
attracts the consumer to get indulge in online food ordering regularly (Kanagal, 2013) Price has operated as a major 
determinant of buyer’s choice of Low pricing observed in online food services acts as an influencer to shop from the 
online food services (Rathore and Chaudhary, 2018). 
 
With modern innovation in information, It is technology take over what people used to do for market researches and 
analysis (Washington, 2013). Using different mechanisms and logics people create computing models for computers 
to use and perform specific tasks effectively with high accuracy without human interactions. Hence, gathering 
customer data, analyze and finding patterns between customer behavior and come for conclusions automatically 
perform by computing models. Creating Algorithms to analyze past data and probability between incidents can be 
used to motivate them and retain customers (Seyed Mohammad Hossein Hasheminejad, 2018). 
 
3. Proposed solution 
 
To address the above issue the proposed solution will be having three different applications to automate the food 
ordering and delivery process. 
 
Customer application- This application will act as a main platform for customer vendor interaction. This platform will 
allow the customer to view, browse, schedule order and track food delivery from the listed food menus. The notable 
technologies to be used in this platform will be a sentimental analysis based food review system, to rate the vendors 
depending on the reviews generated from customers. Vendor profile ratings based on review engagement will be using 
natural language processing for local languages such as Tamil, Sinhala and English. In addition, the proposed 
application will maintain a virtual leader board to list the top zero-carbon contributors to encourage their engagement. 
This application will communicate with both vendor and administrator application. 
 
Food vendor application- This application will be designed for food management whereas the vendor gets a visibility 
on their daily, weekly and monthly online sales and income reports using data analytics. This application will be useful 
for the restaurant vendors to manage their online menu and orders with-out the traditional book keeping. Also the 
vendors using recyclable, reusable products will be featured in the user application.

Administrator application-  This application will act as the super admin panel for both customer and vendor 
application. Administrator platform enables to create, delete and edit vendor profile and verifies the reviews upon 
verification. Also this application will address the food wastage occurring within the restaurant by a food wastage 
prediction system which will estimate the number of orders per day using a forecasting algorithm. The portal too 
supports the business owner to generate weekly, monthly and annual report about the overall performance of partnered 
vendors and achieved business sales. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The proposed solution will be a pre-order based food ordering and delivering system which will encourage and 
automate the manual tasks carried out by the major stakeholders in small medium scale restaurants with minimal 
energy wastage and eco-friendly delivery with digital business approaches using the techniques of sentimental analysis 
and business forecasting. The system will empower the small medium scale vendors to find their potential target 
audience. Also from the consumers end this platform will act as an online market place to consume traditional, healthy 
home cooked foods. The proposed solution will encourage both the food vendors and food consumers to follow 
environmental friendly measures to minimize carbon footprint and polythene usage.

Abstract 
A mathematical model is proposed and analyzed to study the malaria transmission and how to reduce the 
transmission by using specific electromagnetic frequency. The model is governed by four compartments 
for human population and three compartments for mosquito population. The model is analyzed by using 
the stability theory of non-linear differential equations and numerical simulations. We calculate the basic 
reproduction number by the method of next generation matrix. We observe that the disease free equilibrium 
is stable only when the basic reproduction number is less than one and unstable when the basic reproduction 
number is greater than one. We also investigate that the malaria transmission is reduced by using mosquito 
net and specific electromagnetic frequency. Numerical simulations are shown to support the presented 
analytical results. 
Keywords: Malaria Transmission, Human population, Mosquito population, Specific electromagnetic frequency, 
Basic reproduction number. 
1. Introduction
Malaria is a life-threatening disease. It’s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. 
Infected mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite. When this mosquito bites, the parasite is released into 
bloodstream. Once the parasites are inside the body, they travel to the liver, where they mature. After several days, 
the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infect red blood cells. Within 48 to 72 hours, the parasites 
inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells to burst open (Ducrot et al. 2009). Symptoms of malaria 
include fever and flu-like illness, including shaking chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. Nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea may also occur. Malaria may cause anemia and jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin and eyes) because 
of the loss of red blood cells. If not promptly treated, the infection can become severe and may cause kidney failure, 
seizures, mental confusion, coma and death (WHO 2018). 
Morbidity and mortality from malaria are at almost unprecedented levels, particularly in Africa south of the Sahara, 
where the disease claims more than 1 million lives per year. Bangladesh has a history of endemic malaria transmission 
in 13 of 64 districts (Alam et al. 2016). Up to 70,000 laboratory-confirmed and 9,00,000 clinical cases, with more than 
500 deaths per year, were reported in the late 1990s. A cross-sectional survey in 2007 reported a crude prevalence of 
4% in the 13 malaria-endemic districts. More than 90% of cases were Plasmodium falciparum (Bounomo et al. 2013). 
The highest prevalence (>10%) was identified in three districts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in southeastern 
Bangladesh. Prevention and control relies on reducing mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and 
modification of breeding sites), and reducing contacts between mosquitoes and people.  
Mathematics has always benefited from its involvement with developing sciences. Mathematical biology is a fast 
growing, well recognized subject and is the most exciting modern application of mathematics (Dym 2004 and Murray 
1989). It is a branch of biology which employs theoretical analysis, mathematical models and abstractions of the living 
organisms to investigate the principles that govern the structure, development and behavior of the systems, as opposed 
to experimental biology which deals with the conduction of experiments to prove and validate the scientific theories 
(Bubniakova 2007 and Kapur 1985). The field is sometimes called mathematical biology or biomathematics to stress 
the mathematical side, or theoretical biology to stress the biological side ((Biswas 2012 and Biswas 2014). Theoretical 
biology focuses more on the development of theoretical principles for biology while mathematical biology focuses on

Abstract 
The United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) aim to target different stakeholders including 
businesses and development agencies like NGOs into doing more and better with less. The SDGs are inspiring many 
people; they are referred very often in business conferences. Society recalls them frequently and the government is 
also citing them. The implementation of SDGs needs every government and corporates to judiciously prioritize, 
capacities and resources available. The question for corporations is how the stakeholders can work together more 
effectively to achieve them. India over the past few years directed its development to meets its priorities in many areas 
like employment, food, water, education, and energy. In this paper, the researchers are exploring how corporates in 
India are aligned with SDGs as they are through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The study assesses the annual 
report of each of these Indian companies through their CSR activities and extracts all the CSR activities according to 
the various thematic areas. Then they map and align all these CSR themes to the 17 SDGs. This mapping exercise 
develops the knowledge and explores the specific SDGs these companies are focused on. The researchers are also 
trying to explore the convergence between SDGs and existing initiates within companies towards CSR and SDG. This 
study is also a foundational exercise in the assessment of CSR towards SDGs in India. The study looked at 58 
Government-owned companies also called Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE). These 58 companies comprised 
of various sectors like Energy, Oils, Financials, Telecom and IT.

making. There are various social media platforms like video based like Instagram and content based 
like Facebook and Twitter for business purposes. The aim of this paper is to analyze the use of social 
media platform for social projects. These various social media platforms have provided an opportunity 
for various stakeholders to interact amongst them and their customers. Many of the Indian companies 
have embraced these social platforms to communicate and reach out to their stakeholders. Researchers 
in this paper, specifically explore the video sharing platform like Instagram for Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) tasks and activities. The researchers performed analysis on the Instagram posts, 
messages and content for the top 100 listed companies in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. 
The researchers performed analysis on the responses from each of the stakeholders. They further 
analyze how Indian companies are using video and photo based social media platforms to create social 
impacts within India. The researchers also performed a intensive literature review to analyze the gaps 
as well compare the results of this study. The researchers also explored to review how many of the 
Instagram messages and posts are related to CSR from the total posts and responses. The authors used 
quantitative methods to analyze their data. The findings show how distributed and rudimentary the 
companies are. The study shows how Indian companies are adopting and utilizing social media 
platforms and specifically Instagram for their CSR activities. The findings are revealing that only a few 
Indian companies are consciously utilizing social platforms for their social projects.

Abstract  
This study aims to utilize Tagushi design in quality improvement for construction industry. A comparison 
between full factorial and Tagushi design is conducted experimentally. The experiment investigates the 
effect of four major factors and their interactions on concrete compression strength. The factors are; 
percentage of recycled aggregates, percentage of dune sand, amount of steel fiber in concrete mixture and 
test time. Two types of design of experiments (DOE) have been done to test different concrete mixtures by 
using different combinations of the mentioned four factors. The collected data has been studied using full 
factorial and Taguchi “Robust” designs. Also, Minitab software results have been obtained and analyzed. 
Based on full factorial design, it was found that all factors were significant, whereas the interactions 
between factors were significant only for two-way interaction. The three-way and four-way interactions 
were insignificant. On the other hand, Taguchi analysis was used to determine the main effects of factors. 
The results of both full factorial and Taguchi methods were the same except for the percentage of dune 
sand. In the full factorial method, when combining both types of sand, the compressive strength of concrete 
increased. In contrast, Taguchi showed opposites results.

Introduction and Literature review 
Concrete is the main building material that is widely used in all kinds of civil engineering works like substructure, 
infrastructure, buildings, installations of defense work, environs defense and local-domestic improvements. Basically, 
concrete is made by three basic components which are water, natural aggregates, such as sand, rocks or gravel, and 
Portland cement. Recently, the perception of the continued extensive abstraction and use of natural resources 
aggregates is questioned at a worldwide level (Lawson et al, 2001). In order to overcome this problem and decrease 
the rapid consumption of natural aggregates, concrete debris, resulted from demolition works, are being recycled and 
used in concrete productions. Recycled concrete aggregate lessens impact on landfills, reduces energy depletion and 
provides cost reserves (Huang et al, 2002).  
Yehia et al. (2015) studied the concrete properties produced with 100% replacement of recycled aggregates (RA). The 
test results showed that compressive, strength of the 100% RA concrete could be achieved with high packing density 
of concrete” high compaction”.Zhou and Chen (2017) studied the effect of two different types of recycled aggregate 
in the mechanical properties of concrete. The results showed different mechanical properties for various types of 
recycled aggregates. RPA had lower water absorption and density than RCRA. Therefore, RPA concrete had high 
compressive strength than RCRA. The compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete was similar and 
sometimes higher than that of normal aggregate concrete. The authors referred this result due to high absorption of 
recycled which lead to higher bonding strength between cement and aggregate. M. Baena et al. (2016) studied the 
effect of recycled aggregate on concrete mix. Test results showed C20 compressive strength decreased regardless of 
the percentage replacement of recycled aggregate due to different in water-cement ratio. C30 for 50% and less

The main effect plot is shown in Figure 3. The figure shows that the compressive strength decreases with increasing 
the percentage of recycled aggregates. Whereas, the compressive strength of concrete has a proportional relationship 
with time. 
Using 100 % dune sand in the mix didn’t change the compressive strength compared to 100 
% manufactured sand. However, it is noticeable that using the combination of both types of sand has decreased the 
compressive strength of the concrete. 
The addition of steel fibers by 1.5% and 3% to the concrete mix improved the compressive strength. Unpredictably, 
the addition of 3% steel fiber has less effect than that of 1.5%. This result could be due to the loss of workability and 
homogeneity of the concrete mix when adding 3% of steel fibers.

Results discussion and comparison between the results of full factorial and Taguchi Designs: 
 
Full factorial and Taguchi methods are methodology for systematically applying statistics to experimentation. Both 
methods cover the main effect of factors. However, the full factorial can find the interaction effect of factors while 
Taguchi can’t. Moreover, the number of experiments in full factorial method is much higher than that of Taguchi. 
Therefore, full factorial method is more accurate and complex than Taguchi method. 
In our study, the results of the main effect plots for both methods were the same except for the percentage of dune 
sand. In the full factorial method, when combining both types of sand, the compressive strength of concrete increased. 
In contrast, Taguchi showed opposites results. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Concrete compressive strength has been studied in this report. Four factors of interest were defined and variated 
throughout the experiment in order to study their effects on the target response, i.e. compression strength. The factors 
are percentage of recycled aggregate, percentage of dune sand, amount of steel fiber and test period. The full factorial 
design was used and found to be valid via testing data normality and equal variance. Then the results showed that all 
four factors and the two-way interactions were significant. The insignificants were the three- and 
four-way interactions. The model equation has been refined by taken out the insignificant factors and interactions. It 
was found that the R-Squared is high with value of 94.93% which means that our model is valid. After that, the 
response optimizer tool via Minitab was used to determine the optimal factors combination to obtain our target-quality 
concrete mixture. A high-quality concrete mixture with a compression strength of 35 MPa can be attained when using 
50% replacement of recycled aggregate, 100% replacement of dune sand and only 1.5 % inclusion of steel fiber, then 
keeping the mixture to gain full strength for 28 days. After that, The Taguchi method was used to determine the main 
effects of factors. The results of both methods were the same except for the percentage of dune sand. In the full 
factorial method, when combining both types of sand, the compressive strength of concrete increased. In contrast, 
Taguchi showed opposites results.

Abstract 
 In recent years, with the booming 3D printing industries and applications, the process capability and the 
specifications for the 3D printers and the associated products have been tightened due to performance and 
cost competition. Companies are trying to develop the manufacturing capabilities to meet the tighter 
specifications and quality requirements of the customers, but at the same time struggling to keep the offered 
prices within accepted levels. This study focuses on exploring and evaluating experimentally the 
manufacturing process capability of the 3D printers to produce 3D printed parts of different geometries and 
internal designs to minimize the costs lost. This has been achieved by estimating the actual specifications 
limit of the studied 3D printers. Moreover, the study starts with exploring the manufacturing process 
capability and the specifications limit of the available 3D printers in UAEU as well as commercial and 
industrial 3D printers available in the domestic market. Besides, to come up with guidelines and conclusions 
to help in understating the specifications of the 3D printers that aimed to be used. Different 3D printers are 
built to test the process capability of assembled 3D painters to support the objective of the study.

1. Introduction
Recently, 3D printing has become a robust field that is developing significantly to revolute the manufacturing 
processes. Many disciplines like mechanical, electrical, biomedical and aerospace industries utilize 3D printing to 
improve the design manufacturing and to minimize the lead time, as well as reducing the tooling cost for new 
components produced. 3D printing differs from conventional machining such as turning, milling, and drilling, which 
helped people many decades ago to build products. However, in the past few years, they are no longer used as much 
as before because they have some limitations and constraints, such as the expensive cost of the production processes. 
In this regard, the concept of 3D printing has presented. It is also known as additive manufacturing, which is a part of 
rapid prototyping in which 3-dimensional products can be formed from a digital file. Additive manufacturing meant 
to be the deposition of a specific material layer by layer until the desired object is created as per the given design. 
Those layers that combined one on top of the other is nothing more than a horizontal cross-section of the product 
itself. The quality of the object printed using 3D printer relies on the composition of the material added, the 
manufacturing process, the speed in which the printer operates, the type of 3D printer used, and eventually, the volume 
of the part printed using that printer.  In general, 3D printing technology has a significant contribution to the world in 
many directions because of the remarkable advantages to the industrial sector and has a substantial impact on the other

7. Conclusion 
 
In the past few years, the 3D printing field grows rapidly. However, they are no longer used as much as before because 
they have some limitations and constraints, such as the expensive cost of the production processes. In this study, the 
Cpk of 3D printed parts of different geometries and internal designs were speculated to minimize the hidden expenses. 
It was concluded that Cpk decreases with Z direction of the printed part in the same row. And for different rows where 
the height changes, Cpk at bottom-level increases with the increase of the height.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to recommend proactive actions to avoid disruption in achieving project objectives, 
in particular to meet project deadlines. A case study was conducted on an ongoing project in Kuwait (which 
is Al-Ghouse Road) in order to avoid potential schedule delays. The originality of this approach is the 
ability to detect crucial activities and events that might delay projects but are not detected by classical 
techniques. It the beginning, high-level actions were recommended by applying a project risk management 
process in compliance with the Project Management Institute (PMI) recommendations. After identifying 
the risks at the high level, the project schedule was analyzed using Monte Carlo Simulation, by taking into 
account the uncertainties in the estimation of activities durations. This helps in identifying crucial project 
tasks with high uncertainty and deliverables that might delay the whole project but not identified by the 
Critical Path Method. Different professional software were used: “RiskyProject”, “Primavera” and “MS 
Project”.

1. Introduction
Project Risk Management is defined as the systematic process of recognizing, evaluating, and replying to 
risk as a related task to the project, or decision-making behaviour that is not known in advance, but influences the 
project goal. Risk management refers to optimizing and improving the decision to reduce the lack of confidence about 
the future events when the information is incomplete, unclear or under decision (Institute of Risk Management (IRM), 
2011). Studies carried out by Bourn (2003) show that 70% of UK construction projects carried out by public 
departments and agencies are delayed. Many delays occurred in several construction projects, which highlights the 
importance of this study. Risk management procedures should be followed and implemented within ongoing projects, 
to improve project success rate. It is necessary to manage scheduling risks, which are events or unclear situations that 
may impact the completion time of the project (Hillson D. , 2002). To overcome the problem, it is essential to 
determine the causes and effects of the delay to avoid it as much as possible. In Al-Ghouse Road, a proactive approach 
will be applied to prevent the risk before it occurs. On the other hand, if any risk occurs a corrective action will be 
applied to avoid any delay in the project. The Project Management Institute (PMI) has addressed this dual perspective 
of overall risks and individual risks in the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management (PMI, 2009). The standards 
of Project Management Institute (PMI) will be followed to manage the risks that may delay the project. The originality 
of this research paper that it detects crucial tasks with high delay risks, but they are not detected by classical techniques 
i.e. critical path method. The methodology that is related to the Al-Ghouse Road Project consist of: risk identification,
risk assessment, risk responses, and monitor and control.

6. Conclusion  
 
To sum up, proactive approach utilized to prevent any issue that may occur before the project start; by applying 
Project Risk Management Methodology that contain risk identification, risk assessment, risk response, and monitor 
and control on Al-Ghouse Road Project. Simplifying a complex data for Al-Ghouse Road Project by explain simple 
model thoroughly. Monte Carlo Simulation result graph gives us the accurate completion duration. The improper 
estimation for completion duration can affect the budget, worker, company's reputation, and planned schedule. To 
avoid having delays in the project, the company must focus on the duration and control the crucial tasks that may 
occur during the project by applying proactive approach. According to the result, Al-Ghouse Road Project well be 
delay for about 7 days. Al-Ghouse Road Project contain some crucial activities that have most uncertainty and may 
change during the process. Therefore, corrective action applied for those crucial activities by monitor and control.

Abstract 
Indian automotive market is heading for one of the lowest sales over the last eight years. Entire industry is 
in the state of confusion due to various factors like BS1V to BSV1 migration, electric vehicle, GDP decline, 
NBFC crisis and this led to overall negative consumer sentiment. Globally retail numbers are reported by 
government agencies, however in India retail numbers are neither reported nor considered for Sales and 
Operations Planning. There is urgency and necessity to incorporate retail numbers for planning for auto 
manufacturers in India. There are 3P’s of demand sensing and shaping which are Position, Protect and Pull. 
This paper emphasises on theoretical framework for application of 3P’s which includes strategic inventory 
positioning, Strategic buffers & its adjustment and real demand-based planning and execution. Strategic 
inventory positioning helps to identify and position decoupling points to protect and promote the flow of 
relevant information and material.  
Proposed framework of 3P’s will help to mitigate nervousness, supply continuity variability and bullwhip 
effect. This means current situation of overproduction, overstocking and lack of adequate working capital 
for India auto industry can be tackled.

1.Introduction:
Year 2019 has witnessed continues decline in auto sales in India. Month on month basis passenger cars were among 
the worst performers in the category (-41%) in the month of august. Sales of heavy commercial vehicles and two 
wheelers also fell on a monthly basis. Although demand has shown some positive indication in the month of September 
as well as October, month on month basis passenger vehicles have registered degrowth of 5.64%, whereas commercial 
vehicles and two wheelers have registered degrowth of 15% and 12 % respectively. 
Almost after 10 months, the system inventory is at 30 to 45 days which is much improved and trending towards normal 
level. Dealers are facing an acute liquidity crunch due to slowdown in demand. Manufacturers have cut down their 
production quantity to ease inventory level in the pipeline. Entire Industry is in the state of confusion due to various 
factors like migration from BS4 to BS6, Electric vehicle strategy, GDP decline and NBFC Crisis  
All these factors have impacted overall cash flow and consumer sentiments. Even pointers for decline in demand were 
evident, however it was ignored in anticipation of demand. Automakers do not report retail sales and complete

Figure 1. Demand Sensing Based Supply chain network 
 
It starts with demand sensing and shaping, where in actual dealer point of sales data gives appropriate information, 
regarding customer needs and their behaviours. Analysing Point of sales (POS) data will help OEM’s to sense shifts 
in demand as it happens and can be very useful for future demand shaping opportunities. 
 
Sales planning involves generation of delivery orders from dealer network to distribution network which are netted 
against real time inventory positions and vehicle production plans across multi-tier supply network of yards, in transit 
and dealers to meet end customer demand. This further helps dealers to have the necessary information to plan and 
deploy their inventory and vehicle assembly plants have demand signal for their production planning, and further 
suppliers will have planned order visibility for supplies. 
 
Demand based Operational model is all about availability of right material and information at right place and time 
across the supply chain. strategic inventory positioning and buffer management result in moving inventories from 
downstream finished goods locations to upstream raw material component inventories. This shift brings lot of 
flexibility and inventory optimization opportunities across the supply chain. 
 
7.Conclusions  
Considering the current sluggish market condition and future potential for auto sector in India, 3P approach may be 
very beneficial to optimize cost and service levels across the supply chain among all stakeholders. This concept has 
been deployed in other industries across the globe and it has brought significant improvements in inventory turns and 
service levels. To gain agility, changes in demand and supply signals need to be timely propagated across the value 
network where sales channels have the visibility to the upstream supply signals and at the same time suppliers have 
visibility into downstream demand signals. As explained in the beginning of this paper that industry captains are

Abstract 
This article discusses the relationship between workplace safety and production management systems while 
analysing the empirical application of the lean thinking approach. In particular, this paper aims to determine whether 
the application of lean practices has beneficial effects not only on production efficiency but also on the health and 
safety of workers. The analysis is divided into two main stages: first, a review of the relevant literature was 
developed, followed by a case study analysis in an Italian metal casting company describing two continuous 
improvement projects from a workplace safety point of view. Both continuous improvement projects pursued the 
reduction of production interruptions and the elimination of defects, respectively. Research findings indicate health 
and safety conditions improvements after the implementation and application of various lean practices, especially by 
reducing risk exposure in the first project and improving the level of ergonomics in the second. This paper is of great 
interest for both researchers and practitioners since it suggests various possible relationships between the continuous 
improvement approach, provided by a practical application of the lean philosophy, and the improvement of 
workplace safety while fostering production efficiency.

The literature review analysis has shown conflicting views regarding the effect of lean thinking on the health and 
safety of workers. Various authors, mainly from the operations management area, believe that the application of lean 
manufacturing practices can improve the working conditions of the employees; other authors, primarily from the 
area of industrial sociology and health areas, believe that there may exist adverse effects related to lean. 
 
The empirical analyses presented through the case study in Company SFT, have demonstrated a positive effect on 
health and safety as a result of the lean improvement activities; however, the results cannot be considered 
statistically significant to draw more general conclusions. This paper is particularly interesting since the 
implementation of a lean improvement project has enabled the transition from a traditional lubrication method to a 
minimal lubrication method, and it has allowed an improvement of the 4% of the global efficiency index (OEE) with 
a payback of investment of four months. Additionally, the analysis carried in the second improvement project with a 
lean perspective of the post-painting defects has led to a complete redefinition of the workstation with a focus on 
maximizing the value-added activities carried out by the operator. More specifically, the root causes analyses have 
permitted the introduction of simple but effective modifications, and the participation of workers has enabled the 
balance of the workload between the different control stations operating at the same line. Thus, both lean 
applications have led to remarkable benefits regarding the risk exposure and ergonomics of the workers involved.  
 
An analysis of this scale requires an in-depth knowledge of both lean thinking and safety in the workplace, 
understood as requirements and risk assessment techniques. This study encountered a limitation since already 
completed projects were used, making it difficult in some situations to obtain information with a very high degree of 
accuracy. Hence, a future research direction could be the follow-up of a lean improvement project to understand its 
effects on the level of security for employees before, during and after its implementation. Moreover, it should be 
considered that the whole analysis was limited to the manufacturing sector. Therefore, there are several research 
opportunities in other areas, such as construction, healthcare, etc. that could be reviewed according to their specific 
regulatory requirements. 
 
In other words, lean manufacturing offers a range of practices and tools that need to be used in the right way and at 
the right time; the balance in the use of these tools is not established a priori but should be determined on a case-by-
case basis depending on the company’s vision and specific characteristics. In contrast, the application of these 
instruments without having grasped the lean philosophy and without adapting them to each case will hardly allow 
the achievement of effective results.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with its intelligent monitoring and controlling 
applications and predictive and preventive maintenance of industrial equipment is capable of collecting and 
analyzing a large amount of data, achieving high operational efficiency, increased productivity, and better 
management of industrial assets and processes. However, the connected industrial assets have increased 
exposure to the new cyber-physical risks including Targeted Attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats 
(APTs) that are on the rise and have emerged as the most complicated Multi-Stage Attacks, hitting the 
industrial companies and governmental organizations. APTs that are designed with a particular motive, are 
sophisticated, professional, state supported and systematic cyber-attack programs in which an attacker is 
motivated, skilled, organized and well-funded. The existing cyber security intrusion detection techniques 
and traditional defensive mechanisms are no longer sufficiently effective against APTs which is the most 
worrisome situation and thus, novel and more effective solutions are required to predict, detect and mitigate 
APT threats. APTs are a global scourge and a challenging targeted attack so today in this speech we will 
discuss APT attacks and their characteristics particularly in case of oil and gas industries. Moreover, we 
would also discuss prevention and detections methods devised for countering APTs as well as some

Abstract 
This study analyzed the occurrence of robbery and theft in the City of Manila using discrete Bayesian network 
model.    Using a 5-year data of robbery and theft in the City of Manila (with conviction), the results showed that 
February and July emerged as the months with highest probability of crime happening at 10.66 percent and lowest on 
April with 6.80 percent.  In terms of crime happening on a week, the highest probability occurred on the 2nd week with 
28.3 percent and lowest on the 5th week at 6.8 percent.  Most of the crimes happened between 3PM to 6PM with 17 
percent and lowest occurrence between 6AM to 9AM at 7.0 percent.  Male population are more likely to be a victim 
of crime in almost all of the identified locations except for Pandacan where female population has a higher probability 
at 53 percent.  With these information, a patrol priority location table was developed to show the location where the 
crime is more likely to happen in a particular time range of the day.  This information can help the Philippine National 
Police in the police resource deployment.

1. Introduction
A crime is an act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it and for which a punishment 
is imposed upon conviction (Philippine Crime Statistics, June 2013). Crimes are categorized into index and non-index 
crimes to create a standard definition of crime classification. Index crimes involves crimes against persons and crimes 
against property; index crimes are considered to be serious and happens with regularity across cities (Talabong, 2018). 
Non-index crimes are violations of special laws such as local ordinances, etc. The Philippine National Police (PNP) 
focuses on seven types of (index) crimes: (1) murder, (2) homicide, (3) physical injury, (4) rape, (5) robbery, (6) theft, 
(7) carnapping. Robbery and theft tops the list of crimes against property, and will be the focus on this study.
Crime pattern theory stipulates that crime does not occur randomly, it is either planned or opportunistic; the theory 
states that incidents are patterned with respect to time and space, occurring where the activity of the offender and 
victim/target intersect (Bratingham, 2013). The current (assumed) PNP operations on patrolling is statically scheduled, 
routed, and resourced; it can be optimized to contribute on reducing crime index as police visibility results in lower 
estimates of subjective risks of victimization. To establish a good public perception of safety, patrolling can be 
(theoretically) scheduled and routed in line with the probability of crime happening in a given area and time, and in 
harmony with police resources. Since crimes does not occur at random, this study believes that a pattern can be learned 
based from historical data of (recorded) crimes; probabilistic models can be used to represent, and infer from the given 
data.

4. Conclusion 
 
Given the assumptions on PNP operations regarding static patrolling and on-demand police resource deployment; this 
study would be relevant to optimize patrolling routes within Manila and enable pre-emptive police response on crimes 
(robbery/theft). The proposed model can be updated with concurrent conditional probability distributions of its factors 
to ensure relevance. This proof-of-concept may be operationalized to be evaluated, calibrated, and secure timely 
updating of CPDs; it is always better to have more quality data to be confident on a Bayesian network inference. 
 
The data that was used for the Bayesian network are crime records for robbery & theft with conviction; this provided 
enough information to generate inference. This study could be a benchmark on queries that would involve not only 
crime records with conviction, but also with reported crimes that did not make it until conviction due to some legal or 
moral (or other) factors. Some crimes are not filed by victims, some are arranged by the offender with the victim 
before formal crime report, and some are just false report, etc.  
 
More sophisticated Bayesian network are expected to handle different cases given the right data for representation, 
inferring, and learning. Data strategies should be implemented on future studies or operationalization, especially on 
what periods should be covered/considered for factor’s CPDs; we may consider monthly, quarterly, or yearly data 
coverage for CPDs. 
 
As stipulated from Crime Pattern Theory, crimes do not occur randomly but rather with pattern, it may relate 
geographically, socially, etc. (Bratingham, 2013). This study was able to infer a robbery and/or theft happening within 
Manila (location) given time; the model was able to infer a weekly pattern for robbery and/or theft incident . For future 
studies, if given more (quality) data, the researchers may be able to model crime (not limited to robbery & theft) 
incident with more factors. The researchers may be able to infer unusual crime pattern (geographic, social, etc.), and 
infer seasonality, trend, etc. It would be interesting to pin down a syndicate (or other offenders) using a Bayesian 
network as part of PNP intelligence tool.

Abstract
Rotary friction welding is widely used as a solid state welding method for joining of similar or dissimilar 
metals. It is an advanced joining technique that generates frictional heat and material goes under plastic 
deformation at the welding location, thereby affecting the formation of a joint while the material is in solid state. 
After heat generation phase an additional forging force is applied which completes coalescence. Since no 
melting of material occurs during friction welding, but metal gets deform after heat generation at welding zone. 
The principal advantages of frictional welding, low distortion, absence of melt-related defects and high joint 
strength. In this paper the study has been carried out by using the friction welding process on all geared lathe 
machine. The material selected for study and experimentation of RFW is stainless steel SS 304 and specimen 
dia. ϕ 8 mm and ϕ 10 mm. The various parameters studied for the process is rpm, weld time, temperature, 
pressure, heat affected zone etc., the 2D modeling and steady state transient thermal analysis has been carried 
out for the selected specimen.

1. Introduction
Welding is a fabrication technique which is used extensively for joining of metals. There are two main 
classification of welding process, i.e. fusion welding and solid state welding. In the fusion type of welding 
process, the joint edges are melted and in solid state welding process, these edges are heated to become a red-hot 
temperature and subjected to pressure applied to create a welding joint. The former method has a disadvantage 
of substantial micro-structure and property changes. Friction welding is a type of solid state or forge welding, 
where welding takes place by the application of friction between two mating surfaces of metal along with 
application of pressure, required heat can be generated by rubbing two metals on each other and the temperature 
can be elevated to the level where the parts subjected to the friction may be welded together. The fundamental 
principle of friction welding is to use the heat generated through rotational friction to produce a clean joint, 
without the formation of a liquid phase. This contact force first generates heat at the interface. Once the material 
has become sufficiently soft, the forging pressure has applied against the two components forces the heated 
interface material into the flash, removing any surface contaminants and producing a clean joint. The rotary 
friction welding method is the simplest one, but it has an inherent limitation, i.e.it cannot be employed for the 
welding of parts with a non-circular cross-sectional area. Therefore the rotary friction welding is a solid state 
joining process that produces coalescence by harnessing heat developed through controlled rubbing of the 
faying surfaces. Due to the heat, the material start to deform and at which the plasticized material starts to form 
a layers also, at intervene with one another and it gives the results in good quality of weld.

Future Scope 
Explore the evaluation of microstructure by using different diameter. Measure and correlate fatigue and 
corrosion properties with different friction welding parameters. Welding parameters (Weld time, Burn off 
length, rpm.) which could be varied individually to see their individual effects rather than combining these 
parameters. After residual stress measurements, we can carry out the fracture analysis of welding components 
and modeling of residual stress generation during friction welding could also be carried out. 
Conclusion 
This work concerns the rotary friction welding of stainless steel SS 304, specimen dia. ϕ 8 mm and ϕ 10 mm. 
The various parameters studied for the process is rpm, weld time, temperature, pressure, heat affected zone, and 
the 2D modeling and steady state transient thermal analysis has been carried out for the selected specimen. This 
experimental work showed that this steel was successfully welded by rotary friction welding process. According 
to tensile test result analysis that the tensile strength for specimen of ϕ8 mm is 271.67 MPa and the strain 
obtained is 6.9 %. And for specimen of ϕ10 mm is 292.361 MPa and the strain obtained is 6.6 % respectively. It 
has been observed that if the diameter increases tensile strength also increases.  
From the experimentation it has been observed that as the rotational speed increases the tensile strength 
increases. According to thermal analysis the stresses generated because of temperature distribution along weld 
specimen. The micro-structure analysis is done for metallurgical phase which are generated at welded joint. 
From the micro-structure study it has been observed that after heating for ϕ8 mm coarse austenitic grains are 
formed and for ϕ10 mm fine grains are formed. After cooling for ϕ8 mm coarse martensitic grains are formed 
and for ϕ10 mm tempered martensitic grains are formed. By taking the cross section of specimen it has been 
observed that actual heat affected zone (HAZ) for ϕ8 mm & ϕ10 mm is not more than 30 mm. According to 
thermal analysis stresses generated because of temperature distribution along weld specimen. This is measured 
analytically and validated with the experimental temperatures.  
The experimental rotary friction welding set-up was found to be successful for the production of friction welds. 
The rotational speed of the job has been found to be an influential parameter for the friction welding process, 
which has been optimized for the process based on the results of the study. The mechanical properties of the 
friction welds were found to vary with the applied axial pressure.

Abstract 
Increasing productivity is the aim of many common industries in the public and private sectors.  Although 
many productivity publications can be found in manufacturing, construction, and services, few studies are 
found dealing with productivity in public services.     This study aims to review the recent literature 
published about productivity in public services.  The methodology adopted in this paper is a systematic 
literature review. A total of one hundred papers were identified as a result of searching for specific relevant 
keywords.    Different types of analysis were used to classify the papers, find the development and trend of 
research, and finally identify the research gaps. The main findings of the study showed that the research in 
productivity in public sector services focuses on five areas: human resources aspects, technology 
development, re-engineering processes, strategic management development, and economic perspectives. It

1. Introduction
Many excellence models, both in public and private sectors, have been developed and adopted by organizations
to improve the performance. According to Sampaio et al. (2012), Deming Prize in Japan, the Malcom Baldridge
National Quality Awards (MBNQA) in the USA, and the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM)
in Europe are the most popular excellence models that are used by private sector. However, governments in
various countries have adopted these excellence models as a base to improve the performance of their public
sector. For example, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) launched an excellence model in 2015 named the 4th
generation excellence model which is dedicated to the public sector.
Government services play a vital role in the country's economics besides providing essential facilities to the
people living in communities. Government services have a direct impact on other industries, like construction,
manufacture, and private services. Improving government services become an essential topic to the leaders of
countries, and accordingly, most strategic plans focus on improving the government services to enhance the
quality of living. Improving government services will lead to talking about productivity and factors affecting the
efficiency and effectiveness of the services. Although many productivity publications can be found in
manufacturing, construction, and services, fewer studies are found dealing with public services. According to a
report that was published in Albayan newspaper on the 22th of May 2019, The actual productive hours is
estimated as three hours out of the eight working hours, which is indicates that the productivity is very low
(Mustafa, 2019). Therefore, this study aims to review the recent literature published about productivity in public
services. The review will analyze the trend and distribution of the literature that cover the general aspects of
productivity. It will investigate and classify the literature that influence productivity. It focuses on theoretical
development and empirical studies of productivity in general and narrowed down to productivity in the public
sector with focus on productivity in services. The study tries to explore the implication of productivity in different
types of organizations, addresses complexity issues, and visualize the trend of the last ten years. The ultimate goal
is to identify the gaps and potential areas that need further research.

5. Conclusion 
 
One of the objectives of a systematic literature review is to detect the trend of scholars and researches on a specific 
topic. The resulted classification showed the area that literature had focused on issues that influences productivity 
in public sectors services. It also uncovers the gaps in literature where new studies can be implemented. It is clear 
that the productivity studies were covering the following five areas which are: Human resources aspects, using 
technology, Re-engineering processes, strategic management development, and economic perspectives. It is 
noticed that the areas that need further studies are strategic management development and re-engineering 
processes. It was also noticed that the highest focus of the literature is on human resources development and 
technology.

Abstract 
In the 21st century, globalization coupled with technological advancement and free trade has created competition 
among various businesses enterprises. This competition has led many businesses to adopt various management 
techniques such as acceptance sampling aimed at transforming their processes in order to remain competitive in 
the global market and adapt to new market demands. The successful implementation of acceptance sampling is 
highly dependent on what the academic literature refers to as acceptance sampling optimization. A literature 
review on the optimization of acceptance sampling has  not shown any work that studied whether acceptance 
sampling and machine learning (ML) plans can be considered as an optimal acceptance sampling technique 
(sequential sampling being one improved acceptance sampling technique). ML algorithms can be divided into 
four categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement 
learning. Reinforcement learning is different from the other types of machine learning, since it is a method of 
self-learning and acting based on observed data.  
The aim of this paper is to develop a model based on coupling reinforcement learning methodology (RL) and 
sequential acceptance sampling in manufacturing to improve and achieve optimality  in process and product 
monitoring. This model will serve as a continuous improvement strategy towards a better acceptance sampling 
implementation in the manufacturing industry.  Simulation has been used as the model for proof of concept. The 
simulation model is designed to simulate any manufacturing process. However, this paper focuses on simulating 
the inspection process in a production line. In order to determine if an RL-based sequential sampling model is 
able to reduce the sample size and time of inspection, this paper compares the proposed model with the sequential 
acceptance sampling plan and the MIL-STD 1916 
The result of the research will show the integration of sequential sampling and RL as a key to reduce the sample 
size and the sampling time interval during the inspection process in a manufacturing industry.

Abstract 
The rapid evolution of technology resulted to the increase in dependability of the users to it. Everything is 
becoming automated which are designed to make our lives easier and more convenient. The integration of 
automated information systems to an organization improves the quality of work and decreases the room for 
error that paves way to delays or any unnecessary processes which disrupts the flow of the operations. The 
objectives of the study are (1) to assess the information technology and auditing related information system 
of the school and (2) to recommend an implementation framework and auditing information system. The 
school was experiencing a bottleneck in terms of their inaccuracy of data and poor recording of accounts. 
The researchers improved the auditing process by designing a data flow diagram (DFD) which illustrates 
the flow of the enhanced system when automated. The automated system was developed to maximize the 
accuracy of recording data and provide convenience to the personnel in charge of auditing the data.

1. Introduction
Many databases are extensions of the traditional files and records of business and government organizations. An 
important activity in these traditional information system is that of auditing which helps to record the activities as a 
basis for management decisions, and errors and malpractices in administration to be brought to light (Florentin, 1972) 
and automated auditing system would bring more efficiency, productivity, and accuracy. Although, to have benefits 
through automated auditing system, ‘how’ to use the system should be ensured (Love, et al., 2019) to avoid system 
malfunction and incompatibilities that may affect the organization itself (Florentin, 1972).  
In other countries, automated auditing system is already adapted in school administration and accounting system 
nowadays. Electronic Data Processing (EDP) has replaced the manual method and effectiveness of the EDP is still in 
doubt (Oladunjoye, 2012). However, implementation issues may not be a primary concern for researchers, as 
researchers should focus on benefits to the firm (Grabski et al., 2011). For EDP to be effective for school auditing, the 
school must be in such a way that it is auditable (Oladunjoye, 2012). 
Most of the medium sized schools in the Philippines, especially located in province area, are still having a manual 
auditing system starting from issuing the receipt to having a financial statement for monthly checking of cash flow of 
the school’s financial activity. According to the directress, who researchers interviewed for data gathering, lack of 
budget on financial activity caused them to use manual auditing system. The researchers conducted an audit on the 
expense report of the school in which the group discovered four (4) issues while auditing. These are recording without 
receipt, misplaced records, erroneous recording and unrecorded receipt. Tables 1.1 to 1.4 shows the breakdown of the

Figure 3.6. Cash Voucher user interface 
 
For the instance where auditor wants to check the monthly financial data including bills, cash voucher, check number 
etc., this interface will be used. Auditor can select the month he or she wants to view, and the system will automatically 
summarize the number of request forms, number and total amount of bills. For the detailed data or report, auditor can 
access it by clicking the “View details report” button. “Generate and View Financial Statement” button will be used 
for the auditor or the school directress when he or she wants to view the financial statement for the month.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This study aims to assess the current auditing process of the private pre-primary and primary school in Antipolo, Rizal, 
Philippine. Another objective is to construct an improved auditing process through the use of information system. 
Through the conducted interviews and assessment of the current system, the researchers identified the key issues of 
the current auditing system of the school. The school has poor recording policy and procedure which results to 
misplacement of records and clerical errors. Additionally, the auditing activity of the school is done manually which 
also invites possible inaccuracy of data. With this, the researchers devised two (2) alternative solutions for each root 
cause to improve the auditing system of the school.  
 
Based from the cost analysis conducted by the researchers, the best alternative to solve the poor recording procedure 
is to retrain the current cashier and auditor with the improved recording procedure. This generated a much lower cost 
than hiring additional cashier. On the other hand, the best alternative to solve the problem of manual auditing is to 
develop an in-house accounting system for the school. This alternative is cheaper and more practical than incurring 
extremely high cost of purchasing expensive software. With this, the researchers created an improved auditing process 
which eliminates the delay in the submission of reports to the auditor. Additionally, the researchers created a data flow 
diagram of an automated auditing system that can handle the recording of expenses and other transactions of the school. 
With this, financial data can be easily stored and retrieved upon request. Also, this eliminates the chances of clerical 
errors in the process. 
 
This study can be further improved by extending the scope of the research. The future researchers can include an 
assessment of the tuition fee recording process of the school and improve it since the process is also done manually.

Abstract 
 
This study conceptually reviews the role of leadership style on the relationship between smart city policy timeliness 
(that is, smart city policy formulation, implementation and evaluation) and smart city performance. To achieve this, 
the scholars reviewed earlier literatures, as well as government portals on the development of smart city agenda in 
Dubai while relating it to earlier smart cities. The findings reveal that the leadership style used in Dubai 
‘transformational leadership’ would enhance the smart city policy stages. Considering this, the scholars conclude that 
the transformational leadership style is an important factor that speeds up the smart city policy stages in implementing 
smart city agenda.

1. Introduction 
One of the major government concerns is the absorption of migrants from less developed economy to urban centers 
which in recent times have been overpopulated and congested. The effect of this phenomenon includes high crime 
rate, social vices such as xenophobia, ethnic and racial tensions that might lead to loss of life and properties as well 
as costing government billions of US dollars (Comaroff & Comaroff, 2016).  
 
Besides, the services provided by government seems to be ineffective and inefficient in the congested or crowded 
areas. Thus, to avoid these issues, there is need to liberate the congested areas to less populated area via infrastructural 
development and information communication technologies (Albino, Berardi & Dangelico, 2015; Zanella, Bui, 
Castellani, Vangelista & Zorzi, 2014). The process of connecting these isolated areas led to the invention of advanced 
or model city known as smart cities (Schaffers, Komninos, Pallot, Trousse, Nilsson & Oliveira, 2011). 
 
In the era of globalization and advanced technologies, the term smart city has been widely used in numerous studies, 
as such, keen interests and attentions had been geared towards defining, modelling and performance contributing 
indicators (Alves, Dias & Seixas, 2019; Du, Zhu, Shi, Wang, Lin & Zhao, 2019; Willems & Graham, 2019) adoption

Policy Timeliness 
Leadership 
Smart City Performance 
The time that is required to 
formulate and implement a smart 
city policy influence the 
performance. If the time of smart 
city policy is short then smart city 
performance will be accelerated. 
Whereas, if policy timeliness is 
long, that is the time to formulate 
and complete implementing a 
smart city policy, then the 
performance will be in a slow 
progress. 
The power of leadership might be a 
moderating factor on the 
relationship between policy 
timeliness and Smart City 
performance. Dubai Leadership has 
shown the best example in 
moderating this relationship. 
Leadership is a factor that might 
strengths or weakens this relation. It 
is important to study the role of 
leadership to find its effect on 
performance. 
Smart City performance is 
influenced by several factors. 
Policy timeliness is one of them 
as proven in previous literature. 
But how can leadership 
moderate these factors with 
respect to performance. When 
Policy Timeliness is short under 
the leadership motivation and 
support, we would have to a 
better and fast performance. 
This is what Dubai is showing 
as a good example in 
performing its Smart City. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
No doubt, the vital role of leadership style towards the development of any society to be qualified as smart city cannot 
be overemphasized. This has been back dropped of this study using Dubai smart city as a case. Although, this paper 
is a conceptual review, the availability of relevant literature confirmed the stance of Dubai smart city among the 
performing smart cities in the world. Asides the transformational leadership style, as enumerated in Dubai’s affairs, 
the fast tracking of some of the timely projects within the city reflects the performance of a policy proposal to a policy 
implementation. In a nutshell, the dimension of effective smart city in the world has always recognize the moderating 
role vis a vis impact of leadership with strong will in order for a leadership vision not to become a mirage.

Abstract 
Aviation fuel demand in Maluku - Papua area experienced a significant increase of 9.6% per 
year over the course of 2012-2018. However, this increase was not accompanied by the 
development of infrastructure, it was observed that the average coverage day was as low as 6.9 
days. According to fuel terminal design standards there are several classes of fuel terminal based 
on DOT, Coverage Days, number of tanks, and the type of tank. Based on pareto diagram, the 
determined problem for Aviation Fuel Terminal Tual is ""Low Average Coverage Day in the 
Aviation Fuel Terminal Tual (<7 Days)"" and the alternative solution chosen is Modular Aviation 
Fuel Terminal System. There are several main materials in said system, namely storage tanks 
(23 KL), pumps (70 KL / hour), vessel filter, and flow meter. Material specifications are 
specified through hydraulic and tank design calculation. And obtained by installing Modular 
Fuel Aviation System in Aviation Fuel Terminal Tual, there was an increase in Coverage day 
and value creation of 4.17 billion Rupiah.

Abstract 
As global competition between industries and countries intensifies, demand for processors to increase 
productivity, production and service quality continues to grow. This requires a versatile organization and 
the right tools to develop more efficient processes, reduce costs and increase productivity. The continuous 
development of global technology will affect the way customers behave, think and perceive value. Virtually 
all stages of change experienced by the manufacturing sector are modeled on human needs and growing 
customer demand. The manufacturing era is facing a new era of this ever-changing and challenging 
environment, often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the complex and changing business 
world, innovation and entrepreneurship have become key concepts for sustainable economic development. 
Economic, social and environmental sustainability are critical to organizational performance. This paper 
developed on the concept of previous research on Industry 4.0, entrepreneurial orientation, innovation and 
firm performance. It is hoped that this research will help to open a new window in the Industry 4.0 and 
entrepreneurial orientation research.  
Keywords 
Industrial Revolution 4.0, Innovation, Entrepreneurial Orientation, sustainable development, performance. 
1. Background of the research
In recent years, computer and information systems have employed new methods in industry and services  (Al-nahhas, 
2019; Gerrikagoitia et al. 2019; WEF 2019). Evolution, this trend is the fourth trend in industrial systems: Industry 
4.0. It is often called the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term “Industry 4.0” has been largely used in the German 
scientific literature (Brettel et al.  2014; Sendler, 2018; Kagermann et al. 2015; Bauernhansl et al. 2014; Kagermann, 
2013 and Burmeister et al. 2015). Research on Industry 4.0 is highly related to phenomena such as ""Internet of Things"", 
""Industrial Internet"", ""Internet of Services"", ""Data and Services"", ""Smart Factory 4.0"", ""Advanced Manufacturing"" 
and ""Smart Manufacturing"" etc. and their investigation (Al-nahhas, 2019; Kagermann et al. 2015; Vermesan & Friess, 
2013; Porter & Heppelmann, 2015; Westerlund et al. 2014; Simonite, 2014; Tvaronavičienė, 2014 and Rezk et al. 
2015). This research uses the terms ""Industry 4.0"" and ""Industrial Revolution 4.0"" interchangeably. 
The central idea behind the industrial revolution trend is to ensure that people in a given region have high-tech 
manufacturing sites, job opportunities and benefits to create a competitive advantage (Ramsauer, 2013; Avigdor et al. 
2014; Arnold, 2017; Al-nahhas, 2019; Kiel, 2017 and Gerrikagoitia et al. 2019). The Internet appeared before the 
concept and beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Now it's about creating complex networks of intelligent

Abstract 
In today's highly competitive environment, organizations see open innovation and entrepreneurship as their core 
strategies. Conversely, though open innovation research is extensively cited and influences the course of innovation 
investigation, it has a significant effect on the strategic management and economics disciplines. As pointed out by 
different scholars, one of the management issues is entrepreneurship. This issue has become increasingly important 
because in recent years, the dynamic relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation, and new business creation 
has become apparent in a dynamic research trend that combines knowledge from different academic methods. The 
dynamic capabilities methodology supports this research framework in terms of open innovation and entrepreneurial 
orientation. This paper presents the pilot survey study for entrepreneurial orientation, open innovation and firm 
performance. Perform descriptive tests on statistics, normality, reliability and preliminary factor analysis (EFA) and 
display the data in tabular form. The results showed that the questionnaire distribution was normal and the data results 
were normal.

1. Introduction
In today's complex and fluctuating business in the world, innovation and entrepreneurship have become key concepts 
for sustainable economic development. Economic, environmental and social sustainability are critical to the 
performance of an organization (Bilevičienė & Bilevičiūtė, 2015; Rezk, Ibrahim, Tvaronavičienė, Sakr, & Piccinetti, 
2015). The organizations must respond to changing business conditions, updating technical capabilities and customer 
demand and needs (Baregheh, Rowley, & Sambrook, 2009). In more simple words, to increase competitiveness and 
achieve sustainable business performance organizations must be innovative (Kumar, Boesso, Favotto, & Menini, 
2012; Laužikas, Tindale, Tranavičius, & Kičiatovas, 2015; Rezk et al., 2015; Tvaronavičienė, 2014). In the recent 
years, society is progressively transforming towards social digital systems. In order to overcome these challenges, it 
is useful for corporations to adopt open innovation methods. Open innovation is “using intentional knowledge input 
and output to accelerate internal innovation and expand the market for innovative external use” (Brown, 2003). 
Through business-related research and improvements in social science methodologies, more information is now 
produced than ever before (Ali Memon, Ting, Ramayah, Chuah, & Cheah, 2017; Kraus, Burtscher, Vallaster, & 
Angerer, 2018). In the current economic environment, assessing business performance (BP) through the influence of 
entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and open innovation (OI) is a key issue for academics and practitioners. In recent 
years, many researchers have shown great interest in the three main structures used in many empirical studies. 
Entrepreneurial orientation and open innovation are new trends in research for measuring company performance 
(Carvalho & Sugano, 2017; Kollmann & Stöckmann, 2014; Ranasinghe, Yajid, Khatibi, & Azam, 2018; Spithoven, 
Vanhaverbeke, & Roijakkers, 2013; Ventor, 2014). The organization is transforming its business model from an old-
style vertical integration model with in-house research and development actions to an open business model.  
2. Dynamic Capability Theory
Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, (1997), refers to the ability to gain new forms of competitive advantage are called ""dynamic 
capabilities"" and are defined as ""the company's ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external 
capabilities to respond to a rapidly changing environment"". Recognizing the fact that the essentials of the dynamic

Abstract 
The importance of higher education for a developing country such as Malaysia, there is still paucity- to the 
researcher's limited knowledge. Internal environment variable in higher education are of a particular 
importance for achieving high performance, especially when recognizing that such organizational variables 
entails very important sub- variables. In the other hand the top management support will help the university 
to achieve the objective help university to have good profile and good reputation this lead to increase the 
students. Therefore, this study intending to investigate the moderating top management support affects 
relationship between internal environment and Malaysian universities performance. Therefore, data will 
also be collected from academicians’ and scholars from the Malaysian Technical University Network 
(MTUN), which brings together four technology universities' in Malaysia, University Malaysia Perlis 
(UNIMAP), Technical University of Malaysia Malacca (UTEM), University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia 
(UTHM), and University of Pahang Malaysia (UMP). More specifically, academicians and scholars at 
MTUN universities in Malaysia are the main respondents to this study because their experience in the 
management field has made them more familiar with risk management, and the researcher will be able to 
obtain accurate data for excellent results.

1. Introduction
Empirical research regarding the implementation of ERM in higher education institutions is limited, and there is also 
limited academic literature on the practices of ERM within HEIs risk management practices (Ariff, Zakuan, Tajudin, 
& Ismail, 2015; Dharampal, Cameron, Dixon, Ghali, & Quan, 2016; Lundquist, 2015). However, most of the ERM 
programs reported in the limited academic literature on the subject adopts ERM practices from corporations 
(Lundquist, 2015). Nonetheless, not many studies have focused on ERM in higher education, its processes and 
determinants as well as how it can be implemented with HEIs to manage risk and improve the performance. However, 
many organizations have adopted the mission and principles of ERM, we know little of how enterprise risk 
management works in action (Lundquist, 2015). So this gap must be filled. 
Empirical evidence on the effect of ERM drivers on universities performance in the academic domains scanty, most 
of the studies on ERM concentrated on the impact or effect of ERM on firm performance (the financial or non-financial 
performance). Furthermore, survey conducted on Malaysian public quoted industries by Soltanizadeh et al., (2014) 
shows that 32.2% of these firms fully implement ERM, 47.2% have a partial ERM framework, 13.1% have no formal 
ERM framework in place but plan to implement one in the future, 4% were still trying to figure out the need for ERM 
and 3% have no plans to integrate ERM at all.  The study further indicates that firms from industries such as 
infrastructure, hotel, and technology implemented more ERM in their risk management practices that is why firms in 
these industries were thriving more economically than firms in other industries. Furthermore et al. (2017) reported 
that the implementation of ERM is considered at an infancy stage in Malaysia.

Malaysian universities performance. Accordingly, the research constructs are evaluated descriptively using tables and 
mean ranking as presented in subsections below. 
 
5.3 Moderating effects of top management on the relationship between internal environment and 
Malaysian universities performance 
The research objective sought to find out the moderating effects of top management support on the relationship 
between internal environment and Malaysian universities performance. PLS-SEM is very instrumental in achieving 
this objective because in addition to estimating linear relationships it also has the ability to incorporate moderator 
variable which influences the strength or even change the direction of relationship between the independent and the 
dependent construct in the structural model (Becker, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2018; Wong, 2016). Moderation refer to the 
influence of an antecedent that alters that strengthens or alters the relationship between variables in structural model. 
Thus, a moderator  “influences the nature (e.g., magnitude and/or direction) of the effect of an antecedent on an 
outcome” (Aguinis, Edwards, & Bradley, 2017). Moderation is “where a relationship between an independent variable 
and a dependent variable changes according to the value of a moderator variable” (Ali Memon et al., 2019). 
 
A moderator variable can be either categorical or continuous depending on the theoretical conceptualisation of the 
research model (Ali Memon et al., 2019; Hasan, Mohd Saad, & Iteng, 2019; Kee & Rahman, 2017). For categorical 
moderator, Multi group analysis (MGA) is mostly conducted. For the continuous moderator, three measure methods 
product-indicator, two-stage, and orthogonalizing approaches are used (Ali Memon et al., 2019). The use of either of 
the methods depends on the nature of the structural model. This research uses two stage methods to test the moderating 
effects of top management support on the relationship between internal environment and Malaysian universities 
performance. The two-stage approach involves calculating the latent construct scores and saved before subsequently 
building up the interaction term as element-wise product of the construct scores of the independent construct and the 
dependent construct. The interaction term is then used as a regressor on the latent variable scores of the dependent 
(Ali Memon et al., 2019). The moderation test result is reported in table 3 below.

The result of moderating effects of top management support on the relationship between internal environment and 
Malaysian universities performance is presented in table 3 above. The result found three significant moderating effect. 
The result found significant moderating effect of educational level on the relationship between internal environment 
and Malaysian universities performance (β=-0.231; t=3.483; p=0.001). Thus, educational level significantly moderates 
the influence of internal environment on Malaysian universities performance. 
 
Similarly, level of communication significantly moderates the relationship between internal environment and 
Malaysian universities performance (β=0.213; t=2.917; p=0.004). Also, the result shows that the relationship between 
internal environment and Malaysian universities performance is significantly moderated by delegation of authority 
(β=-0.107; t=2.917; p=0.009). 
 
Thus, it can be concluded that top management significantly moderates the relationship between internal environment 
and Malaysian universities performance. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This study intending to investigate the moderating effects of top management support on the relationship between 
internal environment and Malaysian universities performance. Therefore, data was collected from academicians’ and 
scholars from the Malaysian Technical University Network (MTUN), which brings together four technology 
universities' in Malaysia, University Malaysia Perlis (UNIMAP), Technical University of Malaysia Malacca (UTEM), 
University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), and University of Pahang Malaysia (UMP). More specifically, 
academicians and scholars at MTUN universities in Malaysia are the main respondents of this study because their 
experience in the management field has made them more familiar with risk management, and the researcher was able 
to collect accurate data for excellent results.

Abstract 
Recommendations from previous research report that risk management practices in non-profit institutions, including 
universities and higher education, are less developed than in many business communities. The extent to which 
Malaysian universities, especially MTUN universities, have implemented risk management policies is unclear. 
Similarly, when there are risk management policies, it is not known whether these policies reflect enterprise risk 
management practices and principles, and to what extent these ERM principles have impacted the organizational 
performance of MTUN University. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of enterprise risk 
management on the organizational performance of MTUN University in Malaysia. Data will also be collected from 
academicians’ and scholars from the Malaysian Technical University Network (MTUN), which brings together four 
technology universities' in Malaysia, University Malaysia Perlis (UNIMAP), Technical University of Malaysia 
Malacca (UTEM), University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), and University of Pahang Malaysia (UMP). More 
specifically, academicians and scholars at MTUN universities in Malaysia are the main respondents to this study 
because their experience in the management field has made them more familiar with risk management, and the 
researcher will be able to obtain accurate data for excellent results.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the effect of auditor professionalism and professional ethics on consideration 
of the level of materiality in the audit process of the entity's financial statements with a descriptive 
quantitative research approach. The population in this study is the auditor who works at the Public 
Accounting Firm (KAP) of the city of Surabaya. Sampling is done by purposive sampling, and primary 
data types. Based on testing researchers can conclude that the two independent variables (Professionalism 
of the Auditor and Professional Ethics) together have a significant influence on the balance of the level of 
materiality in KAP Surabaya City. This can be seen from the calculated f value which is greater than the f 
table ((251,343> 2,025), while partially the independent variables (Professionalism of the Auditor and 
Professional Ethics) also have a significant influence on the consideration of materiality level in KAP 
Surabaya. This can be seen from t calculate auditor professionalism variable is greater than t table (8,851> 
2,025), and t calculate professional ethics variable is greater than t table (10,552> 2,025), while for testing 
the coefficient of determination (R square) the results obtained are 0.911 or equal to 91, It means that the 
independent variable in this study (Auditor Professionalism and Professional Ethics) is able to explain and 
influence the dependent variable (Materiality Level Considerations) by 91.1%, while the remaining 8.9% 
is explained or influenced by other factors not explained in this research.

commercial, and accessories. For indoor lighting class, they market LED lights that have the best features 
to offer used mainly for indoor. High quality LED lights with maximum brightness are designed for outdoor 
lighting class. For commercial lighting class, high-class performance LED lights suitable for commercial 
use are designed. Accessories market by GES are designed to have a special structure that is beneficial to 
heat dispersion. The company has incurred a penalty loss of PHP 155,771.05 in the year 2019. To remain 
competitive in today's service industry market, a plan is being evaluated for this annual loss of opportunity 
to recover the company's expected profit. Various analyzes have been used to diagnose the observed 
problem, including the why-why diagrams, stream diagnosis, and Kepner-Tregoe analysis. The company 
witnessed an increasing number of undelivered items due to inefficient record keeping and inefficient 
process of recording process orders. The researchers conducted a series of analysis on the proposed 
alternatives that are further tested using cost-benefit analysis and integrated by risk analysis and FMEA. 
With the solutions being evaluated, rectified for their execution with cost-benefit analyzes and risk assessed, 
a realistic approach to solving the steady lack of opportunity is considered a prime premise for a solution.

1. Introduction
Light emitting diode lights or simply known as LED lights were introduced to address the need for energy saving. Its 
efficiency can be measured by the low amounts of power consumed by these lights compared to traditional lights used 
in households, commercial establishments, and others. Wen et. al (2011) proposed the advantage of LEDs illumination 
in general household lighting. According to their study, the power consumption and efficiency of traditional 
illuminated light sources and LED light source in lighting the household environment were analyzed and compared 
with each other at the same standard of average illuminance. The study resulted to advantage of using LEDS in 
household lighting. The demand for lighting products continues to rapidly increase as infrastructures, buildings, 
houses, and etc. continues to develop. Lighting industry all over the world produces more and more lighting products 
driven by the increase in demand. In this nature, the service industry is very broad. It covers a wide range of activities 
that add value to businesses and individuals, but the output is not physical product, rather this industry is enhancing, 
maintaining, repairing, shaping, and making various changes to physical items. A service dominated economy is a 
feature of developed countries. Service has been one of the Philippines economy’s strongest and fast-growing 
industries. Philippines aims to position itself as a center of trade in services in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific 
region. This study involved, Centron Energy Savings Technology Corporation, is a professional manufacturer of 
energy efficient lighting system under the brand GES (Green Energy Savings). Its business philosophy is an advocacy 
that aim to provide the Filipino consumers with economical energy-efficient lighting products and systems used for

For the implementation of the proposed alternative for inefficient record keeping, the company uses a manual record 
keeping for all their files, in order to reduce or eliminate misplaced documents and mistakes in encoding of records, 
the EMC will use a new database system design to keep and track all company files. The company will conduct dry-
runs and provide trainings for their employees for 2 months. An evaluation will be made after 6 months of operation. 
While for the implementation of the proposed alternative for inefficient process of recording customer orders, The 
current ordering system of the company experiences problems when it comes to accuracy. The new ordering system 
will allow the company to view client details, check for unsettled payments, check product availability, and verify 
order list. It will also help customers in placing job orders by providing an accurate ordering system where they can 
check the availability of each product. The initial implementation of the new ordering system will take about 3 months 
for both customers and employees to be familiarized and trained.  The company will conduct dry-runs and provide 
trainings for their employees for the whole implementation period. An evaluation will be made after 6 months of 
operation. In introducing and implementing new procedures and systems into an organization, risk assessments shall 
always be made. This will allow the project team consider factors that may be harmful to the company upon 
implementing changes. Analysing possible risks at an early stage gives the company a heads-up on what to expect to 
the plan of action, which to prioritize, and the alternatives on how to address those risks. 
 
5.Conclusion 
 
The researchers conducted a study at Centron Energy Savings Technology Corporation. It is a qualified energy 
efficient lighting system manufacturer under the GES (Green Energy Saving) brand. Its business philosophy is 
advocacy aimed at providing consumers in the Philippines with economical, energy-efficient lighting products and 
systems used in the home and industry. Using their current systems and procedures, the researchers were able to 
understand and analyze the company's problem. During company visits, interviews, data and current system reviews, 
it was found that the company had issues with record keeping and the inefficient method of tracking customer orders.  
Four alternatives for the root cause found were considered. The four alternatives were analyzed using cost analysis-
benefit analysis and came up to the best alternative to fix the root causes of undelivered items. To help determine the 
factors that affect the increase of undelivered items in the company, introducing a database system to solve the 
inefficient record keeping process. A new ordering system is also proposed to fix the inefficient process of recording 
customer orders.  In addition, the chosen alternative is possible, and entails a significant risk. Centron Energy Savings 
Technology Corporation has solved the issue by addressing the root cause. Clear consideration of possible risks gives 
the company a head-up on what to expect from the action plan, which to prioritize, and the options on how to handle 
those risks.

Abstract 
Process Management or Business Process Management (BPM) ideas published in a book Hammer’s Business Process 
Reengineering Concept, are implemented in many businesses nowadays. Process management helps companies 
achieve quality, time, and cost goals. In quality management systems, the concept of process management is the core 
integrates into the performance and risk management system. On the other hand, an interesting research question is 
what is the role of process management in the context of the 4th industrial revolution and smart factories. The number 
of solutions for automated processes in the smart factories will be increasing, and due to this fact, traditional 
management tools and techniques should be revised. Business process management is one of them. Based on this fact, 
we have tried to answer the research question — What is the role of BPM for Industry 4.0? — in this paper. This 
research question deals in this article, which focuses attention on selected aspects of BPM within the Industry 4.0 
concept. The paper also attempts to mention the impacts and needs of current technical education in this area.

Introduction and motivation
Industry 4.0 is nowadays a topic of research and interest for many universities, research institutes, and businesses. 
Research focuses on how this concept is implemented in practice. It requires, in particular, the transition to the 
digitization of business processes and their ICT support. In particular, the use of cyber-physical systems, which allow 
to simulate reality and implement digital twins for virtual machine control, including robots and processes, is 
discussed. 
One of the prerequisites for the successful implementation of this management concept is the understanding of 
processes in the company and the description of process models. Experience shows that these process models could 
be used to implement information systems to support the management of all business activities, from operations 
management to supply chain management. In the past, many businesses have also focused on supporting the 
implementation of process management as a way to help them achieve their goals in terms of quality, cost, and time. 
The concept of business process management has been adopted for quality management standards. Due to this reason, 
many companies implemented this concept for their management. 
Based on the mentioned facts, the research question has been formulated. The core research question is What is the 
role of business process management (BPM) for Industry 4.0? This paper deals with an answer to the formulated 
research question.

The business process execution in terms of Industry 4.0 is related to the digital factory and application of the Cyber-
Physical System (CPS). The rules and process model can be used for the definition of elementary relationships in 
CPS. The cyber level of CPS enables simulation of the process with using digital twins and makes an environment for 
processes execution.  
The CPS implements these elements: 
●
Data acquisition and data processing.
●
Machine to Machine communication.
●
Human-machinene interaction.
3.4 Self-controlling system 
The result of data collection and integrations is a self-controlling system. This system is almost autonomous with an 
overview of a responsible person (e.g., operator, maintenance worker) if any situation occurs, then he needs to correct 
it. The self-controlling system produces maximal productivity because the system can optimize itself. Benefits that 
can this implementation brings are more visible and optimized decision making, better planning methods, data 
analysis, remote monitoring, automation, proactive maintenance, and more significant agility. This is also related to 
the issue of business process improvement. 
Process improvement is an important phase of business process management. The aim is the continual improvement 
of the business process based on monitoring and data collection. Especially in the context of digital processes, the 
identification of existing pain points can be realized through the performance of continuous software tests. The other 
definition explains process improvement is the proactive task of identifying, analyzing, and improving upon existing 
business processes within an organization for optimization, and to meet new quotas or standards of quality. The 
companies collect data not only from manufacturing processes but from all processes during the product life cycle.  
The companies use several methodologies like Six Sigma, and Centric leverages DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Improve, Control), Lean principles etc. New possibilities of technologies of Industry 4.0 can effectively support the 
implementation of the mentioned methodologies.  The selection of a continuous improvement methodologies depends 
on the overall strategy. 
3.5 Summary 
Table 1 is summarizing the role of business process management for the implementation phase of concept Industry 
4.0. It is evident that the essential theoretical and practical background may be applied.

For a successful implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept, it is necessary to create an implementation team with the 
appropriate competence and knowledge. The implementation team should include a process analyst or methodologist 
with the following knowledge (Benesova and Tupa, 2017): 
-
Project management
-
Engineering and technology management
-
Innovation management
-
Risk and ICT management
-
Business process management
-
Soft skills – communication, creativity

Abstract 
Hospitals are under pressure to match supply with increasing demand as well as ensuring patient safety and 
satisfaction. One of the challenges occur in patient discharge process. In our senior design project, the aim 
is to reduce orthopedic inpatients’ discharge time. It’s the time when patients are allowed to leave the 
hospital after a medical procedure. The team has applied various tools to achieve the desired outcomes. 
First, the team constructed a Value Stream Map, which is an essential lean tool that aids in visualizing the 
current process and identifies possible improvement potentials in every stage of the process. Moreover, the 
team used simulation to mimic the process and understand its dynamic nature then proceed with interpreting 
the results using statistics. In addition, a fishbone diagram was used to categorize all potential causes of our 
targeted issue and identify potential root causes. Using the above tools, we have proceeded with applying 
Six Sigma DMAIC to focus on better understanding customers' requirements and eliminating defects 
causing variations in quality. Finally, the team has taken benefit of all the tools applied to perform the 
necessary statistical analysis.  Next, using these findings, the team generated alternative feasible solutions 
and concepts using several techniques.

Abstract 
In this study, the methodology of life cycle assessment was used to assess the environmental impacts of a 
500MW oil-fired power plant in Sudan. Ecoinvent database along with primary data obtained from the 
Sudanese Thermal Power Generating Company Ltd (STPGC) were utilized. Life cycle analysis was 
conducted with the aid of OpenLCA software and the ReCiPe method was employed. Results revealed 
that the environmental impact is dominated by climate change with a value of 1.07992 kg 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2-eq 
followed by the fossil fuel depletion category, which is equal to 0.39320 kg oil-eq. Furthermore, the third 
most pronounced category is human toxicity with a value of 0.08983 kg 1,4-DCB-eq followed by ionizing 
radiation category with a value of 0.07341 kg U235-eq. Additionally, in regard to the endpoint level, it 
was found that 46% of the overall life cycle impact damages the resources , 36% affects human health 
and 18% contributes to ecosystem quality damage. Moreover, the operation phase and oil upstream 
processes were found to be the most burdensome on the environment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to determine the primary influential factors on environmental impacts, it was evidently clear 
that plant efficiency is the most dominant parameter affecting the results.

1. Introduction
In recent years, growing concerns regarding global warming, air pollution, increasing energy costs and security of 
energy supply, have generated a heated debate among policymakers, related experts, and the general public (United 
Nations 2015). The demand for a green and more sustainable power grid has become internationally urgent, causing 
the implementation of new energy-saving and emissions reduction strategies, at both international and European 
level (Orfanos et al. 2019). In 2015, at the Paris Climate Change Conference, the Paris agreement was born (United 
Nations, 2015). It laid the basis for how countries, including the European Union, should work together under the 
umbrella of a legal framework to tackle the threats of climate change by the year 2020 and beyond. 
Between 1973–2013, the gross electricity production around the world grew from 6144 TW h to 23,391 TW h by an 
average annual growth rate of 3.4% (Hertwich et al. 2015). In 2013 over 67.2% of the world electricity production 
was generated from fossil fuel-powered plants, consequently, a considerable amount (about 40%) of global 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are produced by electricity generation, constituting a very essential role for this 
sector in GHG mitigation strategies as demonstrated by (Treyer and Bauer 2016) and (Jaramillo et al. 2007). 
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation not only contributes to 
climate change by emitting greenhouse gases but also has other environmental impacts such as ozone depletion, 
acidification, eutrophication and the depletion of natural resources as well, caused by other environmental stressors 
(Song et al. 2017). 
Decisions are no longer being based solely on economic perspectives, instead, potential environmental impacts of 
electricity produced by existing technologies and alternatives are now taken into consideration. Nevertheless, only

In contrast, an increase in fuel consumption is associated with lower thermal efficiency which leads to a higher level 
of emissions throughout various life cycle processes for the lower case.  
4. Conclusions   
 
In conclusion, the environmental impact was evaluated, for the midpoint level, by four major impact categories 
namely, climate change, fossil fuel depilation category, human toxicity, ionizing radiation. In regard to the endpoint 
level, it can be concluded that 46% of the overall life cycle impact damages the resources and 36% of the overall 
impact affects human health and the remaining 18% contributes to ecosystem quality damage. 
 
Furthermore, major impactful processes on the environment encompassed by the system boundary were identified. 
The operation phase and oil upstream processes account together for more than 80% of the impact in each midpoint 
impact category. Therefore, these processes are considered to be the most burdensome on the environment and 
further attention should be directed towards them for the purpose of enhancing the environmental profile of the 
power plant.     
 
Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the primary influential factors on environmental impacts 
that could be addressed to mitigate adverse environmental effects, it was found that plant efficiency is the most 
dominant parameter that yields a significant influence on the life cycle assessment findings compared to the 
remaining parameters. Consequently, corrective measures should be taken to boost the efficiency of the plant to 
considerably diminish the environmental impacts caused by the power plant life cycle.

Abstract 
There is a tendency for administrative reform in developing countries experiencing has limitations or even 
failure. The reason is not to consider the institutional factors in carrying out administrative reforms both 
formal and informal institutional factors. As a result, the results of the reform are not in accordance with 
the situation and condition of the community and the surrounding environment. for this reason, it is 
necessary to include institutional factors in every reform agenda undertaken by the government. The aims 
of these articles are to provide description and analysis that reinforces the importance of institutional factors 
both formal and informal in the context of administrative reform in a country. The analysis in this article 
uses a qualitative descriptive method with library research technique. The articles for the analyzed are 
international journals with the theme of institutional factors in the context of reform in various countries. 
the results of this analysis are illustrate that actually related to institutional factors in the context of 
administrative reform, this has been widely applied in several countries. from the results of this analysis 
also explains that an administrative reform tends to fail if they do not consider the institutional factors 
formal and informal. whereas for governments or countries that consider formal or informal institutional 
factors in any administrative reform tend to be successful.

Introduction 
To this day, the study of public bureaucracy has never been exhausted and always been a strategic issue in state life. 
Problems related to bureaucracy always arise and differ from time to time. Policy solutions generated from the past 
sometimes become problems in the present. This condition is inseparable from the changes, developments, and 
demands of the bureaucratic environment both the internal and external environment. Therefore, bureaucratic reform 
is an important agenda to be scheduled in order to create the effective bureaucracy that meets the demands and 
development of the time and environment. 
Bureaucratic organizations do not exist and act in empty space, values, and norms. Bureaucracy is an organization 
that grow and develop in the midst of society whose developed and interrelated with the development of the 
community itself. Related to that, the policies regarding bureaucratic reform are taken must be based on the situation 
and conditions of the bureaucratic environment. Both the external and internal demands of the bureaucratic 
organization are the basis of reform. Historical background, culture, and beliefs of the local community where 
bureaucratic organizations are located are the determining variables in influencing the existence, performance and

As explained in the scheme and table, in general, the results of research analyzed in these articles/journals above can 
be categorized into two categories. The first is research that focuses on formal factors while the second is informal 
factors. Furthermore, formal factors discussed in the study include; written law, rules/regulations, contractual 
agreements, and constitutions. Meanwhile related to informal factors consist of; political ideology, financial, financial 
crisis, business environment. 
 
Public sector institutional reform requires reviewing the structure in a macro, how the structure of the government 
from the central government to the regional government, and the state administration and governance system. This is 
all related to the situation and conditions of a policy set and how all the elements are related. According to Joshi 
(2015), there are three perspectives that must be understood in the context of public sector institutional reform, namely: 
the reciprocal relationship between levels of government that exist within a country. The second is the relationship 
between the state and society or society, where this relationship is related to policymakers and service providers with 
the community as recipients of services. While the third is the relationship with the private sector or private sector, 
where the relationship between the government and the private sector will be mutually beneficial where the 
government guarantees a conducive business climate through regulations and security while the private sector provides 
both direct and indirect tax benefits to the economic growth of the community. From the perspective of this macro 
relationship, it really determines how reform is originally born. These macro conditions can be a motivating or 
triggering factor behind a reform. 
Furthermore, related to the results of the study of the research journals above, it can be said that all research results 
show the interrelation or influence of institutional factors in the context of public sector reform, both quantitative and 
qualitative research. This argument shows the importance of including institutional variables in designing and carrying 
out public sector reform agendas so that public sector reforms will be not rejected and fail. 
 
 
3.2. Conclusion 
 
After seeing the results of the analysis of the articles/journals of the research results above, it can be concluded several 
conclusions, the first; It is important to consider and include institutional factors as variables that have influence in 
the context of public sector reform. The second, these institutional factors can be formal and informal institutional 
factors that exist within and outside public sector organizations. The third, more important thing is that these variables 
of institutional factors determine the success of a public sector reform agenda that undertaken. The ability to define 
and understand institutional factors will be very helpful in arranging and scheduling public sector reforms that are 
appropriate to the circumstances surrounding the environment so that there is no rejection or failure.

Abstract 
Kalesang   Desa is a community development program carried out by the Buru  Regency government in 
the context of community welfare.  This paper aims to explain the function of Kalesang Desa which is 
carried out as an effort to develop the community and to map the potential of social energy contained in 
the implementation of Kalesang Desa. The results of the study show that the Kalesang Desa program as a 
development effort is able to become a medium for raising of social energy where locality, kinship and 
local leadership are positive signals of community development.  The elements for the development of 
social energy are very strong because they are supported by the order of local values in the form of 
kinship, cultural values and local leadership owned by the community in Buru Regency. Thus, very 
interesting from this study is the existence of synchronization between the implementation of Kalesang 
Desa with the potential of social energy which drives the dynamics of rural community development. 
Keywords: kalesang, village, community, buru, maluku 
1. Introduction
In general, the aim of Kalesang Desa is to improve the welfare of rural communities and the quality of human life in 
rural areas through the provision of meeting basic needs, construction of village facilities and infrastructure, 
development of local economic potential, sustainable use of natural resources and the environment (Rodríguez-Pose 
and von Berlepsch 2014; M. C. B. Umanailo and Ali 2019).  Villages have become very important for the central 
and regional governments but they cannot always be in line with the reality on the ground. 
The context of Kalesang Desa in Buru Regency is interesting because its geography indicates the wide availability 
of rural areas with all the resources contained therein including potential sources of labour. The efforts of the Buru 
Regency Government to continue to spur growth and village development can be seen with various programs that 
have been carried out over the past few years, such as the harvest, tourism promotion and fisheries resource 
development. In reality, the infrastructure development that is carried out often left behind horizontal problems and 
conflicts that change the meaning of the development being carried out (Pieniazek 2016). When the Kalesang Desa 
program was prepared, the Buru Regency   Government program was more focused on education and health issues 
and the village's mainstay products in accordance with local wisdom in each of the villages. Based on locality 
ownership due to differences in the structure and local wisdom of each village, it is expected that with the Kalesang 
Desa program (M. C. B. Umanailo 2013), all of these problems can be fixed, and if the Kalesang Desa program can 
be developed, the aim of making the village as the axis of development more tangible will be realized. 
The specifications of the Kalesang Desa program in Buru Regency are a breakthrough program that is more focused 
on issues of education, health and the potential of the village's mainstay including forms of local wisdom in each 
village that need to be preserved. According to the Buru Regent, Ramly Umasugi, this program will not be the same 
in all villages because each village has its own local structure and wisdom. For this reason, the program will be 
adapted to the culture in each village (Tahir and Umanailo 2019). In addition, this program also aims to maintain the

In its achievement, local traditions become one of the instruments of success in giving birth to social energy (M. C. 
B. Umanailo 2020). The habit of the community to be involved in village affairs, cleaning the village becomes a 
value of its own locality in problem-solving efforts. This condition is also supported by the cultural values of the 
people in Buru Regency who generally want to wait and assume that the natural plan does not need to be resisted but 
it is already a life value where humans are expected to always endeavour even in difficult conditions (poor). 
The implementation of the Kalesang Desa is able to synergize with local leadership patterns, the Kalesang Desa 
accommodates local leadership and eliminates the domination of influential people or elite groups in each village so 
that the participants created is a desire born of awareness to help each other work in developing the village. 
 
4. Conclusion. 
 
Community empowerment is a series of systematic actions and involves various components of formal and informal 
organizations. Kelsang Desa as an initiative to build a village is a movement to gather the strengths and abilities of 
the community and their environment. Social energy in rural areas whose existence is part of the inherent of village 
community life has a strategic potential in driving the empowerment of rural communities. This energy is in the 
form of a solid blend of all potential elements of society, ranging from groups of educators, entrepreneurs, farmers, 
students, religious leaders, traditional leaders; which are all available in people's lives. 
The elements of Kalesang Desa, if compiled, consolidated, and utilized will produce social energy that can be 
utilized for the benefit of rural community development. Thus, it can be said that in the implementation of the 
Kalesang Desa there is the potential to develop social energy within the community in Buru district.

Abstract 
The Sula language is a language found in the Maluku region, which is still used by the Buru people, 
especially in the village of Sawah. This regional language has a linguist system that is different from other 
local words , so it must be preserved as national wealth. This study aims to obtain the Sula Dialek Falahu 
language adjective morphology of Sawah Village in Namlea District. This research is field research and 
literature with data collection techniques, namely: elicitation, recording, and recording. The source of this 
research data is oral data obtained through informants. After the information is collected, the next steps 
taken are to analyze the data with the following steps; describe the data obtained, classify, and summarize 
the results obtained from the informant. The results showed that the adjective morphological system 
found adjective characteristics, both morphological, syntactic, and semantic attributes in the Sula 
language. 
Keywords: Morphology, Adjective, Sula, Falahu.
1. Introduction
Regional languages are languages that must be preserved because local languages are the wealth of 
linguists and Indonesian culture. Without writing, society will be rigid in communicating; of course, all of this 
requires communication as a tool of interaction in social life.  The introduction of regional languages through 
research efforts is essential in the context of development today and enriches the vocabulary of Indonesian words 
and is one of the founding foundations for national unity. As stipulated in Article 36 of the 1945 Constitution, 
Indonesian is the national language. However, in the explanation, it is formulated that in areas that have their styles, 
which are well cared for by the people (for example, Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Moluccas, etc.) those 
languages will be respected and maintained by the state (Tahir and Umanailo 2019). 
Regional languages are currently more widely used by the inhabitants of the tribe concerned, most of whom 
live in rural areas or small towns. The preservation, development, and growth of local languages are highly 
dependent on the commitment of the speakers or users of the word to always voluntarily use their expression in daily 
life. If the speakers of a regional language are still numerous, and they also pass on the local dialects they control to 
children and adolescents, then the preservation of the language concerned will be guaranteed in the long run.

4. Conclusions  
 
Based on the results of data analysis and discussion in this study, it can be concluded that the morphological 
characteristics of adjectives are characterized by the existence of an affixation process that produces some 
morphemes. The morpheme consists of inflectional adjective morpheme and derivational adjective morpheme. In 
addition to the morphological features, there are also syntactic and semantic characteristics to mark the class of 
adjectives in Sula Dalek falahu. This is important because not all words can be identified by certain morphological 
features that can distinguish absolutely identifiers from other word classes. 
When viewed in terms of morphology, adjectives consist of basic adjectives and formed adjectives. Basic 
adjectives and adjectives are formed in the Sula language falahu dialect. As for suggestions in research to foster and 
preserve the Sula Falahu dialect, it is necessary to conduct more specialized research on other aspects so that Sula 
language is not threatened with extinction. As well as giving contributions to the Buru community, especially the 
village of Swah to keep the language and culture maintained.

Abstract  
 
Changes in local government institutions is a certainty that cannot be avoided. Various factors that cause 
these changes and various carriers of changes that trigger changes. The advancement of information and 
communication technology as a change-carrying artefact has a great opportunity in these changes. This 
opportunity will be even more significant when the demands of the needs and environmental conditions 
that exist around local governments collaborate in encouraging these changes. The institutional pillars hold 
an essential position in diffusing communication and information technology through institutionalization 
efforts so that this digital technology can become an integral part in the administration of regional 
government.

1. Introduction 
 
Decentralization has made local governments in Indonesia in various dilemma positions in managing bureaucracy in 
the regions. Various demands of situations and conditions that change very quickly bring its ambiguity for the local 
government and its bureaucracy to determine and take firm and definite steps in carrying out their duties and functions 
more productively. Building certainty and firmness of bureaucracy in carrying out its tasks and functions is not as 
easy as turning the palm because what is needed is dynamic adaptation and acceleration following such rapid changes. 
Local governments formed after the centralized era was then in a frame of decentralized conditions which initially 
immediately experienced a surplus of authority as a result of the devolution of authority from the central government. 
Then gradually the authority is rationalized with a variety of considerations both because of the potential possessed 
by the region and the ability of local governments to manage and carry out these authorities. Thus the local government 
will be faced with a dilemmatic position, where limitations are originating from the conditions and situation of the 
region itself. The dilemma, of course, refers to the desires and needs to maximize regional development. However, on 
the other hand, this effort collided with the position of inability that refers to regional conditions. 
Contextually, the limitations that occur are manifested through norms and regulations, which at the same time form 
boundaries in areas that define where and how local governments should act and work. Norms are guidelines that try 
to describe what should be done. At the same time, regulations are a product of constitutional activity intended to 
provide guidance related to the procedures and technical implementation of a policy accompanied by sanctions if the 
procedure is implemented or not implemented. Both norms and regulations are essential institutional instruments in 
assessing the legitimacy of an institution. In the sense that the legitimacy of an institution will be recognized if there

© IEOM Society International 
government bureaucracy. Based on this, the local government must do it in stages, which of course starts from the 
bureaucracy of the local government itself to further addressed to the community. 
n the regulation level, the use of advances in information and communication technology has carried out since the 
issuance of Presidential Instruction No. 3 of 2003 concerning national policies and strategies for e-government 
development. Furthermore, in anticipating the development of situations and conditions, a Presidential Regulation No. 
95 of 2018 concerning Electronic-Based Government Systems. The regulation provides a frame, a reinforcement as 
well as an obligation for local governments to act in the administration of regional governments that utilize advances 
in information and communication technology. The existence of this regulation certainly provides an opportunity for 
local governments to maximize their services to the community so that both administratively and politically, the 
interests of local governments can be achieved to the maximum. 
However, regardless of local government obligations based on existing regulations, it is also necessary to consider the 
feasibility factor. According to Harun, this feasibility is more on the consideration of heterogeneity that must take into 
account (Harun 2018). This heterogeneity is not only about the diversity of tribes, religions and races, but also 
considerations on topographical conditions and regional positions. Geographical conditions in the form of islands are 
essential considerations for formulating flexible regulations. This directed so that the existing regulations can touch 
the condition of regions in the form of islands, especially areas that are in the border, remote and outermost regions. 
One of the things that are entirely instrumental in determining the position of norms and regulations in its 
implementation is how to interpret and interpret existing norms and regulations concerning the application of 
communication and information technology. The interpretation was born from the process of internalization 
environmental conditions that have been interpreting patterns of life and behaviour, both community and bureaucracy 
in the local government. Therefore we need actors who can become agents of change. Actors present as agents of 
change are born from a combination of the political context that developed at the time and institutional characteristics 
(James Mahoney & Thelen 2010). This is important because agents born in the context of local politics and 
institutional characteristics that will build consistency and commitment in the use of information and communication 
technology will have a strong basis of legitimacy to encourage the integration of better use of information and 
communication technology. 
Overall in assessing the integration of communication and information technology directed at institutional change. 
Through digitalizing, the implementation of local government requires institutionalization both in the local 
government bureaucracy and in the community. as stated by Supriyono that the problem of institutionalization can do 
through institutionalizing existing rules accompanied by sanctions, strengthening the roles of the actors so that they 
can carry out their roles and institutionalizing the role of existing institutions both local government and those in 
society (Supriyono 2007). Through efforts to institutionalize the existing pillars, the idea of integrating digitalization 
in the administration of regional government through institutional pillars certainly expected to be comprehensively 
achieved and accepted as an integral part of governance. 
 
3.2. Conclusion 
The conclusion obtained from this article that technology as an artefact is a carrier of institutional change in the local 
government bureaucracy is a condition that is now happening. This is a certainty given the need to provide the best 
service and achieve the maximum goals is a condition that cannot be avoided by local governments. On the other 
hand, the latest and globalized information and communication technology advancements require local governments 
to participate actively and progressively follow these developments. 
Integrating the idea of digitalization in local government requires the diffusion of existing institutional pillars, norms, 
regulations and cultural-cognitive. This is an absolute requirement so that the integration of digital technology in the 
administration of government does not run slowly. In order for this integration to be able to give birth to institutional 
changes that function optimally, efforts are needed to institutionalize these pillars, so that the role of institutional 
pillars can usher in institutional changes in local government bureaucracy through communication technology as a 
carrier of institutional change.

Abstract 
The study of the development of science and technology cannot stand alone as a mere knowledge, the link 
between the development of science and technology has an impact on the formation of participatory space 
which is generally understood as a space for discussion or where individuals meet with their environment. 
This study explores and repositioned participatory spaces that are in ideal conditions and shifts into an 
illusion of reality and is able to shift participatory space that is material to the form of networked space 
that is directly related to the use of technology. The greater participation of the Buru Regency community 
in communicating on social media certainly can shape public sensitivity (sense of public). So that the 
community can monitor inequality and misappropriation which becomes bad behaviour and public 
services. The critical attitude of the citizens who are built in the alternative public space (in this case 
social media), is expected to encourage participation to jointly develop civil society. Where social and 
civilization systems are built based on moral principles that guarantee a balance between individual 
freedom and collective stability.

In social life, we often encounter changes in all aspects of life, including changes in the community itself, because 
basically there is no static society. There are always changes in society dynamically. Whether the change builds up 
in a positive sense or vice versa has a negative impact on society, the change is a consequence of technological 
innovation. 
Science is an English word science, or Scientia (Latin). The Latin verb is scire, which means to know or know. What 
is science; a common and easy definition is a systematic body of knowledge. John G Kemeny: defines science as 
""All knowledge collected by means of the scientific method"" (all knowledge gathered by scientific methods) so 
science is systematic knowledge. 
Technology is simply defined as the application of science, especially natural scientific knowledge. Bunge defines 
technology as applied science. So science and technology are different but inseparable, there is a dialectical 
relationship. Science prepares supporting materials in the form of theories, on the contrary, the invention of 
technology broadens the horizons of scientific research. 
Meanwhile, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a large umbrella terminology that covers all 
technical equipment for processing and delivering information, covering two aspects, namely information 
technology and communication technology. Information technology includes all matters relating to the process, use 
as a tool, manipulation, and management of information, while communication technology is everything related to 
the use of tools to process and transfer data from one device to another. Therefore, information technology and 
communication technology are two inseparable concepts. So Information and Communication Technology contain a 
broad understanding that is all activities related to processing, manipulation, management, transfer of information 
between media (Pusat Data dan Sistem Informasi Pertanian 2014)  
Rapid developments in the field of communication have made experts call it a communication revolution. This rapid 
change is driven by the existence of various inventions in the field of technology so that what used to be an obstacle 
in communication activities, is now wide open. A person can relate to someone or a group of people without being

public sphere ""protect against any economic and social conditions to give everyone the same opportunity to express 
opinions"", emphasizing the protection of individual freedom from the force. 
The Government of Buru Regency seems to continue to strive to open up these public spaces with the active 
involvement of various institutional accounts and public officials, this should be a means that must be used by the 
community if it then wants democratic development to continue to develop (Umanailo et al. 2019). And the success 
of public space does not only depend on the Buru Regency government but on the contrary the community's support 
to participate is the biggest contribution. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
So the essence of digital democracy in the public sphere, the Internet brings in the convergence of text, audio and 
visuals in public dialogue in the public space of the Buru Regency community and increases lateral, interactive and 
discursive communication. This public space can be said to be a democratic space in building interactions and can 
also filter out a variety of opposing and supportive views. The people of Buru Regency must also be prepared to face 
the logical consequences of differences in opinion and analysis. Primordials should no longer emerge which will 
make the public space of Buru Regency people become the boundaries of the area of origin and interests and the 
regional government must continue to strive for the growth and development of public awareness to use public space 
as a means of exchanging information, learning and actualizing.

Abstract 
There are several models of multicriteria analysis methods, but there is no common agreement on the most 
effective method for project selection (Archer & Ghasemzadeh, 2004). In this article, we will present a case 
study for the selection of projects using two families of multicriteria analysis methods namely the methods 
of upgrading ELECTRE II and I and utility methods, and then give a comparative summary of the two 
categories. Through this case study, we note that the results obtained are different depending on the method 
used and the intended purpose, and the choice between a method close to the Utility Theory (MAUT) and 
outranking method must be made according to the advantages and limitations of these categories of 
multicriteria analysis methods (MAM).

1. Introduction
Current projects evolve in a complex environment that is undergoing rapid and often unpredictable changes. 
Conventional planning and project execution tools are only effective if they are part of a global project 
portfolio management approach, while taking into account these dynamic aspects and emphasizing the need 
to innovate to succeed (Tayeb Louafa, 2008); in project portfolio management, success does not only mean 
doing projects well, but also choosing the right projects. 
In the early phases of project portfolio management, several processes require tools and techniques for 
project analysis (qualitative and quantitative analysis: prioritization analysis, capacity analysis, graphical 
analysis, etc.) (PMI, 2013). Thus, multi-criteria decision-making methods become indispensable tools to 
select the right projects. 
There are several models of multicriteria decisions (ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, MAUT, AHP, the 
weighted sum, etc.) and mathematical optimization (ILP, IGP, etc.). However, there is no common 
agreement on the most effective method for project selection (Archer & Ghasemzadeh, 2004).  
Indeed, selection processes based on quantitative and qualitative criteria are used in decision-making to 
justify budget investments and resource allocations. In many cases, however, only financial criteria are 
taken into account in project selection decisions. In other cases, the decision-making process is based on 
the experience and impression of senior management. And generally the decision that results from these 
methods can be very debatable (Hugo Caballero et al., 2012). 
In this article, we will present a case study for the selection of projects using two families of multicriteria 
analysis methods namely the methods of upgrading ELECTRE I and II and utility methods, then give a 
comparative summary of the two categories.

3.3.7- Choquet integral 
The Choquet integral is an aggregation function applying a non-additive model contrary to the previous functions. It 
is defined by the following relation: 
∀(x1, … , xn) ∈ X, C(x)= u(x1, . . . , xn) = 
{i,.., n}(ui (xT(i)) – ui(xT(i-1))). 
x 
 y ⇔ ∀ i ∈ N, ui(x) ≥ ui(y)  
 
avec T(i) une permutation telle que ui(xT(i)) 
ui(xT(i+1)) et u1(xT(0)) =0. 
Example: considering the following data: 
- 
The subset consisting of four projects: P1, P4, P7, P8; 
- 
The criteria: C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5;

3.3.8- Conclusion on MAUT methods

Although the MAUT approach highlights a wide variety of easily comparable numerical solutions and uses fairly 
simple computational methods, it is still complex for the decision-maker to visualize what utility is associated with. 
performance given on each criterion and give a total pre-order. In addition, it is a totally compensatory method, that

is to say that the bad score of an action on a criterion can be completely compensated by its good score on another 
criterion which complicates the interpretation results obtained. 
 
4. Comparative of the two categories 
The table below summarizes the advantages and limitations of each type of these methods. 
MAM Categorie  
Advantages 
Limitations 
Outranking 
method 
- A more elaborate structure based on a 
reflexive 
relationship, 
- it inform the decision-maker about his 
choice; the actions to be eliminated and those 
to be kept (but incomparable between them), 
- Most outranking methods construct the 
overclass relationship based on two concepts 
of concordance and non-discordance. 
- 
structure 
preferably 
developed 
progressively on the basis of less rich 
information (absence of pre-orders), 
- acceptance of the idea of the 
incomparability of actions, which often 
leads to a more in-depth study with the 
aim of reducing or clarifying all the 
actions 
and 
all 
the 
criteria, 
- Does not solve the problem of decision-
making, 
- The outranking relationship has no 
particular 
properties 
other 
than 
reflexivity. As a result, outranking 
methods will first have to build this 
relationship and then use it to answer the 
chosen problem. 
Utility Theory 
- Production of a total pre-order, 
- The result is very rich, based on the wealth 
of hypotheses of the theory, 
- Produce a function that can store all the 
actions from the best to the least good: Large 
varieties of solutions put forward according 
to the method used, 
- Possibility to have the decision-maker 
describe this function via a set of numerous 
and 
sometimes-difficult 
questions 
concerning the intensities of his preferences 
and the weightings of the criteria and / or the 
substitution rates between criteria. 
- Need a lot of information (values and 
parameters) 
-Additional methods: compensatory. 
-Delicate interpretation of the parameters, 
-A 
sensitivity 
analysis 
should 
be 
conducted systematically, to release the 
only robust information, but this is rarely 
done. 
Table 11. Advantages and limitations of outranking method and utility theory 
5. Conclusion: 
All multi-criteria decision support methods have the advantage of being able to make a decision based on multiple 
criteria and not on the basis of a single criterion (profit for example). Beyond this observation, the results obtained are 
different from one method to another. 
Thus, the choice between Utility Theory (MAUT) and outranking method must be done according to the advantages 
and limitations of these broad categories of multicriteria analysis methods (MAM). Indeed, MAUT has the advantage 
of being easier to use but its compensatory character makes the interpretation of the results difficult. Unlike the 
ELECTRE method, which is more difficult to apply, but it helps to inform the decision-maker about his choice 
between the actions or projects to be kept and those to be eliminated but doesn’t solve the problem of decision-making 
itself.  
This is why the use of other methods is still necessary to complete the decision-making process. For example, the 
AHP (Analytic hierarchy process) which allows to hierarchically structure a complex, multi-criteria, multi-person and 
multi-period problem. This method is used for decision making in complex situations where human perception, 
judgments, and consequences have long-term implications (Bhushan and Rai, 2004). Thus, the combination of several 
methods remains possible.

Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to examine and improve material handling at the import warehouse in Kuwait 
Air Cargo (KAC) to ensure efficiency and safety. KAC has been losing customers to a new competitor and 
one of the reasons is the delays in customer’s retrieval of cargo from the import warehouse. To improve 
customer satisfaction, the efficiency of the system and the workers has to be improved. The safety and the 
comfort of the workers has to be considered while the efficiency is increased. By using AutoCAD and 
Tecnomatix, the layout of the warehouse is modified, number of forklifts changed and as a result the 
transportation time decreased by 54% on average. The total cargo retrieval system is simulated using Arena 
software. By employing multitasking workers in the delivery of shipments’ counter, the waiting time of the 
full house customers decreased by 72.79% and the single customer decreased by 48.5%. As for the safety 
of the workers, the working of a worker is simulated in digital environment using the software JACK to 
decrease the ergonomic hazards on the workers. Offered solution is using shelves in the landside area which 
reduced the total cumulative compression on the lower back by 28.7% and the total cumulative moment by 
37.7%.

Abstract 
This paper aims at designing a large scale plant for the production of biodiesel using 150,000 ton/yr of waste cooking 
oil produced from various hotels, fast food restaurants, and domestic areas in the UAE. The transestrification reaction 
considered takes place at 60 oC, 400 KPa, methanol/oil mole ratio of 6:1, 1wt% KOH and is carried in four parallel 
PFR each having an arrangement similar to shell and tube heat exchanger (1 shell and 2 passes & 200 tubes per pass) 
with static mixing elements inserted in each tube to achieve enhanced mixing even under laminar flow conditions. A 
detailed equipment design for the proposed flowsheet used for this process, its economic feasibility and profitability 
analysis is thoroughly done. The profit from biodiesel production along with glycerol as a byproduct is found to be 
$142,877,092 for a ten year project life.  Using 5% tax rate for UAE, the discounted profitability analysis showed a 
payback period of 6 years and with a rate of return of 39%.

1. Introduction
In a world that considers fossil fuel as a major source of energy for almost everything, its high rate of depletion and 
toxic emissions raised the need for alternative sources to meet the growing energy demand. Biofuel production such 
as biodiesel is one of these alternatives. It is an organic liquid fuel, fuel additive or extender that is used as a substitute 
for petro-diesel and derived from different vegetable oils or animal fats [1].  This fuel is biodegradable, nontoxic, free 
of sulfur and aromatics, and safer to handle and transport. In addition, it can be used in almost all compression-ignition 
engines without the need of any modifications [2] and has a superior lubricating property making it an excellent 
alternative fuel [3]. Biodiesel is produced through transesterification reaction of oil/fat with alcohol in the presence of 
a catalyst to form esters and glycerol. Generally, waste oil is used and preferred over fresh oils as it contributes 
significantly in the reduction of the process cost since it costs 2-3 times less [4] and manages huge amount of oil from 
the disposal to water and land sources [5]. Focusing on UAE, the produced waste cooking oil is either dumped in the

Figure 4- Mass Balance Using Tertiary Equilibrium data from literature [12]  
6. Conclusion 
Data from various literature reviews were used for performing HMB, sizing, cost estimations, and profitability 
analysis. The results showed that the transestrification reaction in an optimum condition can produce annually 143,130 
ton/yr of biodiesel from a feedstock of 150,000 ton/yr of WPO. Along with high conversion, due to the utilization of 
static mixers in PFR instead of the conventional CSTR, the process efficiency is higher because of better mixing of 
the reactants and less energy consumption as there is no agitation system. Considering 10-year plant with 2 years of 
construction and 5% tax rate for UAE, the economic analysis showed promising outcomes. The undiscounted and 
discounted analysis main results are PBP of 1.5 year with ROROI of 51% and PBP of 1.5 year with ROROI of 51% 
respectively. This green sustainable process contributes to UAE 2021 visions and supports the economic goals of the 
country as well.

Abstract 
 
During the extraction of crude oil from underground oil reservoir, around 3 to 10 barrels of water are generated for 
each barrel of oil which comes as a by-product of petroleum products that is known as produced water. Produced 
water is composed of toxic compounds which are known to cause irreversible damage to the environment. 
Treatment of produced water is necessary to enable its use in various industrial processes and even to meet 
regulations on toxic materials before discharging water into the environment. The goal of this article is to propose a 
method to treat and utilize the massive amount of produced water generated during oil extraction and to outline the 
means to achieve the proposed method. This paper also aims to develop, design and evaluate the possibility of 
treating produced water to bring down the toxicity level of the water such that it meets the cooling tower limit. In 
order to use produced water as make-up water, it is treated using sand filters, activated carbon filters, electrodialysis 
reversal and reverse osmosis units. This process facilitates treatment of about 1500m3/hr of produced water in 15 
hours.  
 
Keywords  
Produced water, cooling tower, electrodialysis reversal, reverse osmosis, refinery waste. 
 
1. Introduction 
Industrial wastewater is one of the primary sources of water pollution (SHI). Industrial wastewater is broadly 
classified by different industries and the level of contaminants present in them. Some common industries include 
iron and steel, textiles and leather, petrochemicals and refinery, microelectronics etc. (SHI). Industrial wastewater 
treatment is one of the most important processes in the world as many industries treat water to recycle it in their 
processes to save money and also to meet regulations on toxic materials before discharging water into the 
environment (Patwardhan, 2017). In a refinery, around 6 barrels of water are required for petroleum production and 
process facilities to produce 1 barrel of oil (Schultz, 2005). This is mainly utilized in cooling towers, as a feed to  
high-pressure boilers, as process water, like water for firefighting and potable water ; with the highest consumption

The unit cost of the utility was found through literature review. The following table 12 summarizes the 
calculations for the total cost of utilities.

4. Conclusion 
 
In this project it was shown that by using water treatment plant that comprises of EDR and RO units, a huge 
amount of produced water can be treated to meet cooling tower requirements. By using the proposed treatment 
plant both environmental and waste minimization problems were addressed. Reusing produced water in 
petroleum refinery was identified as the best means to manage produced water. An economical study was 
conducted on the process plant focusing on capital cost and manufacturing cost. Overall recovery of the 
treatment plant was found to be 75.9% of feed produced water that could be sent to cooling tower unit. The 
treatment capacity of the plant is 1500 
m3
hr  of produced water in 15 to 16 hours. The treatment plant required 2 
storage tanks, 1 sand filter, 1 activated carbon filter, 9 centrifugal pumps, 1 reciprocating pump, 6 EDR stacks 
and 200 RO modules. Recovery ratio for EDR stacks were 94% with recycle and 84% for RO unit. The Fixed 
Capital Investment required for the plant was estimated to be $ 1,188,920.

Abstract 
Tuberculosis links up with HIV/AIDS at any stage of total infection period. Today HIV and TB are the leading 
causes of death due to infectious disease. We analyse HIV/AIDS and TB coinfection model in this paper. The 
HIV/AIDS and TB coinfection model is divided into two sub models like HIV sub model and TB sub model and the 
total population is divided into ten compartments. We investigate the basic reproduction number, disease free 
equilibrium point and the endemic equilibrium point of the model. The HIV only model is locally asymptotically 
stable in case of  disease free equilibrium when basic reproduction number is less than unity and locally 
asymptotically stable in case of endemic equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is greater than unity. The 
TB only model is locally asymptotically stable in case of disease free equilibrium when basic reproduction number 
is less than unity and locally asymptotically stable in case of endemic equilibrium when the basic reproduction 
number is greater than unity. The numerical simulations of this model show the behavior of dynamics of co-
infections of HIV and TB for different values of contract rate for which we can understand the prevalence of 
progression of individual to AIDS stage.

1. Introduction
Infectious diseases have threatening throughout the world day by day and these diseases have a great influence on 
the human population. Although the epidemiology itself has long history mathematical study of diseases and their 
spreading is at most just over three hundred years old. The past history referrers that plague, Nipah, swine flu, 
hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, TB etc are most dangerous infectious diseases that cause a huge loss of human life 
(Constantinos and Russo 2013, Bekker and wood 2010 ). From its very beginning scientists have been trying to 
control these kinds of fatal diseases. After the manifestation of any infectious virus it starts to increase very fast 
sensibly or insensibly and people need the effective method to resist the outbreak of the disease or at least to control 
the number of infections (Bartlett 2007). Transmission diseases have ever been a great concern of human being from 
the very beginning of our history (Sharp and Beatrice 2011). Millions of people die annually from tuberculosis and 
HIV/ AIDS and billions of others are being infected. AIDS indeed is a terribly dangerous disease found almost 
everywhere in human society. But it has not affected all the societies equally throughout the world. People having 
AIDS are always under the threat of death and the very disease is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
usually known as HIV (WHO Report 2016). HIV is a kind of virus which makes the human body almost incapable 
of fighting any kind of infections. HIV virus causes gradual destruction of immune system of human body by 
reflecting a decrease of CD4+T cell counts (WHO Report 2016, Hethcote 200). Significant immune destruction 
helps opportunistic processes develop and thereby infections start taking place in the body. Our human body heavily 
depends on the immune system to fight infections, the same way it depends on the digestive system to digest food 
(Palmisano and Vella 2011, Hussaini 2010). The immune system also prevents some types of infections from taking 
place in the body. If the immune system is totally destroyed then a person will have to die even from a simple 
infection like cold or flu (Sharp and Beatrice 2011, Biswas 2012).

shows that the great number of population reduce from susceptible individuals for the prevalence of HIV and TB. 
Figure 6(b) shows that effect of the reduction of susceptible individuals directly hit upon 
TL and leads to the increase 
of latent TB. Figure 6(c) shows that 
H
I compartment increase over the time. Figure 6(d) shows the behavior of HIV 
infected individuals showing AIDS symptom slightly increase but after 1-2 years it shows the symptoms very fast in 
5 years time scale.  Figure 6(e) shows the HIV infected individuals exposed to TB that means it is a co-infection 
compartment and it takes 5 or more years to get stable position for our model. Figure 6(f) shows the behavior of 
AIDS infected individuals exposed to TB that goes dramatically asymptotical low level. Figure 6(g) describes the 
interaction of the AIDS individuals dually infected with TB. The individuals of this stage might be the combination 
of AIDS and TB in which the number of individuals dually sick from AIDS and TB to asymptotically low levels. 
Figure 6(h) shows the behavior of the people who are exposed to TB only which reaches asymptotically level state 
faster than any other stages of the model. Figure 6(i) shows the behavior of the individuals with symptom of TB 
only and reaches asymptotically level where it is more or less constant. Figure 6(j) shows that the people who are 
recovered from TB but not dually infected with HIV. At first recovered compartment goes to high and then starts to 
decrease due to the HIV infected individuals.

infection.

Abstract 
This research was conducted in the industry producing cutting tools with high variations such as cutters, 
drillers, and reamer. Products are made according to consumer demand with a hybrid job shop production 
flow. The problem faced by the company is that many jobs have passed due dates or are late, which is 
caused by incorrect production scheduling. The purpose of this study is to design a scheduling that can 
minimize the mean tardiness. To determine the scheduling, the Firefly algorithm method is used which 
minimizes the makespan. Data processing is performed using 25 jobs as numerical examples from 783 jobs 
that will be scheduled from the results of sorting based on the level of delay. After scheduling, completion 
time, number of tardy jobs, and mean tardiness are calculated. Scheduling with the Firefly algorithm 
produces a makepan of 1395 minutes, so the number of tardy jobs decreases from 25 jobs to 3 jobs with 
each delay for 1 day, and mean tardiness decreases from 11.36 days to 0.12 days.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Scheduling is a process of work planning and allocation of resources from time to time with the aim of fulfilling one
or more goals [1]. Proper production scheduling will help companies complete the work in accordance with the
specified time and meet customer demand on time. The scheduling function must manage several jobs together using
a limited amount of available resources. This function will ultimately be responsible for manufacturing the product
and will greatly affect the company's relationship with its customers. This causes this function to have high efficiency.
Production scheduling is certainly done for specific purposes, including: Increasing machine productivity by reducing
machine idle time; Reducing the stock of intermediate goods by reducing the average number of jobs waiting in a
queue because a machine is busy; Reducing work delays. [2] Every job has a due date or due date. If the work is
completed past the specified time limit then the work is declared late. With the scheduling method, this delay can be
reduced, both time and frequency.
The production process at PT Fuji Presisi-Tool Indonesia, which was the object of this research, was in fact often
delayed. The number of delays for jobs in the July 2018 period is 94 jobs out of the 783 jobs done. The company's
production system is a job shop where products are produced with different characteristics, and the order for each job
may be different (multidirectional) where the production process of each job is very different from one another because 
it has different specifications, making it difficult to group them into families. [3] The machines on the production floor
are grouped according to function and are parallel machines in various quantities. The production system carried out
in this study is a job shop with parallel machines, where parallel machine problems consist of scheduling n jobs on m
different parallel machines without interruption.

Calculation of Mean Tardiness 
Mean tardiness shows the average delay. The presence of tardiness is certainly something that is avoided by the 
company because in addition to disrupting the smooth production, this can also affect customer or consumer 
satisfaction.

Mean Tardiness 
0.12 
 
After conducting research, there were 3 jobs that experienced tardiness with each job experiencing a delay of 1 day, 
where the mean tardiness was 0.12 days from the previous 11.36 days. One of the things that caused this was because 
the 25 jobs were considered priority. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Based on data processing and analysis that has been done, conclusions can be drawn in the form of: 
− Company production scheduling is done for 25 jobs that are delayed for 9 to 14 days. 
− Scheduling with the Firefly algorithm produces a makespan of 1395 minutes or 23.25 hours. 
− Scheduling with the Firefly algorithm produces 3 jobs that are behind of the 25 jobs observed or decreases by 
88%.

Abstract  
Natural gas is a vital component of the world's energy supply. Therefore, optimizing natural gas processes is important 
to facilitate more efficient and less costly operations. Optimization which relies exclusively on simulation is 
impractical, due to the enormous computational cost of complex simulations. Alternatively, surrogate models can be 
constructed from and used in lieu of actual simulation models. The proposed work aims to develop a black-box 
surrogate-based optimization model that represents the natural gas treatment process which consist of separation, 
sweetening and dehydration units. A combination of simulation, experimental design, data analytics and mathematical 
programming was utilized. The problem size was reduced by using a regression model of the system’s behavior. The 
regression model was based on the simulation and experimental design. This simplified model was then used in a 
mathematical programming model minimizing a cost function. The methodology is suitable for synthesis of large-
scale complex problems with fewer degrees of freedom. Linear regression along with polynomial feature 
transformation machine learning methods were used to generate the surrogate model. A case study was developed to 
investigate the impact of increasing H2S composition in the feed gas. It was observed that the feed pressure had the 
highest influence among the parameters. 
1. Introduction
The design and operation of natural gas processing facilities tailored for the production of various natural gas 
derivatives and pretreatment is considered to be one of the fundamental problems in chemical and process systems 
engineering. However, planning and superstructure-based mathematical models of any chemical process involve many 
complex unit equation blocks which can be solved using conversion law or physicochemical engineering fundamentals 
and available simulation software (Henao and Maravelias, 2011) . Despite the significant developments in realistic 
unit operation models (i.e. the kind of models featured in commercial process simulators considering non-ideal 
thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport properties calculations and the availability of commercial process simulators 
(Gani et al. 2012)  (e.g. ASPEN, HYSYS, ProMax, gProms), however, these models cannot be used for within 
optimization operations (e.g. supply chain management and planning models) due to computational expenses. Data-
driven surrogate modelling can be defined as a black-box modelling approach that can utilize available data (e.g. could 
be collected from commercial software), that can relate relevant inputs to relevant outputs to describe process 
operations. Such models have been used in the industry and the literature to describe processes by replacing existing 
expensive models (serve as surrogates to reduce model complexity) and correlations which have not yet been 
theoretically explained (Li et al. 2016).  For example, Jin and et al. in 2000 investigated the advantages and 
disadvantages of four metamodeling. In 2002, Hetzel replaced some the detailed unit models equality constraints with 
surrogate models and results showed that the computation time for the refinery-wide optimization with surrogate 
replacement was reduced by one order of magnitude. Henao and Maravelias integrated surrogate models built from 
data generated via commercial process simulators into optimization superstructure-based framework. Another recent 
study (Li et al. 2016). developed a data-driven optimization framework for the production of refinery-petrochemical 
complex where product yields and properties of a petrochemical complex were predicted based on the abundant data.

Abstract 
In most of the imaging applications the camera is placed in outdoor conditions with the lens open to the environment. 
Example, cameras installed on the buildings for surveillance, cameras fitted on cars that are open to the environment 
for ADAS applications, camera for flight passengers to view outside scenes on the fly etc. One of the most challenging 
problems in such scenarios is that the dust particles may easily form a partially or fully occluding layer on the camera 
lenses and block vision. There are more challenging scenarios like the presence of wind, rain, mist, sun glare etc. which 
can also lead to false imaging algorithm results. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem efficiently by  
detecting  dirt/dust  if  presents  on  the  lens.  This  is  helpful  to  stop  the system  functioning  instead  of  providing 
misleading results. This application is more essential for safety critical applications like ADAS where the  accurate real 
time detection of objects must happen. Proposed approach has more than one algorithm like edge analysis, inter frame 
analysis, edge strength analysis etc. to produce accurate result for dust/dirt detection. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of smart phones, tablet computers and other digital products, the demand for camera 
modules and camera-based applications is growing higher. Lens of the camera module can get easily contaminated by 
dust/dirt or oily material and can decrease the image quality. Therefore, there is a need to detect the presence of dust 
and blemish on lens automatically, in order to improve the overall quality of the system 
In common, dust can be segregated into two types as per density that formed, Solid and Transparent respectively. Solid 
dust may  have more density and  shall blocks vision  completely  while  transparent has partial or full vision blockage. 
One of the biggest challenging of this problem is, in real world, dirt or dust will not have any specific shape, which 
make  harder.  There  will  be  plenty  of  approaches  in  image  processing  available  to  detect  or  identify  shape  but 
unfortunately, we can’t use here since dust does not have defined shape as it is generated randomly. 
A simple method used to detect dust on scanners is proposed by Gray, (1st ref paper) Based on this approach, a similar 
way  of  dust  detection  on  camera  module  was  proposed  by  Doi,  (2nd   ref  paper)  The primary  goal  of  these  two 
approaches way to create a difference image to extract anomalous regions. After threshold and few of morphological 
processing, dirty area can be detected from these anomalous regions.  The operation of such approaches is much simple 
and the ability to detect dirty spots is acceptable when the structured background is uniform. But in realistic uniform, 
easily separable background is unexpectable. In order to reduce false positives, Krainion (3rd  ref paper) proposed an 
efficient  approach  based  on  local  gradient  difference  method.  Anomalous  image  regions  can  be  identified  by 
comparing the gradient magnitude of pixels in the image and average gradient of neighbor region. then, dusty area from 
these anomalous regions can be detected by means of a set of heuristic features, including shape, size, color and visibility 
measures. But this method leads to high false detection rate

current algorithm may not perfectly fit for where edges are absent such smooth surface like wall, wetroad,

This paper uses 10 buffers to take differentiation, it is quite high in terms of time complexity and memory
management, it may handle in upcoming version
•
Going forward approach may able to classify the amount of dust present on lens like 25%,50%,75%,100%
6. Conclusion
The idea of this paper is to resolve lens occlusion detection to stop its functionality that supposed to be performed, the 
introduced method has resolved the identified problem and been proven by shown metrics for various dataset with all 
environmental scenarios like rain, fog, mist etc., proposed approach uses sobel edge detection to find edge map as 
unsharpened area of images needs to be calculated along with nearest neighbor interpolation to downscale the images 
to find 3 levels of peak gradient value. Given fixed threshold values are verified with Elbow method. Since this paper 
uses basic image processing features such edge strength calculation, edge differences of frames proposed approach can 
be scale up to any  of  applications  wherever  the  same  problem  exists  even  we  can  use  it  for  indoor  applications. 
Highlight of this paper is that no one steps of algorithm does not depend with features like color, size, shape etc., it may 
help to get good results in all the environmental condition like sunny, dusky, dark area, nighttime etc.,

Systems Simulation and Probability and Statistics in Engineering Applications 
Abstract  
It is important to effectively manage the allocation of limited resources such as beds in order to provide 
access to care in a timely manner. Bed capacity management is essential in delivering high-quality health 
care. The aim of this paper is to optimize the number of beds in the hospital, reduce length of stay, reduce 
discharge delays, and evaluate alternative solutions to bed management. This research mainly focuses on 
developing a discrete event simulation to help and support in decision making on scheduling staff and 
optimizing resources. Scenarios were tested to find out the effect of length of stay, queue length and waiting 
times of patients. Data required to build the model such as patients’ length of stay, available resources, and 
processing times were collected from a public hospital. The results were found to be that the bottlenecks in 
the system is resulting from the over occupancy in wards (especially surgical wards) that is affecting the 
patient flow and overcrowding in the Emergency Department. OptQuest was used to optimize the number 
of beds in order to have bed utilization no less than 70% and no more than 85% which will give the optimal 
solution. In addition, four what-if scenarios were constructed and tested as solutions to be recommended to 
improve the system.

1. Introduction
For the past few decades, worldwide healthcare systems have been under tremendous stress for failing to plan 
effectively as hospitals cannot function at 100% bed occupancy (Kumar & Mo, 2010; Hospital Bed Occupancy, 2018). 
High levels of bed occupancy can affect patient care since it is less likely possible to direct the most suitable bed for 
the patient care. In a health system, a wide spread of consequence may result in a lack of available beds causing an 
increased rate of infections, inappropriate clinic ward patient placing, and pressure on staff to clear up beds. In 
addition, overcrowding and over occupancy in hospitals are considered as a global crisis and is classified as a national 
catastrophe in many countries. One of the main factors of over occupancy rates is the poor capacity planning of beds 
required. According to The King’s Fund in England (cited in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 
March 2018). It is stated that hospitals with average bed occupancy rates higher than 85% have the risk to experience 
regular bed shortages, recurrent bed crisis, and increased numbers of healthcare attained contagions and infections 
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2018). Planning the bed capacity must tackle and take into 
consideration the reasons and causes that affect the load increase in hospitals. One important reason is the divergence 
between the patient flow through beds, bed supplements, and the demand. Whenever the demand of urgent care 
increases, the bed supply lessens thus flow of patients turn out to be weakened. Additionally, treatment delay due to

3) Add extra cleaners on Sunday to free up rooms earlier for patients waiting to be admitted. This will minimize 
the queue length of patients waiting time. 
4) After finding the total optimal number of beds in the hospital, a suggestion can be made by expanding the 
observation rooms for both females and males through using the extra beds that were non-occupied in some 
wards. This will reduce the waiting time for patients entering the observation rooms and decrease the 
utilization of beds.  
5) Adding a doctor who is responsible for female wards and a doctor for male wards to prevent shared resources 
between genders. The goal is to increase the number of discharged patients and increase the opportunity for 
other patients to occupy the bed.  
6) Reduce the turnover time between admissions by assigning two cleaners at the same time to clean the beds.  
7) Increase the number of male general surgery beds by 86 and female general surgery beds by 23 to reduce the 
high occupancy rates and infection rates.  
8) Reduce the number of internal male beds by 69 and female internal beds by 68 to minimize the underutilized 
resources. 
9) Combine wards with very low utilization of beds (such as internal, ophthalmic, and ENT wards) and use the 
beds in these wards for wards with high utilization of beds (such as general surgery wards). 
10)  Extend the working hours of doctors that are responsible in patients’ rounds to improve the discharge policy. 
This will permit patients that are ready to be discharged to be discharged earlier in the day and will reduce 
the overlap time to accommodate both patients awaiting discharge and new patients’ admission to wards.  
11) Transferring patients with acute and long-lasting medical conditions to residential care centers in order to 
reduce the occupancy rates in the wards. 
12)  Adding a waiting time system in the hospital's website that shows the current waiting time in assigning the 
triage level. This will allow people with non-emergent conditions in deciding of when to arrive to the hospital. 
The goal is to minimize the number in queue and the high congestion rates in the ED. 
7. Conclusion  
 
To sum up, management of bed capacity and availability will have a decisive impact on the hospital, meaning that 
improvement related to bed management will impact the availability of beds therefore improving patient flow. The 
objective of this project is to optimizing the appropriate number of beds in a public hospital to decrease the high 
occupancy rates and prolonged patients waiting time. By achieving this objective, the system will be improved in 
different aspects related to BC such as: reach a better utilization rates of beds that are between 70% and 85%, decrease 
the length of queues for beds, reduce patients waiting time, and increase the number of patients recovered. All the data 
that have been collected from the hospital were applied in Arena Simulation Software to understand the current system 
behavior. After running the base model, the outputs showed the bottle neck department that causes the congestion in 
the ED. The department with the highest utilization rate, queue length, and long waiting times are the male and female 
general surgery wards. Therefore, OptQuest for Arena™ have been used to provide the appropriate number of beds 
in each department to decrease the utilization rate and increase the number of discharged patients. Furthermore, four 
scenarios have been suggested for the base model to improve the performance of doctors and decrease the queue 
length of patients .The first one is changing the schedule of the doctors; second, adding mobile beds in MOR2 and 
FOR2; third, using two of the internal wards to be occupied by the general surgery ward; finally, reducing the bed 
cleaning procedure time by hiring extra cleaners for the wards. By using the output analyzer, the first scenario was 
shown that is the best to apply.

Abstract 
This paper explains our project about a six sigma application to improve a PVC pipe production process. 
We began with introducing the company that we chose which is the National Industry Company (NIC) 
and their production process of both PVC pipes and fittings. Then we used the DMAIC methodology to 
define the problem that they are facing which is defective pipes and fittings and in the measure phase we 
collected data regarding both productions and calculated the average defective pipes per month with their 
associated costs and decided to focus on pipe production lines. After that, in the analyze phase, we looked 
into the factors and found the root cause of the defective pipes are torque and feeder speed levels. In 
addition, we used Minitab to draw X bar-R charts and found that the process was out of control, hence we 
used contour plots to find the optimal settings of both torque and feeder speed levels. Finally, in the 
improve phase, we removed the out of control points that were out of the optimal settings found earlier 
and the process became in control indicating 89% improvements. Finally, we provided an out of control 
action plan for when an outlier appears on the X bar charts during the monitoring of the process.  
Keywords: Pipes, defect rate, torque, feeder speed. 
1. Introduction
A Plastic manufacture company was established in the 1960’s in Kuwait which is one of the well-known companies 
that focuses on manufacturing and marketing of construction materials. It has two main factories which are located 
in Mina Abdullah and Sulaibiya; they also own 16 smaller factories which produce plastic, paint, ceramics, and 
interlocks. We chose to apply six sigma application on the production process of both pipes and fittings in this 
company as we found that they have a range of defective pipes and fitting products with an average of 2-2.2 % per 
month which is causing loss of customer ratification and loss of profit as well. Our main goal is to minimize the 
defective pipes produced by the company by 10% to improve their production line in order to gain customer 
satisfaction and to reduce their losses and increase their profits. 
2. Literature Review
Nowadays, manufacturing industries are widely spread and since we will apply six sigma on a manufacturing 
industry, then most of our articles are under this topic. Gupta et al, (2017) applies six-sigma to decrease the 
variations in bead splice of a tire manufacturing company in India. After using DMAIC methodology the standard 
deviation decreased significantly from 2.17 to 1.69 and the process capability increased from 1.65 to 2.95 indicating 
a capable process with a lower defective rate. Moreover, Girmanova et al, (2017) implemented six-sigma to improve 
the metallurgic product quality of a company. They used both DMAIC and failure mode and affect analysis and the 
sigma level increased to 13%, lowering the defective rates and processing cost.  Raman and Basavaraj, (2019) used

natural causes and is kept in the readings. This step was done several times until the out of control points were all 
due to natural causes and the graphs were constructed again to show that now the process is in control. Moreover, 
the capability analysis was recalculated and showed an increase in the capability index indicating a centered 
process able to meet customer’s satisfaction. Also, the number of defective parts per million decreased significantly 
from 9657 to 989 showing that the system improved by 89% and is producing less defective pipes. So, we learned 
that to not produce defective pipes the torque and feeder speed levels should be maintained within their optimal 
settings. 
5. Conclusion 
To conclude, we used six sigma methodology on a pipe production line in a plastic manufacturing company and we 
found that the problem they are facing is having 2.02% defective pipes per month. After conducting the phases of 
DMAIC we understood that the torque and feeder speed levels were causing the pipes to have less wall thickness 
and in return causing them to be defective. Therefore, we used Minitab to draw contour plots and were able to find 
the optimal settings for the torque and feeder speed level which when used provides us with an in control process 
plotted on an X bar-R chart. Hence, 89% improvements were achieved by providing the optimal settings of both 
factors.

Abstract 
This paper explains the consideration of the implementation of autonomous vehicles as the main 
transportation modes pertain to logistic processes in the supply chain area, especially in the oil/petroleum 
distribution. The major challenge that companies currently facing is inflexible distribution processes. 
Improvements can be done through lean logistics, for example by changes the old-fashioned transportation 
or conventional truck towards Autonomous Truck in the future. This alternative needs careful consideration 
to gain a competitive advantage and increase the efficiency of logistic processes.

1. Introduction
1.1 Basic Supply Chain and Logistics
Fundamentally, a supply chain is a total system approach to managing the flow of information, materials, and services
from raw material suppliers through factories and warehouses to the end customer (Operations and Supply Chain
Management, 2018). The application of this concept is applied to all business processes. The difference lies in the
characteristics of primary output that a firm offered (goods/services). Supply chain processes particularly divided into
five individual processes, they are planning, sourcing, making, delivering (known as logistics processes), and returning 
that must be carefully coordinated to maximize the company’s profits. Supply Chain Management, in general,
comprises into several specialized functional fields, beginning from demand planner—managing all activities pertains
inventory management (reorder point, safety stock) and the resource required to produce goods/services, warehouse
management—running a warehouse, including replenishment, customer/user order fulfillment, receiving
(loading/unloading), logistics and transportation—responses to managing the movement of goods throughout the
supply chain. Each function is interrelated and has a critical role to deliver the requirements of demanding customers
with low possible costs to support the cash flow essential to the firm’s long-term sustainability.
In a supply chain, a company is connected with its upstream suppliers and downstream distributors as materials, 
information, and capital flow through the supply chain. The delivery process/logistics refers to the science of transport 
planning, its management, and control. This also includes warehousing and any type of intangible and material 
operations that take place before the goods/resources are delivered to the intended destination. Logistics is essential 
to manage various material flows effectively. The objective is to maximize the value of the customer. Nowadays, rapid 
technological growth is affecting the competitiveness of companies. This phenomenon drives both opportunities and 
challenges, which require a continuous restructuring of the business strategy and positioning tactics. Businesses are 
endeavoring to create a competitive advantage. The costs of providing goods or services are critical to high earnings 
growth, in which earnings growth is a function of the profitability of the company, and profits can be increased through 
higher sales and/or lower cost. This indicates that those principles are directly applicable to the financial health of the 
company. The factor used to assess the performance management of the business is made up of efficiency and 
effectiveness. Efficiency means doing something at the lowest possible cost. In other words, efficiency aims to 
maximize the output with the minimum input (Henandez, (2012); Balocco, et al., (2011). The input resources might 
be of financial, material, human, technological or physical components (Holweg & Bicheno, 2002). On the other hand, 
effectiveness means doing the right things to create the most value for the company. Maximizing those two terms is 
likely to result in conflicting outcomes between them. Nevertheless, there is an equilibrium point in the trade-off

4.2 Battery Policy 
Assuming that the company is buying a Tesla Semi Truck. The truck will have a maximum distance of 800 kilometers 
per 100% battery condition. This autonomous car consumes 1.15 kWh per kilometer. Nowadays, there is already 
existing supercharger that has 150 kW power. Below is the time for the battery to be fully charged 100%. 
 
It is not desired that the truck will have to stop because of the battery insufficiency. So, the calculation of the battery 
safety stock is necessary to be done. The calculation is using safety stock formula. Where, maximum daily usage is 
the percentage of the battery used and average lead time is the duration of the trip. Maximum daily usage number is 
coming from the comparison calculation between 800 kilometers (100% battery condition) and the maximum number 
of distances in one day that is 480 kilometers (assuming the car is driving at 20 km/h speed). Maximum lead time is 
written in days, where the maximum lead time is one full day and average lead time is from the simulation result that 
shows the duration of 414 minutes. 
 
   
 
The safety stock shows the ideal time on when the truck should be recharged. From the calculation, the most optimal 
is to charge it when the battery shows the number of 55.07% that will happen on the third day after the last full 
charging time. 
 
5. Conclusion and Suggestion 
5.1 Conclusion 
Autonomous Vehicles could be a breakthrough in the supply chain area which supports the logistics function. 
However, decision-making must be carefully considered. Simulation Modelling used to predict the future 
implementation of the alternative to gain insight and reducing time, cost, risk.   
 
As mentioned before, the case is about a solar fuel distribution in a small area of Jakarta. So, the route will be short, 
and therefore, the capability of the truck is not maximized. That leads to the inefficiency of autonomous vehicle 
implementation for this case. Here are some reasons why this thing can happen:

1.  The truck is more suitable for a long trip. Designed for 800 km per one fully charged, this autonomous 
car able to almost cross the whole Java Island (a Long trip for around 16 hours) 
2.    The speed limit of the truck is low in a crowded city. The drivers need to drive at a low limit speed 
because of its traffic 
3.    The wage of drivers is low. One of the compositions for the variable cost is driver wage. The low 
rate of wages can lead to the low expense the company’s need to spend.  
 
5.2 Suggestion 
From this report, there are some aspects can be developed from this simulation case for the next study material, 
consists of: 
1. The measurement of the environmental aspects (low carbon) 
2. The number of trucks optimization  
3. The long route modeling 
4. Risk mitigation analysis

Abstract 
This paper emphasizes the use of MCDA methods for project ranking and prioritization. In addition to providing 
researchers and practitioners with the relevant literature with regards to project portfolio prioritization and 
selection using MCDM in the last two decades, this paper also summarizes the most commonly used criteria for 
evaluating projects in multi-project organizations. The literature review synthesis is then used to propose a 
category-based project ranking process within the framework of project portfolio selection. The proposed process 
focuses on the importance of evaluating projects within appropriate categories based on which relative criteria are 
defined and used for assessing portfolio components. The suggested process is then illustrated through the ranking 
of 50 projects in the case of a company operating in the automotive industry. The main purpose of this approach 
is helping decision makers ensure a deep alignment of the potential project portfolio with strategic priorities.

1. Introduction
In a dynamic but constantly evolving environment, organizations are actually required to plan, evaluate, and
select project portfolios in accordance with their organizational mission, vision, and objectives. For that purpose, 
various projects and programs are suggested to address different strategic needs. These projects are generally 
competing for limited resources and are often subject to either internal or external constraints, which exhibit a 
combinatorial character to the portfolio selection problem and then complicates the decision situation. Indeed, the 
project portfolio selection problem is multidimensional as it is characterized by multiple criteria and conflicting 
goals (Stummer and Heidenberger, 2003; Medaglia et al., 2007; Carazo et al., 2010). Either qualitative or 
quantitative, these goals are imposed by the organization’s market, socio-economic environment as well as 
business sustainability challenges. The decision process becomes much more complicated when the number of 
active and new candidate projects rises leading to high number of potential portfolios. In addition, 
interrelationships between projects hold another dimension of this complexity, when it comes to shared resources, 
complementary benefits and outcomes (Elbok and Berrado, 2017). The decision process usually involves different 
stakeholders, having different priorities and interests, who are requested to actively take part of the decision while 
having little amount of information and incomplete data available, thus adding imprecision and uncertainties to 
the process (Cooper et al., 2000; Archer and Ghasemzadeh, 2007).  
In this background, the decision maker has to determine which new project proposals should be considered, 
which active projects should be stopped and which ones should be carried on. Various analytical methods, ranging 
from the simple weighted sum to complex mathematical programming have been proposed to evaluate and then 
select projects (Henriksen and Traynor, 1999; Ghasemzadeh and Archer, 2000; Cooper et al., 2001; Lawson et al., 
2006; Archer and Ghasemzadeh, 2007; Meredith and Mantel, 2008; Verbano and Nosella, 2010). However, there 
is little guidance in the literature about their effectiveness and practicality in different project environments. 
Therefore most of proposed methods are perceived by decision-makers as complex and difficult to adopt while 
seeking to build the most optimal project portfolio.

evaluation criteria at each category level to allow for coherent assessment of projects towards the objectives they 
serve. Then the criteria weighting should be examined for each category by involving the organization’s experts. 
The following step of the process consists of selecting an appropriate MCDA ranking method, taking into account 
the elucidation mode the Decision Maker might be comfortable with and also the decision’s input parameters 
available. The evaluation model should be thereafter constructed according to the chosen method hypothesis. In 
order to illustrate this process, we provide an application of it in the case of an organization operating in the 
automotive industry,  using TOPSIS. The obtained project preorder per sub-portfolio was satisfactory from the 
Decision Maker point of view and revealed the strategic priorities in place while building the ground for an optimal 
portfolio selection.  
This work was limited to the use of TOPSIS for a portfolio dataset including 50 candidate projects, other 
ranking and selection methods would be of interest and will be experimented in a future research considering 
larger dataset or multiple case study.

One of the main security risks in information technology (IT) is software vulnerability. The vulnerability when 
exploited by attacks, can cause catastrophic losses to the system. A lot vulnerabilities are explored and discovered in 
the computing system and these vulnerabilities have also increased multifold. The security vulnerabilities span across 
entire networks, large organisations and have to mitigated by information security engineers on a regular routine basis. 
One of the key challenges for Information Technology (IT) system administrators is how to tackle these vulnerabilities 
and more specifically which vulnerability to prioritize. All companies recognize the importance and need to prioritize 
these vulnerabilities. It is not only important to prioritize the vulnerabilities; it is imperative to utilize a vulnerability 
evaluation system. The significant role of the vulnerability evaluation system is to separate these vulnerabilities from 
each other through quantitative and qualitative methods. In this paper, we first review through both qualitatively and 
quantitatively the various vulnerabilities within an existing large global multinational company. We explore and 
analyze 30,000 various vulnerabilities across a 3-month time period. The 30,000 vulnerabilities are captured using an 
automated software from individual systems and the the network within the company. The software detects the 
vulnerabilities and the various characteristics associated with these vulnerabilities and assigns severity levels based 
on the severity of the vulnerability. The severity is assigned a score from 1 to 5, with 1 being least. The vulnerabilities 
captured span across 20 different lab environments, across different operating systems and these vulnerabilities are 
with various severity levels. The CVSS vulnerability scoring system was utilized for data from one of the biggest 
multinational company from within their environment. The researchers analyzed the various vulnerabilities using the 
various parameters of these vulnerabilities. The researchers analyzed and studied the various inherent patterns within 
the environment. Various variables were analyzed critically as part of the descriptive analytics. The vulnerabilities 
were analyzed across the labs. Then each lab was analyzed using variables like OS, various severity levels, IDs, status 
of vulnerabilities, CVSS scores, Access Vector, Attack Complexity, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, 
Exploitability, Systems, categories of systems, Ports, PCI,

similar pattern and most vulnerabilities doesn’t have the CVSS3 scores. From 12, the correlation between CVSS and 
severity is 0.5, which is not related each other. Similarly, the correlation between severity and CVSS3 is 0.51.

Abstract 
The aim of this project is to design a method to solve the midterm exam timetabling problem and implement 
it to schedule the exams for Mechanical and Industrial engineering department in Sultan Qaboos University. 
A mathematical model was developed and implemented in CPLEX OPL software with the aid of Visual 
Basic language. The objective of the model is to minimize number of students having two exams in two 
consecutive periods, number of students having two exams on the same day and number of students having 
two exams in two consecutive days. The mathematical model is tested for the midterm exams of the current 
semester and an optimal timetable is successfully generated. A survey is designed for the students to 
understand their preferences regarding the midterm timetable. The priorities of different objectives will be 
determined as a result of this survey. The model will be tested with different parameters and operational 
strategies such as completing the exams in 15 days instead of 21 days.

Abstract 
Humanitarian aid is one of the most popular and vital subjects nowadays. This is because, in some disasters like 
Corona epidemy in Wuhan, China, the regional assistance is not sufficient to compensate for the damages and to 
protect the people. Therefore, the management and distribution of these humanitarian aids are of paramount 
importance. In this manuscript, first, we model the need for the first aids in the city by considering the current situation, 
e.g., total population, number of sick people, dead people, number of needed hospital staff, and so forth. Then, this
model solves two phases: (1) in the first phase, we ignore the cost criteria, and we use airplanes to provide the required
materials to maximize the speed. (2) in the second phase, we consider the trade-off between cost and speed criteria,
which introduces the train as the optimal solution.

1. Introduction
Natural disasters are part of our lives forever. These problems do not belong to a particular country or region; therefore, 
all of us may suffer during our lives. In addition to regional aid, humanitarian aid is known as an efficient approach 
to help victims in emergencies. There are some important questions which should be answered. For example: when 
and where they have happened? And who is affected? In emergencies, the major goal of humanitarian aid would be 
considered the right amount of aid, which should be delivered to the right people at the right time in the right place 
with the right information and communication. In this case, Humanitarian Logistics (HL) manages whole operations 
to be slick, efficient, effective in logistics operations. It is clear that one of the major differences between a crisis 
logistic and a normal situation is the lack of stable conditions, and a level of anticipation must be taken into account 
so that it is immediately possible to change and modify the operation plan [1]. Based on these critical situations, some 
parameters should be considered in Humanitarian Logistics. 1) The operation plan should be fully flexible. It means 
that if more disasters happen in another location, HL should create a new plan for managing the new emergency. 2) 
Agility is a vital factor that should be considered to save more lives during a disaster [2]. 3) Efficiency in Logistics is 
an important factor that means to manage the physical movement of goods and vital information at the same time [2, 
3]. 4) In emergency situation, “cost-opportunity” is more important than “cost-benefit”. This is because the life-saving 
of victims is defined as an opportunity that should not be compromised for the benefit [4]. 5) Humanitarian aid should 
consider in large-scale with full accountability and efficiency of forward and backward operations. 6) Irregular 
demands should be predicted and planned to provide them quickly (For instance, by simulation of similar disaster

by each mode of transportation, which is a severe crisis in humanitarian aid. It does not only need several countries to 
help but all over the world should take measures to coordinate with the crisis logistics of humanitarian assistance.

4. Conclusions 
 
To conclude this work, we have proposed a model to compensate for the damages caused by Coronavirus in Wuhan, 
China. In particular, in the first period of the epidemy, the speed criteria had the highest priority, and the cost was 
ignored; therefore, the airplane was the optimum solution to maximize the transfer speed. In the second period, the 
cost and speed were the two factors considered in the optimization problem. The best solution turned out to be the 
train according to the considered criteria. It is interesting to mention that by considering both factors, ships, trucks, 
and airplanes represent the alternatives, respectively. More researches will focus on cases of quicker spread of the 
virus in the future.

Abstract 
The worth of machine-part groups in cellular manufacturing systems is evaluated by different 
grouping measures available in the literature. Three of the well-known grouping efficiency measures 
will be used, analyzed and tested against two case studies taken from the literature to compare the 
effectiveness of cell formation. In this paper it is found that in both cases grouping efficiency 
measures may not lead to choose the optimal or best distribution. For that in the first case the 
designer will choose the optimal distribution based on optimality rather than efficiency. While in the 
second case his decision will be based on the constraints on the shop floor. Moreover, it is found that 
these measures have some deficiencies comparing to optimal manufacturing systems having the 
same sum of voids and exceptions.

Introduction
Group technology (GT) is a method of organizing and using information about component similarities to 
improve the production efficiency of small to medium batch oriented manufacturing systems (Askin and Chiu 
1990). The main idea of GT is to capitalize on similar manufacturing processes and features where similar 
parts are grouped into a part family and manufactured by a cluster of dissimilar machines (Wu 1998). 
The input to the GT problem is a zero-one matrix A where aij = 1 indicates the visit of component j to machine 
i, and aij = 0 otherwise. Grouping of components into families and machines into cells results in a transformed 
matrix with diagonal blocks where ones occupy the diagonal blocks and zeros occupy the off-diagonal blocks. 
The resulting diagonal blocks represent the manufacturing cells. The ideal situation is one in which all the ones 
are in the diagonal blocks and all the zeros are off the diagonal blocks (Nair and Narendran 1998). However, 
this situation is rarely accomplished in practice. Therefore, the most desirable solution of cellular 
manufacturing systems is that which gives minimum number of zeros entries inside a diagonal block [known 
as voids] and minimum number of ones entries outside the diagonal blocks [known as the exceptional 
elements] (Kumar and Chandrasekharan 1990). Voids and exceptional elements have advance implications in 
terms of system operations (for more details see Adil et al. 1996). The effectiveness of a solution is usually 
measured by its grouping efficiency (Chandrasekaran and Rajagopalan 1986) or grouping efficacy (Kumar and 
Chandrasekaran 1990) or comprehensive grouping efficacy ( Mukattash et al 2016) or  the total number of 
voids in the diagonal blocks and number of ones outside the blocks (Viswanathan 1995). Grouping efficacy is

 From the above discussion it can be concluded that, the impact of grouping measures in cellular 
manufacturing systems can be summarized as follows:   
1. The case where all distributions of the main system are optimal and the 
total number of operations in the Machine-Part matrix is constant  
In this case the main system is distributed to different systems having different number of cells. The 
designer has to choose the optimal distribution among all these optimal solutions. In this case grouping 
efficiency measures, may not lead to choosing the optimal solution since the highest value of evaluation 
is different than the optimal distribution (minimum sum of voids and exceptions). In this case the right 
decision will be based on optimality rather than efficiency. Also, the case where alternative optimal 
solution exists, grouping measures, will make the designer more confused about the right decision. In 
this case the decision will be taken based on minimum exceptions or voids. 
 
2. The case where number of cells are constant for different distributions. In this case the sparsity and sum 
of voids and exceptions are constant. The selection of one of the two systems may not depend on 
grouping efficiency measures, since they   may give different conflict evaluations of the both 
distributions. In this case the designer will choose the distribution based on the shop floor’s constraints.

Abstract 
The growth in the industrial sector will make it easier for companies to offer their products and develop 
their markets more broadly, one of them are the sports industry. Every company is required to continue to 
make improvements in all aspects so they won’t be left behind. This research is expected to be an input to 
maintain the supply chain management of the company at the world level. The results of supply chain 
performance measurements using the SCOR® 11.0 performance attribute are then performed using system 
Dynamics simulations which built using Powersim software. Results shown that their lowest score are the 
Cost attribute, so it must be their main focus on improvement. This simulation results are expected to be a 
basis for improvements on the supply chain management especially at Table Tennis Table Manufacturer in

Introduction
The growth in the industrial sector will make it easier for companies to offer their products and develop their markets 
more broadly, one of them are sports industry. Therefore, every company is required to continue to make 
improvements in all aspects. If the company does not make continuous improvements and follow the standards in the 
world, it is feared that it will have an impact on the decline in the company's competitiveness. According to Hadiyati 
(2010) quality is the starting point in capturing market share so that the level of satisfaction not only needs to be 
maintained but must also be increased to face increasingly fierce competition. With this research it is expected to be 
an input for continuous improvement to maintain the quality of the company at the world level (Lima-Junior and 
Carpinetti, 2016) 
To make continuous improvements, analysis is needed related to the supply chain that exists in a company. According 
to Liu et al. (2013) supply chain is a network of facilities that provides raw materials, converts them into final products 
and delivers products to customers through a distribution system. In case measuring a supply chain performance, it is 
needed a performance measurement to support overall supply chain improvement rather than measuring only certain 
functions (Huan et al., 2004)  
The SCOR® 11.0 model is a set of practical guidelines that provides a methodology for managing supply chain 
activities and analyzing their management practices (Erkan & Ugur, 2011). The strength of the SCOR® 11.0 model 
compared to other models is that it is able to define the relationship between processes and influential elements and 
the scope of all existing demand elements (Supply Chain Council [SCC], 2012).  Several previous studies have 
discussed the application of the SCOR ® 11.0 model to various study objects in the industry, among others, according 
to Ariani et al (2017) cheese supply chain in CV. Brawijaya Dairy Industry has adjusted the KPI based on the SCOR® 
11.0 model and weighted the KPI using AHP. In addition, in the research Sutawijaya & Marlapa (2016) about the 
supply chain at PT. Indoturbine has a less efficient condition because the POF and OFCT metrics are below the 
benchmark data advantage value. Also Ikasari et al. (2019) research about SCOR Performance Measurement that 
combined with system Dynamics in Lithium Ion battery manufacturer.

4. Conclusion 
Based on the performance measurements and simulation result, the supply chain performance of the Table Tennis 
Table Manufacturer hasn’t maximized yet because the overall SCOR obtained is 72,09%. Even there are 2 perfect 
attributes (reliability and agility), but there is attributes with very low scores as cost with weighted score 6,93%, this 
value is far from their target on 10% and require improvements to increase their supply chain performance. In further 
research, it is possible to combine this method with multi criteria decision making so the output will be ranked among 
the importance of the problems itself

Abstract 
PT. XYZ produces heavy equipment components which will be supplied to heavy equipment companies, 
required by the heavy equipment industry, civil works, automotive, agricultural equipment and other 
industries. Examples of products produced by the company are bucket 0.97 products which are supporting 
components of excavator heavy equipment products. The company has problem with the bucket 
production line capacity which currently cannot reach the desired production target. The purpose of this 
study is to analyze the capacity of the bucket production line related to efforts to increase bucket 
production capacity using the Theory of Constraint (TOC) approach. Based on the results of standard time 
data collection, calculation of needs and availability of production capacity for each work station is 
calculated. Next we do identification of the bottleneck work station and the bottleneck station exploitation 
stage, followed by the sub-ordination stage and the evaluation of the proposed improvement related to 
capacity problems that occur. The analysis shows that there are several work stations that become 
bottleneck stations. The exploitation stage is carried out by providing several proposed improvements in 
the form of adding work station facilities as well as providing a time buffer at the bottleneck work station. 
To support the proposed improvements, a number of proposed improvement scenarios are simulated 
using ProModel 6.0 Software.

Abstract 
Shopping malls are undeniably the main focal point in many Malaysian cities and shopping has become 
the Malaysian favourite pastime during weekends with families. Moreover, a series of mega sales and 
discount events have encouraged the act of consumption, turning shopping centers to become one of the 
vital elements in lifestyle. With rapid economic growth and urbanization in the Klang Valley, a wide 
range of social and economic factors have combined to influence the trends in shopping centre 
development. There seems to be no let-up in the number of new malls being built in the country. A survey 
by the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPKM) in 2018 revealed that there were 671 malls 
operating across the country, with 39% located in the Klang Valley. However, the new launches are set 
against a backdrop of an uncertain economic situation and fierce competition from the more established 
and bigger players. The popularity of online shopping also has contributed to the turnover of many 
retailers. There is a concern as well that the growth of retail space supply has outpaced demand. Given 
this context, this paper brings the Malaysian shopping centres into focus by analysing the criteria and 
characteristics of the Kuala Lumpur shopping centre through the classification of shopping centre. The 
construct of classification of the shopping centre has been studied in several contexts with varied 
perspectives; however, the researchers seldom noticed any endeavour to prioritize the antecedents of the 
shopping experience from the experts’ viewpoint. The present study endeavours to utilize Analytical 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) modelling to find the degree of importance that customer opinion to different 
criteria of the ten key criteria including size, anchor tenant, type of product, location, presentation, 
leisure/entertainment, customer facilities, management, sustainability and marketing with their underlying 
sub-criteria. There are involving two shopping centre which are super-regional and regional. This ranking 
is not just an ordinary exposition of placing one before another, but it expounds that the consumer is 
much concerned about the environment and type of shopping centre while making a buying decision. 
These results have interestingly explorable implications for both retailers as well as marketers and also 
the stakeholders in improving their investment and business decision of the shopping centre in Malaysia.

Feasibility analysis considering business friendly policies 
and factors: An Effective Approach 
Abstract: 
Due to the business globalization, it is an assiduous task for the investors’ to make decision where is to 
invest. Investors always seek political stability, transparency and predictability in the conduct of public 
policies, and a favorable investment environment. As well as in investment and manufacturing process, the 
factors such as low costs of labor and labor talent and skills, good physical infrastructure, macroeconomic 
stability, favorable exchange rate, low tax rates, and low cost of inputs are also important. Considering 
these issues we propose a technique in this research which can be attractive to decision makers. To justify 
our proposed approach we use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster data and show the effectiveness of 
this study. Experimental result shows the idea presented in this paper gives effective results.

Abstract 
The project studied a case of a ready-mix concrete company to evaluate the feasibility of converting the 
electrical consumption to solar PV which encourages the adoption of the technology in heavy industry. We 
used the DMAIC methodology to address the question “what could be changed to reduce electricity 
consumption, therefore electricity bill?”. 
Data are collected to find how much electricity to cover through the project excluding areas critical to 
production taking data from company, walkthrough observations and interviews. Key observation is the 
weather dependency of electricity consumption. To measure the targeted amount of electricity, we used the 
company’s initial electrical design and calculated the electricity required to produce 1 m3 of ready-mix 
concrete. The target is 29,594.9144 KWH per month.  
Options for improvements were: Replacing the inefficient devices; Enhancing building performance; 
Avoiding the peak hours; Using automated control systems to eliminate waste and the latest option is the 
use of renewable energy. We designed a grid-connected solar PV system to support full load. 
Prices have been estimated based on the current market. To design a system to cover 29,594.9144 KWH 
equivalent to 13,672.89 AED, the company need to invest 75,480.00 AED which will break-even in half a 
year. The maintenance (like cleaning of PV) can be done by the company. The cost of replacement will 
occur every 25-30 years for PV and every 3-4 years for batteries. This solar PV system design reduces 
205,980.6 Kg CO2e in a year equivalent to 1 month of emissions.

Abstract 
For many entrepreneurs, coming up with an idea for a new business concept or approach is easy. The 
question is if this idea has the potential for a successful and profitable business. A feasibility analysis is the 
process of determining if the idea is a viable foundation for creating a successful business. If the idea passes, 
the entrepreneur’s next step is to build a solid business plan for capitalizing on the idea. If the idea fails, the 
entrepreneur drops it and moves on to the next opportunity. A feasibility analysis offers efficiency and the 
opportunity to increase the chances for success before the entrepreneur invests resources. 
Conducting a feasibility study reduces the likelihood that entrepreneurs will pursue fruitless business 
ventures. The feasibility analysis asks the question: “Should we proceed with this business idea?” This 
paper will discuss the process of developing and implementing a successful entrepreneurial business plan, 
and how to capitalize on the idea. The potential value of a feasibility study and the potential “costs” of 
conducting a feasibility study will also be discussed? Challenges facing new business owners, useful tips 
for avoiding pitfalls in new business will be discussed. 
Key words: Feasibility analysis, business plan, viable business strategies, feasibility study, 
winning a business plan, business pitfalls.

Abstract 
 
Estimating changes of coastal land using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing, over 
a period can provide insights into sustainable use of natural resources, especially land. In this study, images 
captured from Landsat Multispectral-scanner (MSS), Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 of Alappad, a coastal town 
in Kerala in 1990, 2001, 2005 and 2009 are used to elucidate spatial distribution of land and land use pattern 
over a period of two decades. During 1990 - 2009, remarkable decline of vegetation and sand from coastal 
areas is seen. Understanding land use patterns over a period is essential for decision makers to implement 
sustainable land use measures and policies.

1. Introduction 
 
Land use is an umbrella term that used to denote the activities undertaken by mankind in order to maintain or produce 
a means of sustenance using land cover (FAO, 1997a; FAO/UNEP, 1999). Human intervention and anthropogenic 
activities can result in unanticipated environmental consequences, including depletion of natural resources. 
Biophysical, economic, technological or institutional need are the precursors for land use changes in any given area. 
Changes in land use patterns occurs during activities directed towards social and economic benefits. Deforestation, 
using agricultural and wetlands for urban infrastructure can modify the hydrologic cycle, increasing surface runoff, 
decreasing ground water recharge potential and increased atmospheric pollution (Moscrip and Montgomery, 1997, K. 
Arun, 2018, Prasad. G et al., 2019). 
 
The consensus is that remote sensing techniques are cost-effective for mapping land use as well as monitoring and 
managing land resources (Jayappa et al., 2006; Santhiya et al., 2010; Mujabar and Chandrasekar, 2012). Landsat image 
gallery is a repository of images of earth surfaces and has been in existence since 1970s and are increasingly adopted

Table 1 shows the percentage distribution of water body, vegetation, built-up, fallow land, sandy area and cultivated 
land use classes in 1990, 2001, 2005 and 2009. Waterbody has consistently maintained its presence at an average of 
28%. Vegetation covered 29% in year 1990 has declined to 18% in 2009. Land cover with cultivated area shows an 
increasing trend from 2005 to 2009 as shown in Fig 3, indicating sustainability efforts in that area. Decrease in sandy 
area from 2005 – 2009 can be attributed or rampant sand mining and natural causes.

4. Conclusion 
 
This study indicates that land use changes as a result of anthropogenic activities and natural events is driven by 
socioeconomic factors. The resulting reduction in land cover is unsustainable and GIS can help in mitigating the rapid 
pace of depletion of water bodies, vegetation and sandy shores. Although this study analysed the various classes of 
land use and coverage of a coastal town of Kerala, these findings are applicable to coastal regions of India, as 
anthropogenic activities and human interventions are fairly consistent. Land use studies can be instrumental in 
facilitating sustainable use of land resources, preventing agricultural land from incursion of urbanization activities; 
making certain that land is used according to appropriateness and restraining from activities resulting in depletion of 
vegetation.

Abstract 
Scheduling problems in manufacturing industries has received considerable attention from researchers 
under ideal environment in terms of certainty of information and stability of conditions.  However, real 
life situations are much more complex, less stable and more uncertain. In such cases, researchers turn to 
the simulation methodology for optimizing scheduling decisions. In this study, a simulation model was 
built for the flexible flow shop problem using Arena and OptQuest was utilized to determine the best 
dispatching rule, optimal batch size and the number of machines at each work center. Average flow time 
and average total earliness and tardiness were selected as performance metrics. The studied problem is 
stochastic in terms of job arrival, processing time and machine failure. The problem becomes more 
complex with the existence of machine setup times in between job processing. Computational results are 
reported to show the effectiveness of the developed simulation model in finding desirable solutions for 
both objective functions. Different dispatching methods are tested and compared in terms of their 
effectiveness in optimizing different objective functions.

1. Introduction
Workshops with flexible flow shop layout face difficulty in optimizing their facilities due to the complexity of 
structure and unpredictability of information. Cases involving dynamic Jobs arrival, at the shop dynamically, 
possible machine failure and sequence-dependent setup times for different job types are specifically more difficult to 
optimize. Management has to decide not only to determine the scheduling rules, but also to determine the number of 
machines to be allocated to each work station for optimal utilization the resources. On the other hand, to deal with 
setup dependency, batching may be considered and hence the optimal batch size should be determined.  
Studies on batching, resource allocation and job dispatching for such problems were conducted and reported in the 
literature. Al-Turki, et al (2017) used simulation methodology to determine the best dispatching rule, optimal batch 
size and the number of machines at each work center for a specific flexible flow shop. FIFO and LIFO policies were 
tested with respect to minimizing average flow. A simulation model has been built using the simulation package 
ARENA and its optimization tool called OptQuest is used for optimization.  In this paper we extend the study by 
extend the model to handle performance measures that include both earliness and tardiness and conduct sensitivity 
analysis with respect to setup time requirement and utility constraint to characterize the optimal setting. Dynamic 
SPT rule was added into dispatching rule options for optimizing the flow time problem and also Dynamic EDD for 
the early-tardy objective.  
The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, a summary of the literature review is 
presented. Section 3 states the problem definition. A simulation model is build using ARENA in Section 4. In 
Section 5, the computational experiments are presented and results are discussed. Conclusion and possible directions 
for future research are stated in section 6.

Table 5 shows the results of sensitivity analysis for the flow time problem with 6 scenarios generated by two 
different machine utilizations and three different setup times. This result gives some interesting insight that can be 
drawn from this data. If we look at the optimal configuration of batch size and number of assign machines in each 
utilization setting, the configuration has remained the same while the setup time is increased. This reveals that the 
model seems to be less sensitive to changes in setup times unless the changing is very high as shown in FIFO with a 
934% setup time ratio. 
Table 5. Sensitivity Analysis on Flow Time Problem 
Another conclusion can be drawn by looking at the configuration for different utilization levels. The model becomes 
sensitive to the changes of the minimum machine utilization. The number of machines drops to one for all work 
centers while minimum utilization is increased from 25% to 40%.  Also, Dynamic SPT `seems to be the best 
dispatching rule to solve the flow time problem under problem considered. This dispatching rule may not always 
give the performance like in the second scenario. However, this rule frequently gives the optimal performance 
measure.     
6. Conclusion
Several dispatching rules are considered for job scheduling on unreliable flexible flow shop for two performance 
measures, average flow time and average earliness and tardiness time. The problem is highly stochastics in terms of 
job arrival, processing time and machine breakdown where the workshop consists of several work centers with 
multiple identical machines at each stage and sequence dependent setup time. A simulation model has 
been developed using ARENA and OptQuest has been utilized to optimize the problem.  The objective of this 
study is to determine the best dispatching rule, the optimal batch size for each job type, the optimal number 
of identical machines at each work center, for minimizing the two performance measures. Sensitivity analysis with 
respect to the setup time and minimum machine utilization is conducted. 
The study found that the Dynamic Shortest Processing Time (DSPT) performs quite for the objective of minimizing 
the average flow time. The Dynamic Earliest Due Date (DEDD) is found to be preferable for minimizing earliness-
tardiness. Furthermore, the model seems to be less sensitive to changes in setup time but sensitive to changes in 
minimum machine utilization. 
Further study is recommended for testing other dispatching rules for different performance measures such as 
minimizing weighted completion time and green production related measures. Further sensitivity analysis for other 
parameters such as the number of the work centers, number of job types or other parameters may be conducted.

Abstract 
Gamma titanium aluminide alloys are of high importance due to their lower density and higher strength as 
compared to their competitor alloys such as Ti6Al4V in the automobile and aerospace applications. The 
current paper reports on the electron beam melting (EBM) and turning of the gamma titanium aluminide alloy 
(γ-TiAl). The γ-TiAl cylindrical parts are fabricated by using the ARCAM electron beam melting machine. 
After fabrication, the γ-TiAl parts are characterized by checking their surface morphology, microstructure, 
hardness, and surface roughness. All these measured characteristics show the acceptable levels for various 
applications except the surface roughness. The key limitation of the γ-TiAl parts fabricated from the electron 
beam melting process is their extremely poor surface roughness. The roughness values are observed as high 
as Sa = 34.9 µm. In this work, the surface quality of the EBM printed γ-TiAl components is improved by 
employing the turning process by using two different radii tungsten carbide inserts (0.4 mm and 0.8 mm). 
Also, the effects of other important turning parameters such as cutting speed (V), feed rate (f), depth of cut 
(ap) and coolant flow rate is taken into account. It has been attempted to find the optimized machining 
conditions to minimize the surface roughness and the main cutting forces during the finishing process.

Introduction 
Due to the high strength, low density, corrosion resistance and fatigue resistance, γ-TiAl (Ti-48Al-
2Cr-2Nb) has numerous potential applications (Basile et al., 2018; Sharman et al., 2001). The 
benefit of lower density is of particular importance in scenarios where ever more tough 
environmental legislations are being imposed to reduce the carbon emission and fuel consumption. 
A study reported by  Mohammad et al. (2017a) showed that γ-TiAl is not toxic and exhibits 
excellent cell bonding and growth as compared to commercially pure titanium. However, it is very 
difficult to produce parts with γ-TiAl owing to its superior mechanical properties.  
Recently, due to the developments in the electron beam melting process, it has become possible to 
print 3D parts from γ-TiAl. Electron beam melting process is based on selectively melting and 
solidification of the metal powder layer by layer according to an input CAD file. A highly focused 
and energized electron beam is used for melting the powder from various metals and alloys. The 
parts produced from EBM has several advantages as compared to conventional casting techniques 
such as: (i) more complex and unique geometries such as lattice and porous structures can be 
generated with EBM (Bsat et al., 2015; Cansizoglu et al., 2008), (ii) the cost of expensive tooling 
(dies and molds) is eliminated, (iii) oxidation and impurities free parts are achieved since the 
process is accomplished in vacuum (Biamino et al., 2011), and (iv) very fine and uniform 
microstructures could be developed for improving the structural integrity of the printed components 
(Hernandez et al., 2012; Lancaster et al., 2016). Nevertheless, aside from several advantages of 
EBM process, one of the significant limitations is that surface quality of the produced parts is 
inferior and the EBM manufactured parts cannot be directly used in applications where smooth 
surface finish is required (Anwar et al., 2018). For example, the surface roughness values are 
usually in the range of Ra = 15.8 – 54.3 µm (Mohammad et al., 2016; Sidambe, 2017) which is not 
suitable for aerospace or automobile applications. A similar comment was mentioned by Karlsson 
et al. (Karlsson et al., 2013), that due to the poor surface finish, the usage of the additively

Conclusions 
This paper investigates the results of the electron beam melting of the γ-TiAl (gamma titanium aluminide) 
and shows the characterization of the 3D printed parts in terms of their surface roughness, microstructure 
and hardness. All the qualities (hardness and microstructure) of the electron beam melted parts are 
satisfactory except the surface roughness. The turning operation was utilized to reduce the surface 
roughness of the gamma titanium aluminide parts, by using a wide range of the machining parameters. The 
turning experiments were performed by using the L36 Taguchi array. The goal was set to optimize the 
turning parameters to produce lower surface roughness while also keeping the main cutting force low to 
minimize the risk of microstructure alterations beneath the machined surface. Following main conclusions 
could be realized from this work. 
1. The S/N ratios and the ANOVA results show that the ap (depth) and f (feed rate) are the most 
noteworthy parameters concerning the Fc (cutting force) while the f (feed rate) and R (insert radius) 
appears to be the most dominant parameters manipulating the surface roughness. The cutting speed 
shows some influence on the Fc (cutting force), while the Q (coolant flow rate) does not seem to 
have any major influence on turning performance. 
2. From the response surface plot of the Ra (surface roughness), an interesting finding is that the 
adverse effect of the f (feed rate) on the surface quality (Ra) could be diminished by using higher 
insert radius. 
3. The results of the computed regression models for Fc and Ra closely agree with the validation 
experiments results with maximum errors of 11.92% and 4.95% respectively. This point out that 
the achieved models are reliable for predicting the turning performance in terms of the Ra and the 
Fc. 
4. Seven optimal combinations of the turning parameters are reported by using the composite 
desirability approach for simultaneous minimization the Fc and Ra. The comparison of solution 3 
of the multi-response optimization with the experimental data shows the prediction errors in Fc and 
Ra as 5.88% and 14.28% respectively.

Abstract 
Readymade garment industry is one of the production industries in Bangladesh where various types of 
materials, components, procedures, actions and conditions are being used and so there is high possibility of 
accidents to occur. Sewing section in garment industry is concerned with different hazards and risks which 
have surely negative impact on the environment and health of the workers. The main reason of this paper 
is to find out the hazards and risks existing in a sewing section of a readymade garment industry located in 
Bangladesh. A hazard analysis worksheet will be prepared including hazardous events, causes, control 
measurements, likelihood of occurring and severity to indicate risk score that have adverse effect on 
workers’ safety in their workplace based on a systematic approach. Risk priority number can also be 
determined by severity, detention and occurrence data. These two methods will help the industry to 
understand immediate concerns and prevent injuries from these accidents in that section.

1. Introduction 
 
Sewing section is one of the major sections of readymade garment industries that are the greatest export sector in our 
country. Approximately 78% foreign earnings are gained from this sector but due to lack of safety culture people 
working there do not feel safe. In various research it was found that there is risk in various occupation in shipbuilding 
industry including fiberglass production, welding, painting and other works (Celebi et al. 2010). In accordance with 
present statistics, about 10,000 ships are plying in Bangladesh, which transport almost 35% of passengers, 90% of 
total oil product and 70% of cargo (Iqbal, Zakaria & Hossain 2011). These ships are being manufactured to fulfill 
local demands and local shipyards can manufacture ships almost up to 3500 DWT ( Deadweight) and few shipyards 
have been able to fabricate around 10000 DWT (Iqbal, Zakaria & Hossain 2011).  
In recent years, research have been performing on health and safety issues because of vibration exposure and a study 
focused on the consequences of various criterions related to environment such as vibration, dust, VOC, noise 
(Cherniack et al. 2004). Some research found that emission of VOC happen during proper health risk assessment and 
during painting of ships are necessary for this purpose (Malherbe and Mandin 2007) and shipyard workers face various 
pulmonary symptoms, asbestosis and functional impairment (Kilburn et al 1985). Also morality among shipyard 
workers were studied in various studies (Puntoni et al. 2001). 
 
The sewing department of readymade garment environment wants proper care to minimize the hazards and risks in 
the procedures for producing elements. So various techniques are necessary to apply to prevent or manage those 
hazardous events or risks. In risk assessment process various types of failures and effects associated with various types 
of failures were included in various research works (Pickard et al. 2005). Various research indicated that in total 
quality management implementation processes various critical factors were studied in various sections of garment

3. Proper maintenance and upgrading working environment 
4. Combustible materials, flammable fumes should be secured in a place away from heat source and circuits 
5. Wider space and safety signals should be provided. 
 
5. Discussion and Conclusion 
Workers spend most of their time in work place and so ensuring work place safety is a must. For ensuring safety an 
interview session was completed with questionnaire. A hazard analysis worksheet was prepared to identify risk scores 
and control measures for accidents. Risk priority number was also calculated to prioritize risk. At the end of this paper 
recommendations were provided for safety issue in sewing section of readymade garment industry. By implementing 
prevention measure accidents can be reduced to a large extent. Result shows that by using PPE and proper maintenance 
are the major prevention techniques. Consciousness and personal effort of each worker are essential for overall safety 
of sewing section. Above all, the research was done by using PHA and RPN techniques whereas other techniques can 
be used in same department or same techniques can be used in other departments. As sewing section is one of the 
largest departments of a readymade garment industry, proper precautions are needed to take to save life of the workers 
as well as money and investment.

Abstract 
This paper is about evaluation of usability characteristics and anthropometric dimensions of Automated 
Teller Machines (ATMs) in Kuwait. As for the usability characteristics, efficiency, learnability, readability, 
and satisfaction are considered. Additionally, as anthropometric dimensions of ATMs for ergonomic 
design, screen height, keyboard height, card slot height, and cash slot height are considered. In order to 
evaluate usability characteristics, a questionnaire with ten questions related to the mentioned characteristics 
are designed. The results of the questionnaire are analyzed by using Minitab Software using Spearman 
Coefficient Correlation. Spearman Coefficient Correlation was used to check if the questions from same 
categories are correlated or not. Additionally, comparisons between customer satisfaction and learnability, 
efficiency and readability characteristics are performed. Also, for the efficiency characteristics of ATMs, 
the total transaction time is measured by using a chronometer for each user. On the other hand, different 
anthropometric dimensions for three banks in Kuwait are measured. These measurements are indicated that 
ATM designers are not considering anthropometric dimensions for different users. Finally, some solutions 
related to usability issues and anthropometric dimensions for Kuwaiti banks and ATM designers are 
recommended.

1. Introduction
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) gives users an opportunity to deal with financial transactions without contacting 
with the bank employee or teller. ATM helps customers to save their time during the attaining banking service such 
as fund transfer, cash withdrawal, bill payment, balance inquiry etc. ATMs have many advantages to users; not only 
saving time, but also, they are safe and easy to use. ATMs also provide to customers 24-hour access to banking services 
(Zhang et al., 2013). On the other hand, users can face many problems due to ATMs (Curran and King, 2008). While 
people try to use ATMs, they may do a lot of mistakes. ATM users in Kuwait are also having problems from different 
issues as limited language selections, long processing time, inappropriate ATM dimensions for different users. On the 
other hand, it is noticed that ATMs are not designed in different sizes which is considered as an issue for users. For 
example, reachability of ATMs components such as keyboard, card slot, cash slot, is creating serious problems for 
users.  
There are many issues related to ATM usability characteristics and anthropometric dimensions (Quesenbery, 2001; 
Shende et al., 2014). One can evaluate usability characteristics of ATMs by analyzing efficiency, readability, 
learnability, and satisfaction. Efficiency characteristic is related with the ATM transaction time. Any ATM transaction 
process should be completed as fast as possible. In Kuwait, some users take long time than expected to do the 
transaction. Especially elderly users spend a lot of time for a simple transaction that is an example of efficiency issue. 
Second one is readability characteristic, where the font size, font and background color, and font style should be clear 
and easy to for ATM read. Likewise, the text size should be chosen to be clear and readable for all people in all ages.

These measurements are important for ATM design and installation. As one can see that ATM dimensions and 
measurements change from one bank to another. Due to different populations and nationalities in Kuwait, there are 
different anthropometric measurements should be taken into consideration.  For this reason, it is essential to know the 
needed anthropometric dimensions are important to create standards and designs. In addition, to increase customer 
satisfaction, it’s very important to reduce awkward positions of elbow, shoulder, wrist and neck. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendation 
 
ATMs have been an important part of our daily life since we are using it for many banking operations such as cash 
withdraw or balance check. At this paper, evaluation of usability characteristics and the anthropometric dimensions 
of ATMs in Kuwait are performed. Usability characteristics of ATM are represented as efficiency, readability, 
learnability and customer satisfaction. In order to evaluate usability characteristics, a questionnaire with ten questions 
related to the mentioned characteristics are designed. The results of the questionnaire are analyzed by using Minitab 
Software using Spearman Coefficient Correlation. Spearman Coefficient Correlation was used to check if the 
questions from same categories are correlated or not. As a result, 66% of respondent disagreed on “ATMs are suitable 
for different users”, which means that people are not satisfied with ATMs design. As for other questions, respondents 
are happy about ATMs. Also, the efficiency of different ATM users is measured. We have found that elderlies are 
facing more issues while using ATM. Moreover, comparisons between different categories such as gender, ages and 
transaction type are analyzed. It is observed that female ATM users spent more time for a transaction and more 
cautious while using ATM. Based on results one can state that ATM designers are not considering neither the usability 
characteristics nor anthropometric dimensions of ATM in Kuwait. 
 
After the analysis of the questionnaire results, there is one major problem about the satisfaction of ATM users, more 
specifically, about the suitability of ATMs for different users. Kuwaiti banks should focus on the ATM user 
satisfaction by changing some of their ATM interface designs to reduce or remove unnecessary steps during the 
process to speed up the transaction process. They can provide more shortcuts for frequently used transactions. They 
can focus cognitive elements of design by providing such as clear and understandable descriptions and messages. 
Finally, for anthropometric dimensions, ATM designers should consider the population measurements, not only for 
Kuwaiti but also for majority of the population. For some features such as font sizes, written or audible messages, and 
language ATM designers should use adjustability feature to serve to wide range of users from different age and

population groups. Due to many different nationalities in Kuwait, ATM designers must provide ATMs with different

Abstract 
The economic value of soybean yield in production center area needs to be increased. The study of business 
model for soy milk yogurt (soygurt) product development was conducted as a consideration in small-scale 
rural agro-industry development in soybean production area. This paper aims to arrange business model in 
the development of soy milk yogurt product in small-scale rural agro-industry development. The research 
methods are BCG (Boston Consulting Group) model and the analysis of strength, weaknesses, opportunity, 
and threat (SWOT). Some efforts such as Promotion and marketing media, the KUB’s (Joint Business 
Group or JBG) manager organization, and the community involvement need to be run to make the 
production of soygurt product to achieve break event point as well as to get profit in small-scale rural agro-
industry. The improvement is mainly necessary on the product segment target, value chain in product 
distribution, cost model in soygurt product’s feasibility, and organization in the implementation activity. 
The study of SWOT model raises alternatives of strength-opportunity, strength-threat, and weakness-
opportunity obtained in the small-scale rural agro-industrial development in order to become a regional 
featured product in producing yogurt made of soybean.

1. Introduction
Soybean is an important food crop for Indonesian, which is in the third place after rice and corn. It is a high-protein 
crop and plays an important role in improving food security in Indonesia. Soybean is an important source of vegetable 
protein to increase the community nutrition due to its safety for health and cheapness. Soybean milk as a post-harvested 
product contains fat, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron, pro-vitamin A, Vitamin B complex (except B12), and 
water (Astuti et al., 2012). The need of soybean continues to increase along with the growth of population as well as 
the need of food industry materials such as tofu, tempeh, soy sauce, soy milk, tauco, snack, and so on.  
Soybean, as a processed food material, has potency to play role in developing Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise 
(SME), and local potential in realizing food security in Indonesia. The Government has prepared Soybean Roadmap 
and determined the target of national soybean production, and the yields were expected to increase year by year 
(Direktorat Pangan dan Pertanian, 2013). The areas of soybean production center to support the soybean productivity

Abstract 
In keeping with the urgent goals of maintaining a healthy environment and providing clean energy 
alternatives at reasonable prices, Saudi Arabia is moving towards electricity generation using wind. 
Selecting optimal wind farm locations is an important challenge in which one seeks to reduce the levelized 
cost of electricity. A four-level multi-criteria decision-making model was developed that used the analytic 
hierarchy process to consider wind availability, electricity demand, employment costs, maintenance costs, 
infrastructure costs, sale prices, and energy production capabilities to optimize wind farm locations. In 
addition, this study introduced multiple factors that affect wind farm success. In this study, the analytical 
hierarchy process was implemented using mathematical simulations to compare three wind farm locations 
in Saudi Arabia.

Introduction
The Saudi Arabia 2030 Vision supports the advancement of the renewable energy industry and seeks to increase
the renewable energy capacity within the Kingdom to 9.5 GW by 2023 (General Authority of Statistics 2016). On July 
23, 2018, the Renewable Energy Project Development Office at the Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral 
Resources of Saudi Arabia hosted bids for the first utility-scale wind farm in the country. It is expected to cost 
approximately $500 million and generate 400 MW of wind power to supply up to 70,000 Saudi households (Saudi 
Arabia Ministry of Energy 2018).  In addition, the wind energy industry is growing. Recently, it has grown by 
approximately 16% per year, reaching 435 GW of installed capacity at the end of 2015 (World Wind Energy 
Association 2016). The invention of electric cars is one of the initiatives that have been made. In addition, new 
techniques have been implemented to exploit energy from renewable sources. 
Recently, the level of discussion regarding shifts from classical to renewable energy within Saudi Arabia has 
increased. Thus, there is ongoing research on renewable energy sources such as wind. Optimization of wind turbine 
locations is important to power generation and the turbine life cycle. In particular, selecting an optimal site maximizes 
the benefits of wind farms (Ali et al. 2018). Several factors affect wind farm location decision-making. Cost is 
important — this includes maintenance and infrastructure costs, as well as labor costs. The latter can include 
uncertainty in currency fluctuations, economic changes, and political situations (Almaktoom et al. 2016). In addition, 
the quantity of energy produced affects location decision-making regardless of cost. Decision-makers also consider 
the opportunities associated with each location. These opportunities include energy demand (the number of 
households in the area) and wind availability as measured via wind speed. Opportunities, costs, and energy output 
significantly influence location decision-making.  
This study sought to rank the criteria used in selecting an optimal wind farm location in Saudi Arabia by 
importance via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This paper establishes a four-level model that includes wind 
farm selection criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives such as locations A, B, and C. The AHP model used to rank these 
criteria was developed based on Saaty (1980). The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analyzes 
applications of AHP. Section 3 introduces the wind farm criteria ranking method. Section 4 includes a case study of 
criteria ranking for wind farm location optimization. Finally, a summary is provided with recommendations and further 
work.

The resulting sub-criteria percentages and ratios are shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8. In order to link the sub-criteria 
to the criteria, one must weigh the former according to the main criteria weights (Figure 2).  
Figure 2. AHP model for wind farm location selection with criteria and sub-criteria weights. 
In order to choose the optimal wind farm location using the AHP method, the sub-criteria information must be 
determined for each location and the weights summed. The location with the highest weight is the best. However, this 
method is most effective when the sub-criteria are qualitative. In this case study, the sub-criteria such as wind 
availability, employee salaries, etc. are all quantitative. In conclusion, the AHP is not sufficient for identification of a 
suitable wind farm location. Further studies should be performed. Thus, this area of research will continue to adopt 
other techniques to achieve its objectives. 
5.
Conclusions
Wind farm turbine technology can make important contributions to the energy needs of Saudi Arabia. This study
presented a model that can be improved to help in developing a model that help in reducing energy costs. This study 
used the AHP, which is an MCDM method, to rank and evaluate wind farm allocation criteria. Due to the weaknesses 
of the AHP in multi-level ranking and dealing with quantitative data, further studies should integrate other methods 
to help achieve better rankings. It is recommended to extend the study and use other MCDM techniques that are more 
effective in ranking multi-level problems using qualitative and quantitative data. To overcome this gap, the technique 
for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) described in Choudhary and Shankar (2012), 
Roszkowska (2011), Srikrishan et al. (2014), and Ahmadi et al. (2013) should be integrated with AHP. It is also 
suggested to conduct further studies that consider the effects of uncertainty like Almaktoom (2017), Almaktoom and 
Krishnan (2016), Wang et al. (2013, 2014), and Krishnan et al. (2016) on optimal location selection.

Abstract 
Everyday, engineers are impressing us with innovative technologies that have brought into reality what was 
recently considered as science fiction or inconceivable futuristic, making our lives much more comfortable 
and more enjoyable. Recently, 3D printing helps in a far-reaching analog-to-digital shift that will 
completely transform the global manufacturing industry. It will change almost everything, the way we 
design, manufacture, distribute and consume.3D printers print objects from computer models to real 3D 
physical objects. The printing is done layer by layer using different materials. As different materials used 
for printing there are various techniques used for 3D printing, as well as the construction of the printer 
itself. In this study, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of installing and analyzing the output of 
an open-source 3D printer.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, 3d printing has become a robust field that is overgrowing to revolute the manufacturing processes. Many
disciplines like mechanical, electrical, biomedical, and aerospace industries, use 3d printing to improve the design
manufacturing and to minimize the lead time as well as the tooling cost for new objects produced. 3d printing differs
from traditional machining such as turning, milling and drilling which helped people many decades ago to build
products. However, recently, they are no longer used as much as before because they have some limitations and
constraints, such as the expensive cost of the production processes. In this regard, the concept of 3d printing has
introduced. It is also known as additive manufacturing, which is part of rapid prototyping in which it is possible to
form 3-dimensional objects from a digital file. Additive manufacturing meant to be the deposition of a specific material 
layer by layer until the desired object is created as per the given design. Those layers that combined one on top of the
other is nothing more than a horizontal cross-section of the product itself. The quality of the printed parts using a 3d
printer relies on many factors, like the composition of the material used, the manufacturing process, the printing
feeding rate, filament flow rate, the type of 3D printer used, and eventually the dimensions of the printed part of the
used printer. In general, 3D printing technology has a significant contribution to the world in many directions because
of the remarkable advantages to the industrial sector and has a substantial impact on the other fields  [Ahmed and Al-
Douri (2020), Ahmed and Al-Douri (2018)]. The development has also been applied to other fields, such as
prototyping, modeling and failure mechanisms [Aldarmaki, A. N. et al. (2019), Al-Shamsi et al. (2019)], Whereas the
aerospace industry is one of the exciting industries due to the wide range of applications that 3D printing technology
could be used Alahbabi et al. (2019)]. However, the 3D printing technology started being embraced in schools [Ahmed
and Alhamad (2018)] for the learning purposes [Alhamad et al. (2019)], as well as implemented in different university

7. Observations  
During the assembly process, several challenges have been faced, with the help of our instructor and the lab engineer 
we overcame them. Regarding the home positioning of the printer, there was an issue with the micro switch, it couldn’t 
compress to the end, so as a solution, double-sided foam tape was used on the three trolleys, so it touches the 
microswitch and lead it to full compression. Moreover, the belts aren’t tightly installed in the grooves, they are too 
thin to fit in the slot, so a cover was designed to keep the belt in the groove and prevent any movement. Regarding the 
filament spool holder, it wasn’t able to hold a high weight, it also permits some movements of the filament spool, so, 
a new design used to hold the spool from the two sides to hold it tightly.  
 
 
 
8. Conclusion  
The main aim of this study is to introduce the students to the process of assembling an open source 3d printer and to 
enhance their knowledge deeply in assembling parts. Building a 3D printer from scratch gave students a chance to 
learn more about different types of bolts, nuts and many various tools. Many challenges faced during the assembly 
and especially the electrical part which was done by the assistance of a mechatronics engineer. In terms of printer 
performance, students got familiar with the software Repetier, they became able to print 3D models for different 
purposes

Abstract 
In genealogy, Foucault discusses how people organize themselves and others through knowledge 
production. He saw the knowledge can generate power by lifting people into the subject and then 
commanding the subject with knowledge. For Foucault, knowledge is a source of power. Various 
controversies that arise due to the leadership style of Gus Dur to this day is still remembered in Indonesia. 
Even some of the language style is a term that is often used as a joke about it to this day. This paper tried 
to see the style of the leadership of Abdurahman Wahid (Gus Dur), especially the language and some of 
the policies of his more controversial for being the number one man in Indonesia. In this study, the 
authors use descriptive research critical with more emphasis on the strength of the analysis of sources and 
existing data by relying on the theories and concepts of existing concepts to be interpreted based on the 
writings of leading to the discussion. Epistemologies of Foucault's much influenced by the concept of 
Nietzsche's thus reasonable if the criticism against the concept of power Foucault is on the influence of 
nihilism. So in his view no one in this world that is considered normal to have power against themselves. 
Only a crazy person or that is considered not normal which is not bound by power or have real power. As 
exemplified in the writings of this style and buzz performed by the figure of Abdurrahman Wahid, who 
indeed is a form of power over self instead be considered as something unnatural and even “eccentric”. 
but in fact the perspective of the general public who have not been able to translate the policy because of 
the limited knowledge.

1. Introduction
Michel Foucault has two main thoughts. The first thought which is about archaeological science. Archaeological 
science is a set of rules that specify the conditions of discourse/discourse at a particular time. Archaeology aims to 
find the structure of knowledge, ideas and mode of discourse. in a discussion about the archaeology, Foucault 
criticized the history of human development in which there are knowledge, rationality, social institutions and 
subjectivity of the modern that is considered natural in society however it turns out is the construction of the socio-
historical of power and domination. Foucault assumes that in the modern era, is a period where there are the spread 
and improvement of techniques-techniques of domination and during this period the model of domination of the 
strong man was at its peak. 
The thought of Foucault that the second is about the genealogy of power. Genealogy of power is a way of Foucault 
to analyze the relationship of knowledge and power are mutually related to one another. Specifically, genealogy

be embraced to rebuild the Indonesian economy recently hit by the crisis great. And to restore the national economy, 
the first step he did was call back the owners of capital that want to invest in Indonesia. Gus Dur sure, a government 
that does not implement a political racist, would make the ""guanxi"" feel safe planting in the Indonesian capital. 
A group of ethnic Chinese in the national knowledge, Gus Dur is the same with tribal-ethnic other nations, such as 
ethnic Javanese, Batak, Papua, Arab, India, Japan and Europe, which had a long life and become a resident or citizen 
of Indonesia. They also have the same rights as legitimate citizens as mandated by the 1945 Constitution (Fikri, 
2012:83-84). The development of Human Rights after the reform of 1998 experienced very rapid progress. Including 
also the freedom to religion. In this period there is a momentum that is very meaningful for the people of 
Confucianism in Indonesia. Before the reform, known only five religions in Indonesia, namely: Islam, Christian, 
Catholic, Hindu and Buddhist. However, currently in Indonesia, recognized six religions, namely: Islam, Christian, 
Catholic, Hindu, Budha, and Konghucu. 
The development of the ethnic Chinese is very limited in Indonesia after the reformation is to be free. The 
recognition of religious Confucianism in Indonesia has actually been recognized since long before the reform period 
began, namely with the existence of Law Number 5 of 1969 which recognizes the existence of six religions in 
Indonesia, namely: Islam, Christian, Catholic, Hindu, Budha, and Konghucu. The settings in this Legislation 
together with the Determination of President Number 1. Pn. Ps. 1965 that recognizes six religions. 
Discrimination people of Confucianism began to be felt with the issuance of Presidential Instruction No. 14 the Year 
1967 On Religion, Belief, and Customs of the Chinese. In addition, the Presidential Instruction No. 1470/1978 
which contains that the government only recognizes five religions namely Islam, Christian, Catholic, Hindu and 
Buddhist. It means that Confucianism which is based on the 1976 census embraced by a million people is not a 
religion recognized by the government. The policy-making of the civil rights of adherents of Confucianism is 
limited. Religious celebrations in the building and public facilities is prohibited. Chinese new year is not put in a big 
day in Indonesia. In terms of education, schools under the foundation One should not teach the lesson of religious 
Confucianism. Marriage among the people of Confucianism is not recorded by the Civil registry Office. The 
instruction does not explicitly revoke the recognition of religious Confucianism in Indonesia. However, due to the 
posed between several other Human Rights violations against the people of Confucianism as written above. 
After the new order regime ended, freedom of religion in Indonesia has experienced significant progress. The 
president of Indonesia at that time Abdurrahman Wahid or usually called Gus Dur issued Presidential Decree No. 6 
the Year 2000 about Revocation of Presidential Instruction No. 14 the Year 1967 On Religion, Belief, and Customs 
of the Chinese. In dictum weigh, it is mentioned that during the implementation of Presidential Instruction No. 14 
the Year 1967 on Religion, Belief, Customs of the Chinese is felt by Indonesian Citizens of Chinese descent has 
been limited movement in organized religious activities, beliefs, customs and traditions. In addition, it was 
mentioned that the implementation of religious activities, beliefs, and customs essentially are an integral part of 
Human Rights. With the presidential Decree, the Presidential Instruction No. 14 the Year 1967 on Religion, 
Provided, and Customs of the Chinese is revoked and the implementation of religious activities, beliefs, and customs 
of China implemented without requiring a special permit as took place earlier. The decision enters into force since 
17 January 2000. 
Revocation of Presidential Instruction No. 14 the Year 1967 on Religion, Belief, and Customs of the Chinese have a 
very significant impact on the development of religious freedom and freedom of expression. Cultural development is 
also growing rapidly after the discharge of the Decree of revocation of the Instructions of the President that such 
discriminatory. The religion of Confucianism is now free to embrace by the Citizens of the State of Indonesia. A lot 
of government policy after the reforms to accommodate the interests of the people of Confucianism and the ethnic 
Chinese. In 2001, President Abdurrahman Wahid made Chinese new year as a holiday elective for the ethnic 
Chinese. The policy followed by replacement of the Gus Dur President Megawati by setting Imlek as a national 
holiday through Presidential Decree Number 19 the Year 2002 about the Lunar New Year on April 9, 2002. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
For Foucault, power is not the relationship of the subjective direction: the ability of a person/group to impose the 
will to another. For Foucault power is a complex strategy in a society with equipment, manoeuvres, techniques, and 
specific mechanism. ""In general it should be recognized that more power to operate than on owned. Power is not a 
privilege that is obtained or retained the class of dominant, but a result of the overall its strategic position, a result 
which shows the position of those who are dominated"" 
Epistemologies of Foucault's much influenced by the concept of Nietzsche's thus reasonable if the criticism against 
the concept of power Foucault is on the influence of nihilism. So in his view no one in this world that is considered

Abstract 
Background: Based on the Ministry of Health’s estimation in 2012, there were 1,095,970 MSM, both seen 
and unseen. In Jakarta, as many as 27,706 residents of the capital city are gay, and tens of thousands of 
gays in the capital city, as many as 5,550 people are suspected of suffering from HIV / AIDS, and in 
Palmerah District there are 163 MSM who carry out  HIV testing. Objective: To provide an overview of 
what factors triggering gay characteristics and a description of knowledge about STIs in homosexual 
groups in Palmerah District, West Jakarta. Research Methods: This study uses qualitative methods with 
descriptive research type. The selection of informants used snowball sampling technique with 4 gay 
people representing homosexual groups in Palmerah District, West Jakarta as research informants. 
Results: Factors triggering gay characteristics were due to several factors, namely permissive, 
authoritarian, and neglected parenting patterns, family factors because the informant’s relationship with 
parents and their families were not intertwined both with parents and families, environmental factors in 
group interactions peers because the friendly environment with peer groups makes sexual orientation as 
gay stronger and feels comfortable, a traumatic experience factor to one informant who has an unpleasant 
experience. Description of STI knowledge in homosexual groups where the majority of informants 
already know about STIs, only a small proportion of informants does not know about STIs. Efforts to 
prevent STIs were carried out by all informants, namely reducing the frequency of sexual relations, not 
changing partners and using protectors such as condoms, and even one of the informants did a health 
checkup for HIV every 3 months. Conclusion: Society can anticipate as parents by understanding how 
parenting can make a child gay and also establish good communication relationships with children early 
on, and as parents know the impact of gay behaviour that is at high risk of contracting an STI or HIV- 
AIDS.

School and I was in early year of Senior High School, I already felt like I was interested in guys, but there was still 
normal. Just glancing around handsome guys. In grade 3 of Senior High Schools, I started to get to know men who 
like each other ""(Personal interview with MF, 17 June 2019). 
Therefore it can be said that any bad experience in the past will continue to stick in the mind so that it can cause 
certain hatred. It can cause traumatic things that can interfere with their sexual orientation. 
Regarding the description of the knowledge of gay informants about sexually transmitted infections (STIs), most of 
the informants already knew about STIs, in which some informants mentioned a number of types of STIs and their 
prevention efforts that they implemented. The types of sexually transmitted infections (STI) mentioned by several 
informants were HIV, AIDS, herpes, syphilis or the lion king, and two informants of whom knew the symptoms. 
The informant BR know a little of the symptoms and modes of transmission of STIs that he mentioned, namely HIV, 
which according to him it is transmitted by sexual contact which is the most risky way of transmitting HIV. ""The 
symptoms of HIV are achy bodies, having much dandruff, itchy, and fever. That’s all the symptoms of HIV that I 
know. And the transmission is hmm by kissing lips is not highly risky even some say it's not contagious if it's just lip 
kissing or eating together, drinking using the same glass or just like that. I think it's not contagious or only a small 
contagion and the fatal one is a sexual transmission.”(Interview with BR, June 16, 2019). 
Regarding efforts to prevent STIs said by all informants are more reducing the frequency of sexual relations, not 
changing partners and using a protective device such as a condom before sexual intercourse. According to several 
informants who use these condoms the informants acknowledge in accordance with their respective roles. If the 
informant is the top, then he/she uses the condom, but if the informant is a bot, then the condom is used, ie the 
partner acts as the top. ""If it's to prevent me, it's more to reduce and I'm also like that when I play clean, because I'm 
more into booty, so my partner is the top one, like using a condom if I want to have sex"" (Interview with BR, June 
16 2019). 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Based on the results of data collection conducted on gays in Palmerah district, West Jakarta, it can be concluded that 
the form of parenting informants' parents that influence the incidence of gays on informants namely permissive, 
authoritarian, and abandonment care patterns which informants become a factor in the formation of their sexual 
orientation become gay. The majority of informants' relationships with parents and their families are not well 
established and there is a distance from parents and families of informants. In the peer group interaction 
environment, the majority of informants acknowledged that the friendly environment with peer groups made their 
sexual orientation as gay stronger and more comfortable until now. There was one informant who had an unpleasant 
experience by being kicked in the buttocks by two of his male friends while the informant sat on the elementary 
school bench so that it caused the informants to hate men, and the informant felt uncomfortable with men. So since 
that incident, the informant has never played with men again and since then the informant has always played with 
women and felt like a woman and not interested in women

Abstract  
 
Pharmacy as a form of pharmaceutical service needs to improve the quality of service continuously 
following established standards. Service quality is not only influenced by the system but workers as the 
dominant factor implementing the service must be considered comfort at work. Pharmacies in the city of 
Ambon today continue to improve service in a system but is not supported by the availability of 
supporting facilities and an ergonomic environment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ergonomic 
problems in pharmacies in Ambon city using Ergonomic Checkpoint. The study was conducted in three 
pharmacy units. The results showed that there were many complaints of workers including pain in the 
shoulders, neck, lower back and legs. The work environment in the three pharmacies is average> 300 C. 
Priority aspects that need to be improved in the three pharmacies are in the Material Storage and Handling 
aspects, sub aspects 1,2 and 7, aspects of workstation sub aspects 52,53, and 57, and aspects Premises, 
sub aspects 73, 77, 78 and 79.

1. Introduction 
Pharmaceutical Services is a direct and responsible service to patients relating to pharmaceutical preparations to 
achieve definite results to improve the quality of life of patients (Majdah Zawawi1 and Noriah Ramli 2016). The 
purpose of conducting pharmaceutical services including to carry out optimal pharmaceutical services both in 
ordinary circumstances and in emergencies according to the patient and the available facilities. One of the 
pharmaceutical services that play an important role in increasing the degree of public health is the pharmacy service 
at the pharmacy. The number of dispensaries in every province in Indonesia has increased every year (Menteri 
Kesehatan RI 2016). Maluku Province is one of the provinces where pharmacies have increased every year, 
especially in the city of Ambon. The number of pharmacies in the city of Ambon in 2018 was 50 units while in 2019 
an increase of 70 units (Dinas Kesehatan Kota Ambon. Jumlah Apotek di Kota Ambon, 2019). Each pharmacy tries

Abstract 
The success of empowering women in rural areas cannot be seen only partially but must consider various 
aspects or factors comprehensively. Many women's empowerment activities have been carried out by the 
central government, regional governments and NGOs, but many more have failed or failed. the failure 
was caused by the Top Down's empowerment programs without regard to the needs and local wisdom of 
the target group or without regard to various aspects/factors that could affect the success of the 
empowerment activities themselves at the target location. This study aims to identify factors that 
influence the success of women's empowerment in rural areas. The results showed that nine factors could 
influence the success of empowering rural women in villages (countries) within the Salahutu District 
region namely; The Role of Government, Cooperatives, Capital, Role of Local Community 
Organizations, Education, Entrepreneurial Soul, Assistance, Social Culture, and Non-Governmental 
Organizations (NGOs).  
Keywords Factors, influences, empowerment, women, rural areas 
Introduction 
Nowadays women have an important role in national development. One of the efforts put forward by Saptandari to 
improve women's bargaining position in enhancing their role in national development is by empowerment 
(Saptandari 1999). Empowerment does not only involve strengthening individual members of the community, but 
also institutions. Instilling the values of modern culture such as hard work, independence, thrift, openness, 
responsibility is an essential part of this empowerment effort. Empowerment of women must be done because they 
have the same interests in development, and are also the users of development results who have the same rights as 
men (Marwati and Astuti 2012). 
Therefore, empowering women in rural areas requires sensitive policies to address fundamental problems, so that 
they can produce the best results. 
Central Maluku Regency is the largest and oldest Regency in Maluku, which based on data from the Central Maluku 
Statistics Agency in 2012 had a population of 371,712 people (23.59%), of which 181,869 (48.93%) were women. 
Judging from the composition of employment, more men have worked which is equal to 65.03%, while women who 
have worked as much as 34.97%. On the other hand, the unemployment rate among women is greater than men 
namely; 8.59% of women compared to 4.97% of men. This condition shows that women's access to the world of 
work is still low in the public sphere, and the position of men is still more dominant or the position and role of 
women is higher. In connection with the above matter, the problem to be answered in this study is how to improve 
the economic level of the family through empowering women by developing the potential of local resources they 
have (Marasabessy and Tuasamu 2016).

that in the future to ensure the sustainability and success of community empowerment it is necessary to synchronize 
community empowerment programs between the government and NGOs. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of the discussion above, it can be concluded the following matters: 1) nine factors can influence 
the success of empowering rural women in villages (countries) within the Salahutu District region namely; The Role 
of Government, Cooperatives, Capital, Role of Local Community Organizations, Education, Entrepreneurial Soul, 
Assistance, Social Culture, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). 2) 
The unsuccessful programs for 
empowering rural women in villages (countries) in the Salahutu District area because they are still partial and Top-
Down. 3) 
Women's groups that have been empowered in villages (countries) in the Salahutu District area 
generally cannot continue their businesses due to lack of capital and access to venture capital.

Abstract 
This study aims to investigate the direct influence of the factors that influence the quality of village 
financial reports, including the competence of village financial managers, the use of information 
technology and the role of village facilitators. The target sample is village financial managers in Buru 
Regency, which are spread throughout the village. Data is collected through a questionnaire and then 
tested using the Smart Partial Least Square technique. The research results obtained were sufficient to 
provide moderate support for these goals. This is evidenced from the inner model test, the R Square value 
of 0.35 implies that 35% of the quality of financial statements can be explained by the competence of 
village financial managers, the use of information technology and the role of village facilitators, the rest is 
explained by other factors not examined. Of the three hypotheses proposed, 2 hypotheses that showed 
significant positive results. The hypothesis that supports this research provides the conclusion that the use 
of IT and the role of village facilitators are variables that affect the quality of village financial reports.

1. Introduction
Decentralization is the transfer of government affairs by the central government to autonomous regions based on the 
principle of autonomy. With decentralization, autonomy has emerged for a regional government. The regional 
government, in this case, the village has the authority to arrange, manage and regulate its territory without 
interference from the central government. With a decentralized government system, efforts can be made to 
encourage villages to innovate and work to advance their villages so that national development can be realized even 
in remote villages (Soleman and Latuconsina 2019). 
To realize national development, the central government has allocated several budgets to each village. Funds 
channelled to each village will later be accounted for by the village head to government officials above the village 
(district government) (Hamiru and Umanailo 2019). As stated in the Ministerial Regulation concerning village 
financial management. Village financial management is an inseparable part of the entire village management 
process, which includes village financial planning, implementation, administration, reporting and village financial 
accountability. Given the amount of the budget managed by the village government from year to year has increased 
so that management must be carried out in an orderly and planned manner so that in village financial reporting can 
be accounted for as well. 
Village financial management in Buru Regency can be said to be not as expected. Problems that arise related to 
village financial management often occur to date, including those related to administrative completeness that is not

Based on the original sample values, it is found that the highest value that affects the quality of financial statements 
(KLK) is the use of information technology (PTI) compared to the other 2 variables. Thus the use of information 
technology is the most dominant factor in influencing the quality of financial statements. 
 
4. Conclusion. 
 
The results of the study were moderate enough to provide strong support for the research objectives, this is 
evidenced from the inner model test, obtained an R square value of 0.35 means that 35% of the quality of financial 
statements can be explained by the competence of village financial managers, the use of information technology and 
the role of village facilitators, the rest is explained by other factors not examined. Besides, from the three hypotheses 
proposed, 2 hypotheses showed significant positive results. The hypothesis that supports this research provides the 
conclusion that the use of information technology and the role of village facilitators are variables that affect the 
quality of village financial reports. The procurement and use of technical facilities is very important in improving 
the quality of village financial reports. Likewise with the role of village facilitators, it also contributes to the quality 
of village financial reports. The hypothesis that does not provide support for this study can be concluded that the 
quality of village financial reports in regency. Hunting might be influenced by other factors apart from the 
competence of village financial managers. 
Based on the results and conclusions above, some suggestions can be explained as follows. 1)  For village 
governments to always utilize existing technology to further improve the quality of village financial reports. 
Likewise with the competence of the village apparatus to always be given an understanding of accounting and 
village financial management because this can be seen from the filled demographic data. Most respondents are not 
from accounting background (respondent characteristic data). 2)  Structural model test results that show the 
influence of the determination of the independent variables on the dependent variable that is moderate by 35% so it 
can be suggested for further research to add new variables that are predicted to improve the quality of financial 
statements such as the application of SAP, work experience, understanding of accounting and the other. 3)  The 
consequence of predictive model testing in this study is that testing can be carried out without a strong theoretical 
basis so that for subsequent studies it can do another model testing such as estimation model testing or can use other 
research techniques.

Abstract 
The objective of this research was to build a business model in traditional tourism villages on Ambon 
Island. The method used in this study is the Canvas Business Model in the form of quantitative and 
qualitative descriptive research obtained through the distribution of questionnaires with a sample of 32 
visiting tourist respondents. The focus of the traditional fishery tourism under study was the trap fish trap 
and traditional fishing. At present, traditional fisheries tourism has not been made in villages that have 
traditional fisheries tourism, even though Maluku province has the characteristics of an archipelago that is 
rich in marine tourism, this is an opportunity to develop and develop cultural-based fisheries tourism 
through the concept of a business model. The results showed that tourists came with purpose adventure 
and diving are in the leading position with each 37,5 % and 31,3% because it is considered as the main 
attraction, culinary and natural is 9,4%, with history and culture 6,3%. This data is influenced by 
demographic variables age and education until a reduction in interest. However, for domestic and local 
tourists, culinary variables are the main interests with 18.4% and 18.1% respectively. While history is 
17.5%.

1. Introduction
Karakteristik Province of Maluku with the territorial conditions of the island, the marine area should be a top 
priority in the development of tourism while maintaining local culture. Ambon Island, which is surrounded by 
traditional villages, has a lot to say about marine tourism while maintaining local culture. One of the local cultures 
referred to here is one of the ways villagers capture fish using traditional fishing gear, including traditional fish traps 
and simple fishing rods. This then becomes a sensation (attraction) in cultural-based marine tourism, which until 
now has not been able to be a new product. Taiwan has succeeded in turning traditional fisheries into a tourist 
attraction, however, there is a conflict between commercial fishing and recreational fishing (Chen and Chang 2017). 
The tourism sector can be used as a potential industry as a tool to develop regional potential (Umanailo and Ali 
2019; Zaman Akhmad 2017) So the focus of this research is only on traditional bubu.

4. Conclusion. 
Marine tourism needs to always be explored for its development and use, especially traditional fishing tourism on 
Ambon Island. The BMC approach will help develop a new business concept. The results show that tourists coming 
with adventure and diving destinations are in the forefront with 37.5% and 31.3% respectively because they are 
considered as the main attraction, culinary and natural 9.4%, with history and culture 6, 3%. This data is influenced 
by the demographic variables of age and education to reduced interest. However, for domestic and local tourists, 
culinary variables are the main interests with 18.4% and 18.1% respectively. While history is 17.5%. Underwater 
wealth is one of the smallest parts of marine nature tourism and certainly, the sensation obtained from an underwater 
adventure is what must be considered. Thus this is the key resource, key activities to then be converted into revenue 
streams which will certainly affect the amount of cost structure in the hope that it will become the solution of what is 
needed.

Abstract 
This research aims to know the impact of marginalization caused by the activities of agricultural land 
conversion in the Village Ngringo. In the analysis of the results of the study, the researchers used several 
approaches in the theory such as the Theory of Rational Choice proposed by James Coleman and coupled 
with the Moral Economy and Political Economy of each was stated by James Scott and Samuel Popkins. 
From the results of the research that has been done that an initial overview of the occurrence of the 
transfer function due to the difficulty of the economic factors that cause landowners to sell agricultural 
land to cover the needs of life as well as the cost of children's education. In addition, with the narrowness 
of agricultural land to be processed then the Hodge trying to cover her needs with the way to work outside 
the agricultural sector is the one with the construction worker. Under these conditions, the laborer still 
retains to work in land-agricultural land that has changed ownership to the owner of the company or 
factory with the consequences at any time lose their source of livelihood due to the land used for 
construction of factory and industry.

1. Introduction
The development of the Industry affect the economic improvement in Indonesia that have an impact on the high 
public demand for vacant land or land for the benefit of the individual as well as group effort while on the other 
hand supplies the ground for it is very limited as happened in the Province of Central Java where the local 
government has determined some locations that are directed to be developed as an industrial area and location of 
industry (regional Office of National Land Agency of Central Java Province). One of the districts that have 
industrial potential are high enough is the Karanganyar Regency (Umanailo and Ali 2019). Karanganyar Regency 
are included in the Urban Area of Surakarta, and Surakarta City itself is the center of growth for the Region 
Development IV Central Java. The region woke up physically has grown and developed to exceed the boundaries of 
administrative (RTRW of Karanganyar Regency 2001) (Maharani and Rahardjo 2012). 
The development of the industrial area in Karanganyar regency is very prominent and focused on the village 
Ngringo village, with very benefited by the factor arbitrate so that it becomes the axis of the growth and

1. Introduction
In this era of globalization, business competition is becoming increasingly sharp, both in the domestic (national) 
market and in the international market. Companies need a strategy to face increasingly tighter competition. There are 
various challenges in achieving company success. To anticipate this, companies are required to be able to work well 
by using a variety of available resources to be accepted in the market. One thing that companies need to pay 
attention to in achieving success is service quality. Services are activities offered by organizations or individuals to 
consumers, which are intangible and cannot be owned (Hasanah 2016). 
As we know, the problem is the incompatibility of a situation with what is desired. Likewise in the world of banking, 
the development of increasingly advanced technology makes the superiority of a product difficult to maintain, 
because the product is easier to emulate. Latuconsina (2016) tried to apply the Tjokroaminto Islamic critical method 
that the value of generosity is a solution as an evaluation of the recipient's subject and object by prioritizing 
customers who need a discount (Muhtar Latuconsina 2016). Latuconsina (2016) also states that there are broadly 
three subjects receiving murabahah instalments, namely customers who make payments on time, are faster than the 
maturity period and who experience the ability to repay murabahah instalments. For this reason, good and quality 
service are needed to be able to provide excellent service and quality as desired and expected by its customers to be 
able to make customers feel satisfied. 
One way to create customer satisfaction through quality improvement, because customers are the main focus when 
we reveal about customer satisfaction and quality. The issue of quality has become a ""price to be paid"" by the 
company to stay in business. At present, almost all companies, especially service companies can produce the same 
quality of service by applying ISO 9001 (Lupiyoadi 2013). Quality of service identifies efforts to meet the needs and 
desires of consumers and the accuracy of their delivery in offsetting consumer expectations. Service quality can be

4. Conclusion 
Multiple Linear Regression Analysis shows that there is a significant influence of independent variables (Tangibles 
(X1), Responsiveness (X2), Assurance (X3), Reliability (X4), Empathy (X5)) on the dependent variable (Customer 
Satisfaction (Y) at the Ambon branch of BRI Bank in Ambon City both partially and simultaneously. This means 
that to make predictions of Customer Satisfaction at BRI Bank Ambon Branch in Ambon City can use Tangibles 
(X1), Responsiveness (X2), Assurance (X3), Reliability (X4) and Empathy variables (X5). 
Responsiveness is the independent variable that has the strongest influence on satisfaction, followed by the variable 
Reliability, Empathy, Assurance and the smallest influence is the variable Tangibles.

Abstract 
Kinetic wind energy can be utilized as a source of electrical energy, Indonesia has a source of wind 
energy that is large enough, wind energy occurs because of differences in air pressure between hot air and 
cold air with the impact of earth rotation. Windmills are one form of utilization of wind energy that is 
converted to environmentally friendly electrical energy, horizontal axis windmills are wind turbines with 
horizontal main shafts that are parallel to the ground surface, a parameter that must be considered in 
horizontal axis windmills is the use of the number of blades and the type of blade used. This study is to 
analyze the calculation of windmills using three blades with a type of blade, namely NACA Airfoil 63-
212 with a lift coefficient of 1.36 and a drag coefficient of 0.48 at an angle of attack 200, to determine the 
use of a windmill blade against the output power. In this study, the time needed by researchers was one 
month, and from the results of this study, the highest power was 4540.75 watts at 7 months with a tip 
speed ratio value of 4.18, at a wheel rotation of 46.16 RPM with the torque of the wheel. 939.71 Nm was 
produced while the lowest was 1043.16 watts in 11 months with a tip speed ratio of 4.18, at 28.27 RPM 
of the wheel with the torque of the wheel produced of 352.48 Nm. The coefficient of power (Cp) of the 
windmill analyzed by the researcher is 0.21 or equal to the efficiency of the windmill is 21%.

1. Introduction
A wind turbine is a form of renewable alternative energy utilization by utilizing wind kinetic energy that is 
converted to environmentally friendly electrical energy (Galloway, Myers, and Bahaj 2010). The wind turbine is 
divided into two, namely horizontal axis windmill and vertical axis windmill. Horizontal axis windmill is a windmill 
with shaft main horizontal parallel to the ground surface, the position of the shaft parallel to the direction of the 
arrival of the wind and the power generator is located on the top of the tower (Saputra, Weking, and Jasa 2017). 
Analyze the effect of flowrate on the power and efficiency of the windmill (Rahman and Kimin 2018). 
Parameters that must be considered in horizontal axis windmills are the number of blades, increasing or decreasing 
the number of blades is one way to increase windmill efficiency (Singh and Ahmed 2013). And the results of the

Abstract  
 
The advance of the technology has changed the consumer behavior of the buyers to online. This study is mainly 
designed to test the relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable of online consumer behavior of 
Generation Z (people born between 1995 to 2010) in Malaysia. There are still lack of study regarding social media 
factors and its effects on the online apparel shopping behavior in the context of Malaysia, especially Generation Z. A 
survey questionnaire is used for collecting the data and information. The research sample is 250 respondents and the 
data are collecting by non-probability sampling. The research data is analyzed by descriptive analysis, correlation 
analysis, and multiple linear regression model through SPSS Software version 23. The results show that the website 
characteristics, online perceived value, and brand reputation have a positive and highly significant relationship with 
online shopping intention. The obtained result provides an indication to marketers in Malaysia when targeting young 
consumers from Generation Z.

1. Introduction  
 
Today social media have become important part of life for the people around the world, including young people. This 
study is carried out to better understanding of marketers on young consumers in Malaysia, especially consumers from 
Generation Z who born between 1995 to 2010. The main purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between 
predictors and online shopping intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. This study assumes that Generation Z in 
Malaysia are preferred online shopping as they are born in an environment surrounded by technology. A study shows 
that half of Generation Z purchase goods and services from online at least once a month (Abramovich, 2019). The 
factors that may affect online shopping intention include a promotion, items delivery speed, attractive image, website 
layout, and others (Sweeney, 2018). However, due to the diversity of Generation Z, these factors are still insufficient 
to explain their online consumer behavior. The significant of the factors will be affected by the place and the period 
in which the research is conducted. 
 
Generation Z is the latest generation, and it has different expectations, lifestyles, values, and consumer behavior 
(Williams & Page, 2011). Many researchers have stated that the studies of Generation Z start from the turn of the 
century (Vukić, 2019). The researches and studies concerning Generation Z are still in the beginning phase, and 
researchers are just started to study and understand the characteristics and nature of this population group (Schwieger 
& Ladwig, 2018). Generation Z will account for about 40% of all consumers in the year 2020 (Artemova, 2018). It is 
important for marketers to analyse the views and behaviors of Generation Z to forecast the future market. 
 
The findings of the study will benefit marketers interested in targeting young consumers from Generation Z online. 
The recommended approaches in this study can provide marketers a guideline to be noticed while creating or 
modifying a marketing plan to target young consumers in Malaysia. From the results, the modifications can be made 
based on the predictors like changing the design of the website or providing a slogan that will bring out the emotional 
feeling of buyers.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

online shopping intention. These subfactors are website quality (sig value = .000), utilitarian perceived value (sig 
value = .013), hedonic perceived value (sig value = .000), and product brand image (sig value = .034). Thus, H1b, 
H2a, H2b, and H3b were supported by the model. Website creditability and online customer reviews have a sig value 
that greater than 0.5. This shows that both subfactors are not related to online shopping intention. Therefore, H1a and 
H3a were not supported by the model.  
 
 
6. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
This study was conducted in Malaysia and focused on the current online consumer behavior of Generation Z. The 
main objective of this research is to determine the factors that will influence the online shopping intention of 
Generation Z in Malaysia. From the inferential analysis result, three of the independent variables of this study have a 
positive effect on online shopping intention. The related independent variables are website characteristics reflected by 
H1, an online perceived value reflected by H2, and product reputation reflected by H3. Besides that, the correlation 
analysis had shown that all independent variables are highly correlated to the online shopping intention. The general 
objective can be supported by three specific research objectives which had mentioned in the introduction of the 
research. 
 
The data analysis result had provided evidence to accept the H1 which stated that website characteristics have a 
positive and significant relationship with the online shopping intention of Generation Z. Thus, a website with good 
characteristics can increase the online shopping intention of Generation Z. Among the subfactors of website 
characteristics, website quality is the only one which significant to online shopping intention. Thus, the model rejects 
hypothesis H1a and accepted hypothesis H1b. It can conclude that marketers should put more effort on the design of 
the website and its customer services, rather than focus on website creditability, in order to increase online shopping 
intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. 
 
The results show that there are a significance and positive relationship between online perceived value and online 
shopping intention. Generation Z in Malaysia will intent to purchase a product or service to fulfil their goals and 
objectives. Marketers can attract Generation Z by fulfilling their perceive value through advertising, product 
packaging, promotion, and social responsibility activities. In this study, online perceived value has two subfactors, 
which is utilitarian and hedonic perceived value. The results of the data analysis show that utilitarian and hedonic 
perceived value are significance to the online shopping intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. This suggests that 
during online shopping, Generation Z in Malaysia will look for the products and services that bring utilitarian value 
or emotional value or both. Product reputation has a positive and significant relationship with online shopping 
intention. Therefore, a good brand reputation will increase the purchase intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. From 
the research finding in Chapter 4, the impact of online customer review on online shopping intention is not significant. 
Generation Z in Malaysia would not consider review and rating as a reference that affects their online shopping 
intention. Furthermore, the model stated that product brand image has a positive and significant relationship with 
online shopping intention. In Malaysia, Generation Z tends to buy a product that has a good image. A good image can 
be built through CSR activities, after-sale services, and other activities.

Abstract 
There are several traditional boat building industries in East Java, Indonesia. However, the performance of 
these industries has not been measured yet. We aim to measure and boast the performance of traditional boat 
building industries using Six Sigma. The results showed that the existing performance measured by sigma 
value is 2.84. There are some critical factors to quality such as: the error of cutting, crack due to assembly, 
and crack due to burning for wood bending. Analyzing the potential causes by fishbone diagram and ranking 
it by risk priority number values, we propose some improvements such as: developing facilities of 
automatic machines, sorting material at the time of purchasing, creating training program for burning and 
assembly, and brainstorming with some experts especially in wood bending.

1. Introduction
Traditional boat building has been widely spread in East Java, Indonesia. Ministry of Research, Technology, and
Higher Education has planned Surabaya city and three regencies such as Lamongan, Tuban, and Gresik as a cluster 
of boat building in East Java (Praharsi et al, 2018). There are several traditional shipyards in those areas. However, 
the performance measurement of these traditional shipyards has not been conducted yet. 
There are some literatures related to performance measurement. Garza-Reyes et al. (2016) found that the lean six 
sigma framework improves the capability of ship loading process and commercial time for more than 30% and cost 
savings in the range of $300,000 USD per year. Cherrafi et al (2017) built a framework consists of five stages and 
sixteen steps to integrate and implement green, lean, six sigma to improve company performances. Ridwan and 
Noche (2018) measured the port performance using the sigma value, the process capability indices, and the cost of 
poor quality. Zu et al (2011) examined the implementation of Total Quality Management and Six Sigma practices at 
companies in China. The results showed that there were no significant differences of implementing Total Quality 
Management and Six Sigma practices in terms of company size, industry, ownership, and process type.  
This study is motivated by their initiatives. We aim to measure the performance of traditional shipyard in East 
Java by using Six Sigma. Six sigma is a statistical technique focused on eliminating defects and reducing process 
variability. There are some stages in implementing Six Sigma, such as define, measure, analyze, improvement, and 
control. Define stage identifies what product or process will be repaired or what resources will be needed in project 
implementation. In this stage, the critical to quality from repaired product or process is determined. Measurement 
stage is used to identify process capability or the performance of production process. Indicator used in this stage is 
defect per unit. Analyze stage explores the reason why deviation between plan and action happened and identifies 
possible root causes of the problem. Improvement stage identifies, implements, and validates corrective actions to 
resolve any problem. Finally, control stage supports and maintains the action of improvement stage, so the process 
will not step back to its previous state. It is expected that we can boost the performance of traditional boat building 
industry by implementing Six Sigma.

burning training on labors, so the proposal that can be given is to take part in a burning training program 
for labors. This training program aims to standardize the ability or knowledge of the labors both beginner, 
medium, and expert in combustion process. The training program can be in the form of seminars, 
certifications, and knowledge sharing together with experts in boat assembly. 
4. 
Conclusion and Implications 
 
We have implemented six sigma measured the performance of traditional boat building industry in East Java, 
Indonesia. The existing performance shows the sigma value of 2.84. It was found that there were 3 CTQ, such 
as: the error of cutting, crack due to assembly, and crack due to burning for wood bending. These main 
problems were analyzed using fishbone diagram. The results showed that the potential causes of cutting error 
are no record of cutting size and traditional cutting measurement method. Meanwhile, the potential causes of 
assembly crack are lack quality of the supporting material used and no wood assembly training yet. Finally, the 
potential causes of combustion crack are no calculation of slope measurement for wood bending and no 
combustion training yet. Several improvements are proposed ranked by RPN values such as: developing 
facilities of automatic machines, sorting material at the time of purchasing, creating training program for 
burning and assembly, and brainstorming with some experts. We expect that in control stage, the proposed 
improvement are monitored and evaluated so that the boat building industry performance can be boasted 
through six sigma.

Abstract 
The construction industry is deemed to be one of the most flourishing industries in Egypt. It greatly contributes to 
the national GDP and represents one of the leading sectors in the Egyptian economy recorded at a reasonable growth 
rate recently. Throughout the history of work in mega projects, particularly in the petroleum, chemical industries and 
power plants, it has been noticed that erroneous technical, managerial and ethical behavior of personnel is dominant 
in the Egyptian work environment, which to a great extent affect passively the performance indices and success of 
the construction projects. Therefore, the aim of this research work is to introduce a model that describes the influ-
ence of ethical aspects on a number of selected performance indices used to measure the success of construction 
projects in Egypt. To this end, questionnaire surveys and interviews were used as data collection means. The 
questionnaire contained 185 questions covering 24 independent variables. The independent variables were selected 
to cover a number of critical technical, managerial and ethical issues that take place during the subsequent stages of 
large construction projects. In this research, only results concerning the influence of ethical aspects are presented. A 
number of statistical analysis tools were presented, using non-parametric analysis techniques and a number of 
regression models were developed to evaluate the project performance During both the planning and implementation 
phases. The study has detected three dependent performance indices that have been correlated with three ethical in-
dependent aspects.

Abstract 
For any organization aiming to achieve sustainable quality culture of operational excellence, it is 
important to ensure that a proper foundation for a company-wide quality (CWQ) culture exits. This 
foundation is a comprehensive company-wide management system (CWMS) which can serve as an 
infrastructure for improving and controlling the different operation systems of any organization. The 
CWMS mainly draws on five MSs, strategic management, initiative management, daily management, 
process management and performance management. It ensures the proper alignment of all people and 
processes, the optimization of resources and sustainability of high performance. For any organization to 
succeed in meeting high-quality standards, the existence of quality culture is essential and this requires 
time and commitment. One key enabler of that is the CWMS and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Methodology. 
This paper will explain how their proper implementation will sustain the quality culture and enable it to 
spread and take over. This paper follows a theoretical review of literature combined with the authors’ own 
experience to discuss CWMS, sustainable quality culture and the LSS culture-related aspects.  
Keywords 
Company-wide quality (CWQ) culture, management system (MS), Company-Wide Management System (CWMS), 
continuous improvement (CI) and Lean Six Sigma (LSS). 
1. Introduction
One of the key factors to success for any organization is the existence of a company-wide quality (CWQ) culture 
which serves as a foundation for operational excellence. It is based on a Company-Wide Management System 
(CWMS) which is a comprehensive MS that has a key goal of achieving alignment across the whole business. The 
CWMS incorporates continuous improvement (CI) methodologies and draws on management disciplines, such as: 
strategic management, initiative management, performance management, daily management and process 
management. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a CI methodology that is well known and well proven. In its turn, it can serve 
a key enabler for enhancing the CWQ culture. This cultural aspect will be discussed further in this paper. 
        The effectiveness of LSS and its success are directly dependent on the type of culture which is dominant in an 
organization. Even if the best improvement methodologies are used, various studies reported many cases of failure 
(e.g., Devane, 2004; Bhasin and Burcher, 2006, Gunasekaran, 2006).  
       LSS is focused on introducing improvement which is directly linked with change that requires a supportive 
structure of technical change leadership as well as behavioral change leadership. The next three sections, i.e., section 
2, 3 and 4, include a general introduction to CWMS, CWQ and LSS. These topics provide a basis for the discussion 
to follow later on the CWQ culture, foundation for LSS and the LSS methodology itself as an enabler for that culture 
in its turn. 
2. CWMS
The ultimate target of QM is to setup a MS and a culture, which ensure organization-wide quality (Mellat-Parasat 
and Digman, 2007). CWMS is a comprehensive MS that encompasses all aspects of management, with QM being as 
a core component since it does affect all aspects of managing and improving a business.

     In its turn, LSS can enable a CWQ culture to become engrained in the DNA of any organization by promoting 
various cultural aspects and fostering the right attitude through many practices of LSS methodology. 
 
 CWQ culture is a culture of alignment for people and projects to the strategic objectives. Various aspects 
of this culture were discussed to demonstrate the comprehensiveness of this culture and its benefits to any 
organization. 
 
 Finally, it is suggested to perform a practical case study in the future, which can be used to verify and 
quantify the LSS impact on CWQ culture. KPIs can be selected and monitored to be used in the benchmarking 
process and in the comparison of the standing prior and after the implementation. Like many methodologies, for 
LSS to prevail, it has to be implemented properly. The increase in global competition and the fast advancements in 
technology make it more decisive for organizations to seek successful implementation of LSS. This requires further 
evolution of LSS including effective training and international certification standards to shape a more robust and 
innovative CWQ culture. More effort is needed in the future to explore this critical area and more LSS practitioners 
need to share their lessons learned, in failure and success.

Abstract 
The majority of Lean Six Sigma corporate initiatives fail to yield the desired results: many are struggling 
in turning Lean Six Sigma into a success, citing lack of leadership, changing business focus, internal 
resistance and availability of resources as the main impeding factors. While a lot of focus is usually put on 
on the technical side of Lean Six Sigma, the Leadership and cultural impact are often an afterthought, 
causing failure down the line. 
The aim of this doctoral research was to assess the impact of organizational leadership on the deployment 
of Lean Six Sigma in organisations and thereby develop a dependency model to facilitate its successful 
implementation. A mixed-methods approach, using survey and semi-structured interviews, was adopted.  
Building on the existing literature, this research extended and helped refine our understanding of Lean Six 
Sigma and leadership, identifying the traits a leader needs to display to increase the chances of successful 
deployment: these traits, although not all completely new in the literature, are organized in a novel way, 
spanning across different Leadership styles articulated in the literature. A new Leadership style was 
suggested as the most conducive to Lean Six Sigma deployments. Its traits are as follows: 
●
Visible
●
Excellent communicator
●
Inspirational
●
Three R’s (Roles, Responsibilities, Relations) clearly defined
●
Consistent
●
Targeted
●
Building a philosophy, a way of working
●
Leading by example
●
Flexible
●
Three C’s (Connection, Competence, Character)
The research also showed that the more service-centred the sector and the smaller the company, the greater 
the need for strong leadership to successfully implement Lean Six Sigma, leading to a Leadership 
dependency model, into which the leadership traits outlined above were integrated.  
The leadership dependency model shows how smaller service organizations are particularly dependent on 
leadership to be visible, inspirational and the ability of its leaders to connect with employees; while larger 
manufacturing organizations rely more on leadership being targeted, flexible, and capable of building a 
philosophy of working around Lean Six Sigma. This would help organizations about to embark on a Lean 
Six Sigma deployment journey to determine where to invest more resources, either on up-skilling their 
Leadership team or on more stable processes.

Abstract 
Cancer is one of leading cause of death in developed countries. While the establishment brags that more 
cancer patients survive than ever before, the horrific side effects inflicted by conventional therapy often 
leave patients partially or severely debilitated, and set the stage for deadly secondary diseases. For those 
people suffering from cancer the dangerous mix of chemotherapy and surgery not only failed to cure the 
cancer, but destroyed their remaining quality of life. The laser treatment has the potential to destroy 
primary breast tumors. This unique treatment can also seek and destroy cancer cells that have spread 
(metastasized) from the original tumor to other parts of the body. This is especially critical as 
metastasized cells are the primary cause of cancer death. A laser beam operating in the near-infrared 
frequency of light heats tissue to a depth of several centimeters, allowing the beam to penetrate directly 
into a solid tumor with minimal damage to normal tissue because it can be focused directly through intact 
skin, no surgical incision is required. 
In recent years there has been much progress in the use of optical diagnostics Methods in the detection & 
diagnosis of breast cancer. Early diagnosis of breast cancer affords early intervention and greatest chance 
to cure. Laser induced Fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF); Synchronous Luminescence (SL) Spectroscopy 
and Raman spectroscopy are some of the technique used to detect the cancer in early stage.  In our 
diagnostic studies, we used the technique of Raman scattering. Raman spectroscopy is based on the 
interaction of photons with the target material producing a highly detailed biochemical ‘fingerprints’ of 
the sample. It can be appreciated that such a sensitive biochemical detection system could confer 
diagnostic benefit in a clinical setting. Raman spectroscopy has been successfully used as a key for the 
detection & diagnosis of breast cancer.  Raman spectroscopy could confer a great to a patient with early, 
rapid and accurate diagnosis. This technique is almost labour free without the need for sample 
preparation. It could reduce the need for whole pathological specimen examination, in theatre it could 
help to determine margin status, and finally peripheral blood diagnosis may be an achievable target.

Abstract 
Optimization of the delivery processes of different facets of human dwelling has been enhanced by 
technological innovations in recent times. One of such is the application of Cyber-physical systems 
(CPSs). This has been widely applied to different fields of human endeavors and the benefits accrued 
from such applications are quite enormous. The construction industry has been noted to be on the back 
foot of adopting such innovations despite the overwhelming usefulness. This study assessed the 
application of CPSs in the construction industry and having a comparative review with the application 
with other selected industries aided by the review of literature. Its potential benefits in different industries 
were discussed, and measures for its adoption in the construction industry were highlighted.

1.0 Introduction 
Cyber physical systems (CPS) can be referred to as mechanisms that function on the premise of the integration of 
computation and physical processes. It is deployed with the monitoring of computer-based algorithms fused with the 
internet. It serves as the link between physical and virtual world. Some scholars have referred to it as ‘realization 
technology’ (Kim and Kumar, 2013).  As described by National Science Foundation (2013), ‘CPS are systems 
where physical and software components are deeply intertwined, each operating on different spatial and temporal 
scales, exhibiting multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interacting with each other in a myriad of ways 
that change with context’. Adaptation, intelligence and responsiveness are attained through the shared knowledge 
and information between the physical process and the computational decision components of CPS (Leitao et al., 
2015). This is achieved with the embedment of computers and network monitors which ultimately control the 
physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. More often, 
the cyber and physical components of such systems are independently built. 
The working process of CPSs is often taken as that of embedded systems, however, there is a clear distinction 
between both systems. In CPSs, there is a large percentage of the physical component when compared with 
embedded systems (Wu and Li, 2011). Also, the computational element is the main focus in embedded systems 
whereas the nexus between the physical and computational components is significant in CPSs. The network of 
interaction between input and output is a core feature of CPSs unlike embedded systems which are more of 
standalone devices.

hindered the industry from benefitting from the enormous gains of the application of CPSs in its processes. 
Although recent studies have shown that there are great promises for the industry. In comparison to other industries, 
the construction industry is still lagging far behind in terms of the applicability of CPSs to its processes. 
Collaborative efforts among stakeholders will help spur the ease of acceptance. The teaching of modern 
technological innovations in construction processes should be encouraged in tertiary institutions. This would aid in 
the phasing process from classroom teachings to on-field practical experience. Workshops and symposiums should 
be regularly organized by professional bodies in the construction circle for educating professionals on recent 
technological innovations so as keep stakeholders abreast of developmental drives emanating from revolutionary 
world of digitalization. Modeling of intended facilities through virtual models and progress monitoring coupled with 
resource monitoring are some of the potential benefits of the application of CPSs in construction processes.

Abstract 
The main problem facing the construction industry in Iraq is the absence of proper management techniques during the 
project execution stages. Over the past decade, a new concept, known as Building Information Modelling (BIM), has 
been rising and developing as a new construction management tool in the AEC industry. Building Information 
Modelling is considered as modern technological advancement and referred to as a new revolutionary tool in the 
construction industry, due to its platform of collaborative working techniques and its growing computer software 
which can be involved among all the project tasks to increase the level of performance during the project life cycle as 
well as reduce the project’s complexities and conflicts. BIM has many benefits that play a significant role in the project 
execution such as visualisation of the project by creating 3D models, reduce the project’s cost, duration, and many 
other benefits will be investigated through this research paper. Recently, BIM is used and implemented in most of the 
developed countries such as the USA, UK, and EU, where it became an essential part of the construction projects to 
achieve the planned and anticipated project delivery. As of today, BIM is not applied in the Iraqi Architecture, 
Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry and the companies are struggling in its implementation. Therefore, the 
purpose of this research is to explore the process of BIM adoption in the small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in the 
Iraqi construction sector. The validity for selecting SMEs comes from the fact that 80% of the projects executed by 
these companies do not involve the use of BIM, in addition to their limited knowledge about the subject. Moreover, 
to achieve the research aim and objectives a mixed method of data collection was adopted and consists of 
questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with experts in Iraqi construction companies with different specialities 
such as architecture, engineers, construction projects managers, etc. out of 90 participants in the questionnaire 38

Abstract 
The implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has significantly increased in the last few years in 
Morocco. However, it has been noticed from the literature that construction companies in Morocco face barriers which 
limit the full implementation of this technology. One of these barriers has been identified to be the lack of BIM courses 
within the higher education system, since is essential for AEC students to get a clear and deep understanding of this 
process and technology in order to meet the industry’s requirements. Currently, there is an increasing request to 
embrace BIM within the educational system in Morocco either for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in order 
to supply students with the required knowledge and skills to be able to work within a BIM environment. Therefore, 
the aim of this research is to explore the status of BIM in the Moroccan higher education and to identify the main 
barriers which limit its implementation in the Moroccan higher education. To achieve the aim of this research, a mixed 
method approach has been adopted.  Furthermore, the researchers highlights some recommendations which will aid 
the implementation of BIM within the higher education system in Morocco.

technology, training lecturers on new software and technology/overcoming the resistance to change, and getting 
people to understand the potential and the value of BIM over traditional methods.  
 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations  
 
The aim of this paper was to explore the current situation of BIM within the higher education system in Morocco. 
From the data collected using a mix method approach, it has emerged that the status of BIM in Morocco universities 
is at the very early stage. This has been justified by the participants by claiming that BIM is not required to be used in 
Moroccan construction firms, therefore there is no need to confuse students with an advanced technology such as 
BIM. Moreover, other limitations emerged from the data collection, such as lack of BIM materials, lack of experience 
among lecturers and high cost of training for BIM.  
On the other hand, the participants have proposed few recommendations to overcome these barriers and will help in 
the integration of BIM in Moroccan universities. One of the recommendations were based on mandating an obligatory 
use of BIM, as in the UK, which will consequently lead the industry and universities to embrace this technology. In 
addition, they have recommended training lecturers on new software and technology despite its high cost, since the 
availability of a BIM course will bring the attention of a higher number of students which will lead to a higher return 
on investment. Finally, the participants emphasized on the important role of the government in spreading BIM 
awareness between organizations and universities, as well as providing materials and textbooks in both Arabic and 
French, since these are the two official languages in Morocco.

Abstract 
A large number of international academic institutions offering engineering programs have successfully 
gone through the accreditation process over the past decade. However, many more programs in the Middle 
East and the Far East are actively working to prepare for accreditation in the coming years. Texas A&M 
University at Qatar has been one of such academic institutions in the Middle East that all its engineering 
programs became accredited over a decade ago.   
This paper outlines the process developed and implemented by the institution and its engineering programs 
to get ready for the initial review and successfully institutionalized the lessons learned throughout the years. 
The article also discusses the challenges normally faced at the early stage and the training required to engage 
the faculty and staff for a successful visit fully.

1. Introduction
Academic programs normally go through a periodic review process to ensure they meet some educational 
standards set forth by an entity.  This review process is often called accreditation and carried out by a 
governmental office or a designated organization. As stated, accreditation is conducted periodically to 
935","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Dubai, UAE, March 10-12, 2020 
© IEOM Society International 
To better prepare for the accreditation, the College trained one faculty member for each program, and the 
process was further supervised by a faculty with an extensive background in accreditation.  The College-
wide coordinator responsible for accreditation has conducted monthly meetings to review and discuss the 
latest guidelines annually provided by the ABET headquarters.  Each program has been recommended to 
identify courses that could be mapped to student outcomes.  Each student outcomes recommended to be 
measured, and its level of attainment be documented at least every two years or with short frequencies.  All 
programs have regularly and consistently met with their Industry Board of Advisors and constituencies at 
least once a year and reviewed and revisited the Program’s Educational Objectives (PEOs) at least every 
two years.   
 
All programs have developed and documented robust student career advising, which has been enriched by 
a frequent presentation by the members of the Industry Board, alumni, and potential employers. Those 
faculty members whose primary teaching interests are within-subject areas addressed by the course selected 
for accreditation serve as members of that course committee and are responsible for developing a rubric to 
measure and assess the collected data.  At each monthly meeting, the progress achieved by the members of 
the accreditation committee is discussed and evaluated. All courses taught and delivered at the Qatar 
campus are in English, and faculty, staff, and students are all fluent in two or more languages. 
 
Texas A&M University at Qatar faculty members are actively encouraged to attend conferences through a 
well-structured process that annually provides funds to attend technical workshops and to present scientific 
articles at international conferences relevant to their research and teaching interests. This policy ensures 
that all faculty members stay current in their field and deliver the latest knowledge and development in their 
fields to students. Furthermore, Texas A&M University at Qatar academic facility includes more than 
700,000 square feet of instructional facilities, which house academic classrooms and over fifty states of the 
art laboratories equipped with over $100 M equipment. 
 
The school’s academic policy encourages programs to annually prepare and update their self-studies, which 
in turn significantly reduces the magnitude of the work often required to prepare for a program review. All 
faculty participate in the preparation of the program self-study and well trained on the accreditation 
requirements. 
 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Many engineering programs outside of the United States have embraced academic accreditation as a means 
to maintain and monitor the quality of their programs and continually keep their curriculum compatible 
with similar programs in western universities. Although the general perception to prepare for accreditation 
review often implies the faculty must invest a significant amount of time, however, the approach taken by 
Texas A&M University at Qatar which briefly presented in this article has proven that proper faculty 
familiarization with the process and annual documentation of program’s progress will provide an effective 
and robust approach in program readiness for such visit.

Abstract 
Engineering curricula in the US, in general, contain several courses with primary focus on writing and 
communications to assist engineering students in developing better writing, established branch campuses, 
these needs become further felt as for a large majority of these students the English is the secondary 
language and acquiring college degrees in their homeland often prevents them from being exposed to the 
English-speaking people daily. Although most of the students admitted to the program earn respectable 
scores in the standards test such as the ACT or SAT, building and strengthening their English 
communications is often paramount.   
This paper describes the process incorporated in the petroleum engineering curriculum at Texas A&M 
University at Qatar campus to develop and maintain students’ competency in English communications

1. Introduction
The State of Qatar is an independent country, which is about 11,586 sq. km. Qatar is a peninsula in the Middle East 
that is surrounded by Persian Gulf water with a population of 2.6M reported in 2017 by the World Bank.  Natives 
make only about 10% of the total population, and the rest are expatriates who have taken residence over the past four 
decades. Qatar has the highest income per capita in the world and has become one of the most developed countries in 
939","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

the Middle East since 1993. Although the official language of the country is Arabic, the English language is 
predominately used as a medium of communication by financial and non-governmental agencies. As part of its vision 
2030, Qatar has invited six US universities to establish their international campuses in Qatar Foundation's newly 
designated location, Education City, since 2000.  These universities include Texas A&M University, Cornell 
University, Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, Georgetown University, and Virginia 
Commonwealth University.  Texas A&M University campus in Qatar was established in 2003 and since awarded 
engineering degrees to over 1,100 in four disciplines including Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, 
Mechanical Engineering, and Petroleum Engineering. All degree programs offered at the Qatar campus are identical 
to the main campus in College Station and English is the medium of communication the inside and the outside of 
campus. Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) has widely been recognized in the Middle East for producing 
engineering graduates with exceptional technical competence and exceptional communication skills. 
 
Although all programs offered in Doha significantly emphasize mastering communication skills, one salient feature 
of the Petroleum Engineering curriculum at Texas A&M University in Qatar is its one-credit hour technical 
presentation course, which is required to complete the degree program (Retnanto et al. 2018). For this course (this 
course is not a replacement for a capstone design course required by the curriculum), all students are required to work 
individually and deliver industry-based projects of a petroleum engineering problem. In addition to a required 
comprehensive written report, an end of the semester presentation to sponsors, faculty members, and classmates is 
needed as well. Students are assisted and coached on presentation skills. 
 
 
 
2. Organization of the Petroleum Engineering Communication Courses 
 
Undergraduate students in the Petroleum Engineering Program are required to complete all program, college, and 
University requirements before they can receive a B.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University. 
The university graduation requirements must have two writing-intensive courses within the major.  
 
Faculty of Petroleum Engineering in College Station has historically been emphasizing communications as skills that 
can be transformed by proper training and exposing students during their four-year course of undergraduate education.  
 
The main objective of the one-credit hour technical presentation course is to provide skills to conduct an independent 
study of a petroleum engineering problem and to synthesize results and draw appropriate conclusions from the study. 
The course provides skills to write technical papers and gives oral presentations in a professional setting. At the end 
of this course, students will be able to: 
1. Gather information, make calculations and analyze data to achieve the specific objectives of an independent 
study of a petroleum engineering problem 
2. Prepare an introduction for a paper/presentation, consisting of the problem statement, review of previous work 
presented in the literature, need for further study, and study objectives 
3. Prepare a methodology section for a paper/presentation, including tasks, data and methods employed, and 
assumptions made in the study 
4. Summarize the results of an independent study inappropriate textual, tabular and graphical forms, consistent 
with engineering and Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) presentation standards 
5. Prepare a discussion section for a paper/presentation, including analysis and interpretation of study results 
6. Draw appropriate conclusions from an independent study consistent with project objectives and properly 
supported by data, calculations, and analysis 
7. Identify limitations of the work and prepare recommendations for further work, if appropriate, supported by the 
evidence presented in the results and discussion of the study 
8. Identify the significance, potential benefits, and possible applications of the results and conclusions of your 
independent study 
9. Prepare a references section, consistent with the SPE style guide, listing all literature cited in a technical paper 
10. Write a title and abstract for a paper/presentation of an independent study consistent with SPE standards 
11. Prepare Microsoft PowerPoint slides and poster for an independent study that can be used in an oral presentation 
to persuade others that the study results, conclusions and recommendations are correct and useful 
940","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Dubai, UAE, March 10-12, 2020

12. Present the result of an independent study orally to a panel of practicing engineers from the petroleum industry 
and faculty members in 10 to 15 minutes, using PowerPoint slides 
 
Also, students are required to write a technical paper for the independent study consistent with the Society of 
Petroleum Engineering standards on a subject related to petroleum technology. All students need to prepare at least 
2,600 words that include an introduction for the paper consisting problem statement, review of previous work 
presented in the literature and study objectives, methodology and technical content for the paper on a subject related 
to petroleum technology, and discussion, conclusions, title, references, abstract for the paper. During the semester, 
students receive feedback on their writing progress through in-class workshops, peer review, written and oral 
comments from the instructor. 
 
Following that one-credit hour technical presentation course, senior students are required to participate in the annual 
petroleum engineering student paper contest, in which SPE-style presentations are judged by industry representatives 
(Retnanto and Parsaei 2017). The student paper contest has a long tradition at College Station, and we have 
incorporated the activity in our program largely unchanged, although only for senior students. Students are required 
to make a 15-minute presentation on a subject of their choice, commonly one involving an independent project or an 
undergraduate research project, although students may choose to speak on any petroleum engineering topic. Students 
are responsible for proposing the topic, conducting independent research, and preparing the presentation. Students 
improve presentation skills and write an accompanying technical report in the form of a Society of Petroleum 
Engineers paper. Students are encouraged in their junior year to begin an independent study of a petroleum engineering 
topic that they could later present in the student paper contest. 
 
The contest is a daylong event that now occurs at the beginning of the spring semester. Usually, two or more 
presentation sessions run concurrently, with each session judged by panels of three to five industry participants. 
Typically, 15-20 technical industry professionals take part during the day. The contest day begins with an orientation 
meeting of faculty session leaders and technical judges. Judges rank student achievement on 1-to-4 scale with 4 
indicating proficient or skillful ability and 1 indicating lack of ability according to the rubric. Judges may also write 
comments concerning individual presentations, which are read and saved by the program. Judges rank the first and 
second place winners for each session. 
 
Winners from senior student paper contest submitted their abstract in the Society of Petroleum Engineers regional 
student paper contest, a very significant event held annually in one of the GCC capitals. Winners of that regional 
contest, in turn, present at the SPE international student paper contest, which takes place during the SPE Annual 
Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE), the major event on upstream oil and gas, usually attended by more 
than 8,000 people. 
 
Strong financial support has been provided by industry to TAMUQ Petroleum Engineering for prize money and 
contest expenses, indicating their recognition of the value of the activity. Texas A&M at Qatar has been successful in 
the contest having had students 1st place in 2014 and 2015 SPE Middle East Regional student paper contest 
undergraduate division and competed at the 2014 and 2015 SPE International Student Paper Contest during the SPE 
ATCE in Amsterdam and Houston, respectively. Texas A&M at Qatar students rank the 2nd place in 2016, 2017 and 
2018 at the regional contest undergraduate division. 
 
 
 
3. Observations Made and Recommendations Received from the Course Audience 
 
Student outcome in communication (ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences) is assessed for both 
writing and communication skills. The student is assessed on their ability to express their ideas logically and 
systematically, and clear statements of the significance of topic, problem, and solution (as applicable), and conclusions 
were included. In student presentation skills, the assessment covers the ability to communicate effectively orally. That 
includes that speaker engaged audience, referred to graphic aids, had appropriate eye contact and speaking voice and 
speed, and was at ease; the presentation was within and not excessively under-allocated time. Also, visual aides were 
informative, supportive of presentation, well designed, had appropriate content, attractive, not excessively wordy, and 
in an appropriate number for the presentation. The student is required to highly competent use of the library, online,

ABSTRACT 
One of the financial technologies (FinTech) innovations used by 46% of the internet user in Indonesia is mobile 
payment, or m-payment. This quantitative research aims to examine the acceptance level of m-payment 
applications using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). An online questionnaire 
was distributed among 102 respondents and processed with the software IBM SPSS Statistics 25 using a multiple 
linear regression model. The result shows that independent variables such as performance expectancy, effort 
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, significantly influence behavioral intentions of m-
payment use.

1. Introduction
The development of internet technology in the last twenty years has undeniably brought many benefits to 
its users, both in terms of communication, information dissemination, lifestyle, and distribution of goods and 
services. In Indonesia, the percentage of internet users has reached 56% of the total 268.2 million population of 
Indonesia in 2019 (Katadata.co.id 2019). Mobile phones, especially smartphones, are arguably an important 
element that unites communication and entertainment functions (Abrahão, Moriguchi, & Andrade, 2016).

The test results show a significance value of 0.010, smaller than 0.05, so it can be concluded that H3 is 
acceptable. Although study by Khechine et al. (2014) prove that social influence does not significantly influence 
the interest in using technology, several similar studies, such as Oliveira et al. (2016) gave the same results as this 
study; that social influence significantly influences the intention to use. Another study by Mustaqim et al. (2018) 
also shows that only social influence factors that have a significant effect on the emergence of the intention to use 
e-commerce. In the end, someone can be motivated to try something because of the influence of the people around

H4: Facilitating conditions influence the user's behavioral intention towards the m-Payment use. 
 
The test results show a significance value of 0.001, smaller than 0.05, so it can be concluded that H4 is 
acceptable. The results contradict with Al-Qeisi et al. (2015) who studied the acceptance of internet banking 
technology in three middle eastern countries: Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The findings from Al-Qeisi's 
research prove that facilitating conditions do not significantly influence the interest in using the system. The same 
results were obtained in the study of Attuquayefio and Addo (2014) who studied the acceptance of information 
technology in elementary schools. However, research by Mustaqim et al. (2018) did not show the same results. 
These different results are probably caused by differences in the products that are the subject of research and the 
types of respondents chosen. Facilitating conditions have a significance influence on most studies. Someone will 
be more motivated to use technology that is easily accessible and has supporting facilities if they need help. 
Looking at the current condition of m-Payment and the results of this study, it can be concluded that the facilitating 
conditions indeed have a significant effect on the interest in using m-Payment. 
The results of the calculation of the coefficient of determination in Table 6 show that the Adusted R Square 
value of 0.696. This means that the independent variable is able to explain the dependent variable by 69.6%. While 
the remaining 30.4% can be explained by other variables not tested in this study.

Referring to Table 5, the regression equation is obtained as follows.

The regression equation explains that, for example if there is an increase in one unit of the PE variable and it is 
assumed other variables constant, then the Y value that reflects the intention in using m-Payment will increase by 
0.375. 
5. Conclusions 
The results of this study explain that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and 
facilitating conditions affect the users’ intention to use of m-payment. The results showed that the independent 
variables of UTAUT can be used to predict the users’ interest in using m-Payment by 69.9 percent, while the 
remaining 30.4 percent is explained by other variables that are not covered in this study. Therefore, the next 
research is expected to be able to test these variables. In addition, further research can also examine moderation 
variables, such as age, gender and voluntary use of m-payment. Another limitation is there is a large difference in 
the number of respondents who live in Jakarta with respondents from other regions, which reached 55%. In other 
words, the sample used has the possibility of not being fully representative. Further research is expected to cover 
more cities in Indonesia, since there are different conditions, such as the quality of internet connection or the 
purchasing power.

Abstract 
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) make-up 99.8% of all enterprises which comprises 57.4% of added 
value and 66.8% of employment within the European Union economy. In the age of the fourth industrial 
revolution, there will be an increasing competition among SMEs to operate efficiently, to hold on to their 
customers while capturing additional market share. 
Most of the SMEs leaders have difficulties to establish an overall strategy that is consistent and optimised 
due to a lack of time, methodology and/or knowledge. For instance, the leader may focused on the internal 
performance of the company at the expense of its customers’ expectations; or launching innovative 
products/services but neglecting its industrial strategy; or improving its operating profit without involving 
its stakeholders in the business development. 
This article explores how the assessment of the environment threats and opportunities may help SME leaders 
to formalize their strategic vision through the identification of the key strategic dimensions. It comprises 
three sections: (1) the notions of strategy, strategic dimensions and performance measurement system (PMS) 
are defined (2) the SME’s environment factors and their level of risks are evaluated, (3) the conceptual 
framework that identify the priority index of each strategic dimension is proposed.

1. Introduction
At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Small and Medium enterprises (SME) will compete fiercely to improve their 
efficiency while retaining the interests of their customers or new businesses. Unfortunately, many SME managers have 
difficulty in establishing a coherent and optimized overall strategy due to lack of time, methodology and / or know-
how (Gueguen 2010). For example, the leader can focus on the internal performance of the company at the expense of 
the expectations of its customers; or launch innovative products / services by neglecting its industrial strategy; or 
improve its operating result without involving its employees in the development of the company. In addition, they 
usually make their decision based on limited knowledge of the environment and may, in this case, subscribe to the new 
internally developed action plan or reuse past success strategies that do not match the opportunities or constraints 
market threats (Grant 2016). In the digital age, the rise of data analytics as a new source of knowledge can help leaders 
make decisions faster, shape their ability to cope with environmental change and mitigate risk decision-making 
(Merendino et al. 2018).

Abstract 
As the power of graphics processor unit (GPU) increases with multi-cores far more than CPUs to improve 
the speed of graphics-related computations, the unique characteristics of a GPU is very much suitable for 
massive parallel computing. Through data exchange and processing between CPU and GPU, the 
heterogeneous computing holds the promise of higher utilization of hardware platforms and thus more 
efficient computing than just the CPU computation alone. With the promising computing power, the 
operations research world could take heed of this new heterogeneous architecture for improving the 
computation of meta-heuristics especially for large optimization problems through the parallel computing 
platform called C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism (AMP). Developed by Microsoft and fully available 
in Visual Studio 2012, C++ AMP inherently takes advantage of GPU power and computing parallelism 
for computation. The aim of the research is therefore to investigate the impact of C++ AMP on data-
parallel matrix calculation for traditional NP-hard problems, namely Quadratic Assignment Problem 
(QAP), and compare small, medium and large size problem sets. The results indicate that C++ AMP is 
potentially valuable when it comes to computing large size problems and can become an important asset 
in OR researchers’ toolbox.

Abstract 
Outpatient appointment scheduling problems require predicting outpatients’ treatment or examination time 
more precisely to reduce patients’ waiting time and physicians’ idle time. As there are many characteristics 
of outpatients’ examinations, the treatment or examination time of each outpatient is varied and random. 
Thus, this research applies the data mining method to classify outpatient’s examination time of a case image 
center. The relevant one-year data of outpatients’ examination time are collected and preprocessed, such as 
the outpatients’ examination position, the examination time and the number of examination images, the 
examination performed by radiological technologists, the medical order issued by which department of 
physicians, etc. This study uses three kinds of classification methods, including decision tree methods (e.g., 
C4.5, CART, and CHAID), Logistic regression, and artificial neural network to train and verify data. The

Abstract 
Freight transportation practices accounted for a significant share of environmental degradation and climate 
change over the years. Therefore, environmentally responsible transport practices (ERTPs) become a 
serious concern of freight shippers and transport service providers. Past studies reported that a little 
attention is paid to assess the ERTPs of freight transport companies. This paper proposed a hierarchical 
framework consists of five ERTPs dimensions and thirty-three practices including four new practices. The 
transport firm selection is affected by multiple expert opinions, lack of information availability, decision-
making ambiguity, and background of experts. The evaluation of such decisions requires a multi-criteria 
decision-making (MCDM) method under group decision-making approach. This paper used an 
intuitionistic fuzzy set integrated analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP) and VIseKriterijumska 
Kompromisno Rangiranje (IF-VIKOR) method. The applicability of the proposed framework is validated 
with Indian freight transport industry. The importance weight of ERTPs are computed with the help of IF-
AHP method and performance of selected transport companies’ w.r.t. ERTPs are measured by IF-VIKOR. 
The result analysis shows that  environmental knowledge sharing among freight transport actors, quality of 
organizations human resource, collaborative green awareness training programs, promoting environmental 
awareness program for employees, and compliance of government transport emission law and practice have 
been ranked top five ERTPs which significantly contribute to the environmental sustainability of freight 
transport industry. The proposed framework is also ranked freight transport companies based on ERTPs. 
Two different sensitivity analysis approach are presented to check the model robustness. This research is 
expected to provide a reference to develop ERTPs in emerging economies freight transport industry and 
contribute to the development of sustainable freight transport system.

Abstract 
In a hospital’s daily operations, outpatient nurse scheduling is usually a key non-clinical procedure 
because a successful scheduling ensures worker satisfaction and the quality of nursing care, and may well 
keep HR costs under control. Unlike other scheduling problems in a hospital, the outpatient nurse 
scheduling problem (NSP) is a niche problem because the schedule must be determined based on the 
demands of the physicians of the outpatient department (i.e., according to the ‘mother schedule’). In 
general, the set of criteria that are established for the outpatient NSP are two-fold: intra-mural and extra-
mural. The intra-mural criteria include the aforementioned demand defined by the ‘mother schedule’, as 
well as the relevant regulations of the hospital, the preferences of the decision-makers, and even the 
customs or culture of the hospital. The extra-mural criteria usually include, for example, environmental 
factors (e.g., the location of the hospital) and legal requirements. Among these factors, some are relatively 
fixed and some are subject to change, but a change in a previously fixed factor (e.g., the labour law) 
usually alters the scheduling decision problem intrinsically.  
In this paper, possible effects on the outpatient NSP resulting from changes in the law were examined 
based on the case of a real hospital located in southern Taiwan. This hospital used to apply a previous 
binary goal programming (P-BGP) model that was proposed by Wang, Hsieh, Zhuang and Ou in 2014 as 
a decision support for the outpatient NSP. However, the new labour law of Taiwan (where the hospital is 
located) that was unveiled and enforced in the last few years has imposed a stricter condition on the 
number of working hours that a nurse can work in a day and thus prohibited a nurse (whether full-time or 
part-time) from attending three due shifts on any weekday. With only two shifts a day allowed for each 
nurse under the new law settings, the P-BGP model obtained no feasible solution to fulfill all of the 
scheduling demands with the nursing staff resources available (including the staff size of 31 and the ratio 
of full-time/part-time nurses of 21/10). As the current nursing staff is no longer sufficient for the required 
nursing needs, the effects of the new law on hospital management are evident.

Abstract 
Transportation has become sector dominantly consuming fossil fuels and causes air pollution. The solution is 
either using natural fuels that are also environmentally friendly or replacing the engine by electric motor. This 
paper presents modeling and developing a prototype of city car scale electric vehicle employing Brushless DC 
(BLDC) Motor as a prime mover. A 1000 W, 48 V BLDC Motor is used and expected to provide a torsion of 
30 – 50 Nm. The chassis is constructed using Aluminum Chassis Frame, which is lighter yet more rigid. The 
body of vehicle is designed to have coefficient of drag (cd) of 0.4 – 0.5 to reduce aerodynamic resistance. The 
energy is stored in a 48 V, 8.7 Ah Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery equipped with Battery Management System 
(BMS). A 48V 350W 17A controller is employed including IC MC33035 to drive a Mosfet to control the 
BLDC Motor speed. Together with BMS, this controller determines the most proper power consumption for 
the required speed and torsion. The weight of vehicle including the driver will determine the maximum speed 
of vehicle. The test drive demonstrated the maximum speed of 53.3 km/hour. This development may be further 
enhanced for building a real electric city car.

1. Introduction
The intensive use of fossil fuel has caused significant reduction of its deposit to a critical level. If the trend of
this use continues then the deposit is predicted to last in the coming tens of year. The reserve of fossil fuel and its 
depletion was calculated resulting in the prediction that the deposit of oil, coal dan gas will be depleted approximately 
in 35, 107, 37 years, respectively (Shafiee and Topal 2009). The environmental effects of fossil fuel use is another 
great concern worldwide (Kakaras, Koumanakos, and Doukelis 2012). Transportation sector seems to be the one 
responsible for the both problems. In one hand this sector consumes much fuel causing considerable fuel deposit 
reduction, and, on the other hand, this implies pollution problem. It would be a dilemma, while transportation sector 
is required by people, yet it may lead to some drawbacks. Looking for answers on how transportation system is 
operated using resources other than fossil fuel that concurrently implies minimum environmental problems would be 
the best option in this situation (Trappey et al. 2012).  
Alternative energy is currently considered as one of the sources that may be used for some purposes including 
for transportation system. This would be one of the efforts to replace (or reduce) the intensive use of fossil fuel. 
However, the development of system and scheme to produce alternative energy sources seems to be stagnant. The 
attempt of producing alternative energy is placed in the context of global decarbonization. Carbon emissions have 
reached unmanageable level at the global scale and directing energy policy by increasing efficiency and/or using 
environmentally friendly energy would be the primary strategy to minimize these emissions (Garrett-Peltier 2017). 
This concern therefore leads to fossil fuel divestment as a way to shift the policy focusing on environmental aspects 
(Healy and Barry 2017). Another concern of alternative energy production is the feedstock of its production that 
should not disrupt the food reserve. It is also identified that the feedstock of alternative energy production takes major 
portion of its production cost and finding the best feedstocks is important to assure low production cost and production 
continuity. For some type of alternative energy, the production cost is not economically feasible (Atabani et al. 2012). 
Electrical energy is expected to be the most feasible type of energy for different use, including transportation 
system (Shaukat et al. 2018). This is based on the characteristic of this energy, where it is easy to generate using 
different type of energy, and it is extensively suitable for different use. The use of electrical energy for transportation

Some frictions that may take place in the vehicle will also need to be minimized. The production process of the 
vehicle has followed the design and it is expected that the internal and external frictions and resistant are as expected. 
However, there are still some unforeseen situations that may contribute the difference between the design and the real 
system. Some improvements are still required to have the system demonstrating better performance with minimum 
energy consumption.  
5. Conclusion 
Design and development of electric vehicle powered by BLDC motor have been carried out. These include the 
chassis, body, and controller. The prime mover of BLDC motor is commercially available and this is used for the 
developed system. The materials for the vehicle are selected so that these may be easily obtained but may provide 
good characteristic of the vehicle. The vehicle is produced by strictly following the design therefore resulting in 
minimum different between the estimated characteristics with the actual performances. The system has been tested 
proofing the capability of achieving some distance with minimum energy consumption. This will be the opportunity 
for further extensive application. Some improvements are still necessary in the design stage and production based on 
the feedbacks from the test drive.

Abstract 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Agenda 2030, entitled “Transforming our World” has 
tabled aspirations for urgent action on climate change.  COP 24, held in 2018 in Poland, wants greater 
urgency of action from all countries in managing carbon emissions. Human activity is the prime contributor 
to generating carbon emissions, primarily from electrical power generation from coal, oil and gas and 
transport driven by carbon based liquid fuels.   South Africa has an abundance of coal. South African 
electricity generation is historically embedded in thermal coal power generation, owning and operating 
large power stations of typical capacities of 6 x 600 MW turbo-generators. Most recently, South African is 
busy adding another 12 X 800 MW super-critical turbo-generators. South African imports all its crude oil 
and natural gas. These are used extensively in transportation of persons and goods. The South African 
economy is totally based on the carbon economy.  Reducing the dependence on coal and liquid fuels will 
impact jobs and the economy.  The interdependencies are complex.  The paper presents the status of South 
Africa’s contributions to carbon emissions and the country’s aspirations as committed at COP 24.  The key 
performance indicators for the transition period of 2020 to 2050 are considered.  The paper concludes with 
a research proposal for developing strategies and quality standards of measurement and management in 
moving South Africa’s transition away from a carbon based economy over the next three decades.

INTRODUCTION 
South Africa has a diverse nation with a population of 57.7 million [1]. South Africa is a significant industrial and 
economic power and has the largest economy in Southern Africa. It has a well-developed mining, transport, energy, 
manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, commercial timber and pulp production and service sectors[3][2]. Various factors 
influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in SA. Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of seven gases that have direct 
effects on climate change: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).  
The South African economy is a carbon based economy; electricity generation is powered by coal and transport is 
powered by liquid fuels extracted from imported crude oil [4].   South Africa has experienced a seven-fold increase in 
fossil-fuel CO2 emissions since 1950, with 80-90% of emissions from coal.

Conclusion 
 
 The complexity of climate change requires a multifaceted approach. The proposed quality standard to be developed 
will need to be internationally acceptable, be standardized in data collection, analysis, measurement and reporting and 
have measurable impacts on national economic growth, risks and risk management strategies. Climate change is 
equivalent to poverty; it is man-made and it is only man with conditioned behavioral practices that could charter a 
new course for the environment. The exercise of measuring and reporting is to manage downwards GHG emissions 
from human activity of industrialization.

Abstract 
The Efficiency and Quality in Manufacturing Business are some of the key differentiators between 
competing entities in the business environment and the marketplace. Therefore, improving Efficiency and 
quality of means of production or services standards is the one of the main obstacle confronting South 
African’s Small-Medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as other firms globally.  Lean Approach techniques 
and methodologies are efficiency and process management Systems adapted largely from Toyota 
Production System (TPS). . Lean Approach is a gradual transformation overall work environment. 
Generally, Lean Approach is regarded as a set of tools to aid detection and Eradication of wastes in the 
process system. 7S Lean Methodology which could be applied by any scope organizations is derived from 
five Japanese lean 5s methodology; Sort, set in order, Shine, standardise and sustain, extended by Safety as 
well as Spirit in the recent years. This Methodology aids organisation in work environment for effectiveness 
and reduction hindrances in processes also enhances quality standards as well as throughput, through 
scrutinizing a prearranged work environment. This paper intents to evaluate prior investigations findings 
regarding values realised on implementation of 5S, as well as the extended 6s and 7s application and ability 
to improve efficiency in organisations for enhanced organisational performance. To assemble theoretical 
analysis various pertinent to the study objective narratives, articles and papers domestically and globally 
have been referred to.  The outcomes illustrate that Lean 5s Methodology as well as the extended 6s and 7s 
Lean Methodology is an effective system to enhance of organisational performance, irrespective of 
organization scope. Therefore, 7S Lean Methodology would soundly aid the goals and purposes of 
organization to a realise sustained enhancement in organizational performance and throughput

INTRODUCTION
Small-Medium enterprises (SMEs) companies need to be sustainable and productive in order to thrive and contribute 
significantly towards the South African economy by creating jobs and eradicating unemployment. To be sustainable 
and productive, SMEs companies need to adopt efficiency improvement systems. Efficient World-class operations 
make use of continuous improvement strategies and efficiency improvements methods to stay relevant and compete 
in the ever-changing business environment. Most World class Companies also started as small enterprises who me 
efforts to learn, adopt and improve via different efficiency improvement systems. This study focuses on 7S lean 
framework for Packaging and fulfilment SME Company, Packaging and fulfilment is the process of designing, 
evaluating, and producing packages [1]. [1] Further States that the efficiency of SMEs in packaging and fulfilment is 
the ability to use various lean techniques such as flowcharts; brainstorming; benchmarking and 5W2H (what, when, 
who, where, why, how, how much). This includes generation of products eliminating waste, ineffective time and 
unnecessary energy use in the business [1].

IV CONCLUSION. 
 
With ever increasingly evolving business environment, intensified awareness and concerns of work environmental 
issues has prompted organisations to use various efficiency improvement tools. From the prior read publication works 
it is clear that one of the lean methodology tools does have significant positive impacts on organisations performance 
when effectively implemented.  By understanding the results of the lean 5s and 6s in clear that the new Lean 7S 
Methodology can have positive outcome the organisation performance. 
 
It is noticeable that the goal of 7S function is broad and diverse. When successfully applied, the work environment 
improves reduce waste in different forms, organize work areas, promotes hygiene as well as team cohesion, the 
complete gains of 7S cannot be envisioned in firms, if the obstructions related, completely understood, addressed and 
removed. The lean 7s methodology has become the base for any lean method to be applied.7S methodology is a 
continuous improvement tool and should be constantly monitored and evaluated.

Abstract 
The present study aims to analyze the inter-linkages between the essential enablers of total quality management 
applicable in Indian engineering educational institutes. The implementation of TQM in engineering institutes can be 
used as a means to improve the quality, academic and research performance, students’ satisfaction level, employees’ 
morale, etc. In this research paper, twelve enablers of TQM implementation in engineering institutes have been 
identified using the literature review and expert opinion from academicians. In this study an ISM based 
methodology has been used to understand the relationship among these enablers. This helped in identifying the 
power level of each enabler which can facilitate in taking appropriate action so to enhance the overall standard of 
engineering education. Additionally a MICMAC analysis has also been used to examine the driving power and 
dependence power of identified enablers. The results show that the top two enablers such as ‘Vision of Institute’ and 
‘Top Management Commitment’ are having high driving power and low dependence power, thus these two should 
be given additional consideration for better improvement of education level.

1. Introduction
India is currently, one of the major engineer makers in the world. In the worldwide education commerce India seizes 
a significant place. India has one of the largest set-ups of engineering institutions in the world. On the other hand, 
there are still a large number of possibilities for further development in the engineering education system. Also, the 
plan of the Indian government is to increase its present gross enrolment proportion to 30 percent by 2020, which will 
enhance the standard of education institutes. The quality of assistance in engineering institutes is positioned in the 
approachability, discussion and associations that be present among teachers and students.  In present competition 
situation engineering institutes faces many challenges to given better education under budgetary limitations. 
Unhappy students and low morale of employees are stated as the major challenges in the engineering institutes. 
Feigenbaum (1994) believes that ‘Quality in Education’ is the important key aspect of the development of global 
competitive education.  In order to attain quality in education, the engineering institutes must adopt changes in their 
education system. In such a global challenges situation, TQM looks like to be one of the prominent techniques to 
improve not only the quality of education, but also satisfied all the employees, students and funders. Total Quality 
management in education has varying perspectives and orientations that we can relate to the conceptualization, 
measurement and control. 
In this paper, ISM (Interpretive Structural Modeling) is used to formulate the structural model of TQM enablers for 
improving the quality of education. In ISM, a set of different and directly connected enablers of concern are ordered 
into a methodical hierarchical model known as a structural model (Warfield, 1974; Sage, 1977). ISM is an 
authoritative tool to formulate link structural model. Mental models are generally unclear when there are many 
numbers of enablers and it becomes complicated to understand the inter-linkages between these enablers. ISM gives 
an apparent understanding of all the enablers and their affiliation with other enablers. Application of ISM 
methodology to examine systems and problems in various fields is well documented in literature as shown in Table

Abstract 
A bone abnormality is a medical condition which is caused by physical damage or diseases. There are many factors 
which can  lead to various abnormalities. An irregularity in a bone is generally diagnosed by orthopedician and 
radiologists using x-ray images of the affected bone. Bone abnormalities affect more than a billion people in the 
world. With more than 30 million emergency visits annually, there is a lack of expertise. Although computer aided 
diagnosis is still very limited in the world. They are mostly confined to research projects and there’s been no real 
world applications. For the past few years there has been a great leap in the development of Artificial Intelligence 
which now makes it possible to implement and test deep learning models in the medical field. One can get an 
appropriate amount of data for these implementations. MURA is a database that was made available by Stanford 
University for testing purposes in a target of achieving a best model for detecting bone abnormalities. Our 
paper mainly focuses on the advancement in medical imaging technologies targeting the diagnosis at the level of 
experts for improving health care access. We used python, as a programming tool, and fastai, to process images and 
implement the model for abnormality detection. The proposed model follows a feed forward network resulting in a 
good accuracy rate.

6. Conclusion 
 
We have able to achieve a kappa score of 0.674 with an accuracy of 0.84. It doesn't seem a lot but a lot of improvements 
can be brought to the model with further increase in the number of layers and change in hyperparameters. We can see 
that it's possible to build the models of deep learning in the field of health, and in particular in radiology. There has 
been a great outcome from the model and it shows promise in helping radiologists diagnose diseases present in x-ray 
images better. It would be possible to build a much better model if we have enough expertise in the specific field. 
Having expertise in the field helps us understand the features much better and thus selection of hyper parameters much 
easier. It also helps in optimizing the images and better augmentation of data in initial phases.  
  
  
  
 
We can also hear from some of the machine learning experts that it’s completely possible to replace the radiologist if 
we can build a model that can predict with more accuracy, but the truth is far from that. It’s really impossible to replace 
radiologists but we can surely say that we can see the use of Artificial Intelligence in every corner of the field. Recent 
developments such as portable ultrasound machines will help further to push the AI into the field Radiology. As 
precision is increasing along with the decrease in the price of GPUs we can expect the need for automation more than 
ever. When computation becomes more affordable and available we can expect many more algorithms that could teach

itself while radiologists can judge the accuracy of it. Thus the model will get better just by working more. The main 
challenge that will be faced is with data. Data available on the internet, with proper labels, is very limited. Some 
models may have the requirement of thousands to millions of images to get the target accuracy. The other issues 
include the cost of error. As most of the models are dealing with very sensitive information the wrong prediction may 
result in severe outcomes. There will be resistance even from doctors as well as hospitals, we need to convince them 
that AI algorithms can work. All in all, with an increase in research in this field we can definitely say that AI will 
revolutionize the field of radiology in the long run. I also see the pace of research can be much accelerated if we can 
get a hand from radiologists too. So, it is one of those things which we need to keep forefront.

Abstract 
In this paper we used solid transportation problem to analyze the cost of raw materials which are used for road and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bridge works in PWD, West Bengal. We all are aware of the classical Transportation Problem Which involves only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two components - supply and demand where a homogenous product is transported from various sources to different
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
destinations in such a way that total transportation cost is minimum. But in real life situation mode of transportation
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
plays an important role on transportation cost. From the practical point of view, an increase in transportation cost
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may also increase the selling price of commodity. So, keeping this in mind we can give our effort to slash down total
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
transportation cost which in turn may reduce the selling price. That is why the mode of transportations is taken into
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
the account in transportation problem and this causes the emergence of concept of solid transportation. Solid
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transportation problem (STP) involves three components – supply, demand and capacity of conveyance. Here the
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transportation cost is optimized by delivering a homogeneous commodity from various sources to different
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
destinations in different conveyances. If there are m number of origins, n number of destinations and p number of
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
conveyances, then for classical TP, no of feasible solutions is m+n-1, whereas for STP, number of feasible solutions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is m+n+p-2. For making the problem generalized we have collected the data from PWD, Government of West
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bengal. They published a Rate book which includes different types of rates for different material which are used for

1. Introduction 
 
The major components for classical TP are sources and destinations whereas those for STP are sources, destinations 
and conveyances which are defined as follows. 
Source: The place or origin from where the commodities are transported is called the source for e.g. warehouse. 
Destination: The place to which the commodities are to be transported is called destination.

can be applied on any balanced STP with a finite number of sources, destinations and conveyances to determine
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
minimum transportation cost while transporting a homogeneous commodity from various sources to different
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
destinations through different modes of conveyances.

Abstract 
Variability in clinical assessments is a long-standing issue affecting the efficiency of care delivery, cost, 
and resource utilization. Despite its importance, so far, only limited research has been conducted to 
identify potential causes and contributory factors of variation in clinical assessments. This study, 
therefore, aims to provide background on variation in clinical assessments and evaluates why they 
occur. Moreover, potential solutions and challenges associated with variations are discussed. The results 
suggest that creating effective standardized systems that identify and mitigate root causes of variations 
may optimize resource utilization and service delivery without compromising patient care.

1. Introduction
Clinical assessment variation is defined in healthcare practice as “patients with similar diagnoses, prognoses and 
demographic status receive different levels of care depending on when, where and by whom they are treated, 
despite agreed and documented evidence of best practice” (Kennedy et al., 2010). There is a high degree of 
variability in medical practice among physicians that may have an impact on the service quality and costs. 
While evaluating the differences in a physician's practice is challenging, it is also suggested in the literature that 
understanding the clinical practice variation may lead to a reduction in healthcare costs and enhance healthcare 
outcomes (Van Parys, 2016). Therefore, hospitals and other healthcare organizations aim to continuously 
measure and control the level of variation in their entity and act according to where variation is challenging for 
quality.  
Clinical variation is quite common in healthcare systems. For example, a study finds that 30% to 40% of 
patients in the US receive clinical care that is inconsistent with the guidelines. Besides, the study shows that 
patients receive clinical care that are not relevant to their cases resulting in 20% to 25% of errors or unnecessary 
care (Taichman et al., 2009). It should be added that clinical assessment variation is not only present in the 
diagnosis of patients, but also in the average consultation time of patients with their physicians, which is simply 
defined as the time that physicians and patients spend together. A comprehensive study, which describes the 
average primary care physician consultation length in 67 countries, covers over 28 million consultation length

4. Conclusion 
 
This study aims to identify causes and contributory factors to the variations in clinical assessments. The paper 
evaluates this significant challenge in healthcare by understanding the nature of the problem and its potential 
causes. As highlighted throughout the paper, unwarranted variations may have an impact on optimal resource 
use, patient care and costs. Reducing this type of variation requires better knowledge of all the primary factors 
that are summarised in this study. Future research can zoom in each factor and identify all potential root causes 
in a systematic way in which industrial engineering tools can be implemented, such as lean and system 
modelling techniques. Such tools and methods can help identify sources of variations to optimize resource 
utilization and implement evidence-based practices in healthcare. Though this study is mainly based on the 
literature review covering this topic, further study can elaborate on the findings in an existing healthcare setting. 
Such a study can gather qualitative and quantitative data together to make insightful suggestions and develop 
better tools for variation reduction to optimize resource utilization and service delivery.

Abstract 
In this research, a distribution network that trucks transport various products including perishable foods from some 
suppliers to some stores are considered. In this distribution network, there are multiple cross docking centers. Cross 
docking is a logistic management strategy in which products delivered by inbound trucks from suppliers are 
immediately loaded to outbound trucks to stores in same day. Because products are not stored for a long term in cross 
docking center, cross docking center can save operation cost, reduce inventory space, shorten delivery lead time from 
supplier to store and avoid loss of sales opportunities due to deterioration of food etc. A distribution network that has 
multiple cross docking centers is called the cross docking network. This research considers effective truck 
transportation among cross docking centers in cross docking network. The main difference from the previous truck 
scheduling paper of cross docking network is that this research selects truck type considering temperature control zone 
(Normal, Chilled and Frozen) of the products to be transported. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) 
with an objective function which is to minimize total transportation cost among cross docking centers. And this 
research decides truck type, truck size, destination, quantity of loaded product and departure time to cross docking 
center. We show numerical experiment results using real data transported among cross docking centers and discuss 
the difference between the current and proposed transportation.

Optimal Periodic Preventive-Maintenance Policy For A 
System Where Its Failure/Repair Follows The Non-
Homogeneous Pure Birth Process

Abstract 
A periodic preventive maintenance policy is considered for a deteriorating repairable system. On each 
failure the system is repaired, at periodic times iT (i = 1, 2, … N−1) the system is preventively maintained 
(PM) to improve its reliability performance, and at the time NT the system is replaced. The failure/repair 
process between two PMs follows the Non-Homogeneous Pure Birth Process (NHPBP) which is a 
generalized version of the Non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). The reliability improvement made 
by a PM action is stochastically modeled based on the properties of NHPBP. The cost for each PM is 
variable reflected the reliability condition of the system at that PM time. The PM policy are characterized 
by the two parameters (N, T), optimal (N*, T*) which minimize the long-run expected cost rate of a 
replacement cycle are derived and calculated based on a two-stage optimization procedure, and detailed 
properties of (N*, T*) are investigated and observed through numerical examples. Because the PM model in 
this study is developed based on a new type of failure/repair process (NHPBP) instead of the conventional 
minimal repair process (NHPP), the current work would suggest a new research direction in the study of 
PM.

Abstract 
The study aimed at having a review of the adoption of digital technologies in the South African 
construction industry with particular emphasis on the awareness of the various digital technological 
innovations, their applicability at the different stages of construction processes and the extent of usage at 
the different stages was equally considered. The research area for the study is Gauteng Province, South 
Africa, while quantitative approach was deployed with the aid of questionnaire survey. Respondents for 
the study are construction professionals comprising of Architects, Quantity Surveyors, Builders and 
Engineers. Analysis was carried out with appropriate statistical tools. Findings from the study revealed 
that Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensors are the digital technologies mostly deployed in construction 
processes, while generally there is a low adoption of digital technologies for construction projects. 
Equally revealed is that the design/engineering phase has the highest level of awareness and usage of 
digital technologies among the different phases of construction projects. Conclusively, the study 
emphasized the need for the adoption of digital technology at all the phases of construction projects as the 
potential benefits to be accrued are immense.

1.0 Introduction 
There have been calls for the improvement on the delivery processes in construction activities. Perennial issues like 
cost overrun, delays, poor quality delivery, health and safety issues, underperforming projects have continued to 
plague the construction industry (Sultan and Kajewski, 2013; Fischer, 2009; Flyvbjerg et al., 2003; Mustapha et al, 
2013). The construction industry is an ideal candidate for a step change due to its reoccurring problems like lack of 
certainty (in terms of quality, delivery date or cost), relatively poor productivity in comparison with other sectors, 
inadequate client satisfaction and inefficiencies as a result of out of date processes (Kamara et al., 2010). There have 
been spirited efforts to abate these problems posed to the construction industry over the years, yet the issues still 
persist. Taking into cognizance the need to improve on construction processes and delivery as well as the 
importance of the industry to the economy of any nation, there is an urgent need to adopt a redirection of the 
methods and ways of carrying out activities in the industry. One of such steps is the incorporation of digital 
technology in the processes of construction activities. 
There has been an upsurge in the adoption and application of digital technology to processes like industrial systems 
and basic human activities in recent times. Industries such as manufacturing, banking, health and medicals have all 
embraced multidimensional approaches to the adoption of digital technology while the construction industry is still 
on the back foot (McKinsey, 2016). Some of the challenges posed to the construction industry are a resultant of its 
inflexible nature in embracing new methods and technological innovations. The construction industry can attain 
efficiency, effectiveness and creating a window of opportunities through the adoption of digital technologies 
(Building Radar, 2015). Digital transformation such as adopting new digital technologies can make the global 
construction industry save approximately $1.7 billion yearly (Sutton, 2018). According to a report on digitization by 
McKinsey (2016), the construction industry is ranked 21st out of 22 industries regarding digital technologies 
adoption. Simu (2016) asserted that the reputation of the construction industry about cost and time overrun can be 
improved if digital technologies are adopted. Hampson et al. (2014) opined that the construction industry compared

Abstract 
Despite advances in computer hardware and software capabilities, the expense of running experiments in computer 
models of a complex industrial equipment is still a relevant issue. To minimize it, experiments must be statistically 
designed and critical variables identified using appropriate analysis methods. In the study presented here, several easy-
to-implement yet effective data analysis methods were used for identifying the variables that must be measured with 
more accurate devices and methods to estimate the energy efficiency of a billets reheating furnace. A furnace’s 
simulator was used to perform the experiments and results analysis shows that oxygen percentage in the combustion 
gases, fuel flow in the burners, and combustion air temperature are critical variables for quantifying furnace’s energy 
efficiency.

1. Introduction
Computer models are increasingly used for maximizing processes’ efficiency and products’ quality (reliability, 
durability, performance, robustness, etc.) in a faster, and cheaper way at the design and manufacturing stages. In fact, 
they allow running experiments which could hardly be possible to perform otherwise, namely when the product or 
process does not physically exist, the experimentation is time-consuming, too expensive, difficult, risky or even 
dangerous to be performed. The spectrum of applications ranges from nano (molecular simulations) to mega scale 
(structural analysis of buildings and bridges) in various science fields, namely in chemistry, toxicology and 
pharmaceutics, materials, electronics and communication, biotechnology, aeronautics, and so on (Garud et al., 2017).  
Despite advances in computer hardware and software capabilities, the expense of running experiments in computer 
models is still a relevant issue. Single evaluations of stress, thermal, and impact/crash analyses can take hours to days, 
if not longer. To overtake this inconvenient or hindrance, an alternative has been to run experiments in meta‐models 
or “models of the models”. Simulated or computer experiments are becoming increasingly prevalent surrogates for

To validate the data analysis, a confirmatory experience was performed using the computer model and an efficiency 
value equal to 57.8% was obtained. This result confirms that a rigorous measurement of the three aforementioned 
variables to adequately quantify the energy efficiency of the furnace under study is required. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
As the trend in technology favors a shorter product development cycle and a quicker reaction to market opportunities, 
shorter-duration non-sequential experiments will become more popular in engineering. However, practitioners 
(engineers, researchers, …) cannot ignore that valid and practical conclusions drawn from experimental studies depend 
to a large extent on the way how the data were collected. To try out many settings of an input variable in a ""what if"" 
scenario or testing many variables simultaneously in an unstructured way to achieve a specified objective are 
counterproductive practices. To appropriately plan and run statistically designed experiments is a more structured, 
faster, cheaper, and reliable practice for that purpose at the systems design and manufacturing stages.  
 
The operation and the energy efficiency maximization of systems supported on user’s empirical knowledge is an 
unsustainable practice. Thus, even when it is not possible to perform experiments in industrial environment, due to 
technical, economic, lack of resources, or other reasons, running statistically designed experiments in a computer model 
and analyzing the results with tested and validated methods is an efficient approach for maximizing the systems 
performance. 
 
This study shows that fractional factorial designs and easy-to-implement methods for screening are alternatives to more 
sophisticated approaches for designing and analyzing results from computer models. Al-Shiha and Yang’s, Dong’s, and 
Benski’s methods are structurally different, efficient, and easy-to-implement in Excel by those who are not experts in 
statics and computation. Moreover, they can supplement or replace the popular Half-normal probability plot. In this 
case study, all the analysis methods lead to the same conclusion so one can assume their result confidently. 
 
In this study a computer model of a billets reheating furnace was used, and it was possible to conclude, only with 16 
out of 64 experiments, that the percentage of O2 in the combustion gases (v2) is the variable with the greatest influence 
on the furnace’s energy efficiency. Its effect is 2.5 times higher than that of fuel flow in the burners (v1) and 6 times 
higher than that of combustion air temperature (v3). The monitoring and measurement as accurate as possible of the 
v2 value is determinant in the furnace’s energy efficiency evaluation, but a similar approach is required to variables 
v1 and v3. Results analysis provides evidence that v2 and v1 should be set at the low level, while v3 should be set at 
the high level. All the other variables must be set at low level. For future work, it is suggested further studies to identify 
the optimal value for v1, v2 and v3. To validate the presented results to other furnace zones is also recommended.

Abstract 
This research objective was to identify conflict resolution methods in South Africa's lifecycle of 
construction projects. The information was gathered through a questionnaire distributed to South African-
based construction professionals. Ninety-one (91) questionnaires were obtained from one hundred and 
twenty (120) questionnaires sent out, with a response rate of 76 percent. Research findings were analyzed 
in the form of the Kruskal-Wallis test using a descriptive and non-parametric test. The findings showed 
little relevance. This study's results draw a conclusion to cooperation and compromise as prevalent 
approaches to conflict management in construction projects.The research recommends adopting 
collaboration and compromising as a conflict resolving approaches

Conflict, Dispute, Construction Industry,  Project and Professionals 
1. Introduction
The construction industry is a complicated and competitive environment in which members with distinct opinions and 
expertise levels of the building process come together to work together, each has its own objectives during the building 
members from distinct professions, and each professional wants to make the most of their advantages. The more 
respondents with distinct cultural backgrounds engaged in the building value chain, the more vulnerable are 
arguments, whether contractual or social, which lead to conflicts in the construction phase (Kumaraswamy & 
Yogeswaran, 1998). The distinctions between conflict and dispute between construction professionals are confusing. 
The two terms have been used interchangeably, particularly in the construction sector (Acharya et al., 2006). Conflict 
and dispute are two separate notes, according to Fenn et al. (1997). Conflict occurs as a consequence of concern being 
irreconcilable. Thus, which implies conflict can be managed, potentially to the extent that the dispute that results from 
the conflict is not allowed to occur. Whereby conflicts are the outcome of the dispute that contributes to the project 
being completed unsuccessfully. Disputes are linked to problems such as mediation, arbitration of negotiations and 
others Soeharto (2001), noted that, with limited resources, the project could be a momentary activity that takes place 
within a specified period. Conflicts in construction influence many stakeholders ' interests in connection with 
significant investments; they decrease profits and are therefore very costly and unprofitable (Awakul & Ogunlana 
2002). However, investors are increasingly dissatisfied with the legal methods of constructive dispute resolution 
(Stipanowich & Matthews, 1997). As a result, the current confrontational culture often determines a reduction in 
labour efficiency and an increase in production expenditures (Ng et al. 2002). Lastly, Yiu and Cheung (2006) stated 
that conflicts in the construction industry sometimes seem inevitable due to powerful differences of concern among 
construction project participants. The views of Yiu and Cheung (2006) in the construction industry sometimes seem 
inevitable as a result of differences of concern between construction project participants. Due to the inherent nature 
of conflicts in building projects, it is hard to build a cooperative atmosphere during the construction stage (Fenn et al. 
1997). Likewise, Gudiene et al (2013) argues that there is no standard for evaluating success as a result of the 
uniqueness of the individual projects. On the other hand, each and every project management team can understand the 
project's course and the current circumstances. 
Several authors like Fenn et al (1997), Ambrose and Tucker (1999), Harmon (2003), Ankrah and Langford (2005) 
have one thing in common: conflict is an inevitable by-product of organizational operations in a project setting. This

Abstract 
In recent years, the growth of Internet has reached many organizations. Web sites become an avenue for 
companies to widen their market and reduce facility cost. This calls for the need to develop websites that 
are more user-friendly, especially for government-operated sites where a large portion of the population is 
required to be a user. A case study on the Professional Regulation Commission: Licensure Examination 
and Registration Information System (PRC: LERIS) was conducted. The Single Usability Metric (SUM) 
was used to encapsulate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction score of the said web site. Primarily, 
this paper presents a framework containing design factors seeking to address different design issues. This 
paper aims to improve the SUM by implementing the improvements on the design factors. A new design 
was developed to compare the SUM with the existing website. The increase in the sigma level indicated the 
evidence of effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Background of the Study
It is undeniable that rapid development of the Internet has a significant effect on different organizations. In relation to 
this, companies of any size and type are using web sites for their transactions (Barnes and Vidgen 2000; Bell and Tang 
1998). Web sites are great aid for companies to widen their market and minimize the facility cost. Consumers also 
benefit significantly in using such sites, as much as with organizations. It helps them access vast collections of 
information in the World Wide Web (Liddle et al. 2003). The emergent of digital age does not only transforms the 
way of doing business which includes web services but also the expectations of customers. Thus, it is important to 
continuously evaluate and improve such services. In relation to this, Wang and Senecal (2016) discussed that usability 
is an essential construct in assessing websites. Therefore, it is imperative for web designers to consider usability as an 
indicator for a successful design (Kaur, Kaur, and Kaur 2018). Having said that, this paper established design factors 
to be considered in designing a website. Agreeing to this, Guo et al. (2016) stated that website design has a significant 
influence to user satisfaction.  
This paper conducted a usability testing on the registration process of certain website to uncover design issues. The 
website considered is government-operated to regulate professionals or individuals required of board examinations. 
There are several issues encountered by the users. Among these are undistinguishable buttons, ambiguous label’s 
captions, confusing textbox positioning, and numerous graphics resulting to disorderly layout. The design factors are 
based on these issues which include (1) Command Buttons, (2) Entry Fields, and (3) Graphics. Through literature 
review of these factors, the framework of this study was developed.  
The system studied is a website of Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) to accommodate the board examinees, 
board passers, and all individuals required of any board exam. LERIS stands for Licensure Examination and 
Registration Information System which is an improvement of the former PRC website. PRC: LERIS is a website 
comprising of various online service such as Exam Application, Initial Registration, Renewal of License, and

5. Conclusion 
The formulated hypotheses concerning the command buttons, entry fields, and graphics were evidenced through 
comparison between the SUM of Design 0 and 1. The improved value of SUM verified the usefulness of the 
established framework, specifically the design factors. Most of the metrics increased from Design 0 to 1 except task 
completion rate. Despite this, the improvement on other metrics greatly affected the SUM which significantly 
increased from 2.05 to 2.50. This denotes that researchers and web designers can use this study as a basis in achieving 
a successful website design.  
6. Recommendation 
Given the contributions of this study, the design was still not able to reach the 3-sigma level. It is necessary to conduct 
further study on the site and uncover opportunities for improvement. Other area of exploration can be on 
implementation of the design factors in different website which can strongly justify the effectiveness of the framework. 
Further, the design must be further iterated to achieve a higher SUM reaching up to 6-sigma level. In relation to this, 
a more extensive review of literature must be done to uncover more design factors.

Abstract 
With the rise of the digital age, people are increasingly exposed to the visual environment such as online 
websites that commonly contain usability issues. This study established a framework for improving the 
usability of an online birth certificate application website as measured through the Single Usability Metric 
(SUM), with completion rate, error rate, satisfaction, and task times as usability metrics. This is done by 
incorporating the concepts and guidelines provided by the design factors such as page layout, user’s 
workload, and lists. Usability testing was conducted to gather quantitative information for measuring the 
usability metrics, which were standardized to obtain the SUM of the current design. The design factors 
were then analyzed and improvements were applied to develop a new design. A follow-up usability 
testing for the new design was conducted and results showed that the SUM increased from 1-sigma to 3-
sigma level. The framework consisting of the design factors on web design development is deemed 
effective in improving the usability of a website.

1. Background of the Study
The advent of the internet caused a massive disruption to business models and processes across different industries. 
Along with this is the emergence of the digital platforms that impacts the Industrial Engineering role in technology-
based ecosystems with implications in the society and the economy (Zutshi and Grilo 2019). This increasing 
prominence of virtual surroundings poses a complex adaptive challenge to the users as they navigate online. Stokols 
(2018) explained that the influence of cyber sphere is evident in the design of work environments and understanding 
how people respond to and modify their surroundings requires explicit consideration. 
With the digital age, manual tasks are transitioned into online applications, which require cognitive demands. This 
study looked at the considerations in website design to improve its usability. Several studies provide guidelines and 
recommendations to improve the user experience in websites. Quinones and Rusu (2017) conducted an exhaustive 
review of 73 studies related to usability heuristics for specific domains and methodologies of papers published from 
2006 to 2016. However, according to Alonso-Virgos et al. (2019) despite this a lot of websites still have big 
usability problems. They analysed the degree of compliance to the usability guidelines by web developers to 
determine which usability recommendations are often forgotten and which are important to the minds of the web 
developers. Most of the usability problems can actually be addressed by the guidelines found in literature. 
This research examined an E-government website (Philippine birth certificate online application) as the 
experimental stimuli. Based on initial user testing and user feedback, it was found out that the website contains 
many usability issues particularly on navigation, complexity, and clarity of the information being processed. The 
users generally struggled on using the website because of the difficulties in understanding the functions within the 
website since the ambiguous design deters the user’s supposedly smooth operation. The website is system-centered 
rather than user-centered, which motivated the study to enhance its usability. To improve its usability, a framework 
of design factors were established and studied to identify specific usability problems found in the website. The

The same procedure was done to standardize the usability metrics. There is an improvement in usability scores 
across all four usability metrics.  There is an increase in quality rate from 73% to 95% for completion, from 91% to 
99% for errors, and from 75% to 99% for the task times. The satisfaction scores of the users immensely increased 
from 18% to 99.76%. From 1 sigma, the new design development resulted to a process sigma of 3.

5. Conclusion 
 
The framework consisting of the design factors on web design development are deemed effective in improving the 
SUM score of the website. Based on the usability tests conducted, all the three hypotheses were proved to be true. 
The SUM of the birth certificate application website increased from 1-sigma to 3-sigma level. Improving from 1 to 
3-sigma would mean decreasing the percentage of defects by 62%. With a process sigma of 3, there will be 66,807 
defects per million or 6.7% percentage defects. In general, a sigma level of at least three is desirable for 
organizations.

6. Recommendation 
 
There are still opportunities to further improve the birth certificate website. It is recommended to develop design 
iterations until the target of six-sigma level is achieved. More research could be done to identify other improvement 
areas and consider other design factors not considered in this study. Moreover, the applications of the design factors 
to enhance other kinds of websites are recommended to further strengthen the evidence that support the results of 
this study.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to determine the best average cycle time for multi-
degree cyclic scheduling in a no-wait robotic cell producing identical parts using N-machines and one robot to 
perform handling operations. We make a conjecture that the best average cycle time is always produced by a k-degree 
cyclic schedule. The problem is NP-hard in nature and is solved using a brute-force method to obtain the exact 
solution. A numerical example is used to analyze the model and the proposal is validated through computational 
results obtained. The sensitivity analysis performed based on different parameters is used to obtain insights and 
implications of the model.

1. Introduction
The processing on the cyclic environment is gaining popularity due to its ease of handling and higher throughput 
rates in a flexible manufacturing environment. A cyclic schedule can be defined as a schedule that repeats itself at 
fixed intervals of time. These fixed intervals are called cycle times and it corresponds to each cycle of operations. 
The number of parts produced in each cycle depends on the degree of cyclic scheduling. 𝑘𝑘 parts enter and leave the 
robotic cell during a cycle in a k-degree cyclic schedule. The cycle time controls the throughput rate and hence we 
consider it as the object to be minimized in this paper. Minimum cycle time results in maximum throughput. For a 
k-degree cyclic schedule, {𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇1, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇2, … 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘} represents the inter-arrival time for the loading station. The average of
these times gives the average cycle time of the schedule. It can be defined as the mean time required in producing a
part in the robotic cell.
One of the important questions that arise in scheduling theory is about the existence of an optimal cyclic schedule. 
According to (Dawande et al, 2008), different infinitely-long schedules will have one optimal schedule if the input 
parameter values are integer based. The parameters such as the status of the robot, the position of the robot, and the 
status of each part being processed determine the state of a schedule. Since the number of machines and robots in a 
cell are finite, the number of states will be finite. A schedule can be generated by arranging these states sequentially. 
Similar states repeat itself during an infinite schedule. However, the occurrence of these repeated states can be 
segmented in case of an optimal schedule and a schedule can be obtained which can be repeated to obtain the same

From these observations it can be inferred that the degree of a cycle plays an important role in determining the 
average cycle time. Hence, this analysis concludes that, for a schedule with suitable input parameters, a multi degree 
cyclic schedule always gives relatively lower cycle time and higher production rate.  
7. Conclusion 
This paper gives a few new results for scheduling in a no-wait robotic cell. The results obtained are convincing and 
it justifies the proposal. Multi-degree cyclic schedules are very useful when it comes to the scheduling of robotic 
cells that operates for very long periods of time. The results give the optimal value of 𝑘𝑘, which is of high significance 
for industrial applications and has immense theoretical value. This paper proves that the best optimal cyclic schedule 
is obtained from a cyclic schedule with 𝑘𝑘≤(𝑁𝑁−1)!.  
For future research, the mathematical model can be extended to analyze whether the same proposition stands in the 
case of a robotic cells working on a different parts scenario. Also, studies can be performed to analyze the validity 
of the results in the case of robotic cells having N>4. Algorithms with lower time complexity can be developed to 
solve the model, which will make the model more productive in an industrial environment.

Abstract 
The Humanitarian Engineering Workshop is an initiative started by Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) in 
collaboration with University of Groningen Campus Fryslan, Globalization Studies Groningen, the Network on 
Humanitarian Action (NOHA) Groningen, and the Centre for Innovation / Leiden University since 2016. The 
workshop is conducted over a week in May each year, and so far, four successful workshops have been completed. 
Up until now, nearly 90 TAMUQ students have participated in these workshops.   The one-week experience is truly 
unique for TAMUQ engineering students who need to collaborate with graduate students enrolled in Groningen’s MA 
in Humanitarian Action from all over Europe, Asia and Latin America. The experience allowed our students to 
understand the many complications involved in reconstruction work in post crises. Students work in teams comprising 
people from different professional backgrounds, enforcing cooperative learning across disciplines. 
The workshop is designed to provide instruction from experts in the fields of humanitarian aid and innovation, 
sociology, socio-linguistics, politics, education, data analysis, engineering, sustainability and risk management, 
blockchain technology, and more. The primary modes of instruction involve open ended discussions, integrated 
learning, cooperative learning, and systems thinking. Students work together in groups with people from the various 
participating organizations in teams to work on their final rapid prototyping projects. 
Instructional topics in the workshop include: 
•
Principles of Humanitarian Action and Engineering
•
Professional Ethics in Engineering and Humanitarian Action.
•
Advanced Scenario Planning – Manoa Technique
•

Abstract 
In a quest to grab the market share of smartphones, manufacturing companies and partnered e-commerce 
sites are offering greater benefits on exchange products. This has severely increased the concern of returns 
management through better remanufacturing and disposal policy. Though we know a lot about demands of 
new products there is no guarantee about the quality and the quantity of the returned products. Spare parts 
requirement are also equally difficult to gauge with the technological advancement making the components 
obsolete within 2-3 years span. An effective remanufacturing policy could be replenishing a portion of 
spare parts inventory through the returns recovery. To reduce the production uncertainty and maintain 
optimal inventory levels we propose a two-step methodology. First we obtain a good forecast of the return 
quantity and spare parts requirement by comparing results obtained using Bayesian Estimation and 
Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Secondly, based on the return quality function, 
the production curve for the spare parts is determined. The study is concluded by presenting numerical 
cases to illustrate its usage.

Abstract 
When cities are growing in both size and complexity, the freight distribution and management make a 
significant challenge for transportation management. Freight transportation execution is one of the main 
sectors that is looked into when planning. The concept of city logistics explicitly tries to optimize the urban 
transport network and many optimization approaches have been introduced to optimize the vehicle routing 
methods considering several objectives. Since recent times, there is drawing attention for two-echelon 
freight consolidation modelling efforts with the emerging of megacities. This paper reviews the available 
literature under the city logistics modelling, and two-echelon freight consolidation for identifying the 
perspectives adhered. The study was conducted through a systematic review of literature using multiple 
studies published under the area of city logistic modeling and two-echelon-distribution modelling in 
thorough key word base search of city logistic modelling efforts, and performance parameters used for 
freight analysis within city networks from the findings. The review framework takes into account the 
diversity and complexity found in city logistics practices.  It was evident that there is a lack of modelling 
efforts in two-echelon vehicle routing for city logistic combining with optimization models for dealing with 
multiple objective and modeling uncertainty.

1. Introduction
City logistics is a major factor influenced by the economy of a country as the demand for goods transportation depend 
on the nature of economic and social activities. In developing economies, cities are growing in both size and 
complexities giving rise to the origination of Mega-cities. This will lead to continuous increase in demand for the 
transportation of goods. With this the local governments are putting the effort to planning the commercial 
transportation networks in order to minimize the traffic congestion, travel delays and the emissions from the vehicles. 
Most of the time planning and decision making are done by the freight operating companies and not usually by the 
public authorities. Nevertheless, less focus is given on the conditions of congestion, travel time and other uncertainties. 
(Crainic et al., 2004) stated that when organizations manage the distribution it is for the best efficiency of their 
commercial shippers and they do not consider its impact it may have for the city transportation in general. 
Freight transportation is one of the main sectors looked into in city logistics when planning but less attention is given 
to this as more focus has been given to general city routes planning. As delivery times are becoming crucial with the 
growing demands it is vital that the freight transportation is planned with minimum delays with short travel times. 
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the bottlenecks that inflate the logistic cost, simplify the process and reduce 
overall logistic costs. Several optimization approaches have been introduced to optimize the vehicle routing methods

5.  Conclusion 
This paper reviewed the literature available under two main areas. City logistics modelling and urban freight routing 
and optimization and identified the available approaches taken in terms of the modelling perspectives. It was found 
that there is a gap existing in modelling and optimizing using the multi objective and uncertainty for two-echelon city 
logistic modelling. Mostly the models and frameworks discussed here tries to link the end to supply chains and 
highlights the importance of integrating all the stakeholders in planning. but the attention to optimization of road 
network in two echelon vehicle routing under city logistics needs to be improved. Also on the other extreme there is 
optimization approaches looking to advanced freight distribution systems. However, there are many stages to be 
considered before these are fully employed and still there are challenges for a methodology in planning and building 
an operational model. It was identified that less attention has been given to modelling the effects of dynamic 
environments within a road network, variability of travel times and road capacity. The effect of different transportation 
scenarios will be further researched through a development of a simulation model.

Abstract 
In an airline, fleet-related assignment decisions are crucial to the overall airline profitability and these are 
being subjected to increasing complexities with time. Aircraft assignments are concerned with the 
allocation of a profitable aircraft to flights, given the constraints of airline fleet and flights the airline 
operates; the objective is to maximize airline profitability. A large range of constraints related to operations, 
passengers, airports etc. are to be satisfied in such an allocation. Initial fleeting decisions so made are often 
unable to complete as planned owing to the highly unpredictable, interdependent and regulated environment 
airlines operate in. Airlines almost never experience a day without disruptions, as observed in the research 
conducted. Fleet re-assignment aims at minimizing the cost of the disruption while ensuring operational 
continuity by using remaining resources and satisfying the additional constraints thus created. This study 
presents optimization models related to fleet assignment and re-assignment, adapted from Operations 
Research literature with their applicability analyzed, constraints considered and performance evaluated. 
The review brings up the need to address specific operational constraints of airlines; especially those of 
medium scale, taking aircraft seating configurations and specifics into consideration in the models to 
enhance practicality, in addition to accommodating real needs of airlines such as handling parallel 
disruptions.

1. Introduction
The operations of an airline have high fixed costs while the industry reflects many externalities and dependencies 
(such as oil prices and security concerns). The demand is not very volatile and the supply is constrained in many 
airlines. The industry operates by selling flights using aircraft that are leased in the long term, the utilization of which 
may not be optimal due to the many externalities involved. Planning and operational processes of such an industry 
entail many constraints and uncertainties. Concepts related to operations research and optimization are therefore, of 
interest to the industry. One of the most important resources an airline handles is identified to be its fleet, good 
management of which decides the profitability of the airline to a great extent. 
Initial fleet assignment decisions concern the generation of a set of routes the airline chooses to operate and deciding 
on the frequency of operation so as to maximize profit, based on factors like traffic estimates, revenue as origin-
destination pairs subject to aircraft characteristics, operations costs and some operating restrictions. This decision is 
followed by the assignment of departure times and a profitable aircraft type to each flight, given the set of aircraft and 
operational routes of the airline. This deals with the aircraft types, each having different capacities, equipment

4. Conclusion 
 
This paper serves as a guide to identifying logical and defined models available in the areas of aircraft assignment and 
re-assignment, systematically. Aircraft assignments allocate profitable aircraft to flights, with the constraints of the 
airline fleet and flights that the airline operates and the objective of maximizing airline profitability. Additional 
constraints related to operations, passengers, airports etc. are to be satisfied. Initial aircraft assignments often get 
disrupted owing to the industrial environment of the airline business. Fleet re-assignment, therefore concerns 
minimizing the cost of the disruption while ensuring operational continuity using remaining resources and satisfying 
the additional constraints created. Many optimization models have been proposed in relation to fleet assignment and 
re-assignment, and are found to have a great level of applicability in the industrial context. The constraints considered 
by them and their performance are being challenged, given the computational abilities of software being developed. 
The study systematically reviews current literature and identifies the available models in terms of the constraints, 
functions and performance for airline disruption management and consequent aircraft reassignment problem.

Abstract 
Nowadays, many firms try to delight their customers by reducing the time between customer order and the 
time of delivery. Due to this reason, cross-docking has become an interesting logistics strategy in supply 
chains. In this process, arrival and the departure of cargo will be taken place on the same day. This study 
has been carried out to identify the processes involved in cross-docking, its benefits, complexities of 
implementing a cross-docking system and the factors to consider when implementing a cross-docking 
system. A comprehensive literature review has been conducted along with expert reviews based on 
interviews in order to address the identified research gap. The previous studies were analyzed to select the 
studies that have studied the implementation of cross-docks and the significant factors of a cross-docking 
operation. Then, a full-text review was conducted to identify the factors that are necessary to consider when 
implementing a cross-docking system in a warehouse. Based on the literature, cross-dock shapes that are 
suitable for respective cross-dock types have been suggested.   
Keywords: Cross-docking, implementation, warehouse

Introduction
With the development of a customer-driven economy, supply chains attempt to satisfy customers by delivering goods 
and services with a minimal time while minimizing the material handling expenses. As a result of increasing pressure 
on supply chain partners to optimize operations, cross-docking has turned into a prominent method for the 
transportation of materials. Rather than a single driver takes care of many separate deliveries; these can be mixed or 
re-sorted out at a close distribution centre which will enhance the driver effectiveness. As a rule, when a shipment is 
landed at the port, it has to be moved to the distribution centre. In cross-docking, when the materials are unloaded 
from the inbound trucks, it will be sorted and moved to the outbound truck which is scheduled to be delivered to a 
particular destination. This is advantageous for the customer by delivering materials on the scheduled time and as well 
as for the manufacturer by diminishing warehouse expenses and time.  
Figure 1 shows the design of a typical cross-dock terminal. When the inbound trucks arrive and inbound docks are 
occupied, they will be assigned to the waiting area for inbound trailers in order to wait to be worked. Once the due 
time arrives; the vehicle is asked to be located to the dock to start the unloading process. When the unloading process 
is over, shipment is checked and sorted for the relevant destinations. Then, the cargo will be moved to a temporary 
staging area which is close to the outbound docks manually with the support of material handling equipment (four-
wheeled platform dollies, pallet jacks, forklift movers etc.). At the temporary staging area; value-added services like 
labelling will be processed. As soon as the outbound vehicle is available at the outbound dock; cargo will be loaded 
to it to be delivered to the final destinations (Novaes et al, 2017).

Other than the physical characteristics considered above, a better relationship developed with effective communication 
with the stakeholders; suppliers, customers, warehouse workers, transporters etc. is essential for implementing an 
effective and efficient cross-docking system in the warehouse.  
 
Conclusion 
 
In the paper benefits of implementing a cross-docking system is identified as well as the complexities of implementing 
a cross-docking system. Also, the paper has highlighted some important characteristics of an ideal cross-docking 
system. The study has discussed some of the important factors that are necessary to consider when implementing 
cross-docking system in a warehouse; cross-dock types for deciding an efficient cross-dock system, shapes of cross-
docks used in the industry and their effectiveness, models that has been developed for material handling problems 
within the warehouse and truck scheduling problems developed by the authors with the objective of minimizing the 
transportation time, cost. A future research question would be to analyze the effectiveness of cross-dock shapes with 
respective to different cross-dock types.

ABSTRACT 
The aim of this paper is to introduce an innovative framework that links a project manager’s (PM) soft 
skills to the rate of success of a given project. This framework would enable companies to measure the level 
of soft skills and competencies possessed by a candidate PM. The approach been adopted in this research 
work is to identify the core soft skills that would lead to the success of a project. The methodology 
comprised designing a survey questionnaire to determine important soft skills required by a project manager 
for the success of project. The data collected through the survey was then statistically analyzed using SPSS 
and Minitab in order to tune the proposed framework that would enable the selection of project managers 
in a more robust, well-informed manner. This work concentrated on oil and gas projects as its application 
domain. 
Keywords 
Maturity Level, Project Management, Project Manager Competencies, Project Framework. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Project management can be defined as the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to accomplish the 
project within limited time and resources. A project manager is responsible for leading a project from start to 
completion. Hence, a project manager is expected to have special skills that would enable him/her to successfully run 
and manage a project. In the past, less attention was given to the soft skills a person possesses (Robles, 2012). 
However, now it becomes more apparent that soft skills play a vital role in the project success. Therefore, identifying 
key soft skills needed by PM and measuring their effect on project success is of a great importance. Oil and gas 
projects are complex in the nature of their tasks and may worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Therefore, 
the selection of a project manager with the right skills is a crucial task (Osman and Al-Hinai, 2018). One cannot 
emphasize enough that choosing the right project manager will lead to an increase in projects success rate. Therefore, 
a new innovative framework called, Soft Skills & Competencies Maturity (SSCM) is developed in this research work. 
As a result, the anticipated benefits of using the proposed SSCM framework within the oil and gas organizations would 
enable the selection of project manager(s) in a more robust, well-informed manner that can lead to an increase in the 
project success rate. 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
According to the British Standard Institute (2000), project management is the planning, monitoring and control of all 
of the project activities and the motivation of all of the individuals involved in it to accomplish the project objectives 
on time, according to the specified budget, scope and quality. In general, managing a project involves four phases 
(Munns and Bjeirmi, 1996). First, the initiation phase that includes developing the business case document and the 
feasibility study. Second, the planning phase where the work requirements are defined clearly, the needed resources 
to achieve the project objectives are determined and allocated as well as the execution of the work is well planned. 
Third, the execution and controlling phase. In this phase, the predetermined plans are executed and the progress of the 
work is monitored to adjust any deviations from the original baseline plans. The fourth and final phase is the closing 
phase where the Project Closure Report is created and accordingly the project is handed over or commissioned to the

CONCLUSIONS 
In this research work, a novel SSCM framework to measure the maturity level of soft skill and competences of project 
managers and how they affect the project success rate is introduced. To achieve this, a survey questionnaire has been 
distributed among project managers in oil and gas companies in Oman. The analysis conducted in this paper using 
statistical means have demonstrated that there are relationships between soft skills competencies of a project manager 
and project success rate. However, the level of relationship between each soft skill and project success varies among 
the different project four phases as well as the different project success factors. The SSCM framework can be used 
during recruiting and hiring of project managers. It can also be used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of managers 
and hence determine areas that need further development and improvement. Moreover, it can also be used for 
promotion and career advancement. Authors are optimistic that this study would provide organizations and individuals 
alike with key soft leadership skills to successfully execute projects.

Abstract 
The abundance of ready meals in the stagnant Japanese food market is remarkable. The general term 
“ready meals” outside the home refers to such items as commercially available lunch boxes from the 
delicatessen. In Japanese food supermarkets (hereinafter referred to as SM), discounted sales of ready meals 
are made to reduce food waste and increase gross profits before closing. The following three points are 
considered for the discount sales of ready meals: 1) Stock food is sold to reduce waste loss; 2) if the discount 
amount is large, the food’s quality is suspect and the meal is not purchased; and 3) the discount amount is 
reduced in order to secure gross profits. In contrast, setting discount prices for ready meal often depends on 
the experience and intuition of the person in charge, as such, there is no numerical basis. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to derive the optimal discount prices that maximize the gross 
profit for the discounted sale of ready meals in SM, taking into account the impact of the expiration date 
on consumers and the aforementioned points of the discounted sale for ready meals. Our results indicated 
that the optimal price changes according the amount of stock, the number of customers at the store, and the 
number of times that discounts are changed. In addition, the optimal price for each condition could be 
derived by simulation.

Abstract 
Individuals with long-term mobility disabilities and age-related limitations can face many challenges in 
home environmental control, home healthcare tasks (e.g., reminders to take medications), maintaining a 
requisite amount of physical activity, and social interaction.  In a previous pilot-study, the authors have 
shown that Voice Activated Digital Assistants can help address the challenges faced by the above-mentioned 
demographic1.   
In this paper we present a three-step methodology for the integration of Amazon Alexa devices with a variety 
of smart home technologies that will help the aforementioned demographic to live independently at home.  
The first step is a needs assessment exercise involving a small pilot with members of the targeted 
demographic, namely older adults with long-term mobility disabilities.  We developed an instrument that 
gauges the technology-solutions they require.  Additionally, we assessed ability to cope with newer 
technologies, which is subsequently used to develop the format and content of training materials in the 
third-step.  The second step starts with detailed assay of common-off-the-shelf (COTS) components that can 
be integrated, with minimal developmental effort, to provide technology solutions to the “gaps” identified 
during the needs assessment.  The technology-solutions were ranked for safety, ease-of-use, and the level 
of expert technological-support needed for continued use.  The selected solutions were presented to a test-
audience within a simulated home environment.  The third step involves the development of appropriate 
training-material and product testing in real homes of the target group. 
We have successfully implemented the first two steps of the aforementioned methodology in the 
development of a product that integrates smart light bulbs, smart doorbells, and robotic vacuums at a senior

Abstract 
In the field of quality assurance, acceptance sampling plan is a widely-used method which applies statistical 
and quality control concept. It provides an efficient way to decide whether to accept or reject the lot under 
the allowable risks without having a full inspection of all products. To reduce the average sample number 
or inspection cost, many scholars have proposed various acceptance sampling plans over the years. 
Rectifying inspection plan is a sampling system which can help to provide the quality assurance of the 
incoming product lots to the custom. In rectifying inspection plan, only a sample of n  units will be 
inspected and the defective units should be replaced by non-defective one if the lot is accepted. Instead, the 
remaining units will be 100% inspected once the lot is rejected by the rectifying inspection.  
Process capability indices (PCIs) is a practical statistical tool to provide the information of the ability of a 
manufacturing process or procedure to meet specification limit. Juran (1974) proposed the first PCI, process 
precision index (
pk
C
 ) in 1986 and Kane (1986) proposed another index, 
pk
C
 , a yield-based process 
capability index, which is one of the most popular PCIs. However, since the degree of deviation from center 
of the process is not considered when evaluating process performance in the traditional capability indices, 
the concept of loss-based capability index 
pm
C
 was developed based on the Taguchi’s loss function. 
For the propose to minimize the number of average total inspection, we consider a variable rectifying 
inspection plan with repetitive group sampling based on loss-based capability index 
pm
C
. The proposed 
pm

-based VRRGS plan has three parameters, (

to be solved. In order to protect both producer and 
consumer, the probability of acceptance cannot be less than 1-α  when the quality level reaches acceptable 
quality level (AQL) while the probability of acceptance should be less than β  when the quality level is at 
rejectable quality level (RQL). Therefore, we use minimizing ATI as objective function and producer’s and 
consumer’s risk as two constraints to build an optimization model. Through this model, the required

Lastly, the performance of the proposed VRRGS plan is also discussed with operating characteristic (OC)

VRSS plan is tabulated. The results show that the ATI required by VRRGS plan is smaller than required by 
VRSS plan under the same condition. Also, since the slope of OC curve of proposed VRRGS plan is larger

Abstract 
As technologies develop rapidly nowadays, managing and improving the quality of products have become 
important issues in manufacturing industries. Acceptance sampling plan is a quality management tool which 
has been commonly used in practice to provide reliable decision rules in lot sentencing. Owing to the 
availability and efficiency of acceptance sampling plan, various acceptance sampling plans are proposed to 
handle different situations. Skip-lot sampling plan (SKSP) has been used extensively in the manufacturing 
industries for inspecting a successive series of lots or bulk materials. It takes the quality history into 
consideration and inspects only a fraction of the submitted lot. On the other hand, repetitive group sampling 
plan (RGSP) gives the submitted lots the chance of resampling which is helpful for maintaining long-term 
cooperation between the producer and the consumer. Compared with single sampling plan (SSP), both 
SKSP and RGSP can obtain a smaller average sample number (ASN) in inspection.   
Process capability indices (PCIs) is another common tool in the field of quality management that has been 
used to measure the performance of manufacturing process. The advantage of PCIs is that it is a 
dimensionless tool and is useful to quantify the process capability. Among PCIs, 
pk
C
 is the most popular 
one in manufacturing industries because it not only considers both precision and accuracy of the process 
but also gives the estimation of the process yield. In recent years, scholars have applied PCIs in acceptance 
sampling plans. The PCI-based sampling plan can improve accuracy of inspection by using the exact 
sampling distribution. To consolidate the advantage of SKSP, RGSP and PCIs, this study develops a 
modified version of SKSP based on 
pk
C
 where RGSP is used as the reference plan.  The optimization model 
of the proposed plan is constructed to minimize the average sample number and fulfill the quality and risk 
requirements by both producers and consumers. Moreover, the performance of the proposed plan are 
compared with the conventional SSP and SKSP.

Abstract 
In recent years, technology has improved dramatically, and consumers’ demands for quality have become higher. 
Therefore, many scholars have investigated in designing advanced process capability indices for measuring the 
process performance with extremely low defect rate.  Process yield is a commonly used tool in manufacturing industry 
to evaluate process performance. However, process yield only consider if the product falls within the specification 
limits and assume the products which meet the specification limits have the same quality. To remedy for this situation, 
a more advanced and customer-orientated index, called quality yield index (
)
qY
, was proposed. Quality yield index 
takes quality loss into consideration by penalizing yield when the product characteristic deviates from the target value. 
Unfortunately, the sampling distribution of the estimated 
qY is too complicated, which makes it difficult to establish 
the exact confidence interval. Therefore, several approaches for constructing confidence intervals of the index 
qY
have been presented including approximate distribution approach (AD) and bootstrap approach. Approximate 
distribution method is constructed by subtracting the upper bound of expected relative process loss from the lower 
bound of process yield and can also be view as a conservative estimation method. Bootstrap method is a useful 
technique for estimating sampling distribution no matter what the exact population distribution is. In this paper, we 
apply the concept of generalized pivotal quantities to construct the generalized confidence interval (GCI) for 
qY . In
order to examine the performance of GCI method, a series of simulations are conducted and compared with the 
existing methods in terms of coverage rate and the average value of lower confidence bound (LCB). The simulation 
results indicate that GCI method always performs the best for calculating LCB of 
qY . As a result, the GCI method is
recommended in practical situations for assessing the process performance based on the quality yield index.

Abstract 
 
Change point refers to the time when a process really shifts from a normal condition to an unexpected condition. 
Identification of the change point leads one to an effectiveness root cause analysis of the process. In the case 
that there exists a multi-dimensional data sets i.e. panel data, an expert can analyze a variable of a cross-section 
on a determined time series at the same time. This research attempts to detect and analyze the change point 
based on the number of cars manufactured by different companies around the world in the last 19 years. This 
paper first identifies the change point of each country separately and then addresses the change point of all 
countries simultaneously using panel data approach. The comparative report of this paper helps one to analyze 
factors performed the change of the production volume.

1. Introduction 
 Change point analysis of panel data well addresses a valuable time to identify the factor(s) influenced the 
process.  The change point refers to the time when the process departures from a natural condition to an 
unexpected performance.  Identification of the change point helps experts and managers to identify the root 
cause of the new condition.  
 Bai (2010) used the least square error (LSE) method to estimate the common change point in means of a panel 
data and also used the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) method to estimate the change point in mean, 
variance, and both. Horváth & Hušková (2012) investigated the statistic of the change point estimator in the 
panel data means generated by the Bai (2010) and proposed approximately the distribution of the statistic. 
Horváth & Hušková (2012) used their proposed method to identify change in the Gini coefficients of 33 
countries, including European countries, Australia, the United States, South America, China and Taiwan. De 
Wachter & Tzavalis (2012) proposed a test to detecting the change point in the structure of a dynamic linear 
panel data model and used it to identify the effects of the 1997 Asian crisis on investment decisions of Asian 
companies. Enomoto & Nagata (2016) extended the Mahalanobis – Taguchi (MT) method proposed by 
Taguchi (2002) using Bayes inference to identify the change point in a panel data. Enomoto & Nagata (2016) 
used their proposed method to detecting the change point in the annual consumption of four beverages in states 
of Japan for the years 2001 - 2013. They identified the change point in 2010 for Kagoshima state and Shiman 
state, and in 2011 for Tokyo. Peštová & Pešta (2015) propose a test to identify a common change point in 
means of the panel data. Their proposed statistic is based on the LSE method and they use the Bootstrap 
method to determine the test criteria. Peštová & Pešta (2017) proposed a common change point estimator in 
the panel data means. Their proposed method is also derived from the LSE method. In the case that the last 
observation is addressed as the change point of the panel, it indicates the lack of the change point, otherwise, 
it is used to detection of the change point using the bootstrap method proposed by Pestova & Pesta (2015). 
Cho (2016) proposed a method for identifying the change point in panel data using CUSUM method. Cho","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Figure 1. The result report of the software 
 
The result of this research is confirmed by the economic report. The crisis of automotive industries in 2008-
2010 was reported as a part of the financial crisis of 2007-2008 leading to a great recession (Chakraborty Das 
2008, Associated Press 2008). The crisis of automotive primarily reported for American industries and then 
the crisis affected European, Canadian, and Asian industries.  
The change point addressed in this research is about the time that a substantial increase in the automotive fuel 
price experienced and automotive industries decided to change their strategies. Three big American 
companies, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, encouraged to focus on vehicles with high profit margin. The 
Chinese government reduced automotive taxes in order to spur flagging sales, in 2008. 
In fact, the results of this paper addresses the value time in a scientific method. The change point can be 
focused on experts to analyze the source of the unnatural condition. In addition to, the method of used by this 
paper is capable of applying for monthly, weekly or daily observations. 
It should be noted that this crisis affected on each country differently, for example, China experienced an 
increase in average car production after 2008, while this is the reverse for Canada. Thus identifying the change 
point in time series observations of the sum or mean of the world car production may mislead us into the 
accurate estimation of the change point. As can be seen in Table 1, the change point of the total of the world 
car production is estimated the 2009. In other words, the influence of the various external factors, at one time 
or at different times, may vary from one cross - sectional unit to another. The panel data provides the 
opportunity of the considering the effects of the cross - sectional units. 
5. Conclusion 
This paper analyzed car productions by the world countries in terms of the presence of a common change point 
in the mean. Change point identification provides the opportunity of analyzing the sources(s) manifested itself 
to the process. Change point addresses the time that really an assignable cause(s) has been experienced by the 
process. This paper focused on the annual automotive productions of the world and provided a panel data. The 
change point analysis of this panel using two approach addressed a valuable time i.e. the change point. The 
identified change point of this paper is confirmed by the economic reports. The method used in this paper can 
be approached by professional industrial management. This professional approach leads managers to eliminate 
the special cause of the process as soon as possible.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract 
Line graphs are prevalently used to show trend especially time series. However, there is limited study on the influence 
of visual properties in complex comprehension tasks such as determining differences in slope. In this study, the effect 
of color hue and horizontal distance between points were considered in a slope task. Monochrome palettes using blue, 
green and red were developed to illustrate 4-time series data. Saturation was fixed while lightness were varied. 
Horizontal distance between points were set to 1.67, 2.00 and 2.5 cm while maintaining a constant height of 6 cm. 
Red resulted in the worst performance in terms of response time (RT) and accuracy. As for distance, data suggest that 
lower values negatively influence response time and accuracy. The best RT was obtained for high setting and highest 
accuracy for medium setting. Colors of monochrome palettes used did not significantly influence RT and accuracy. 
The hypothesis that red can improve perception of slope was rejected. In this study, graph understanding was improved 
although statistically insignificant by blue. High and medium horizontal distance settings significantly affected 
performance in slope tasks invalidating the hypothesis posited in this study. Accuracy can best be improved by using 
the medium distance setting while RT is best at high distance setting.

1. Introduction
Companies gather data that are sometimes too much to handle. The challenge is to organize and design visualizations 
that provide quick and accurate understanding of complex data (Ryan, 2015). People who have advance degrees find 
it difficult to interpret graphs (Bowen and  Roth, 2005). It is the job of the graph designer to determine visual properties 
that will make the visualization comprehensible and attractive. Readability which is defined as the ability to extract 
information that is encoded in graphs is influenced by the color scheme (Thudt, 2007). Reading a graph presents 
numerous challenges that include slope interpretation (Janvier, 1998), detection of patterns (Bowen and Roth, 2005), 
and confusion due to visual clutter (Li and Moachieh, 2014). Comprehension, on the other hand, does not only include 
reading but also interpretation of graphs (Friel, et al. 2001). 
The simplicity of the line graph lends itself to prevalent use in illustrating trends in multiple contexts. Time series data 
is usually represented using line graphs to show how a variable's behavior over time. However, the increase in the 
number of time series creates visual clutter that affects the readability of data. Visualization of multiple TS is facilitated 
by the use of colors and other unique visual properties such as line characteristics to distinguish each series of points 
Javed et al. (2010). However, there is limited research on the manipulation of graph design features on the readability 
of line graphs especially as information and task complexity increases. Cleveland and McGill (1984) noted the 
limitation of the human perceptual system in comparison of values on curved slopes which is part of graph 
interpretation (Cleveland and McGill, 1984).

1997). One possible explanation is the low contrast ratio of the red palette compared to blue. If the contrast ratio is 
low, it is more difficult to distinguish one line from another. It was clear that no specific hue has clear advantage over 
the another based on the insignificant result of the test on . Color was found to aid decision making in comprehending 
graphical reports especially if there is a time constraint (Benbasat and Dexter, 1986). However, the study of Benbasat 
and Dexter (1986) used only green without any variation in saturation and lightness. Thus, it is also possible that the 
use of different levels of saturation in constructing the monochrome palette could have caused confusion.   
 
 Contrary to color, horizontal distance between data points significantly influenced RT and accuracy. The hypothesis 
about distance posited in this paper was invalidated since high and medium distance settings resulted in best RT and 
accuracy, respectively. Such a result can be brought about by the nature of the slope task which can be difficult to 
perceive if the points are close to each other. A line graph that is too tall or narrow a disproportionate rate of change 
can be construed especially since it involves the angles and slopes of the lines. In contrast, if proportions are too short 
and wide, the rate of change will look small (Vlamis and Vlamis, 2015). 
5. Conclusion  
 
A specific graph comprehension task was considered in this study where hue and horizontal distance were considered 
as factors. Colors of monochrome palettes used did not significantly influence RT and accuracy. The hypothesis that 
red can improve perception of slope was rejected. In this study, graph understanding was improved although 
statistically insignificant by blue. 
 
High and medium horizontal distance settings significantly affected performance in slope tasks invalidating the 
hypothesis posited in this study. Accuracy can best be improved by using the medium distance setting while RT is 
best at high distance setting.  
 
The results of this study can be used to improve sales report presentation where audience are interested to know about 
trends indicated by slopes. Sales performance of different products over time are sometimes presented for comparison 
and eventual decision making. In presenting this kind of information, it is recommended that the distance between 
data points should be 2-2.5 cm with a height-to-width ratio of 50%.

Abstract 
Cross-docking is a logistic technique that can reduce costs occurred in a supply chain network while 
increasing the flow of goods, thus shortening the shipping cycle. Inside a cross-dock facility, the goods are 
directly transferred from incoming vehicles to outgoing vehicles without storing them in-between. Our 
research extends and combines this cross-docking technique with a well-known logistic problem, the 
vehicle routing problem (VRP), for delivering multiple products and addresses it as the VRP for multi-
product cross-docking (VRP-MPCD). We developed a mixed integer programming model and generated 
two sets of VRP-MPCD instances, which are based on VRPCD instances. The instances are solved by a 
commercial software AMPL with CPLEX solver. The findings show that the small instances can be solved 
optimally by CPLEX. However, larger instances cannot be solved optimally within predefined 
computational times.

1. Introduction
Speed and productivity of a supply chain have become important factors in the growth of organizations. A supply 
chain is expected to be reactive and fast, while keeping prices low. Cross-docking is a logistic technique that can 
reduce costs occurred in a supply chain network while increasing the flow of goods, and thus shortening the shipping 
cycle. Inside a cross-dock facility, the incoming goods are directly transferred to the outgoing vehicles, such that 
inventory is kept to a minimum level (Ladier and Alpan 2015). The advantages of using a cross-dock facility compared 
to traditional distribution centers are reductions in labor costs, delivery time to customers, and the need for warehouse 
space (Boysen and Fliedner 2010, Chen and Song 2009, Galbreth et al. 2008). 
Cross-docking has been widely adapted by various companies such as Walmart, as it is able to reduce costs and time 
occurred during the delivery process within a supply chain network. In this network, several suppliers need to supply 
products to several customers based on their customers’ demand. Some customers may have similar demand with each 
other, resulting in direct shipping of products to each customer from the same supplier. In this case, each supplier 
needs to send one or more vehicle(s) to the customers’ site in order to satisfy the individual customer demand. Each 
customer, on the other hand, is visited by multiple suppliers’ vehicles for each product they order. 
The idea of cross-docking is to first consolidate those supply products in a cross-dock facility before sending it to the 
customers. This may result in fewer vehicle visiting each customer. It helps to eliminate the long origin-to-destination

could be due to the distances or time travel required between suppliers. For a larger number of vehicles used (e.g. 3 
and 4), each vehicle visits the same number of suppliers. The same observation applies to vehicles assigned to 
customers.     
5. Conclusion
This research introduces the extension of the VRPCD, the so-called VRP for multi-product cross-docking (VRP-
MPCD), which consider the presence of multiple products in a supply chain network instead of single product (as in 
VRPCD). In order to solve the VRP-MPCD, a mixed integer programming model has been formulated. We consider 
several constraints with respect to the suppliers and customers, such as the number of vehicles to be used, delivery 
and pickup processes for multiple products, planning horizon for the entire process, and the vehicle capacity. 
We further modify the well-known VRPCD benchmark instances to consider multiple products, so-called VRP-MPCD 
instances. The VRP-MPCD instances are then solved by our formulated mixed integer programming model by using 
a commercial software AMPL with CPLEX solver. Optimal solutions for the first set of the VRP-MPCD instances 
with 10-nodes can be obtained. However, the experiments show that it takes a longer computational time of over an 
hour to solve the problem when we tested with 30-nodes instances. Therefore, future work may include how to design 
heuristics that provide good solutions and solves the problem more efficiently. Statistical tests need to be conducted 
in order to evaluate the performance of heuristics. The heuristics can be utilized to solve real industry data that possibly 
include a larger number of nodes. Another direction for future work is to validate that the presence of cross-docking 
facility could really reduce the transportation costs occurred when delivering products from suppliers to customers.

Abstract 
The paper considers a closed-loop supply chain with one supplier, one manufacturer and two retailers, in 
which the customer demand is assumed to be price-sensitive. We induce retail price in the demand 
through an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) pricing process, and characterize the customer 
demand by an auto-regressive non-standard ARMA(1,1) process. We use an order-up-to (OUT) inventory 
policy with minimum mean square error (MMSE) forecasting scheme and measure the bullwhip effect at 
each echelon of the closed-loop supply chain. With the help of numerical simulation, we recognize that 
the bullwhip effect or the anti-bullwhip effect may occur depending on critical values of parameters of the 
underlying demand process. We observe that the bullwhip effect at the manufacturer is affected by 
retailer’s market share. Moreover, a remanufacturing process in the reverse channel and a steady pricing 
mechanism for the product can significantly reduce the bullwhip effect at different stages of the closed-
loop supply chain.

1. Introduction
Due to growing focus on environment protection, many companies now-a-days have turned their attention towards 
accommodating end-of-life products for product recovery, recycling or remanufacturing. The reverse flow of 
product in the so called closed-loop supply chain is not only emerged as a crucial approach to protect environment 
but also to get significant economic benefits. That’s why big companies all over the world are establishing 
remanufacturing units today in parallel to manufacturing units to follow government regulations on waste product 
and carbon emission reduction in order to protect environment and earn considerable benefits.   
A common experience of many supply chain managers is that a small error in the demand forecast in the 
downstream may cause a substantial variation of the order quantity at the upstream supplier, which is commonly 
known as bullwhip effect. In the last decade, bullwhip effect in supply chain with a pure downstream flow of 
materials has become a research hotspot to many researchers. However, a reverse logistics in any supply chain may 
impact the bullwhip effect especially at the manufacturing stage. The primary objective of this study is to measure 
the bullwhip effect at different echelons of a closed-loop supply chain when the market demand follows a non-
standard stochastic process. In most of the studies on the bullwhip effect literature, an Auto-Regressive AR(1) 
demand model is considered. However, the true behavior of the actual demand in reality cannot be described with 
the AR(1) demand process. Instead, an Auto Regressive Moving Average ARMA(1,1) process would reflect more 
appropriate behavior of the customer demand in reality. As price is an important driver of the customer demand in 
the market, in this study, we induce price in the demand through an auto regressive moving average process. As a 
result, the customer demand becomes a non-standard ARMA (1,1) process. Our proposed closed-loop supply chain 
consists of two retailers, one manufacturer having two units – one remanufacturing unit and one manufacturing

7. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we investigate the bullwhip effect at each echelon of a closed-loop supply chain which consists of two 
retailers, one manufacturer, one supplier and one third party collector. We have assumed that the customer demand 
is influenced by retail price. We have incorporated the price dynamics in demand through an ARMA(1,1) pricing 
process. The market demand is then reduced to a non-standard ARMA(1,1) process. We have observed from the 
numerical results that the bullwhip effect occurs at each stage if it occurs in the first stage. On the other hand, if an 
anti-bullwhip occurs at the first stage, it may not propagate through all upstream stages. We have further observed 
that the remanufacturing decision in the reverse channel significantly reduces the bullwhip effect at the manufacturer 
stage. Furthermore, a steady price mechanism can considerably reduce the bullwhip effect at all stages of the supply 
chain. In this paper, we have assumed deterministic lead time at all stages. Future research may relax this 
assumption and consider stochastic lead time to investigate the bullwhip effect for a more realistic closed-loop 
supply chain.
