Abstract 
This article proposes a Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) approach for aircraft engines and Remaining Useful 
Life (RUL) monitoring, and failure prevention. Due to the unavailability of run-to-failure data, Turbofan Engine 
Simulation data, obtained from NASA repository, is used to train and test our model. Data Acquisition and 
Management system framework and planning are proposed for online monitoring and RUL prediction. In practice, 
sensor measurements usually suffer from noise contamination, hence the prediction models are challenged by noise 
contaminated data for both training and testing tasks. This is done to assess their prediction ability in a similar 
condition of having noisy data. Linear and nonlinear prediction models are developed, with performance comparison 
addressing both regression and classification problems. Models performance indices consider both prediction accuracy 
and percentage of predictions before the actual failure (PBAF). The proposed model considers continuous learning 
and improvement to account for any further operational changes that affect the model prediction ability. This is 
reached by ingesting the model with the actual RUL during the maintenance of the engine unit, and by comparing it 
to the predicted one.  
Keywords Condition-based maintenance, Failure prediction, Engine Degradation, IoT, Industry 4.0. 
1. Introduction
Aircraft engine is a critical component.  Its failure causes loss of lives. The traditional maintenance strategies, that are 
proposed by the designers, usually involve Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). These strategies propose 
preventive maintenance tasks that are based on reliability analysis of the operating systems. These strategies improve 
effectively the reliability of the engine. However, the costs are high due to unnecessary maintenance or replacement 
actions. Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) is used for cost minimization while achieving reliability improvement. 
Online monitoring and data analysis lead to better maintenance planning and maintenance duration reduction. In 
addition to performing effective maintenance plans, airlines can achieve better consistency of flight scheduling.

4. Conclusion and Future work 
 
This research proposed a framework for aircraft engine's RUL prediction. This framework included On-line remote 
monitoring and continuous learning with cloud connection facility. The RUL prediction model parameters are meant 
to be updated every maintenance operation, which helps improving the accuracy and the predicting capabilities of the 
model. The sensor noise problem was overcome by our model which affirms its robustness. This promotes its ability 
to provide reliable predictions with real data that is normally contaminated with noise. The input data were 
preprocessed before exploring the prediction possibility. The preprocessing included outliers and highly correlated 
variables removal for reaching better modelling performance. We studied both regression and classification 
methodologies for performing RUL prediction. The Random Forest classifier showed promising results. It offers safe 
and conservative condition-based maintenance. It could provide RUL classes prediction, above/below a certain level. 
This was demonstrated at 20% level of RUL. The classes prediction was achieved at only 1.24% PAAF% and 7.43% 
general error rate.  
 
For the future work, the framework will be validated with real system and embedded sensors. Moreover, spare part 
stocks, arriving time and downtime to be taken into consideration for a complete maintenance planning system.

Abstract 
A challenge of automotive enterprises is to achieve a total implementation of Lean Thinking tools through the 
manufacturing processes. The Automotive Cluster of Nuevo León (CLAUT) in Mexico developed an instrument 
which evaluates the use of 23 tools distributed in five levels and 279 criterions to measure the maturity level of its 
member companies in the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools. The instrument was made with the 
collaboration of three companies. This study has the objective to prove, redesign, and standardize this instrument by 
conducting three rounds of audits with external auditors to a case study in seven companies (OEM, Tier1, and Tier2). 
The main goal is to decrease the time of evaluation and to standardize it for it to be replicable in different companies 
of the same industry. The methodology selected was the PDCA cycle, and it was replicated twice. The redesign of the 
instrument was supported on a theoretical basis, using state of the art as BPM Maturity Model and Lean Enterprise 
Self-Assessment Tool (LESAT). The results of the audits allow to identify the practical implication of the assessment, 
and after two cycles led to the improvement of both the application method and the content of the instrument.

Introduction
During the last two decades, lean manufacturing tools have had a higher application in the automotive industries to 
improve the performance of the processes by eliminating wastes. Currently, there are different Maturity Models (MM) 
being used in the field which were created by various authors and companies to measure the implementation of lean 
manufacturing tools (Vivares, 2017). The MM are used to evaluate processes in companies and organizations, to 
measure and compare the level of maturity between each other in a specific industry. These models are a combination 
of arranged elements from lean manufacturing principles to grant a particular measure of maturity in this topic.  
Most of the MM are focused on a specific company process or standard, which make it too difficult to achieve the 
best level for different companies on the same sector (Tarhan, Turetken and Reijers, 2016). Berenguer (2015) points 
out that the level of maturity becomes fundamental to assess the performance of an organization and is based on 
implementation evaluations for its measurement. Due to this, the MM were created to serve as assessments of the 
current state and provide a guide to identify measures of improvement that allow its future development (Röglinger et 
al., 2012).  
Seven different MM were studied in this research to compare them and used it as a theoretical basis. They include: a) 
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) proposed by Chemweno, Pintelon, Van Horenbeek & Muchiri (2013); 
b) Process Management Maturity Assessment (PMMA) defined by Rohloff (2009); c) Meng Maturity Model (Meng,
2011); d) Purchase Maturity Model (Bermelmans, 2013); e) Maturity model for production Management
(Kosieradzka, 2017); Business Process Management (BPM) defined by Chen, Ding., Fu and Huang (2016) and Lean
Capability Model (Mize, 2002). The last two MM are specific for Lean Manufacturing (LM) concept and were selected 
as the main models for this research.

made by the participants of the second audit alongside the comments made by the team while applying it in the field. 
As part of the theoretical contributions, the team combined the structures of the BPM maturity model, LESAT format, 
sequential and non-sequential grading to create a new instrument for the Automotive Cluster of Nuevo Leon. The 
team concluded in agreement that the topic of the BPM maturity model applied in the tobacco industry by the authors 
Chen et al. (2016) is of great use for production industries such as the automotive industry. The practical contributions 
of the study focused on the benefits achieved for the CLAUT. As this instrument can be used to evaluate any process 
in the automotive industry, and it will be up to the CLAUT to decide if the instrument will be used for their benefit 
only or if it will be shared with other Mexico’s clusters and others Latin American countries. 
Due to the time frame given by the university for the study is limited, a second pilot test with the second redesign was 
done with two of the remaining three companies that did not participate during the second round of audits. It must be 
said that due to the time limitations of the project, this study was done with seven of the ninety-two-member companies 
of the CLAUT, and most of them were audited twice for the study. The instrument is given to the client in the status 
of a pilot test to be re-examined further due to the study small statistic sample.

Abstract 
 
Since the early nineteen hundred several associations have risen. These are cluster associations of concentrated firms 
belonging to the same industrial sector receiving support from academic institutions and the local government in order 
to enhance competitiveness. Literature seems to be vast on studying the effect of clusters on the competitiveness of 
members (see Karaev, Koh, and Thomas-Szamosi 2007; Awad and Amro 2017; Carrie 1999). However, there is vague 
formal analysis of the effects that clusters have on members' productivity. Therefore, this study aims to analyze 
whether Geographic Proximity, Social Capital and Innovation within a cluster affect cluster members' productivity, 
particularly in a local Mexican Home Appliance Industry Cluster (CLELAC). The data for analysis was retrieved 
using a self-designed survey, applied to current executives from the companies which are members of the cluster. This 
data was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Algorithm, introducing the construct of Productivity as the 
dependent variable, and the constructs of Geographic Proximity, Social Capital, and Innovation as the independent 
variables. The results suggest that Geographic Proximity and Social Capital within a cluster affect positively firm’s 
productivity growth, which proves the first two hypotheses of this study. Apart from the hypotheses, two new causal 
relations were found in the model: Proximity and its positive impact on the cluster’s Social Capital; and Social 
Capital’s impact on Innovation within the cluster. However, the impact that Innovation within the cluster may have 
on firm’s productivity could not be proven.

Abstract 
We determine the prioritization of processes and tasks in automotive companies. The methodology of 
Failure Mode Analysis and Effects was applied, the purpose of the FMEA is to take actions to eliminate or 
reduce failures, starting with the highest-priority ones in order to efficiently identify all possible failures in 
a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product or service. The traditional Failure Mode 
Analysis and Effects methodology was applied to four different processes in the companies of the 
automotive industry, finding deficiencies in the calculation of the Risk Priority Number. Therefore, the 
calculation of the Risk Priority Number is modified in the methodology, implementing additional steps, 
adding a weight to the calculation of the risk priority number. The weighting was determined in the cost 
function associated with a failure scenario within the process. To do this, the cost of the severity of a defect 
was calculated, such as the effects on the customer, warranty costs, scrap, etc. Secondly, the cost of the 
occurrence was determined, which indicates what the company is going through when the defect is repaired. 
The cost of detecting a failure in the system is applied. Finally, these factors are balanced. Finally, a 
comparison is made against the traditional methodology to identify the improvement in the prioritization 
of tasks of failure modes that represent a greater impact on the economy of the company and have a 
consistent control plan.

Abstract 
South Africa, being a developing country, experiences the impact of global competition which has pushed many 
organizations to develop plans to respond to a continuous competitive global market. The restaurant, fast food, and 
catering sector is broad within the service industry involving independent restaurants, quick service restaurants and 
fast food outlets, outsourced catering companies, just to name a few. This study’s objective is to establish the 
importance of focusing on the fundamentals of quality management practices and the usefulness of leadership practices 
in the management process of the above-mentioned sector. This study included a quantitative research method under 
which an empirical investigation was executed following the literature review. The study consisted of the analysis of 
data collected from questionnaires administered to 65 restaurants in Gauteng, South Africa. After results analysis and 
interpretation, it is concluded that the functions of management were not well integrated, mainly the leadership 
functions. Hence, a need to improve specific aspects of the foundations of management approaches in the restaurant, 
fast food and catering sector is required.

1. Introduction
The restaurant, fast food and catering sector comprises all institutions that supply the public with food and beverage. 
It provides a large collection of employment and profession which vary based on to the kind of service in each 
establishment. For instance, the jobs executed in a fast food store are very different from those performed in a 
restaurant or in hotel establishments (Magris and McCreery 2001). 
In the 21st century, managers are faced with a number of trials related to guaranteeing organizational success in the 
world economy. These trials comprise leaders and competing on a global scale, improving the quality of goods and 
services, as well as drawing and keeping an experienced and diverse personnel (Cooper 2005). 
1.1 Background, Rationale and Value of the Study 
The failure rate of management commitment characterized by fast change should become an aspect of great concern 
to the managers of modern companies. Theoretically, the significance of this study lies in the fact it explores the 
implication of leadership as an element of the quality management system (QMS) and it explores the failures of a 
management system in an organization.

safety system in line with their quality management system. As stated in the ISO 2200 (2005), the organization shalt 
perform internal audits at scheduled time intervals to establish the system of food safety management. 
 
The researchers further recommend that the organizations should incorporate the Theory X and Theory Y by Douglas 
McGregor (1960). Based on McGregor, managers in Theory X presume employees are negligent and lazy and need 
continuous supervision and outside incentive in order to attain organizational, while managers in Theory Y presume 
personnel want to work and are capable of directing and controlling themselves goals (McGregor 1960, Arslan and 
Staub 2013). McGregor encouraged a Theory Y perception, proposing that leaders who support contribution and allow 
openings for individual challenge and creativity would accomplish greater accomplishment (Sahin 2012).

Factors that contribute towards cost overruns in an African 
Mega-project

Abstract 
Mega-projects improve the livelihoods of people and boost the country’s economy. When mega-projects are to be 
constructed, the government notifies the public of the details including the budgeted cost. Most of these projects spiral 
out of control when it comes to budget and time. State-owned entity (SOE) mega-projects are funded by taxpayers’ 
money and as a result of cost overruns, the extra funds required to cover the extra expenses are resourced from other 
departments’ budgets or borrowed from other countries. Developing countries are hit the hardest when it comes to 
cost overruns in projects. The literature review results show that there are many explanations for cost overruns 
however these explanations can be summarised into four categories i.e. political, technical, economical and 
psychological. A case study methodology of one African mega-project is investigated to determine the contributing 
factors towards cost overruns. Data is collected through interviews and company documents. The findings of the case 
study reveal that variation orders and contractual claims during the execution phase of an African mega-project 
contribute as factors towards cost overruns. Innovative project management measures need to put in place in order to 
eradicate cost overruns.

Cost overruns, Developing countries, Mega-projects. 
1. Introduction
Cost overruns are a worldwide problem and affect many industries across the world which consequently affects 
specific project performance. Flyberg (2009) states that infrastructure mega-projects cost overruns average from a 
range of 20.4% to 44.7% and that globally 9 out of 10 projects have cost overruns. Cost overruns are caused by many 
different factors and impact the final project cost at completion. Pultarova (2016) recently reports on a survey analysis 
conducted by Ernst and Young, a professional services firm, of the performance of 100 of the world's largest mega-
projects, including nuclear power plants, hydropower projects and offshore and onshore wind farms (Ernst and Young 
Global Limited 2016). The survey findings are that 57% of the projects are running wildly over budget while 64% 
experience delays, with 35% experiencing delays of up to 2 years. Majority of mega-projects are implemented by 
(SOEs) to stimulate economic growth by addressing the social needs of the population and creating jobs. SOEs operate 
off taxpayers' money, and when cost overruns occur, it increases the amount of wasteful spending. Projects are often 
not managed responsibly, nor do the officials get blamed when these cost overruns occur. Instead, contractors are 
merely blamed for their poor performance. Project cost overruns by SOEs are a significant problem because taxpayers 
bear the financial burden (Edward, 2009). Therefore the risks associated with developing and planning these projects 
become high. Burns, Shields & Shrestha (2013) has done a study on 363 public projects and discovers that the size 
and the duration of a project has an impact on cost overruns i.e. the larger and longer a project is, the greater the risk 
of increased costs.   
Countries will be impacted differently by the cost overruns of projects due to different economic conditions, 
geographical locations, and working environments. Over the past 70 years, there has been no improvement in cost 
overruns of infrastructure projects (Bruzelius, Flyberg & Rothengatter (2002). 
Cantarelli, Flyberg, Molin & van Wee (2010) say that cost overruns can be summarised into four main categories: 
political, technical, economical and psychological. These four categories are explained in more detail in table 1.

In figure 2 the C&I Contractor has claimed 93.72% progress of the Unit’s tendered/budgeted cost. The additional VO 
and contractual claim for Unit 2 have increased the overall cost of the Unit. The budget has increased from the initial 
amount of R207 million to R537 million. In addition to the cost overruns experienced in Unit 2, there is also a 4 month 
delay. The initial completion date was November 2017, but the actual completed was March 2018.  
Both Units experience time delays and cost overruns which impact the overall cost to completion and the completion 
date of ABC Project.  
 
 
 
Figure 3: Project area costs 
 
In addtion to the results determined from Unit 1 and Unit 2, there are other areas that are affected by cost and time 
overruns during the research period. Figure 3 shows areas  BOP (Balance of Plant), Unit 3 and Unit 4 having 
contractual claims. The C&I Contracor submitted delayed access claims that include cost and time impacts. 
From the research study, it can be said that factors contributing towords cost overruns in megaprojects are VOs and 
contractual claims during the execution phase of the project. The explanatory analysis of cost overruns can be 
summarised by the following explanations which are also supported by the other researchers: 
 
A study conducted in Nigeria by Aigbavboa, Dosumu & Sunday (2017) find that cost overruns are due to design errors 
caused by a lack of coordination among the project teams which result in variation orders. In South Africa, a study by 
Aigbavboa, Lusa & Thwala (2015) determines that variation orders are associated with time and cost overruns, 
affected quality, and cause disagreements/disputes between parties and resulting in loss of productivity. 
 
Idrus and Sambu (2011) did a study in Malaysia on cost overruns and identified that mismanagement by the 
contractors, clients, and consultants all contributed towards the cost overruns. 
 
Conclusion 
It has been identified from past studies that cost overruns is a persistent problem. Mega-projects seem to be more 
complex because of the project size, public stakeholders and technology involved. These large projects tend to have a 
higher risk and therefore increase the chances of failure. Innovative measures need to be put in place that will address 
cost overruns i.e. improve cost estimation techniques. Project management practices need to be implemented that will 
manage the projects by tracking and reporting on project progress. Employees and contractors with the required 
experience should be selected to works on projects of a similar nature, so they will be bringing the skills and lessons

cost overruns need to be investigated. Further studies are required to be conducted which compare similar projects 
within the African continent to determine these factors and how they can be mitigated.

Abstract 
Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) have transfigured into a complex system because of its need to 
accommodate fluctuation in demands and fulfilling customers’ requirements with immediate effects. FMS 
scheduling problem is strongly non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem and is usually 
difficult to find its optimal solution. The performance of a scheduling system, in practice, is not evaluated 
to satisfy a single objective, but to obtain a trade-off schedule regarding multiple objectives. Therefore, in 
this research, we make use of one of the multiple objective decision-making methods, a global criterion 
approach, to develop a multi-objective model for solving FMS scheduling problems with consideration of 
three performance measures, namely minimizing mean job tardiness and mean job earliness and also mean 
machine idle time, simultaneously Due to the complexity of the multi-objective model, a Variable 
Neighbourhood Search (VNS) approach is developed for solving the addressed FMS scheduling problem. 
Moreover, Taguchi method is utilized to tune the parameters of the algorithm and analyze the parameters 
of the studying problem. The feasibility and adaptability of the proposed heuristic is investigated through a 
test problem in small and large sizes. Finally, the results clearly indicate the superior performance of the 
proposed VNS approach for the problem.

Abstract 
There have been many lawsuits targeting organizations that have yet to make an effort to make their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
websites accessible to persons with disabilities. And hence, many vendors have started to make an effort
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
in making their web interfaces accessible to persons with disabilities. Many research studies have also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
emerged, targeting user studies of persons with disabilities on the accessible web interface given the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limitations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Considering that the majority of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users comes from the general population, besides employing persons with disabilities, it is critical to also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
employ the general population in conducting user testing on the accessible web interface. However,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
existing literature on the perspectives of the general population on the accessible web interface is rather
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
limited, in particular on individual accessibility features implemented according to WCAG. Obtaining the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
general population’s insights on individual accessibility features is critical as it enables us to examine the
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
individual accessibility features from the perspectives of the general population with a more critical lens.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Our preliminary pilot user study findings suggest that the general population regard the accessibility
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
features that they see as either (1) not relevant, (2) no effect or (3) helpful.

4. Analysis and Findings 
 
Our analysis on the pilot user study results from the 4 participants suggests that their ratings on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
the five accessibility features of the CATME system can be classified mainly into (1) irrelevant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) no effect or (3) helpful. This means that certain accessibility features catered to persons with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
disabilities can be beneficial to the general population as well. Accessibility features like “error
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identification” can be useful to the general population as well in the sense that if they encounter
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
an error on the website, they would know the source of the error easily. Another accessibility
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feature that is regarded as helpful to the general population is the “link purpose” feature with a
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
mean rating of 4.5 and the third most helpful accessibility feature on among all five accessibility
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
features is “context-sensitive help”. From our pilot user testing study on the general population
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on accessibility features, we find that accessibility features that promote easier navigations will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
help the general population in navigating through the website as well. On the other hand, certain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accessibility features do not affect the general population, as we hypothesize that those
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accessibility features might act as just “aesthetic” features to the general population such as the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accessibility feature for “on focus” where the colors of the buttons change when the participants
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hover on them. There are also accessibility features that are regarded as “invisible” or “not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relevant” to the general population such as the “focus order” accessibility feature as in general
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the general population doesn’t use the keyboard tab functionality to navigate the website but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rather the use of mouse is preferred.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In essence, our pilot user testing study of the general population on accessible web interface
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seeks to inspire awareness in the human-computer interaction community that the insights of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
general population may also be critical in advancing the accessibility features catered for persons
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with disabilities. Our work aims to advance the existing literature that focuses on employing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
persons with disabilities in evaluating accessible web interface and overcome the limitations of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Human’s perspectives have long been seen as a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
valuable resource in improving usability, and hence, our research seeks to employ the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perspectives of all in advancing the usability for persons with disabilities and also the general
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
population. It is hoped that our pilot user study in utilizing the general population in evaluating
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accessibility features implemented according to WCAG will bring new perspectives to the user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interface design community.

Experimental Analysis of Program Motion Instruction of 
Industrial Robotics 
Abstract 
In this applied research, an experimental study has been conducted to develop a statistical-mathematical 
based correlation for assessing consistency and processing time of a robotized manufacturing cell 
simulating of an automated manufacturing system process such as the robotic leaser cutting using an 
educational robotics test-cell. The correlation is to investigate contributions of programming parameters 
on the performance of robotized work-cell. Processing time has been used to model the manufacturing 
cycle time and consistency of the operation outs has been used to model the quality in terms cutline 
consistency. A set of statistical relationships have been used to simulate consistency and cycle time in 
order to tackle the variability of proposed sources as pieces of time and dimensions that need to be 
processed in the loaded parts the work-cell; in addition the relationship that suggestively correlates the 
impacts. A set of experimental tests has been conducted responding to the predicted formulas for the 
cycle time and consistency. Experimentation factors that have been leveled from minimal to maximal 
values are selected based on the robot’s computer operating system in terms of processing speed, motion 
properties, and termination types the default characters of the programming. Analysis the results shows 
that the correlation can be used to tradeoff the programming solutions objectively depending on the task 
design requirements. The contribution of this research work is to introduce a new depiction of optimizable 
factors of robotic computer programs that directly affect the performance criteria.

Introduction
According to Feng there are many approach to gain the optimal cell design, one of them is multi-robot 
cell design. It means the selection and location of the resources, which, where and how many robots and 
tools will be used. Off-line motion planning optimizes the allocation of the welding points and connecting 
trajectories [1]. André Hengstebeck says the gap between technical capability and practical application of 
service robotics increased constantly within the last years, especially regarding small and medium-sized 
enterprises. By utilizing this approach, industrial operators will be considerably supported regarding the 
planning and implementation of automated and especially hybrid robot-assisted work systems [2]. 
Human–robot collaboration has been a significant research topic since the initial steps of robotics. The 
constant introduction of robots in industrial environments, the creation of new compliant robots and the

Conclusion 
 
As a future work, an approach to optimize the efficiency of the robot regarding final throughput 
and energy consumption is highly recommended. In automated industrial production, the 
efficiency of robotic motions directly affects both the final throughput and the energy 
consumption. Simulating and analyzing the robot trajectories depending on the cycle of 
processing time and energy consumption can be reduced. 
• According to the DOE analysis, the termination is more significant and has more 
correlation than the speed, the optimal parameters are termination 100: Speed 2000 to get 
the major consistency get the smallest cycle time. 
• The consistency and the cycle processing time are highly dependent of the variation of 
motion components. 
• To build an effective program for the accuracy, manufacturing details are to be prepared 
relative the consistency movement of the tool. 
Error issues that impact data is a combination of human and robotic error. Human in terms of 
hand measuring with no constitutes as a deviation, yet still developed a trend supporting the 
claim as such. Robot error because of the grip strength of the FANUC robot used. The gripper is 
not as tight as trying to hold object steady. This causes the tool to be pushed back or forward 
where the trajectory when process is not consistent and far away from the original path.

Analyzing the components of sustainability from the economic, social and environmental spheres in the 
framework of the value network of medical tourism, establishes strategic importance to take advantage of 
the economy that surrounds the tourist destinations in the different regions of Colombia. For the case of 
study, the regions will be analyzed: central formed by the cities of Bogotá and Medellín, eastern conformed 
by the city of Bucaramanga and pacific by the city of Cali. 
Based on the methodology developed by Gereffi (1999) in the global value chain approach, Gattorna 
(2009), and Hald, (2010) in a dynamic supply chain approach, the characteristics of the different value 
networks and their interaction with the different stakeholders that will be compared.

Introduction 
Medical tourism is one of the fastest-growing tourism initiatives. This performance is observed in Asian countries 
such as Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, India and the Philippines (Turner, 2011; Hyder, Rydback, Bong, Osarenkhoe, 
2019). In Latin American countries, the development of medical tourism is observed in Mexico, according to the study 
conducted by Garman et al. (2016). Medical tourism is a manifestation of globalization (Hopkins et al, 2010), which 
involves elements to be considered in order to avoid uncertainty and risk in the provision of the service.    
Medical tourism includes not only the medical intervention of the patient, but also a series of services related to 
recovery, post-surgery, rest and recreation, transportation of the patient to the places included in the service (airport, 
hotel, hospital, tourist sites, etc.), therefore, the importance in the value network generated in each of the providers of 
these services. Considering the variety of operators of the value network, the importance of service quality and 
reliability, the handling of complex situations in the medical intervention and in the subsequent recovery, is 
fundamental. The control of these factors and third-party operators (travel agencies, insurance companies, government 
entities) where complications can arise is of vital importance to appropriate monitoring and control (Hyder et al. 2019).

The objective of this document is to carry out an exploratory review of medical tourism, its interactions with operators 
considered in a value network and compare it with the specific case in Colombia. In emerging countries, medical 
tourism has an interesting potential for development, generating research inputs for Colombia.  
 
Statement of the case 
 
Medical tourism is a development opportunity focused on providing wellness through the provision of a service that 
integrates medical treatment and a service of recovery and recreation. Hopkins, et al., (2010) states that medical 
tourism has rapidly emerged as a manifestation of the global commercialization of health care. It also defines medical 
tourism as cross-border health care, motivated by low costs, short waiting times, and because the services provided 
are not available in their countries of origin. These health care activities are closely related to tourism activities that 
make it easier for patients from abroad to interact in new cultural settings and other tourism services while in a pre- 
and post-operative process or medical intervention (Hopkins, et al., 2010). 
 
In medical tourism. we can observe the participation of different operators who provide various services related not 
only to health care but also to other elements of preparation before the medical intervention, medical care, rest and 
well-being for the patient's recovery. Establishing a characterization of these stakeholders and their participation 
within the value network is very important to monitor service quality and government control. 
 
In Colombia, medical tourism is growing, due to the credibility and trust that a group of hospitals and medical 
professionals have acquired. In cities such as Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Medellín, and Cali, market opportunities have 
been observed and their hospitals have been certified with the highest quality standards to ensure the trust and 
credibility of institutions and professionals. These factors confirm the importance of the credibility and trust of the 
operators that are around the value network of medical tourism; Hyder, et al., (2019) deepens its investigations in the 
behavior of the trust networks and the information medium (Word-of-mouth) that grants the credibility of the 
professionals and the institutions that provide the medical service and the pre- and post-operative care.  
 
Based on the relevance of the development of medical tourism as a competitive advantage in developing countries, 
the aim is to analyze the sustainability of medical tourism in Colombia based on the characterization of the value 
network in the cities of Bogota, Bucaramanga, Medellin, and Cali. Based on the identification of the operators of the 
value network (stakeholders) it is intended to establish their importance and interaction between them and the impact 
on the sustainability of medical tourism. On the other hand, the revision of the regulations that regulate medical 
tourism in Colombia in comparison with other leading countries in that market. 
 
Methodology 
 
For the development of the project, an exploratory and analytical methodology is established. The first phase of 
secondary research will be the review of the literature on medical tourism and networks of logistical value. 
 
The second phase with the application of qualitative and quantitative surveying instruments in a non-probability 
sample for convenience to hospitals and medical professionals in the cities of Bogota, Bucaramanga, Medellin, and 
Cali.  
 
The third phase related to the analysis of the medical tourism value network, based on the characterization of the 
network, from the analysis of the theoretical references and the exploratory results that were developed (Figure 1).

Abstract 
In today’s knowledge-based digital economy, the pace of innovation is accelerating with disruptive technologies being 
discovered and introduced rapidly. The new global business environment has pressured many organizations to be more 
aggressive in adopting innovation and emerging technologies and use them as the cornerstone of their competitive 
strategy. Moreover, changing customer behavior, demand and requirement have led to complex changes and created 
an urgency to digitally transform an organization. In such an environment, rapid transformation is needed to accelerate 
and innovate business activities, business processes, models, and, ultimately, the workforce competencies. In such a 
situation, many c-suite executives are facing various challenges such as rigid processes, risk avoidance, digital 
disruption, interdepartmental conflict, disinterest in new ideas and complacency to move forward. These challenges 
require a vastly different approach to digitally transform a company’s business. The objective of this paper is to 
propose an integrated digital transformation framework by integrating the business-need space (model elements), 
problem space (design thinking), solution space (Waterfall, agile) and change management space methods for a 
successful digital transformation deployment. 
Keywords 
Integrated framework, digital transformation, design thinking, change management, agile, system development life 
cycle, information systems 
1. Introduction
In recent years, Digital Transformation has attracted increasing attention from researchers and practitioners (Nikolova 
and Antonova, 2019; Haverkort and Zimmermann, 2017; Hess et al. 2016; Bonnet et al. 2012; Capgemini and MIT, 
2011; Lucas Jr. and Goh, 2009). The transformation affects every aspect of a company’s business in its entirety and 
leads to changes in the way of doing business (Haverkort and Zimmermann, 2017) and even in its business process 
models (Lucas Jr. and Goh, 2009). Therefore, it is essential to understand the technological options as well as the 
impact of adopting these technologies in the enterprise. 
Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business and organizational activities, processes, 
competencies and models to fully leverage the changes and opportunities of a mix of digital technologies and their 
accelerating impact across society in a strategic and prioritized way, with present and future shifts in mind. 
With emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, IOT, big data, sensor technologies, 
cloud  and mobile disrupting the marketplace in all industries, enterprises are facing a substantial threat from startups, 
modern IT solutions and other enterprises who are integrating these technologies into their enterprises in agile 
processes. For example, Blockchain has created a threat to the entire traditional banking system. Chatbots will be the 
cornerstone of future customer service, such as the work of consumer helpdesks. 
Digital transformation is a highly complex, enterprise-wide endeavor (Hess et al. 2016). Digital transformation has 
become a high priority on the c-suites executives’ strategic agendas. Bonnet et al. (2012) concluded that nearly 90% 
of executives in the U.S. and U.K. are expecting information and digital technologies to make an increasing strategic

Figure 2: The Integrated Digital Transformation Framework 
 
The joint framework is to have one integrated framework drawing from the four identified spaces and the identified 
methodologies. Integrating the joint framework with the other organizational activities will guarantee the seamlessness 
of the deployment and the integration of the digital technologies into the enterprise. The joint framework allows 
enterprises to: (1) implement a single and integrated method that delivers value to the customers/users; (2) set priorities 
to accomplish their strategic goals and objectives; (3) keep up with digital trends to stay effective and relevant to the 
customers/users; (4) seamlessly and rapidly integrate emerging technologies into their infrastructure; (5) lower costs 
through the whole value chain.  
 
7. Limitations and Future Work 
  
The proposed framework was developed based on existing methodologies and literature on Design Thinking, Agile 
SDLC, Waterfall SDLC, and Change Management and align them into four spaces: business need space, problem 
space, solution space and operational space. Attention was given to prior academics and practitioners research and 
findings were considered while developing the framework. However, the framework hasn’t been tested in the real 
environment yet. This research framework can be extended/adapted to any type and/or size of any enterprise. This 
research is not focused on a specific change management or agile method to follow. Future research may focus on 
verifying the framework and integrating other spaces and methods for digital transformation. 
 
Conclusion  
 
In this paper, we presented an enhanced integrated digital transformation framework by mapping well-known 
methodologies such as Design Thinking, Agile SDLC, Waterfall SDLC and Change Management to four identified 
spaces (business need, problem, solution, operational). The framework will guide managers to implement sustainable 
digital transformation practices / principles for achieving an effective and efficient operation. Managers need to 
consider the strategic fit and the portfolio fit of the digital transformation in the business need space and to avoid 
jumping into a solution space too quickly. Moving into a solution space should be considered only after there is a 
sufficient validation about the problem. 
 
The main contribution of this paper is to propose an integrated framework and the analysis of the issues and challenges 
posed by traditional approaches. This paper contributes the body of knowledge on digital transformation research.

Abstract 
India is one of the fast-developing BRICS nations having a great growing strength in mobile and smart 
technology. This technology advancement has enhanced online sales in retail sector (e-
tailing) for high value electronic or sports products and low value grocery or stationary products. The 
online sales increase the movement of products from manufacturers and retailers to buyers, 
resulted huge increase in demand for logistics services.  India is trying to focus on reducing carbon 
emissions without having much regulations for strong implementation.  Ultimately, 
capital cities such as Delhi and Bangalore face heavy traffic congestions, involving public transport and 
goods transport. To avoid this situation, our research is exploring how local 
businesses, suppliers and logistics providers can work collaboratively sharing their resources such as 
warehousing, transportation and delivery to achieve environmental sustainability having 
win-win situation for all stakeholders involved. We conducted in-depth case studies with local companies 
to understand the current difficulties in delivering online orders. We will compare, 
and contrast e-tailing models of the UK with India to suggest an appropriate model that can solve local 
issues and address sustainability goals.  Our research will provide a new online e-tailing 
model to implement good practices to a wider society to enhance quick impact of sustainability.

satisfaction. 
Purpose/Hypothesis: Modeling cohesion can lead to better strategies for forming teams. In this study we are going to 
investigate the effect of gender, race, year of study, GPA, previous course grade and selected prerequisite 
knowledge on the cohesiveness of teams and the extent to which each student feels cohesion while working in 
teams.  
Design/Method: Multiple regression analysis was used to model the effect of individual characteristics on a student's 
perception of cohesion in their team. ANOVA is used to find the effect of team composition on cohesiveness.  
Results: Hispanic/Latino students reported more cohesiveness in their teams, and students with selecting ""Other"" as 
their racial/ethnic identifier had significantly lower cohesion. Black students were observed to report a much higher 
cohesion, but the observation was not statistically significant. Since the population Black students was enough to 
prevent an underpowered analysis, the lack of significance is due to a high variability among Black student 
experiences.  
Conclusions: The finding that underrepresented minorities perceive a higher level of cohesion than White students is 
intriguing and suggests future qualitative research. Keywords Cohesiveness, gender, race, teamwork

Abstract 
This paper assesses the gap between an established QMS at the South African national electricity company in the 
metering division compared to ISO 9001:2015 requirements standard and finding ultimate ways to close the gaps. The 
study follows a quantitative approach with questionnaires distributed and semi-structured interviews conducted to 
collect the data for more reliability and validity of the study. A sample of 200 employees was selected form the 
metering division, however, the response rate translated to 82.5%. It is found that some of ISO 9001:2015 clauses are 
not respected, and the expected requirements were not met in terms of process approach, with 77% of respondent 
indicating that there is a lack of resources and competencies, while 73% indicated that there is a deficiency in design 
and operation compatibility. Recommendations made on the failure in the process approach include the use of internal 
and external audits and the development of quality awareness programs of metering employees.

1. Introduction
The distribution of QMS (Quality Management System) which improves the performance of the company is 
influenced by the organization the strategy of quality management (Solomon et al. 2017). This study is based on the 
gap assessment of the current QMS in the metering division of the state-owned electricity company compared to the 
requirements of ISO 9001:2015. Metering in an electricity state company is the discipline that helps to measure the 
electricity consumed by customer to bill the customer for the electricity used and again it helps to do the load 
forecasting meaning that it is through metering that the electricity company can estimate the electricity that will be 
needed in the future by the whole country. It is therefore very imperative to highlight the ISO family of standards 
background. 
1.1 The ISO Family Standards 
The ISO 9000 family of standards was first released in 1987 and updated in 1994 . The purpose was to deliver a 
standard methodology and framework for defining the QMS in a consistent way, with a focus on users. There are 
multiple standards with divergent scope such as production, design transmission and inspection (ISO 9001); only 
production, inspection and transmission (ISO 9002); and final inspection and testing (ISO 9003) (Tata 2009). These 
three models should be used in control situations, while the ISO 9004 standard, which is the highest quality of a 
standard, is voluntary access to an organization. All these standards provide quality requirements, explain what a QMS 
must contain, without setting how to achieve them. According to Aggelogiannopoulos et al. (2007), the new Standard 
set consists of:

Abstract 
Development of an efficient workspace scheduling algorithm for shipyard manufacturing has become more crucial as 
the modern smart factory technologies burgeon. Because shipyard manufacturing is generally conducted on a large 
scale, making workspace scheduling decisions is not a trivial mission. In particular, one needs to consider several 
factors (due date, resource limitation in the workspace, etc.) in order to efficiently schedule block processing in the 
workspace. A commonly used strategy is to input additional resources into a workspace to shorten the total production 
time. By implementing this strategy, one can curtail the total production time, which can later result in significant cost 
reductions in shipyard manufacturing. In this study, we tackle the workspace scheduling in shipyard manufacturing 
problem by taking the additional resource input strategy into account. This problem can be considered as a class of 
the parallel machine scheduling problem. We present a mixed integer programming model for the addressed problem 
and develop an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm. The proposed algorithm is composed of two stages: (i) a genetic 
algorithm enhanced by an ordering-based heuristic scheduling and (ii) a tabu-search algorithm for local search that 
considers the additional resources input method.

Abstract  
 
The UNEP has identified Artisanal Fisheries (AF) as the most important sector for meeting the twin needs 
of economic development and environmental sustainability. During 2004-14, fish exports from Brazil 
declined from 107,000 tons to 34,000 tons while fish imports grew from 158,000 tons to 403,000 tons due 
to low productivity of Brazilian AFs. Hence it is important to understand opportunities for productivity 
improvement of these fisheries. With productivity improvement and further expansion, sustainability issues 
should be considered carefully. In a project funded by the Newton Fund in the UK and FAPESC in Brazil, 
we explored drivers of sustainable development of AFs in Santa Catarina via a stakeholder workshop and 
field visits. We also interacted with officials at the EPAGRI, the research and agricultural extension 
organization of the State of Santa Catarina. 
 
Findings of the workshop and field visits are briefly summarized below but will be elaborated during the 
presentation at the conference. 
 
• 
The level of technology use in aquafarms in Brazil is basic. There were one or two instances of old 
mechanical technology but there is no integration with the latest electronic, IoT technologies. 
• 
There is general lack of awareness of sustainability issues among most AFs. Since water supply is 
abundant, they tend to think pollution is not an issue. Without adequate efforts in treating the waste 
water before they leave aquafarms, pollution issues could be the most significant limiting factor for 
future expansion of AFs. 
• 
There is a lack of awareness of the fish supply chains as most AFs do not directly deal with 
supermarkets or final consumers. 
• 
Lack of financing and access to banks is also a serious bottleneck for future expansion. 
• 
The AFs tend to work with traditional models of fishing. More training on new business models 
(e.g., (i) linking directly to market, (ii) using cooperative structures to ensure large supplying power 
and consequently winning bargaining power, and (iii) developing future contracts for supply of fish 
to the market to ensure all fish produced are sold on time) will help the entire AF industry. 
•

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to design a future value stream map of the system and pathology laboratory 
process with lean health care application tools in terms of quality improvement in order to decrease the 
non-value-added activities for pathology unit in a public hospital based in Istanbul, Turkey. This paper aims 
to decrease waiting time, sample rejection, mistake, manual processes, and disorders as well as increase the 
suitability of laboratory environment and work safety. Data are collected from personal observations, 
information technologies unit, and authorized employees. In order to measure sub-processes, some 
qualitative data are transformed into quantitative data via authorized employees’ experiences. Moreover, 
data tracking and keeping systems are too poor for revealing the current situation. The current value stream 
map of the system of the radiology department of a public education and research hospital was analyzed 
and the future value stream map of the system and pathology pathway was redesigned with lean health care 
application tools in terms of quality improvement. The greatest limitation is the resistant to change and fear 
of talking on mistakes and low performances. This paper states an example of a current and future value 
stream map showing systematically where the bottlenecks are and how these can be improved and what 
specific benefits will this analysis bring to the health care system. It will be useful for both academicians 
and practitioners on how to apply lean to health care.

It leads waste of time and cost. One of the most crowded Education and Research Hospital was chosen to apply lean 
management methods. In this study, focus group interview is made in order to determine need and problems. As result 
of findings, detail work process flows were created to understand bottlenecks. In order to improve the process and 
decrease the waste, a current value stream map was created. For the activities seen on the map, durations were observed 
and found by time studies and responsible people for each activity specified. According to the bottlenecks, system and 
process analyses, and the study findings, key performance indicators were defined for evaluating the processes more 
efficiently and for categorizing whether the processes were qualified or not. In that regard, quantitative indicators were 
listed, and the method for collection of the data, explanations, and current value sections were shared for consideration. 
According to literature review, suitable lean management methods were matched with each bottleneck. Briefly 
summarizing the findings, six sigma was applied to decrease number of rejected samples. As a result of this, 37 patients 
have been prevented from waiting 3 days to get report in one month period. Secondly, a new digital cabin was 
suggested to be purchased that could provide 36 extra sample examinations per day.  After that, 5S rules were applied 
for achieving system in macroscopy. 5S implementation provided a clean and tidy environment. The clean and tidy 
environment provided five extra samples to be examined per day. A technological device was suggested, as it will 
decrease processing time from 14 hours to 3 hours. In saved time, 66 more samples will be processed. Another 
improvement suggestion was for microscopy unit. As seen in the current value stream map, one of the most critical 
bottlenecks is the waiting period of diagnosis in microscopy. The waiting time decreases of 8 hours from 33 hours to 
25 hours. The last improvement is to transfer from manual signature to e-signature. The e-signature decreases the 
signature process from 5 hours to 1 hour. In conclusion, getting result decrease average from 7 days to 5 days by 
applying the lean methods.  
Even though there are still manual processes in macroscopy such as embedding and microtome devices using the new 
technology would  automatize the process in future. Lean techniques are possible to implement at other pathology 
laboratories in different hospitals which will also have promising results. Many hospitals have similar manual 
activities such as manual signature, achieving system. Most of pathology laboratory have similar process, so methods 
used in this project can be practicable in other pathology labs. 
All in all, an improved flowchart is created which eliminates non-value-added processes of the current flowchart. In 
consideration of all these outcomes, it is highly suggested that the hospital should apply these improved suggestions 
which are also explained and aligned with lean application methods.

Abstract 
A metered dose inhaler (MDI) was modified to facilitate the discharge of vaporized medication. Several designs 
were considered using simple machines and associated parts like levers, gears, handles, etc. The final design 
includes a modified actuator and incorporates several of the ideas developed in alternative designs. A handle 
(like a bicycle brake handle) attached to the actuator body is squeezed and compresses the canister containing 
medication. By utilizing leverage, the force necessary to discharge the vaporized medication from the nozzle of 
the canister decreases. The handle design reduces pressure on the hands and the inhaler design includes a small 
spacer directly underneath the gas canister which improves the efficiency of use. The final design is functional 
and solves the problem posed by standard MDI’s. It is relatively inexpensive and aesthetically appealing which 
makes it a competitive product on the market.

1. Introduction 
An inhaler is a relatively common medical device that is mainly used to treat respiratory diseases. Inhalers are 
designed to release medications directly to the lungs (Department of Health Australia). Typically, an inhaler 
releases the medication is in the form of vapor which is sucked in through the mouth and hence straight to the 
airway (Presspart Manufacturing Ltd). The most common type of inhaler (MDI) consists of a canister that 
contains the medication dissolved in a solution that is pressurized (3M) (Stein, Sheth, Hodson, & Myrdal, 2014). 
The canister has a valve that releases the medication in a vaporized form when the nozzle is pressed (Bespak). 
The canister is inserted into a (typically) plastic actuator with the nozzle facing downwards. Once the bottom of 
the canister is pressed and the nozzle is pressed inwards the canister releases the vapor and the actuator directs it 
into the mouth.  
The other type of inhaler is the dry powder inhaler (DPI), this releases medication in the form of dry 
powder (Presspart Manufacturing Ltd). A problem with the standard MDI is that it requires quite a bit of 
pressure to press the gas canister with a finger or thumb. Users that have frail joints, weak hand or finger 
muscles may find it difficult to use. Since asthmatic attacks occur suddenly and can be lethal, hence it is 
important that users are able to effectively dispense their medication. 
 
The goal of the project is to design a viable inhaler that would facilitate the release of the medication and 
thereby offering a solution to the potentially deadly health issue. 
Several alternative designs were conceived primarily based on modifications of the actuator of the MDI. 
Common concepts and parts that were used in these designs include gears, leverage, and better grip. One design 
had an electric motor that assisted in pressing down on the bottom of the canister. Our final design incorporated 
some of these ideas, i.e. leverage, handle, etc. It was also unique as it included an inbuilt spacer, a device used to 
increase the effectiveness of an inhaler by slowing down the vaporized medication and allowing it to properly 
reach a user’s throat (Asthma Society of Canada), to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the inhaler. The 
final design has a handle, akin to a bicycle handle, that uses a lever system to reduce the force necessary to 
depress the gas canister, and the pressure needed by increasing the area of applied force.

firm grip, and the force required to press on the inhaler can be distributed among the whole hand, and not just 
two fingers. In addition to this, the force that needs to be exerted by the user would only be a fraction of the 
original amount thanks to the mechanical advantage provided by the lever. This is a two-in-one solution to the 
problem. 
  
Despite the added volume and material, the size of the proposed inhaler design is kept small enough to fit into 
the pocket. The front section of the spacer is threaded so that the user can unscrew and clean. This was included 
in the final design so that all parts of the inhaler are accessible for cleaning. In addition, the inhaler could be 
attached to a lanyard and hung from the neck. 
 
 
Figure 7. General arrangement drawing 
  
The issue of stability during handling which affects standard inhalers that require too much force to release the 
medication was considered. Since most current MDI’s in the market have the same plastic actuator may be 
difficult to grip for someone who has limited strength in their hands and fingers. This could cause the inhaler to 
slip from their hands and break. This situation would be potentially fatal given that the user needs the inhaler to 
treat an attack. To create more grip, the actuator body is covered in a patterned rubber, like that of a bicycle 
handle. Having a better material to hold would give the design more stability, as well as making it more 
comfortable for the user.  
 
 
4. Conclusions 
The final design satisfies all the requirements previously specified. Its materials are kept light and inexpensive, 
the design is aesthetically appealing without compromising the structural integrity of the inhaler as a whole or 
affecting the drug. The actuator is designed for easy gripping and insertion of the inhaler canister also, the joints 
between the spacer and the actuator have fillets to increase the structural strength of the inhaler and reduce the 
risk of them breaking apart. The handle is pivoted at an optimal location to create the best leverage and the 
colors of the actuator are chosen based on the drug that is being administered. The handle and actuator are made 
of polypropylene for lightweight and All the sharp edges are filleted out into rounded edges.

Due to the complex 3D geometry of the chassis, the authors considered numerical approaches for modal analysis. 
The simulations were performed in CosmosM with a 3D CAD model of the chassis designed in SolidWorks – see 
illustrations from Figure 7. The modal and harmonic analysis – not discussed in this paper - are used in the process 
of optimizing the design of the robot.

The development and design of unmanned ground vehicles is a complex task involving integration of electronics 
and mechanics, optimization related to terrain conditions, performance and reliability in operation. The authors 
considered such parameters in mechatronics integration, evaluation of the power requirements and mechanical 
optimization of the robot by vibration analysis and Finite Element Modeling, with important benefits in minimizing

Abstract 
Integration across a supply chain decision levels is key on improving investment returns. Integration of 
different time scales leads to large scale problems usually computationally intractable. Different 
approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem in terms of modeling and solution methods. 
However, most of them are problem specific or applicable only to short time horizons. Clustering has the 
potential to handle such problems by grouping similar input parameters together and considerably 
reducing the model size while not compromising solution accuracy. This work presents a new class of 
clustering algorithms to support the integration of planning applications of different time scales. The 
clustering algorithms were formulated using integer programming with integral absolute error as 
similarity measure. Two different clustering algorithms were developed: normal and sequence. The 
models were developed in the GAMS software. Two case studies are presented to assess the algorithms 
outputs and computational performance using utility demand data. It was found that the algorithm is 
capable of finding good quality solutions; and even succeed at finding optimal solutions with a small 
computational effort while providing clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster 
similarity.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management has demonstrated ability to increase profits while upholding customer satisfaction 
(Papageorgiou 2009). This comprises three decision levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. Decision makers 
usually follow the aforementioned sequential mode (Grossmann 2012). Nevertheless, these levels are subject to each 
other, and comprise dissimilar time scales. Consequently, their integration is fundamental to increase efficiency and 
profit. The planning decisions must be carried out concurrently if one is to achieve a global optimum. Due to the 
difference in time scales between the three supply chain management elements, their integration frequently derives 
in a multiscale model which is in practice computationally intractable. Although diverse methodologies have been 
suggested to solve this problem from a modeling and solution perspective, most of the methodologies are specific to 
a problem or its applicability limited to short timeframes. Accordingly, clustering arises as a valid and suitable

takes a few seconds to solve the full scale model. Nevertheless, computational time reduction using clustering has 
been proven in the previous case study. In this case study the focus is the quality of the solution. 
Figure 4 shows the values of the objective function alongside with the relative error compared with the optimal case. 
All clustered cases underestimate the value of the objective function. Normal clustering is closer to the optimal 
compared with sequence. The objective function’s error average is -1.7 %, and 4.2% for normal and sequence 
clustering, respectively. It was found that increasing the clusters number improves solution quality in both types of 
clustering as it closes the gap between the clustered cases’ and optimal solution. Also, changing the weight factors 
does not cause a strong effect on the objective function values. This might be the result of a similar symmetry 
between the heat and electricity demands.

5. Conclusions 
  
This study targets the integrated supply chain problem employing a clustering methodology. Since the use of shorter 
time periods lead to large and intractable models, this study main objective is to decrease the model size by denoting 
the days of the year by typical days during the operating year while maintaining accuracy in the results. 
Accordingly, a mathematical programming methodology was used to model the clustering problem with single or 
multiple attributes. There are clustering advantages in terms of solution time compared with the full scale model, 
while increasing size had a minor effect on solution accuracy. It was found that normal clustering yields better 
objective function, average, and standard deviation error values compared with sequence. For the one attribute case 
study, the error range is within ± 0.5 % for all studied cases. The error grows as the number of cluster increases 
suggesting there is an optimal number of normal or sequence clusters regardless of cluster quality. The 
computational burden associated with solving the MILP model even with the L1-metric still denotes a drawback for

large planning horizons. Nonetheless, the application of a heuristic algorithm helps reaching optimal solutions in 
shorter times. 
For the multiple attribute case study, it was found that all clustered cases underestimate the values of the objective 
function. Normal clustering is closer to the optimal case compared with sequence. The objective function error 
average is -1.7 % and -4.2 % for normal and sequence clustering, respectively. Additionally, varying the weight 
factors does not have a major effect on the value of the objective function. This could be the result of a similar 
symmetry in heat and electricity demands.

Abstract 
The global energy sector is growing fast which requires a quicker shift to renewable energy to 
maintain the rise in the global temperature. Unlike conventional power plants, electricity from 
renewable sources cannot be adjusted easily to match consumer power demand because 
renewable resources are intermittent short-term seasonal power sources. Accordingly, a rapid 
increase in surplus power is expected in the future. Instead of losing the surplus power or 
exporting it for low returns, storage and utilization in other sectors urgently need to be explored. 
Power-to-Gas technology offers a possible solution for optimal use of energy surplus and helps 
managing the intermittent and weather-dependent renewable energies like wind, solar, or hydro 
in a storable chemical energy form. The main concept behind Power-to-Gas technology is to 
make use of surplus electricity to decompose water molecules into their primary components: 
hydrogen and oxygen. Power-to-Gas is not only a storage technology; its role can be extended to 
other energy streams including transportation, industrial use, injection into the natural gas grid as 
pure hydrogen, and renewable natural gas. The goal of the current study is to investigate the 
feasibility of four specific Power-to-Gas pathways in Ontario, Canada. The pathways examined 
are Power-to-Gas to mobility fuel, Power-to-Gas to industry, Power-to-Gas to natural gas 
pipeline for use as hydrogen-enriched natural gas, and Power-to-Gas to Renewable Natural Gas 
(i.e., Methanation). The study quantifies the hydrogen volumes at three production capacity 
factors 67% (16 h/day), 80% (19 h/day), and 96% (23 h/day)upon utilizing Ontario’s surplus 
electricity baseload. Five allocation scenarios (A-E) of the hydrogen produced to the four Power-
to-Gas pathways are investigated and their economic and environmental aspects considered. 
Allocation scenario A in which hydrogen assigned to each pathway is constrained by a specific 
demand is based on Ontario’s energy plans for pollution management in line with international 
efforts to reduce global warming impacts. Scenarios B-E are about utilization of the produced 
hydrogen entirely for one of mobility fuel, industrial feedstock, injection into the natural gas grid, 
or renewable natural gas synthesis, respectively. The study also examines the economic 
feasibility and carbon offset of the PtG pathways in each scenario. The amount of surplus 
baseload electricity for 2017 of each capacity factor is converted to hydrogen via water 
electrolysis. Accordingly, the total hydrogen produced is approximately 170 kilo-tonnes (kt), 193 
kt, and 227 kt, respectively. Results indicate that the Power-to-Gas to mobility fuel pathway in 
scenarios A and B has the potential to be implemented. Utilization of hydrogen produced via

Abstract 
Planning is one the most fundamental steps of project management. Every project consists of a set of activities. With 
the increase in number of activities or complexity of projects, project activities efficient management is important in 
the defined range of resources. Due to the limited organizational resources, activities planning is an issue for managers 
& researchers to be concerned about. A project should be accomplished in the specified range of time & budget. 
Therefore planning the project with realistic attitude is a necessity. Knowing the priority & the importance of the 
activities leads to efficient activities management & correct and accurate allocation of time, budget, cost and other 
resources. Thus, different elements such as cost, time, project staffs' skill & other elements can affect each activities 
weight factor. Determination of activity weight factor depends on the various aspects. To this end, current study has 
proposed an approach to determine activities weight factor applying Data Envelopment Analysis. The proposed 
approach includes three phases. In the first phase project activities have been extracted based on the work breakdown 
structure. Then, the second phase does recognize effective parameters on activities importance. In this phase, 
research's literature has been reviewed & these parameters have been extracted. Afterward, based on the academic and 
industry's expert's idea in the field of project management effective parameters on project activities importance have 
been selected. In order to assign weights to the activities in the third phase, initially the proper DEA model has been 
chosen. Model's inputs & outputs have been determined & activities weights have been specified on the basis of gained 
efficiency numbers. Eventually, the proposed model has been solved & demonstrated in a numerical example.

Abstract 
 
The Region of Yogyakarta (DIY) is one of the regions in Indonesia. Community growth in Yogyakarta 
reaches 1.34% in 2017 which can cause various problems such as unemployment community that continues 
to grow every year. In addition, another serious problem in Yogyakarta is high congestion which is 
implicated by the increasing number of population in DIY. Those problems have a bad influence on regional 
cash which is very useful in the development of the area. This study aims to increase regional cash of DIY 
by considering available employment and traffic congestion. Because the problem is so complex, a system 
dynamics approach is used to solve it. Based on the simulation results using Powersim 2005, the main cause 
of unstable regional cash is the high cost of building new roads, the cause of high cost of building new 
roads is congestion, and the cause of congestion is the high demand for vehicles by residents of the 
Yogyakarta area. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the level of demand for vehicles to increase the cash 
of the DIY area. By reducing the demand for vehicles to 0.00003, which initially 0.00005 has succeeded in 
making the regional cash stable and increasing continuously. In addition, to increase employment in order 
to eliminate the population unemployment in Yogyakarta, it can be done by increasing the growth rate of 
new companies. By increasing the growth rate of the new company to 1.2 which initially 1 has succeeded 
in making employment increased continuously.

1. Introduction 
 
Every region in the world has its own diverse problems. Some of the most common in this modern era are the problem 
of unemployment due to the absence of available employment opportunities, congestion due to the large demand for 
vehicles that are comparable to the population in the area, and unstable regional cash, in which regional cash/regional 
income is an important indicator in development or advancement of a region. 
 
One area in Indonesia is the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY). Data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) 
shows that community growth in Yogyakarta reaches 1.34% in 2017 which can cause various problems if it is not 
wise to regulate other components in this area. In addition, the increasing population has implications for 
unemployment that continues to grow every year. Unemployment continues to increase in line with population growth 
and lack of employment opportunities (Amelia, 2005). It was proven that in 2003, the number of unemployed people 
in Yogyakarta was 96,084 people (Tukiran & Mustar, 2005). 
 
In addition, another serious problem in Yogyakarta is high congestion. Citing the official Inrix website from Kompas 
(2017), the average of Indonesian community spends in vain time on the road (stuck in traffic) for up to 47 hours in 
one year, which occupies the country of Indonesia as the world's second largest country. In Yogyakarta, according to

Based on Figure 7, by increasing the growth rate of new companies that employment is no longer in shortage, it means 
unemployment will decrease and there will be no more unemployment in the community due to lack of jobs. Increasing 
the growth rate of the company can only be realized by the government, for example by helping to lend initial capital 
if needed, facilitated in the steps of entrepreneurial affairs, providing training to the community on how to 
entrepreneurship well, being also informed about the benefits to be acquired by entrepreneurship so that people are 
attracted to opening a business which ultimately creates jobs becomes available and reduces unemployment. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Based on the discussion above, it can be concluded that the Yogyakarta regional cash is experiencing fluctuations that 
are quite large due to the imbalance of income and expenditure of regional cash, even the longer the regional cash 
decreases until it can show the number 0 means that the regional cash will run out for a long time if no repairs. The 
main cause of unstable regional cash is the high cost of building new roads, the cause of the problem of the construction 
of new roads is congestion, and the cause of congestion is the high demand for vehicles by residents of the Yogyakarta 
area. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the level of demand for vehicles to increase the cash of the Yogyakarta area. 
By reducing the demand for vehicles to 0.00003, which initially 0.00005 has succeeded in making the regional cash 
more stable and increasing continuously, so has the construction of new roads which were initially 11,500 meters2 
repaired to 6,000 meters2. This can be realized by the government, for example by promoting programs to familiarize 
people traveling on foot, so that the health of the body will become better, so that the community is interested in 
reducing the need for vehicles. Whereas to increase employment in order to eliminate the population unemployment 
in Yogyakarta, it can be done by increasing the growth rate of new companies, researchers increased the growth rate 
of the new company to 1.2 which initially 1 and succeeded in making employment increased continuously. This can 
be realized by the government, for example by helping to lend initial capital if needed, facilitated in the steps of 
entrepreneurial affairs, providing training to the community on how to entrepreneurship well, being also informed 
about the benefits to be gained by entrepreneurship so that people are interested in opening a business.

Abstract 
Cleaner production (CP) approaches and technologies are top-tier tools to align with sustainable innovation policies 
and furthermore, governments of the developing countries have become mindful about sustainable strategies to 
prevent pollution in recent years. However, only a handful of organizations in textile industry in developing countries 
have embraced CP approaches throughout the years. Therefore, this paper has shortlisted 20 barriers among all using 
previous literature, expert opinion and assessment of the entire stakeholders chain from the perspective of textile 
industries operating in developing countries which fall under 4 major criteria: i) Technologic and Information barrier, 
ii) Economic and Financial barrier, iii) Market barrier, iv) Managerial barrier. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process
(FAHP) which is an excellent tool to deal with linguistic level of comparisons, has been used to rank these barriers to
set spotlight on the most critical group of barriers. The outcome of this paper will act as spur to set sustainable
strategies and goal against them while having limited resource. Finally, this paper stands out as it focuses on the
proactive step to ease the application of CP approaches on textile industry which accompany high environmental
expense in terms of dumping the untreated waste water into water bodies.
Keywords: 
Cleaner Production, Pollution Prevention, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, Textile Industry. 
1. Introduction
Cleaner Production (CP) is a concept that deals with utilizing the limited energy sources and materials used in 
production efficiently and efficaciously as well as superseding the detrimental and virulent materials by materials that 
are considered to be anodyne (Hens et al., 2018). The proper implementation of CP is consummated through 
diminishing the misuse of raw materials and natural resources alongside a warranted utilization of energy, a significant 
reduction in harmful emissions and wastes, and increasing the percentage of recycling (Basappaji & Nagesha, 2014). 
This concept of preventive strategy has become more desideratum nowadays as the world is seeing an unprecedented 
escalation in industrialization followed by an uncontrolled rate of urbanization and population boom. This implies the 
need for an humungous amount of energy and materials to meet the ever increasing demand of the inhabitants of this 
planet which in turn is achieved through exploitation and deterioration of the environment (Severo et al, 2017).  
 It is now recognized and substantiated that practices of CP entrench a higher profit margin in all sorts of industries in 
addition to providing competitive advantages to them (Jia et al., 2014; Khalili et al., 2015). Every industry in the 
developed countries has implemented the principles of CP and harvesting the benefits from it. However, the concepts 
and practices of CP are yet to be popularized among developing countries especially, one like Bangladesh. Among 
the different industries, the textile industry is one of the immensely important sectors in this country (Islam et al., 
2011). This industry is involved in employing about 65% of population currently engaged in industries. Moreover, the 
lion’s share of the export earnings, currently more than 81%, comes from this industry (“Bangladesh Textile Industry: 
Present Scenario, Future Prospects and Challenges,” 2017). Therefore, it can be averred without any doubt that 
implementation of CP practices in this industry will be far more viable and profitable (de Oliveira Neto et al, 2019). 
However, the barriers responsible for encumbering the application of CP are to be identified and obviated beforehand. 
At present, the textile industry of this country is being hamstrung by many challenges such as, government restrictions, 
environmental policies, frequent accidents and death of the labors, riots, strikes and so on (Hossan et al., 2012; Kurpad, 
2014). In these unpropitious conditions, implementing the principles of CP through a rigorous eradication of the liable

earnings and they can hardly presentiment the long term benefits of implementing CP. Also, the professional in this 
sector of Bangladesh are more likely to emphasize on profit margin rather than funding the research and development 
department. So, this is the most critical impediment as it would not be hard to realize how this barrier is impeding the 
initiation of adopting CP measures. 
Management resistance to change (ManB3), technological awareness and expertise (TB2), concern about 
competitiveness (ManB2) and difficulty to access information on CP (TB4) took the second, third, fourth and fifth 
position respectively in the global rank. Management which shows resistance to change as it may include risks and 
does not encourage flexibility and innovation, also shows indifference to social responsibilities are greatly impeding 
the CP implementation across the country. Since, most of the textile factories are using age old technologies and 
process in conventional way, implementing the CP tools will require the flexibility to changes and new adoption. 
Technological awareness and expertise is a big issue for developing countries though the government has started to 
invest for technological advancement, but this barrier becomes redundant from the developed countries perspective. 
Also, the managers and the decision makers are more concerned about competitiveness in price setting and unaware 
of the economic and environmental benefits of implementing CP. Also, most of the company in textile industry of 
Bangladesh are small and medium sized enterprise which face difficulty to access information on CP. Using the 
aforementioned global rank list obtained from the research, critical managerial decisions regarding CP implementation 
can be made to be proactive about the impeding factors and overall process improvement. 
6. Conclusion 
This research outcome can help the organization to set focus on pivotal area to align strategies with the sustainable 
goals and strategies. In most of the developing country, organizations deal with scant resource, goes along with the 
conventional process and hardly thinks about bringing any changes. While applying cleaner production in such 
organization, a manifold barriers can come across to impede even the initiation. However, it is not possible to allocate 
same amount of resource and attention to each one of them. So, the outcome of this research can help the decision 
makers narrow down the list. Fuzzy AHP method has helped to identify the most critical to least critical factor among 
the selected 20 and also allowed both local and global improvement according to necessity. Also, practitioners and 
experts are more comfortable to give their opinion in linguistic approach rather than sharp numbers and to deal with 
this uncertain and ambiguous data, fuzzy approach has been adopted. 
Since this paper focused on the implementation of CP in textile industries of Bangladesh, government legislation has 
not been taken into consideration as the government has taken steps to encourage the organizations including SME to 
adopt greener approach and tightened up the environmental regulations. But the organizations which are adopting CP 
because of the government legislation have myopic view of possible obstruction that are impeding the whole process 
severely. So, this paper aims to contribute in this process through helping the managers being proactive about the 
potential critical barriers and allocate resource and effort to them to get the maximum output.

Abstract 
The leather industry is one of the key contributors to the economy of Bangladesh. This industry is flourishing rapidly, 
but at the same time giving birth to complicated and severe risks in its supply chain. The purpose of this study is to 
identify, categorize and analyze these risks, which are creating vulnerabilities in the supply chain of the leather 
processing industry of Bangladesh. To assess these risks, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy 
comprehensive evaluation technique are applied. Firstly, through a thorough review of literature which is afterwards 
enhanced by an elaborate discussion with specialists in the field of leather industry, four main risk factors (external, 
demand, supply, and operational) and 16 sub-risks are selected. Later, the relative weights of the main and sub-risks 
are determined using the AHP. Finally, the level of risk of the whole industry is quantified applying the fuzzy 
comprehensive evaluation technique. The outcomes of this work point out that the current risk index of the supply 
chain of the leather industry resides between low and moderate risk level. The results also indicate that supply and 
external risks are more threatening to the supply chain of this industry than demand and operational risks. This analysis 
is expected to aid industrial managers in tackling supply chain risks in the leather industry more conveniently.

1. Introduction
Previously, supply chains of enterprises mainly focused on accelerating profit. However, in recent days compliance 
and quality are considered as cardinal factors especially in export business (Paksoy et al., 2019). To support this idea, 
Zsidisin et al. (2004) conceptualized supply risk as reduced quality of products and services caused by delayed supply. 
Also, supply chain risk assessment is crucial to agribusiness than manufacturing supply chain for its seasonality, long 
supply lead time and supply spikes (Behzadi et al., 2017). Since supply chain across industries are extremely stretched, 
many factors are posing potential threats to make the supply chain vulnerable. Moreover, globalization impel 
industries to adopt new business practices which include considerable amount of risks (Vishnu et al., 2019) Any 
potential for unwanted negative consequences towards the supply chain has been considered as a risk factor in this 
framework. In another work, risk has been defined as the expectation of loss where the probability of loss is 
proportionate with the risk (Mitchell, 1999). Now business environment has become uncertain and prone to 
vulnerability more than ever due to complex relationship among the supply chain stages (Prakash et al., 2017). 
The leather industry soared up in an enormous scale in Bangladesh in the 1970s as one of the largest businesses in the 
country and the government welcomed it as a significant growth generator of the country. Bangladesh has got the 
competitive advantage over other competitors because of availability of hides and skins, their fine grain pattern, 
uniform fibre structure and competitive labor cost. Moreover, the agro based economy has helped to proliferate this 
by-product industry with available indigenous raw materials with prospective for sustainable export growth over the 
coming years through attracting both foreign and local investments by assuring business friendly environment (Khan, 
2019; Paul et al., 2013). At present, Bangladesh fulfills the need for about 10% of the world's total leather market and 
the main export markets are: UK, USA, Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, China, Japan, Spain, Italy, 
France, and UAE (Hoque & Clarke, 2013; Khan, 2019). However, this second largest export-earning industry is facing 
a continuous dwindling in export-earning. As per the data of Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), export earnings from

Abstract 
Context: Technology Readiness Level (TRL) has been widely used in the management of aeronautical automation 
projects. However, it does nothing to take on board non-technological aspects such as human factors, organizational 
factors and human-machine interaction to name a few. It has been demonstrated that many projects failures are related 
to a lack of consideration to human & organizational issues. On the other hand, human factors specialists and 
systems/software engineers often find collaborative and communicative aspects difficult between them. With the 
upcoming 4th industrial revolution, new collaborative system emerges where human operators interact with automated 
system to achieve a goal. This statement led us to develop a 7 steps matrix that measures the maturity of a human-
machine system and enable both human factors engineers and system/software engineers to collaborate in the design 
of efficient and safe systems. Furthermore, this scale can be used in conjunction with TRL.   
Methodology: Literature review has been made on existing scales measuring human factors readiness level, 
manufacturing readiness level and system readiness level. This state of the art has made it possible to identify a gap 
among all these structural scales. They focus on one aspect that surrounds the system: either the technological maturity 
of the subsystems, the system’s integration into an operating environment or the consideration of human factors.  The 
following matrix takes a functional perspective by using and activity-centered approach and seeks to assess the 
maturity of a human-machine systems (or joint cognitive systems) to achieve its goals in a dynamic environment. 
Relevant elements of those scales were codified according to the meaning they were making for collaborative system 
design. The first model underwent a validity test that resulted in modifications of the three first steps (S-CERL 1, 2 & 
3). In this way, the model follows an incremental path. Indeed, it is confronted with a case study in the field of aircraft 
engine maintenance. Several elements have been added, deleted and/or modified following its confrontation with the 
case study. Thereby, further adjustments are expected.    
Results: The matrix provides a framework for engineers to consider human and organizational issues surrounding the 
system. It makes it possible to assess the adequacy of the system with its environment during the design process. More 
precisely, it provides 1) a collective thinking on the future human-machine work situation with an activity-centered 
approach; 2) a communication support among stakeholders and a means of bringing together different work packages, 
especially human factors and design/software team; 3) it prepares the operational actors for change through the 
participatory methods it uses.

Abstract 
The liberalization of the petroleum sector in Morocco has a significant effect for petroleum product 
distributors. Since the beginning of December 2015, fuel prices are freely determined. This event presents 
many constraints affecting the balance of the sector plus the competition between its economic players. 
With the halt of the competitive manufacturing’s activity, Morocco's only refinery, distributors must, for 
their part, build up large stocks. As all fuel products are imported, we will be interested in the evolution 
by making forecasts of the price of fuels in the Moroccan market. In order to achieve their objectives, the 
oil companies must rely on precise forecasts. In this context, our paper aims mainly to study the time 
series of fuel selling price in order to provide precise forecasts to the company respecting the permissible 
error margin of 3%. To this end, we worked with the SVR function. The predictions made were quite 
satisfactory with regard to the constraint set by the company (plus or minus 3% as margin of error). The 
error of the SVR function used is about 2,53%. The error in then minimized compared to our previous 
method: ARIMA which error is about 2.855%.

1. Introduction
Crude oil price forecasting has widely been considered as one of the most important but challenging issues in the 
research fields of data analysis and prediction, due to the interactive uncertain factors driving the crude oil market. 
On the one hand, similar to other energy commodities, the crude oil is directly associated with various uncertain 
market factors, e.g., supply and demand, competition between providers, substitution with other energy forms, 
economic development, population growth and technique development (Yu et al. 2014). On the other hand, as the 
crude oil is a dominant resource concerning energy security, the crude oil market is super-sensitive to diverse 
uncertain external factors, such as political instabilities, wars and conflicts (Yu et al. 2017) ( Naser et al. 2016). 
Recently, oil prices have made the headlines of the financial press on a daily basis in Morocco. Since the end of 
2015, fuel prices are now governed by the free play of supply and demand. Now, consumers have the freedom to

The average error equals 26.882361 that presents  2.53%. The error graph is presented in Figure 5. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Error graph 
We can clearly see that the model chosen can be used for modeling and forecasting the future sells in this 
petroleum manufacturing since the error found (2.53%) respects the permissible error margin fixed by the company at 
3%. Moreover, SVR function is a useful tool which guarantees a good accuracy and minimized the error compared to 
ARIMA model. 
 
Conclusion  
 
In this paper, we studied the selling prices of the SSP through the SVR function. Our aim is to ameliorate the 
modeling and forecasting of fuel selling price. To this end, we have prepared our database, and subsequently 
developed the program in Python language which will be compiled on Spyder software. The predictions made were 
quite satisfactory with regard to the constraint set by the company (plus or minus 3% as margin of error). The error 
of the SVR function is about 2.53%. Consequently, the SVR function proved its strength manifested in the error that 
was further minimized: 2.53 % instead of 2.855% for ARIMA model. 
In our future work, we will use another method in this way that will minimize the error more, take into account 
unforeseen factors and analyze the change of fuel selling price in up and down.

Abstract 
Onshore and offshore drilling oil and gas wells have been known as one of the most hazardous industries. 
In this sector, unsafe behaviors, actions and operational decisions could have irreparable consequences. 
Therefore, promoting safety culture in organizations can lead to the prevention of accidents and 
catastrophes. Soft Operational Research (O.R.) techniques such as Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and 
Strategic Options Development Analysis (SODA) can be utilized for providing awareness for practitioners 
to know their complex problems better. Moreover, these techniques can aim researchers to find a proper 
solution for those complicated problem. In this paper, identification and analysis of factors influencing the 
safety culture in the drilling industry are done by strategic options development and analysis (SODA) 
methodology in order to prevent and reduce accidents which are the results of unsafe actions and behaviors.

Abstract 
For many years, researchers improve the maintenance system of all aquaculture technology including the best idea 
for water maintenance and sustainability. The study is coming from a premise that the prevalence of certain factors 
such as pH and temperature affects water quality for pond and aquarium system. With this epistemology, the study 
posits that the idea of combining five different existing filtration technologies to create a new filtration technology 
system that will minimize the effort of performing manual maintenance procedure of keeping freshwater ornamental 
fish.  The logic behind this idea is to choose the best characteristics of existing design of filtration system and 
eliminate characteristics that contribute to the negative side. Using experimental method, the proponents considered 
material selection and system design in order to improve the potency of a design filtration unit which greatly affects 
amount of energy consumed and huge volume of water consumption. Testing was performed to validate the 
efficiency of materials along with their characteristics. Results of the study revealed that waste water can be 
renewed with the use of filtration media classified as mechanical, chemical and biological. The results of the study 
were contributory to improve the effectiveness of water treatment by introducing additional treatments in the 
mechanical filtration, proposing a chemical treatment in one of the stages, and boosting the biological absorbance of 
waste nutrients by applying Phytoremediation. The study suggests that water quality is the key to a healthy 
livestock.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND 
1.1 Introduction 
Aquaculture in the Philippines has a long history that involves many species and farming practices in diverse 
ecosystems. It is a controllable and manageable production system (Aypa 1995). Most of the production comes from 
the farming of fish and other marine organisms. Philippines is also known for breeding different ornamental fish 
which are later on used as pets, home decoration and as well as for business purposes. However, according to FAO,

With the combination of the selected filtration, there are significant decreases in frequency of water change per 
week and volume consumed as per the filtration system is concerned. 
 
CHAPTER 5 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1 Summary of Findings 
 
There are several factors that the researchers considered from performing the study; 
1) Choosing the right filtration for a specific water condition is very important. Some materials can affect other 
water parameters like pH and hardness which is not suitable in some other aquatic organisms 
2) Checking the market for availability of materials as well as the function of that specific materials must be 
considered to achieve full scale efficiency.  
 
The researches have seen the importance of having good and proper filtration materials and system. The first finding 
is that the nitrogen containing compounds (Nitrate, nitrite, ammonia) is decreased more than the tolerance level if 
the proposed materials as mentioned in chapter 4 is combined in one (1) system. This leads to lesser consumption of 
water because water parameters are more stable and clarity is maintained. The results prove that it is an efficient 
upon activating the filtration on the second week and later on improves as good bacteria continues to culture in the 
biological system of the filtration. The plant which serves as the phytoremediation tool grows lush and fast 
indicating that it completely absorbs the nitrogen containing compounds and other nutrients found in tank water. 
TDS value also had significant changes which contributes on the benefit of the effect. 
 
5.2 Conclusion 
From the current study, researchers conclude that waste water can be renewed with the use of filtration media 
classified as mechanical, chemical and Biological. The selected materials such as Lava ring, Honey comb Matt, K1-
media, are the best used natural-biological removal of Nitrogen compounds such as Nitrate. In the chemical 
filtration, Addition of carbon and Resin can improve water quality. Phytoremediation in terms of using the POTOS 
plant is really effective because the fast growth of plant indicates absorbance of toxic nutrients. Lastly, it is best to 
use different types of filtering materials in the mechanical part of the filtration since particles have different sizes 
and a specific mesh is design to capture base on the size present in water. Lastly, Water quality is the key to a 
healthy livestock. With this design it can help improve the Aquaculture society on the given problems. 
 
5.3 Recommendation 
We highly recommend this study to be used in designing filtration or water maintenance system because of its 
efficiency of removal. We strongly suggest that there should be more students who conduct research that includes 
the fusion of biological science and engineering concepts. The world needs to have advanced inventions that helps 
improve the quality of environment since nowadays, the major concern is the detrimental effects of pollution 
specifically, water pollution. If ever the design will get thorough improvement, there are such points that it could be 
a solution to this problem.

Abstract 
Safety programs and systems can improve the organizational safety in the context of safety. These programs 
can not only provide a safe condition for employees’ activities but also can assist managers to upgrade 
safety level, prevent accidents. Moreover, mutual collaboration between managers and employees in safety 
programs can lead to safety culture improvement. In this study, critical success factors which influence 
successful implementation of safety programs are analyzed. Thus, these factors are classified using 
interpretive structural modelling. In addition, the relationship of these factors with each other are 
determined.

Abstract 
Understanding how project-management performance in the early stage affects project outcomes is critical 
to project decision-making process. Our study contributes by revealing how different constructs of project 
performance are interrelated before the construction phase of a project, and how they will impact project 
outcomes. Drawing on theories of project and organization management, we develop a project performance-
causality model. Our research results suggest that the outcomes of completed projects are significantly 
directly related to the performance of project innovation and quality in the early stage of project delivery 
process (i.e., before project construction). Succeeding analysis reveals that communication performance 
before project construction indirectly affects project performance, which has the largest effect on project 
outcomes. The research findings indicate that it is practical to estimate marginal project outcomes 
quantitatively prior to project construction.

1. Introduction
Whilst the modern corporate business environments have been characterized by ever-increasing 
challenges and economy globalization, managers have been utilizing innovative technologies and strategies 
to accomplish and maintain competitive edges (Chan and Qi, 2003). While project management, a strategic 
competency for organizations, is to apply skills, knowledge, and techniques for performing projects 
effectively, successful project management that efficiently achieves the project on time, on budget, and 
within specifications to the project stakeholders’ stratification is treated as key to developing a sustainable 
competitive edge (Project Management Institute, 2013). Naturally, a volume of researchers and 
practitioners have performed numerous studies to identify the influential factors of project success.    
For instance, Song et al. (2007) concludes from analyzing two R&D projects that the initial planning 
conditions and the effective performance of front-end planning management impact how well R&D plans 
and the subsequent R&D processes perform. Schwab and Anne (2008) employ regression analysis to study 
239 movie projects from 1931 to 1940 and conclude that project outcomes are contingent upon the 
perceived relevance of preceding performance and upon organizational control on project participants.  
Furthermore, based on a sample of  56 capital projects executed by 15 Fortune 500 process-industry 
corporations in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Scott-Young and Samson (2008) investigate the 
effects of project team process, project team design, project team leadership, and organizational context 
variables on capital project outcomes using regression analysis. They discover that project incentive, project 
leadership, and cross-functional project team factors are the strongest predictors of project outcomes. 
Shepherd et al. (2011) utilze regression analysis technique to investigate how negative emotions and 
affective commitments due to project failure affect the performance of subsequent projects. Using the data 
collected from 257 research scientists with respect to project teams in 12 different German research 
institutes, they find that emotions as outcomes may affect emotions as inputs for succeeding projects; in

For instance, during the initiation and planning phases of a project (please see the TE column in Table 
4), a 1% performance increase in Communication produces respective 0.90%, 0.84%, 0.90%, 0.85%, and 
0.88% performance increases in Team, Innovation, Scope, Risk, and Quality. A 1% performance increase 
in Team results in 0.17%, 0.40%, 0.73%, and 0.69% performance increase in Innovation, Scope, Risk, and 
Quality, respectively. A 1% performance increase in Innovation results in 0.29% and 0.05% performance 
increase in Risk and Quality, respectively; and a 1% performance increase in Risk results in 0.17% 
performance increase in Quality. 
The MPOs of Communication, Team, Innovation, Scope, Risk, and Quality (please see the TE column 
of the Project Outcomes row in Table 4) are 0.70, 0.34, 0.45, 0.16, 0.07, and 0.38, respectively. This 
indicates that a 1% performance increase in Communication before the construction phase produces 0.70% 
performance increase in Project Outcomes. Similarly, 1% increases in Team, Innovation, Scope, Risk, and 
Quality create 0.34%, 0.45%, 0.16%, 0.07%, and 0.38% increases in Project Outcomes, respectively. 
In particular, Communication possesses an MPO of 0.70, the highest among the variables, despite 
having no direct effect on Project Outcomes. This finding suggests that the project-performance chain may 
generate synergistic interaction effects that magnify the overall effects on the outcome variables. 
Further, the proposed model gives managers a range of Project Outcomes measured by time and cost 
performance. By using the percentile ranks of Project Outcomes measured by completed time and cost 
performance (as shown Table 1), our causality model provides a way to estimate quantitative MPOs in 
relation to time and cost prior to project construction. As such, this study provides a direct benefit to both 
researchers and practitioners. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In sum, this research develops a capital project performance-causality model. The test results with 
respect to the importance of Communication, Team, Scope, Innovation, Risk, and Quality to Project 
Outcomes are consistent with prior studies of the project-construction phase (e.g., Chen, 2014; Chen and 
Lin, 2018; Hoegl and Parboteeah, 2007; Keller, 1994; Tabassi and Bakar, 2009) and overall project life 
cycle (e.g., Chen, 2014; Bendoly and Swink, 2007). The performance-causality model not only offers 
understandings of how project-management performance variables (such as scope, communication, risk 
and innovation) affect one another in the project delivery process’s early stage , but also provides a method 
to compute MPOs before project construction. Namely, our research expands the comprehension of how 
project-management performance variables in the early stage of project delivery process influences project 
outcomes.

Abstract 
DKI Jakarta is one of the urban areas that has always experienced an increase in population every year. 
This results in an increase in the development of the plains of Jakarta and the increase in groundwater use. 
As a result, groundwater is decreasing and the Jakarta area is getting lower. This is exacerbated by rising 
sea levels due to global warming. In the future, it is very likely that areas near the waters will be inundated. 
By looking at the problem, researchers discouraged the project by building a reclamation that applied the 
working principle of magnet levitation as a place of refuge and increased the number of dwellings in the 
Jakarta area. In addition, it can also increase Jakarta's regional income and development can be carried out 
according to what the government wants. With the magnet levitation, the region will be free from flood 
threats and reduce groundwater use which is one of the threats to flooding for Jakarta. This project is a 
long-term project that can benefit the population and government of Jakarta. In addition to income from 
investors, this project can also increase the potential of Jakarta. Various kinds of things can be built in this 
area, including supporting facilities that can be supplied to the Jakarta area such as logistic storage and so 
on. The total needed in this development is IDR 695,580,112,442. This project is planned to start on 
September 3rd, 2018 and finish on November 5th, 2024 before adding contingency reserve.

1. Introduction
Hoping to have a better life is normal, one way that can be done is through urbanization. In 2014 it was found that 
there were 54% of the world's population living in urban areas, even according to United Nations (PBB) estimates it 
would increase to 66% by 2050, 90% of which were concentrated in the Asian and African continents (Widyaningrum, 
2018). In Indonesia, one of the urban areas is DKI Jakarta. According to world population data, Jakarta ranks 9th most 
populous city in the world in 2015 (Malik, 2017). It can be seen from the increasing density of Jakarta which can be 
seen in Figure 1.

4. Conclusions 
 
Based on the discussion above, it can be seen that the construction of MagLev in Jakarta for flood prevention can take 
place as soon as 827 days and the longest is 842. It is planned to begin on September 3rd, 2018 and finish on November 
5th, 2024. The total cost required is Rp. 695,580,112,442. The most prioritized stakeholder is the Investor, followed 
by the Developer Agency, DKI Jakarta Provincial Government and so on. This project will have an influence on 4 
parts, namely the community, companies, local government, and the Indonesian state.

Abstract 
Increasing demand for housing causes higher demand for household equipment. To keep the house clean, 
tools that can help clean the house are needed. Based on the results of the questionnaire on 55 respondents 
in which the respondents were household cleaners, it can be seen that the product that needs to be redesigned 
is mop. ANOMALI (An Ergonomic Mop for Healthy Life) is a mop that can be squeezed by pulling, using 
the back-rolling principle so that the user does not need to bend the body and turn the wrist to squeeze the 
mop. In addition, you can remove soap only by pressing a button, using the Bernoulli principle so that it 
does not need electricity. Mops can be removed so they are easy to wash. Made with a good working 
mechanism, making the mop lighter, aesthetically and still comfortable to use. ANOMALI materials are 
made of plastic and stainless steel. For plastic, Polystyrene (PS) will be used which has strong, hard, and 
high resistance. Stainless steel is chosen because it is not easily bent, light and anti-rust. It is estimated that 
the maximum cost for one ANOMALI production is Rp. 233,000. ANOMALY is made using ergonomic 
methods such as the principles of hand tools design and anthropometric measurements, and also uses the 
Kano model as a method to identify customer needs.

1. Introduction
House is a place to rest, do activities and gather with family. Over time, the increase in the number of people led to 
the increasing need for homes. The General Ministry of PUPR said through Jurnal Asia writed by Anonim (2016) said 
that housing needs in Indonesia until 2025 are estimated to reach more than 30 million units, so that the needs of new 
homes are estimated to reach 1.2 million units per year. 
The increasing number of houses built, leading to increased demand for household needs. To keep the house clean 
and healthy, tools are needed to clean the house. Based on the results of the questionnaire to 55 respondents, the most 
needed cleaning equipment for redesign is a mop. The current mop design makes people who using it has a potential 
to cause injury and fatigue. Poor work posture is indicated when the hand pressing the fabric of mop requires the user's 
body to bend and rotate his wrist firmly. It will certainly interfere health and safety especially in the lower back and 
wrist. Unusual work posture for a long time can cause discomfort and pain in one of the limbs (Mufti et al., 2013). 
Current condition of users while mopping the floor can be seen in Figure 1.

trunk so that it is easy to wash. Made with a good working mechanism, so it makes the mop become light, aesthetic 
and comfortable to use. ANOMALI’s materials are made of plastic and stainless steel. Polystyrene (PS) will be used 
as a material of ANOMALI which has a strong, hard, and high resistance. Stainless steel is chosen because it is not 
easily broken, light and anti-rust. It is estimated that the maximum cost for the production of one ANOMALI is Rp 
233.000. ANOMALI is made by using ergonomics methods such as the principle of hand tool design and 
anthropometry measurement, using the five-step method to formulate concept generation appropriately and also using 
the Kano model as the method of identifying customer needs.

Abstract 
The concept of intermodal goods transport systems is proposed as a solution to the problems of 
inefficiency in long-haul routes for unimodal transport systems. Currently, in Colombia, freight transport 
is mainly concentrated in the highway mode, which has led to a historical dependence on this mode of 
transport, which also causes an increase in freight rates, which ends up directly affecting the economy of 
producers and consumers. 
This article presents a model for estimating a cost structure for an intermodal transport system for the 
logistics corridor between the origin (Yacopí - Cundinamarca) and destination (Puerto de Santa Marta - 
Magdalena) nodes, integrating each of the 3 ways of transportation modes – road, fluvial and ferrous – 
as input variables, with the aim of being applied to a supply chain of the agri-food sector; specifically in 
the productive chain for exporting cocoa harvested in the municipality of Yacopí. 
The methodological model for the elaboration of the cost structure does not take into account the external 
costs associated with the activity of freight transport, such as: air pollution, road accidents, traffic 
congestion, etc. The model is based on the determination of the agri-food chain and the definition of the 
logistic corridor in order to be characterized through the application of the Hierarchical Analysis Process 
(AHP). Subsequently, the model is fed with the data collected in this specific field and by consulting the 
databases of public and private entities that regulate and record the way variables of the model fluctuate, 
such as: fuel, tolls, cost of tires and auto parts, drivers' salary, maintenance costs, etc. Once the 
information has been consolidated, the costs associated with the intermodal transport of cargo by distance

Abstract 
 
Risks are part of the nature of projects and risk management is an important component of project management. Risks 
may appear in any moment and aspect of a project, producing schedule delays, cost overruns and even poor quality if 
they are not effectively managed. Risk management process includes the identification and analysis of risks in order 
to decide risk responses. Risk considerations allows the project manager to make decisions related to scope, time or 
cost baseline during the planning phase and to establish plans to be used during the constructing phase of the project.  
 
Risk response consists of identifying, evaluating, selecting, and implementing actions in order to reduce the probability 
of occurrence of the risk or reducing its impact if occurs. While risk analysis through qualitative and quantitative 
methods is frequently studied, the decision making process related to selecting risk responses is not so studied. There 
are two main approaches in this topic: the identification of risk responses and the selection of actions to accelerate the 
project.  
 
The proposal is based on four steps: identification of potential risks, identification of critical risks, evaluation of risk 
impacts and evaluation of risks responses. Potential risks are identified through literature review, expert judgment and 
field research on site. Critical risks are identified through a Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) which uses 
occurrence and impact risk dimensions to build a risk score (RS) and the detection dimension to build a risk priority 
number (RPN). Subsequently, there is evaluated the probability and impact of critical risks over the project and 
simulated trough Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Finally, response actions are evaluated considering changes in logic 
network, risk probability and impact, secondary risks and contingency required trough MCS.  
 
The proposed method was applied in a highway construction project. A preliminary list of 1,471 risks was reduced to 
303 risks by identifying duplicated and some included in others. The FMEA allowed to identify 8 critical risks for the 
project. A literature review allowed to identify 227 potential response actions corresponding to the four generic 
strategies applied in construction industry: avoid, accept, transfer and mitigate. Specific project responses were 
identified and evaluated according to restrictions such as traffic management, neighborhood relationship, potential 
safety-casualties, construction method and site space. Three responses were identified by the experts: re-design based 
on additional studies; enhancing project management and working in two work fronts. The simulation was conducted 
for every response and impacts over the schedule were identified. 
 
The application of the method showed advantages over main approaches in selecting risk responses. Detailed risk and 
response analysis allowed to understand their impact over project schedules. A decision process guided by risk

Abstract 
Infrastructure construction is considered the way through economic activities are created and improved in a country. 
In particular, transport infrastructure is considered a key factor in economic development and represents the link 
among production centers and consume. However, during the construction of road infrastructure, risky factors may 
affect the project in such way that the results could be presented in a different way than anticipated by the interested 
parties. 
Facing risk factors, it is essential for project managers to adopt a rigorous and systematic risk management 
methodology, which take advantage of experiences in previous projects. Risk management usually includes the 
identification of risk factors, a qualitative or quantitative risk analysis, according to the complexity of the project, the 
design of risk responses and control during the construction phase of the project. In Colombia, road construction 
suffers frequent scope changes, costs overrun and time delays, due to an inadequate assessment of risk factors. 
A research project was performed to establish risks factors and categories that affect the normal development of road 
construction projects in local environment. A long list of risk factors was obtained, so a prioritization process had to 
be done. In order to be sure not to lose a risk, two different methods were applied. To study the risks impact over 
projects, a road construction project was selected to apply the risks prioritized. The research project used Monte Carlo 
simulation considering the correlation among risks and activities and among risks themselves.  
The results made it possible to measure the impact of risk factors on activities and project durations, concluding in 
first place that the project had 0% probability to comply with that established in the contract. In addition, sensitivity 
analysis allowed to identify specific risks factors that could affect the project, which were contrasted to real 
performance of the project. In conclusion, it was obtained realistic results when using local risks factors and capturing 
correlations between the factors considered.

Abstract 
Engineers are spending a lot of time with teamwork and collaboration. Hence, teamwork skills are increasingly 
valued by many companies, and many college engineering courses require their students to do group projects. Peer 
evaluation is a way to assess the quality of teamwork, but this assessment might be influenced by many factors. For 
instance, since we have less female engineering students than male students, many teams might be presented without 
female students. This paper examines whether there is difference in peer rating results between teams that have 
female students and teams that do not. This study would select the data from a first-year engineering course. As a 
result of this study, teams with women have somewhat more improvement in the quality of peer evaluation, but the 
difference was not substantial.

1. Literature Review
Nowadays, since teamwork activities increase geometrically in industry and education (Lawler et al., 2001; Cordes 
et al.,1995; Loughry et al., 2007), teamwork is recognized as an important skill in almost all disciplines. Hence, 
effectively working in teams is a very important ability for candidates who are seeking jobs, and recruiters keep 
evaluating this ability (Alsop, 2002; NACE, 2011; Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy, 2004; 
Loignon et al., 2017). According to the Job Outlook survey performed by the National Association of College and 
Employers (2011), the “ability to work in a team structure” was the most important skill that recruiters are looking 
for in college graduates (Loughry et al., 2013). In addition to the work organizations’ emphasis on teamwork, the 
Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) also requires institutions to demonstrate teamwork 
skills development in their education (Honor, 2012).  
However, the characteristics of each team member might affect the effectiveness of teamwork. There are various 
dimensions to examine team member traits; for instance, Jackson et al. (1995) and Harrison et al. (1998) 
recommended to analyze demographics information (e.g. gender, age, education and tenure) (Kang et al., 2006). 
Instructors should be careful about female students in teams and consider them when they want to form teams or 
analyze the peer evaluation result (Beigpourian & Ohland, 2019). So, in this study we would like to know whether

performance between stochastic and deterministic variables and store stock-outs through predictive models. These 
variables materialize in different types of information, from demographic data like age and customers’ perception 
to operational features like shelf capacity and inventory. While these variables were previously analysed by 
isolated studies, this pioneering project joins this approach to provide an integral analytical solution. 
This research is conducted through the application of logistic regression, and some others such as deviation 
analysis, clustering and Sigma, for selecting relevant family and sub-family products that were the focus of the 
models developed. Moreover, this study emphasizes on some recommended and specific actions aimed to reduce 
the in-store stock outs, based on the insights emerged from the models developed.

Before introducing all the data into the software, a different procedure was made to determine from the initial 
variable list, all the important ones for every analysis. The purpose of this process consisted in obtaining all the 
correlation coefficients for each variable of each model and despise all the ones with the strongest correlation. It 
is important to mention that having variables with strong correlation can skew the model’s iterations; this 
correlation analysis was carried in Excel spreadsheets using the Data Analysis tool.  
Once this exercise was performed for every model and the variables were obtained, every model database was 
introduced into the Rapid Miner software and were submitted to logistic regression analysis. It is crucial to 
mention that the alpha value was set to 0.1. (𝛼= 0.1) 
 
Statistical results from logistic regression analysis are used to decide which variables are significant to the model 
and which are not. For this project, the statistical evidence analysed to take these decisions were: Beta Coefficient, 
Standard Coefficient, Standard Error, Z-Value, P-Value, Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve (Receiver Operating 
Characteristic).  
 
As mentioned before, the alpha value was set to 0.1 so every time a model was submitted to the software and the 
iteration was performed, the first analysis made was to note which variable’s P-Value was less than 0.1.  P-Value 
is the first important result in this type of projects. Once the variables above 0.1 were noted, the model was 
submitted one more time but now despising these variables. This exercise should be performed until every variable 
fulfil the requirement of alpha.  
 
 
2.5 Evaluation 
This phase corresponds of the evaluation of every model created as mentioned in the last stage. Once this exercise 
was performed on every one of the 33 models, a thorough review was realized in every run of the software to 
verify that the established objectives were achieved.  
From the initial models, 3 of them were despised: Fermentados (“Fermented” Store 1), Carne Seca (Dried Meat, 
Store 1), and Naranjadas (Orange-flavoured beverages, Store 2). 
 
3.6 Deployment 
 
This stage gathers the complete information obtained during the analysis including the results and the final 
deliveries for the client. During this phase several preventive actions where defined for each of the stores analysed, 
based on the significant variables. Because of the project’s scope, it was agreed with the customer that the final 
models where going to be deployed in a replicable software, in this case it was Rapid Miner. In addition, a 
dashboard was created as a graphic and simulating tool, where the probabilities of going out of stock could be 
measured considering the different values that the variables can take. At last, a training manual is also part of the 
final deliveries, this manual has the objective of becoming the main tool during the training sessions, the tool is 
designed to explain step by step how to develop a logistic regression model with clear examples, the goal is that 
the client can consider the training when addressing new projects.
3. Conclusions 
The insights developed from the data mining research are results of a subfamily approach to determine the 
variables and drivers of in store stock-outs. It is of great significance to combine variables with different sources 
and nature in one whole system to develop more accurate solutions. Based in a logistic regression analysis and 
predictive models, the conclusions and insights can be summarized as follows: 
 
● 
Demand: With these variables, the customer’s perception was analysed regarding different 
factors such as order and accommodation, employee’s kindness and general experience from 
the store; the team was able to explain how these perspectives have a direct impact in the 
generation of stock-outs. So far, no study with this approach using the survey’s Best Place to 
Shop variables was realized in the store; for this reason, it is recommended to carry out this type 
of projects in the store using different approaches and involving these variables. The store has 
currently potential information from their customers that can help to achieve indicators.  
 
● 
In-store operation: These variables belong to the execution of the operation inside the store, 
such as the defined spaces for the product exhibition. Compared to other retail stores, the one 
under study is in charge and in control of the definition of exhibition spaces and the structure of 
the shelves for most of the departments. As a highlight, the variables of Price, Promotion, Shelf

Abstract 
Mass customization could be considered as a new trend in the apparel industry. Not only, the fashion industry has 
limitations of the short life cycle and low predictability market but its supply chain also faces many obstacles to 
achieve this customization with a high level of customer satisfaction and more flexibility at low cost. The present 
study aims to address the factors affecting the performance of supply chain. That’s why a survey and individual 
interviews have held with apparel supply chain professionals in order to focus on these factors and construct the 
relationship among them through simulation and modeling using a system dynamic approach. The results have 
revealed that the product variety, lead time, return policy and quality levels affected dramatically the supply chain 
profit under mass customization. Moreover, some potential areas have been suggested for further studies in order to 
enhance the supply chain profitability whenever mass customization system is applied within the apparel industry.

Introduction 
The fashion industry is distinguished by the short life cycle, high volatility and low predictability due to the growing 
level revolution which put great pressure on its supply chain management [Chan Alan TL, Eric WT Ngai, and Karen 
KL Moon, 2017]. That’s why a garment variety can be presented to the apparel market with minimum cost and short 
the time through mass production [Mehrjoo and Pasek, 2014]. Nevertheless, it can be achieved at high lot sizes, 
while the consumer demand has recently focused on functioned garments towards mass customization (MC) [Satam 
D., Liu, Y. and Lee, H.J., 2011]. So, it is the current trend to meet individual customer requirements in which the 
supply chain should be flexible. [Roy, N., Komma, V.R. and Kumar, J., 2013]. The Made-to-Measure (MTM) is 
considered as a customized approach where digital patterns are used to fit the garment exactly to the customer size 
using different software like Gerber, Lectra, Optitex, and PAD [Gill , S., 2015]. These systems were developed to 
obtain the pattern using different methods of body measurements, namely direct entry, 3D body scanning, and 2D 
digital camera that can achieve the optimum fitting [Lu and Wang, 2011]. Therefore, the basic block to achieve the 
fashion MC is through different stages; garment design, production, customer demand, the information flow, and 
management risk.[Wen , X., Choi, T.M. and Chung, S.H., 2018]. This supply chain is a sophisticated and inflexible 
cycle [Martino , G., Fera, M., Iannone, R. and Miranda, S., 2017]. Therefore, it faces a great challenge in balancing 
the demand and the supply with a quick response to the market [Ambe, Intaher Marcus, 2009] where the 
manufacturer prefers to deliver the consumer the required product at the exact time in which the lead time and cost 
should be minimized [Lu and Wang, 2011].

Abstract 
Candy industry is facing challenges in production waste. Because of the strict regulations and specifications 
that assure food safety, production needs to meet high standard requirements to deliver final product to the 
customers. One of the principal problems industry has now a day is throwing to the rubbish food that can be 
eaten, but that does not completely satisfy specifications. Candy manufacturers need to focus daily in these 
requirements so waste can be reduced. This same problem is happening in the company where the authors 
made this project. Specifications where not accomplished, and machinery malfunctions impacted directly in 
the quality of the final product. Turning it out into waste. The purpose of this work was to reduce 10% of the 
waste in a lollipop production line in a Confectionery Company in Mexico. Supporting the project in Lean Six 
Sigma methodology, taking as support DMAIC tool. Throughout this work efforts realized in an international 
to decrease variation in the cooking process of the candy will be described, to understand how 270 kilograms 
of candy waste per day were reduced in a 36.51%. This investigation may be relevant for professionals 
involved in food, confectionery and candy industry. But also for engineers looking for a classic Lean Six 
Sigma Project and its development.

Introduction
Satisfying world’s lollipop demand requires a 24/7 production, high standard, controlled operations, and hard 
work. An actual problem candy industry is facing now a day is food wasted because of high standards non-
compliance. According to Tatum (2017) product that was checked and found to be slightly off spec but is still 
good to eat is thrown to rubbish. Companies cannot assume contamination risks delivering final products, but 
these strict specifications conclude in one of the biggest amount of waste in industry. Another challenge being 
faced by the industry is machinery malfunctions. If a machine involved directly in food production has a 
defect, it will impact directly on quality and food safety specifications. Machinery needs to be working 
perfectly and aligned to FDA regulations. 
An international confectionary manufacturing organization placed in the north part of México with more than 
3,000 associates, it is having problem in the Lollipop Production Line since 2017 to middle 2018 (when this 
continuous improvement project began), which contribute with the second most wasteful line  from the 14

4. Conclusions 
Results of the project surpassed authors and the company expectancies. The general objective was 
accomplished, reducing 36.51% of the caramel waste, 26.51% more than the general objective established in 
the definition stage. For the second objective, reducing the average waste in injection process, the reduction 
was a 31.62%, exceeding initial objective in 19.62%. For the last objective, reduction of average waste in 
expulsion process, initial objective was surpassed with 43.93%, obtaining a final reduction of 53.93%.  
It is important to mark that the success of the project was accomplished with the support of the production 
line leaders, operators, and maintenance technicians due to the valuable information provided by their 
experience in the field. The involvement of each person in the production plant was a key factor for decision 
making in the different stages of the project.  
Empowerment of the experts on the process is essential. The experts are the field operators and production 
line leaders. Every point of view must be taken into consideration. Departments aspiring and contributing to 
the same objective have to be involved. 
One of the project limitations was time, authors only had 4 effective months to develop whole DMAIC phases 
and improve the process. Measurements were made only in this period of time. A second limitations was 
automatization tests in the production line. These tests stopped production, in this way authors could not work 
in the project and waste incremented because of this tests. Despite these limitations, and as seen in the graphs 
results showed the improvement. 
And as a final learning, it is crucial that involved parties must have the same objective, so that the solution is 
systematic. It will lead to better control in the future. A contingency plan must be devised to positively affect 
all the people involved. Continuous improvement with the appropriate tools will guarantee foresight for the 
evasion of all emerging restrictions and incidents.

Abstract  
While there already exists tools that can be implemented to improve inefficiency. The problem lies in determining 
where the inefficiencies reside. The contribution this paper provides includes demonstrating an outline to create a 
composite index for the purpose of determining inefficiencies.  This objective leads to the numerical presentation of 
a composite index which will quantify the healthcare industry’s inefficiencies. The healthcare industry has benefitted 
from operational efficiency improvements, both in medicine and administration. The outputs of this index will provide 
healthcare administration a means of justifying internal and external decisions made for specified operational 
improvements. The Analytical Hierarchy Process and the Data Envelopment Analysis are the methodologies 
incorporated in the composite index. The index integrates sub-indices that are aggregated and weighted to determine 
the overall efficiency of a hospital. The index is applied using real data from ten Canadian hospitals which has been 
provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). The index demonstrates the level of efficiency for 
each composition of the index and the overall efficiency of a hospital can be standardized to the efficiency of all 
hospitals using this system.

application.  
1. Introduction
Each industry implements tools to determine how efficiently they operate. In the healthcare industry there is a
need for priority setting, management science tools, and optimizing efficiency in the health care industry. (Bota et al., 
2000) Therefore, a determinant tool incorporating a multi-criteria decision-making process was created to address 
this issue. This tool can be used to create, and monitor, the results that management would like to see within their 
business, or in the case presented in this paper, the hospital. These results will lead to enhanced quality of care, cost-
effectiveness, improved teachings, etc. Hospitals present a deficiency in quantitatively pinpointing inefficiencies 
within their setting. (Baltussen and Niessen, 2006) It is for this reason that the health care industry was chosen for 
running this model. Inclusively, this research provides hospital management with a determinant tool which improves 
the experience, care, and management provided by the health care industry.  
The purpose of this research is to provide industries with a superior tool for determining inefficiencies. It is 
important to determine where these inefficiencies lie, because once an inefficiency is pinpointed it can be analyzed 
and eliminated. The internal management team should then be able to utilize methods of improving their efficiency in 
select areas which will then affect overall efficiency. Wherea,s it is difficult to quantify efficiency, the methodologies 
incorporated in this study are ideally suited for this resolve, as they are measurable, verifiable methods. (Borisov et

As the example of Hospital D has shown, the hospital with the highest efficiency relative to the other hospitals 
becomes the one operating at 100%. The relative efficiency of hospitals is important as it demonstrates how the 
hospital is performing relative to other hospitals. It provides a manner of comparing the relative efficiency at which 
hospitals are operating. If all hospitals are operating around the same individualized level of 45% efficient, then 
relative to one another, it will be close to 100% efficient. But, if a specific hospital is running at 85% efficient and its 
relative efficiency Is at 60%, it indicates that improvements need to be made to be able to function at a similar level 
to other hospitals. It is a manner of standardizing the care that is provided by the healthcare industry.  
 
5. Discussion 
As a contribution to both the academic community and the workforce, this article provides a detailed guide 
on how to create an ameliorated method to measure efficiency. It explains the logic behind its development, the steps 
required to build this form of composite index, as well as a numerical example based in the health care industry. The 
work done can be applied to other industries and can also be programmed into software to create a program that 
industry can use as opposed to building themselves. The index demonstrates a manner of using multi-criteria decision-
making methodology to determine inefficiencies in a hospital setting. It incorporates an individualized approach at 
determining priorities as localized staff determine the importance level for comparison matrices. The composite index 
is adjustable and therefore can be used by all hospitals, no matter the classification. Finally, the relative efficiency 
calculation allows for all the hospitals to be compared despite their differences in classification. In this manner, 
management has two important statistics, an internal efficiency level and the external relative efficiency level of the 
hospital. These statistics can be used to justify strategic planning, operational improvements, budget cuts, etc.   
 
The goal of this work was not only to demonstrate the effectiveness of such a tool to determine individualized 
inefficiencies, but also to provide additional means for an industry to not only pinpoint their inefficiencies but to 
standardize them across it. In this way, a business can determine how efficient they are operating according to one 
another. Nonetheless, this standardization would require that the index be turned into a program that could conduct 
this external analysis while having the internal aspect remains with the business itself. The steps and example were 
included in this paper so other industries may incorporate it, as well as for future research in creating a program with 
the composite index already installed for easier use.

Abstract 
The Service Mold company examined in this study is leading aerospace parts manufacturing industry located in 
Windsor, Ontario. The company demanded a new plant layout for the better material movement to improve the actual 
productivity by eradicating all the wastes in the process with the help of lean tools. In this paper, the authors analyzed 
old layout which was in random shape and identified non-value added material movements. Authors prepared a new 
layout based on the present scenario from random layout to U shape layout by utilizing cellular manufacturing to 
minimize the travel distance of both employees and material. Tools like 5W1H, Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Cause 
and Effect Diagram and 5Why are used to find the root cause of the current obstacles. And Kaizen tool was used with 
Pareto chart to identify the primary reason for the problem.  The future layout is expected to have better productivity 
in the company.

1. Introduction
The authors made Gemba walk in one of the aerospace manufacturing companies named Service Mold + Aerospace 
for Improvement, which is located in Windsor, ON. The company mainly works on pull based system whose supplier 
and customer is Sonaka, Montreal. The manufacturing units consist of automatic and manual cutting, two 5-Axes 
Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines as well as manual and laser inspection process.    
This paper is focused on eliminating waste by removing excess movement of man and materials. The major objective 
here is to improve the quality rate and implement a continuous production between processes using Lean methodology 
and its associated tools.   
2. Literature review
2.1 Lean manufacturing
Industry’s main motive is giving a product/service with the full satisfaction to clients by reducing the wastes, improve 
the productivity, to train the people and create a quality-oriented mindset. Lean Manufacturing tools and techniques 
are widely used in the most of the companies and exported all over the world. So, final execution means of high-
quality products is carried out by the senior management team in order to sustain in competitive world. [1] 
In modern era, manufacturing process is due to two main factors. One of the main factors is a high competition with 
an economic growth while Second is the old manufacturing style are not meeting the society criteria in terms of 
requirements and service execution. Many firms are reconstructing to lean manufacturing processes with some goals 
in hand. In order to maintain the sustainability in society, manufacturers are producing good quality products with low

5. Conclusion 
 
Lean Manufacturing is a systematic tool which is very much useful in identifying and eliminating non-value added 
activities. In the current process, there is a real root cause in it. It has been identified and eliminated with the help of 
lean manufacturing techniques. End customer satisfaction will also be improved thereby improving its productivity. 
By using the cell manufacturing technique, one of the wastes (excessive movement) is removed. So Mura-unevenness., 
Muri-overburden would be reduced. Inventory of the material is also been reduced by implementing this. Eventually 
inventory holding cost will not cross its limit.

Abstract 
As a strategy for achieving regional competitiveness, the interest in the cluster approach has become relevant. 
Organizations in similar processes industries are creating synergies to access for more sophisticated services and 
customers increasing competitiveness and regional prosperity. 
The purpose of this research is to identify the influence of agglomeration and the readiness to create synergies in some 
of logistics activities such as transportation services to become more competitive. The Northeastern region in Mexico, 
which is very active on international trade operations, have a critical mass of transportation services. The data was 
gathered from transportation firms’ executives and secondary data sources. The first part of the research is a 
comparison of the evolution in different regions where these groups of firms have been stablished and their impact in 
competitiveness according to the occupied personnel, wages and total investment. 
On the second part, the multivariate linear regression technique was applied, to test the impact of the agglomeration 
and synergies in the specified region to affect competitiveness.  
As a result, the statistical significance of geographical allocation of the agglomeration and their intent to create 
synergies was display to contrast the hypothesis associated to the capabilities of the transportation logistics firms to 
become a cluster in the selected region.

1. Introduction
In supply chains, the elements of the logistics system have taken high relevance to compete and for some organizations 
is considered a key competence.  
Based on the global competitiveness measured by the GCI (Global Competitiveness Index), a specific index to 
measure logistics competitiveness has been known as LPI (Logistics Performance Index), defined by WEF. The LPI 
index measures 6 specific dimensions of the supply chain such as ""transparency and efficiency of customs"", 
""infrastructure and transport quality"", ""international shipping"", ""logistics competence and quality of the service"", 
""tracking and tracing"" and ""opportunity shipments"". In the 2017-2018 LPI report, the countries of Eastern Europe, 
Asia-Pacific and North America represented the top 10 ranked and Germany was the first of the list.  
Mexico is located on 54th position of the index, being the dimensions of quality of transport infrastructure, logistics 
competence and quality of service, and transparency and efficiency of customs the greatest opportunity areas to 
improve its position in the ranking (WEF, 2018). 
Germany has highly developed logistics clusters, which helps it logistics competitiveness through synergies between 
different actors in the supply chain. 
This study focuses on the truck carriers of goods, as part of logistics chains, in the region of Nuevo León (NL) in 
Northeast Mexico. The study pretends to analyze whether the factor of geographical location of the agglomeration 
and the factor of synergies in transport are existent in the logistics companies in the region to be integrated as part of 
a logistics cluster for competitiveness.

The Shapiro-Wilk test was used, since it is most recommended for small samples to test for normality of the data set. 
The result of this test is that the null hypothesis indicates that the sample comes from a normally distributed population 
is not rejected. 
 
Evaluating the relative importance of the coefficients obtained from the matrix of standardized regression coefficients, 
the importance of each variable in the equation is showed, where GL is greater but not very much than the independent 
variable SN effect. In this matrix, the calculated t-student variable values are observed: For the variable GL, the t-
student result was 4.754 and the significance is 0.000; and for the variable SN, the t-student value was -3.961 and the 
significance of 0.000. These results conclude in the acceptance of the hypothesis of significance for these two 
variables. 
 
After analyzing the obtained results, the demonstration of variable GL plus variable SN confirmed a significant model 
for the dependent variable logistics competitiveness. Therefore, we can accept hypothesis number 1 while hypothesis 
number 2 was not entirely acknowledged, since the variable SN even if it has a significant impact in the model is not 
positive in the dependent variable. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
 
Concerning the interpretation of the results it can be concluded that in the region of NL trucking firms have been 
affected positively on theirs competitiveness due to increase density in the geographical location (GL), as well as 
develop synergies through strategic partners (SN) has a negative effect given the profile conditions surveyed 
companies. This particular case analyzed in the sample collected that companies in the region where the analysis is 
performed, have very low trust, are not likely to share information and generate synergies to compete. 
 
These two constructs as a whole explain and predict a part of the competitiveness dependent variable (R2> 55%). 
 
Therefore, according to the results obtained, the conjoint of capabilities for the initial establishment of a logistics 
cluster in NL region were not totally acknowledged for the trucking companies, in order to increase competitiveness 
for the cluster members based on joint collaboration. 
 
It is recommended to extend this study to other transport modes and for multimodal transport developed regions, such 
as Bajio region and Estado de Mexico so they can be compared on competitiveness. Finally, we recommend using the 
technique of Structural Equations (SEM) to implement an exploratory analysis of new variables in order to increase 
the explained variance by the proposed model, and the significance of new constructs to a greater understanding of 
the phenomenon behavior.

Abstract 
The study is coming from the premise that the prevalence of standards associated with the male gender role hinders 
most of the young women to consider building a career in the field of engineering. In line with this epistemology, the 
study posits that most young women in the Philippines are more drawn to a specific type of engineering program 
rather than considering a variety of engineering discipline as a career option. Using qualitative research method, 
specifically thematic analysis, the study aimed to highlight the prevailing stereotypes of undergraduate students taking 
up industrial engineering from two of the premier professional technological institutions in the national capital region 
of the Philippines. With an end in view of understanding what shapes the outlook and mentality of students to consider 
industrial engineering as a degree program, themes gathered from two focused group discussions were used to give 
meaning to the experience of students in selecting an engineering major in tertiary education. Results of the study 
revealed that students do have a speckled perspective on industrial engineering. The study suggests that generalizations 
about industrial engineering as a discipline shapes the decision of an incoming undergraduate student to properly 
identify a suitable engineering program to pursue. The study contributes to the growing number of literature in the 
fields of engineering education and training, women in non-traditional areas, gender and development, and in general, 
women in engineering.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND 
1.1 Introduction 
It is known that engineering programs are male-dominated profession rather than women. Most students are interested 
in taking engineering over other courses. Women, on the other side are taking business -related and social science 
programs like Accountancy, Business Management, Marketing, Education, etc. Schools nowadays particularly college 
universities are also seeking women to take engineering programs. On the study of Brawner et.al (2012), Industrial 
Engineering program is warmth, flexible, and has more feminism among other engineering programs. Engineering 
consists of mathematics and sciences and girls have found to be as strong as boys when it comes to those courses. In

General Objective: To identify the factors that contributes as to why the undergraduate women are drawn to 
industrial engineering over other engineering majors in the Philippines. 
 
The conceptual framework of this study as well as its analysis has paved the way for the researchers to consider that 
the three parts involved in the conceptual framework also belong to those factors that contributes on as t o why the 
undergraduate women are drawn to industrial engineering over other engineering majors. The identified factors are 
the following:  
 
1. 
Stereotypes About Industrial Engineering 
2. 
Reasons for Choosing the Industrial Engineering Program 
3. 
Knowledge in all about Industrial Engineering 
 
Specific Objective: To identify the various stereotypes about industrial engineering that affects the students to 
be drawn to the program. 
 
Through thematic analysis, the researchers indeed found out twelve (12) prevailing stereotypes of undergraduate 
women that affects the students to be drawn to the program. Such stereotypes are categorized into themes that are 
explained in the interpretation found in the chapter 4 of the study and these are: 
 
1. 
easy 
 
 
 
7. 
Femininity 
2. 
fun  
 
 
 
8. 
Flexibility 
3. 
sociability 
 
 
9. 
Opportunity 
4. 
comfortability 
 
 
10. 
Encouragement 
5. 
Belongingness 
 
 
11. 
Women Empowerment 
6. 
Active and participative  
12. 
Women Development 
 
5.2 Conclusion 
 
It is evident by the results displayed in the analysis and interpretations for this study that the prevalence of standards 
associated with the male gender role indeed hinders most of the young women to consider building a career in the 
field of engineering. The researchers came with an end in view of understanding what shapes the outlook and mentality 
of students to consider industrial engineering as a degree program using the themes gathered from two focused group 
discussions were used to give meaning to the experience of students that made them drawn to a specific type of 
engineering program, which is revealed to be Industrial Engineering. The proponents conclude that undergraduate 
female students really do have a speckled perspective on industrial engineering. 
 
5.3 Recommendations 
 
Results of this study show that women are indeed drawn to a specific type of engineering program and the researchers 
recommended that institutions and organizations should create programs that will focus on women empowerment 
particularly for other engineering fields. It is a kind of need that women should feel the belongingness in other 
engineering programs not just a specific one to eliminate the gender inequality in engineering that exist in education. 
Women in engineering organizations will be of great help as interpreted in the study and such organizations should 
also have continuous or rather more activities and events in the future supporting women that will further encourage 
them to be drawn to engineering.

Abstract 
The study aims to design and develop an all-around air controller. Different design options were considered in order 
to give consumers the best possible design in terms of functionality, safety, economic and sustainability. Four design 
combinations were made by the proponents that include the skin, skeletal support and filter. The design for 
functionality was made of Polyethylene tarpaulin, round plastic and hepatitis virus (HEPA) air filter. Next, the 
design for safety includes Polyethylene tarpaulin, round stainless steel and HEPA air filter. Another design is for 
economic which uses canvas, round plastic and carbon air filter. The last design is for sustainability that uses 
waterproof fabric, round plastic and HEPA air filter. 
The proponents used various tools to determine the best design option. In the trade-off analysis, analytical hierarchy 
process (AHP) was used to determine the best material to be used. It was then determined that the best materials are 
Polyethylene tarpaulin, round plastic and HEPA air filter which is the design for functionality. International 
standards were considered as the top priority in the design project. The proponents made sure that the final design 
project conforms to applicable codes and standards to ensure the safety of its end users. Results of the study 
suggested that the optimal design combination that satisfied all the specified criteria under different constraints and 
trade-off is the Design for Safety. This design uses Polyethylene Tarpaulin for its tube as it can withstand hot and 
cold temperatures. The design uses round plastic for its skeletal support since the material is light though its 
durability is in question since plastics are flimsy. Lastly, HEPA filter will be used for the filter of the product since it 
is the most effective among the three to filter-out pollutants in air.

Abstract 
This design project aimed to provide a solution that addresses material handling and safety issues. Ladders are 
structures used for going up or down that consist of series of bars or steps between two upright lengths made of 
metal. Rigid ladders, which are self-supporting or leaned in a vertical surface and flexible ladders are hung from the 
top, are some types of ladders that are commonly used. The design concept of this industrial ladder is that the stairs 
can be converted into ramp and vice versa, and combined in a single system. The materials used for the design were 
aluminum, and a jalousie mechanism, which is known to be lightweight yet sturdy and corrosive. The primary 
function of this ladder is mainly to be a staircase for going up or down, but it can also be converted to a ramp for 
industrial use. This design project matched with the need for stairs or inclined plane. Results of the study suggested 
that the advantage of the new design over the traditional ladders are: First, it is portable and can be easily transported 
or carry alone within the trip; second, the material handling, particularly loading and unloading of goods will be 
more comfortable and safer. Since it is convertible to a ramp, the porters can use strollers or forklift that would aid 
them in carrying the loads to or from the truck, instead of using stairs alone. To create a better and final design, the 
proponents evaluate different constraints such as environmental, safety, usability, economic and manufacturability, 
and use Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to assess the nine design 
options.

Abstract 
The objective of this work is to develop a comprehensive model for the industrial facility’s energy system. In order 
to model the current energy system, we simulated each technology including the gas turbines, HRSG, duct burners, 
and boilers based on historical data from the company. After finding the hourly energy demand including electricity,

1. Introduction
Determining the optimal power dispatch or energy management strategy in a cogeneration facility is a conceptually 
challenging task. Consider an industrial plant which requires electricity, -either generated internally or purchased 
from the grid, heating, and cooling. This cogeneration facility has gas turbines, Heat Recovery Steam Generators 
(HRSGs), stand-alone steam and hot water boilers, steam-driven chillers, and electric chillers. Steam must be 
generated to meet the process demand, to operate turbine driven chillers, and may be used in heat exchangers to 
generate hot water to meet comfort heating demand. Chilled water must be generated to maintain CHP cooling, 
provide the process and comfort cooling demands and condense excess steam. 
Equipment efficiencies often vary with ambient temperature, humidity, and operating load, requiring dynamic 
models to estimate performance. The plant demand itself (electricity, steam, hot water, and chilled water) may vary 
depending on type of day, the time of the day, and the season. Clearly, operating complex cogeneration utility 
systems based on heuristic rules may not be optimal; a more systematic approach is needed[1,2].  
Given that the utility requirements (steam, heat, electricity, and cooling) for a production period are known, we want 
to determine the optimal energy dispatch for the industrial facilities division. The optimal energy dispatch strategy 
refers to the total amount of self-generated electricity, purchased electricity, and purchased natural gas consumed by 
each technology when costs are minimized. It determines which units in the cogeneration facility should be 
operational and at what levels. As we allow the utility requirements to change from period to period, this can also be 
considered a multi-period optimal power dispatch procedure. 
The objectives of minimizing the energy usage in a process, minimizing the cost of purchased and generated 
utilities, and optimally operating the cogeneration system and the process are linked together.

The results suggest that using electric chillers in heating seasons can be a better option in cost and energy 
saving. Moreover, using a steam based electrical generator can be a good option for the future especially during 
summer.  If gas turbines can ramp up and down within their reasonable part load operation range (40-50% to 
110%), they can save on natural gas consumption and reduce the number of start-ups and shut downs. 
Therefore, the company can manage the number of start up/ shut down by scheduling the GTs in their part load 
operations and they can save on greenhouse gas emissions by scheduling the CHP units. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
this paper developed a comprehensive model for the industrial facility’s energy system. First, each technology 
is simulated including the gas turbines, HRSG, duct burners, and boilers based on historical data from the 
company. Then a mixed integer linear programming approach was used to optimize the operation strategy of the 
current technologies to minimize total energy cost.  Then we compared the optimization results with the current 
situation at the company. The results suggest 4% saving in total utility expenditure and 3% saving in natural gas 
consumption which is equal to the saving of 4500 tons of CO2 emission.

Abstract 
Ontario has a high dependency on nuclear and renewable energy, with more than 85% of its electricity supplied from 
non-carbon-based sources. Due to the intermittency and inflexibility of the generators, surplus electricity (SBG) is 
generated when supply exceeds demand. This paper aims to develop a mathematical model for power-to-gas (P2G) 
energy system, converting SBG into hydrogen to be used by end-users. The four end-users studied were renewable 
natural gas sector (RNG), hydrogen-enriched natural gas sector (HENG), mobility sector and industry sector. Two 
scenarios were considered for the model: Scenario 1, where a single pathway was considered for implementation and 
Scenario 2, where the four pathways were integrated into one system for a combined installment. The objective of this 
model is to minimize the total cost and maximize emission offset with a lifetime of 20 years. The modelling and 
optimization were carried out in Python using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based approach. The 
Scenario 1 results showed that replacing industry feedstock by hydrogen is more cost-efficient than other sectors. The 
Scenario 2 results showed that the system can reduce 470,595 tonnes of CO2 per year, which is 95% of the maximum 
achievable offset and utilize 57% of the surplus electricity.

1. Introduction
To many jurisdictions across the world as well as the general public, reducing their carbon fuel dependency and 
greenhouse gas emission is becoming an increasingly greater priority. For example, the State of California has 
committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 [1]. Many other governments have been devoting similar 
efforts in recognizing the importance of carbon footprint reduction. Until the current iteration of its government, 
Ontario has also been a big promoter of decarbonization [2]. Ontario has a large dependence on renewable power 
generation could be used as an important tool for carbon footprint reduction in the province [3,4]. However, power 
output from existing non-carbon-based sources (i.e., nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, and biofuel) cannot be adjusted easily 
to match consumer demand. The slow ramping rates in nuclear generators and the uncontrollable nature of renewable 
energy sources make it impossible to fine-tune the output of these power plants. Therefore, a constant discrepancy 
between supply and demand is inevitable [4]. 
When electricity supply exceeds demand, surplus electricity is generated, which Ontario lacks an internal market for 
an effective management system. This surplus generation is currently managed by exportation and curtailment, which 
is a process where the capacity of generators is involuntarily reduced, resulting in economic loss [5]. There exists an 
opportunity to develop a storage system of the sort that uses this surplus generation. This will allow for higher 
utilization of non-carbon energy within Ontario, achieving carbon emission reduction, while preventing excess green 
energy from involuntary exports or curtailment. 
As a response to this opportunity, a Power-to-Gas (P2G) system is recommended. P2G is a system in which the surplus 
generation could be stored and distributed as chemical energy, effectively linking the supply from the power grid to 
the demand in the gas grid. Briefly, a P2G system uses the surplus electricity generation to facilitate hydrolysis via

5. Conclusion 
 
Based on the scenario 1 model results, the most dominant component contributing to the capital cost (CAPEX) is 
hydrogen storage tanks across all pathways. The second largest cost is PEM electrolyzers in all pathways except for 
the transportation pathway. The most dominant component contributing to annual operating cost (OPEX) is 
purchasing electricity for all four pathways. There is also a significant cost regarding purchasing carbon dioxide gas 
for methanation reaction for RNG. Based on the cost per emission offset, the industry pathway seemed to be the most 
efficient in terms of achieving the greatest reduction in carbon emission with a given budget. 
Based on the scenario 2 model results, the model required 1,705 electrolyzers, 1,386 pre-storage compressors, and 
514 booster compressors, 74,533 storage tanks at the total lifetime cost of 47.5 billion dollars and achieved an emission 
reduction of 470,595 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year of operation, which is 95% of the maximum achievable offset. 
Notably, the cost of the combined system is greater than the sum of the costs of the individual systems from Scenario 
1, which was 39.6 billion dollars. This was due to more storage units being required as the hours with little to no 
surplus generation required a greater amount of hydrogen production at once in the combined model, which meant 
that a larger volume of hydrogen had to be stored in previous hours. On the other hand, if one pathway within the 
combined model had to be chosen for expansion, the industry pathway would be the best choice, as it is the most 
efficient pathway to achieve the lowest unit cost per emission offset.

Abstract 
Wind energy has been growing fast and is recognized as the most successful energy source among all the alternative 
energy sources. However, due to the low utilization rate, the spread of small-scale wind power generator is progressing 
slowly. In this paper, the stator teeth pairing design is studied to reduce the cogging torque of the dual radial flux 
permanent magnet generator for small scale wind turbines. The proposed method is capable to minimize the 
characteristic deterioration due to cogging torque reduction through an asymmetric design of teeth width. The 
proposed design method is verified through finite element analysis.

1. Introduction
Development of renewable energy used in urban environments is of growing interest to industry and local 
governments as an alternative to utility-based and non-renewable forms of electric production. In particular, Wind 
energy has been growing fast and is recognized as the most successful energy source among all the alternative energy 
sources [1-3]. However, due to the low utilization rate, the spread of small-scale wind power generator is progressing 
slowly. 
The vibration and noise of the generator are caused by cogging torque produced by attraction force between rotor 
magnet and stator core. And it also determines the cut-in speed of wind turbine.  
Various methods for reducing the cogging torque such as skew, notch, pole-arc and slot opening optimization have 
been studied in the existing studies, but they are not widely used due to the drawbacks of deteriorating the 
characteristics of the generator and difficulties in manufacturing [4-9]. 
Dual radial flux permanent magnet generator (DRFPMG) has higher efficiency and power density than conventional 
generator because of high output voltage and space utilization. Cogging torque of DRFPMG is can be easily canceled 
by cogging torque phase shift of inner and outer stator.  
However, the complete cancellation is difficult due to the cogging torque difference between the inner stator and 
outer stator. In addition, there is a disadvantage that the cogging torque reduction amount is greatly changed according 
to the assembly tolerance due to the multi-pole structure. 
In this paper, the stator teeth pairing design is studied to reduce the cogging torque of the DRFPMG for small scale 
wind turbines. The proposed method is capable to minimize the characteristic deterioration due to cogging torque 
reduction through an asymmetric design of teeth width. 
The proposed method minimizes the cogging torque sum by designing the teeth width of the inner stator and the 
outer stator core asymmetrically. It is easier to manufacture than the method of offsetting the phase of the cogging 
torque of the conventional inner stator and the outer stator.

The aim of this study is to minimize the cogging torque of DRFPMG through a stator teeth pairing optimization. 
As a result of optimization, the cogging torque is reduced about 67[%] compared with the initial model. By applying 
the proposed cogging torque reduction method, the cogging torque can be reduced without degrading the efficiency.

Abstract 
 
The design and operation of energy systems, specifically those driven by chemical processes such as 
gasification and coal combustion have long been associated with theoretical modelling studies done within 
chemical engineering. However, with the rising need to face challenges brought upon by a warming climate 
and increased emissions from fossil fuel sources, there is significant interest in being able to design and operate 
systems that can harness the power of renewable energy sources while also providing economic benefits 
derived from operating them in a flexible manner. Mathematical modelling of such systems will therefore 
need to borrow concepts from chemical process engineering as well as power systems engineering and energy 
economics. The project currently being undertaken involves the mathematical modeling and optimization of 
a polygeneration-based energy system. Existing research in the area of modeling and optimization of systems 
behaving as a polygeneration plant, have primarily included the use of coal or biomass gasification to obtain 
syngas. With this key unit operation as the foundation, the energy systems have been designed in a manner 
in which they depend on the syngas produced to drive both the production of power as well as value added 
chemicals and liquid fuels. In this project, the key difference in the design is the inclusion of renewable energy 
sources, specifically intermittent sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar power. Additionally, 
aside from the syngas derived from gasification unit, power derived from other established pathways are also 
included, namely natural gas combined cycle process as well direct coal combustion processes. The main 
contribution from this project would be to look closely into the behavior of these energy pathways and 
investigate how and to what extent the energy system can be made more flexible while also taking into account 
that we seek to maximize profitability from the perspective of the operator. The flexibility of the 
polygeneration optimization framework can be obtained by reformulating it into a stochastic optimization 
problem. By doing so, the uncertainty and intermittency of renewable energy sources, domestic electrical and 
chemicals demand can be accounted for and accordingly, operational and design decisions can enhance the 
flexibility of the system based on intermittence/uncertain data assumptions. The integration of these 
intermittent sources into polygeneration mathematical framework requires some electrical engineering (i.e. 
power system mathematical modelling) background. The resultant polygeneration system is expected to act 
as a smart tool with which the interactions between chemical process plants and power plants (i.e. either

Abstract 
 
To develop products that achieve high customer satisfaction, product developers have to make decisions during the 
early phase of product development, regarding the customer and user experienceable properties. Traditional 
development approaches have to rely on market analysis, but lack a long-term perspective. By integrating forecast 
methods like scenarios technology, Marthaler developed an approach that allows the development of multiple product 
generations. This approach currently focuses on market pull strategies. (Marthaler et al., 2019) This article introduces 
an approach that expands the current approach by focusing on technology push strategies and delivers a method 
specifically designed for technology push strategies. With this approach innovations can be developed, by utilizing 
reference systems from other industry sectors. The utilization and subsequent surveys with employees of the BMW 
AG confirmed the applicability of the approach in their product development process.

 1. Motivation 
The efficient and effective design of innovation processes is the central task of innovation management. This means 
that innovations can only be successful if, on the one hand, current and future customer needs are met and, on the 
other hand, they can be developed and produced in a cost-efficient way (Weissenberger-Eibl & Joachim, 2009). An 
innovation that targets a specific need that has been identified in the market is referred to as application-oriented 
innovation or pull innovation. This is a method of positioning the product with a low market acceptance risk. In 
contrast, technology-oriented innovation or push innovation is used when companies have their own technologies, 
concepts and ideas and aim at realizing them as products for use cases in new markets. The risk of the market 
acceptance of the product is higher because the product was not developed based on specific needs. This means that 
technology push innovations generally have a lower probability of success in the market than pull innovations, as they 
do not result directly from recognizable market requirements (Hofbauer, Körner, Nikolaus & Poost, 2009). In contrast, 
however, the degree of innovation is very high since push strategies aim at breakthrough innovations through their 
massive R&D investments, some of which also flow into basic research (Souder, 1989). 
Studies show that decisions made in the early phase of product development determine the success of products on the 
market (Tobias & Hansgeorg, 2009). In order to increase the probability of success of push innovations, an assessment 
of potential and future must be made in order to support the early phase with suitable marketing and environment 
measures.  
Technology and market innovations underline that a company can only produce successful product innovations if 
there is an integration between market and technology opportunities (Hofbauer et al., 2009). There are already 
numerous methods that can be used to find a technical solution based on a demand. What is currently not addressed 
is the decision as to whether the new technology can be introduced to the market as products with future thinking, for 
example scenarios technology.   
Numerous ideas or technologies already exist at BMW AG, but it is not always clear which ones will be introduced 
to the market. It is also a challenge for every large corporation to sit together for certain issues and work more

According to the results of the first survey, the project manager did not change his opinion much and evaluated the 
systematic approach in terms of system and process as good.  
All participants gave a negative assessment for P4. 
•
P4: The systematic can be integrated into existing product development processes.
6 Interpretation and outlook 
The results of the Delphi survey show concrete possibilities to make the systematic approach applicable with the 
""technology push"" strategy. Most of the success factors are assessed positively by the project manager, but there are 
still a few factors like M2, M3, S3 and P3 that were assessed with a large deviation. 
It is due to the fact that the systematic approach is very complicated, and very quickly presented. In principle, 
employees from different departments only get a glimpse of the systematic's sub-steps. In order to create a holistic 
view, the entire systematic approach was presented in 15 minutes so that they could also participate in the survey. The 
sub-step that is relevant to the corresponding employee was presented intensively and in detail. However, not every 
sub-step includes foresight or future thinking, so it is difficult for some employees to judge whether they have fully 
understood the entire process and it is not intuitive for them to apply the systematic approach. If this is the case, the 
deviation from the success factor M3 is also explained. 
In addition. there is the problem that the systematic approach is very difficult to master in a short time. In order to 
carry out the systematic, the project manager must fully understand it. In order to deliver efficient work, the other 
participants must not know what is behind a sub-step, which is why there are sometimes employees who only give 
simple input information and are not allowed to expect or receive any output information. For this reason, success 
factor S3 has a large deviation.  
In addition to the large deviation, the systematic approach also has negative success factors like M6, M9 and P4. 
The project manager of the pre-development strategy expressed that he could hardly perceive any chances or risks 
from the systematic approach. The development history and the completed development projects were also not 
compared since the technology is completely new. The systematic approach has made a leap from maturity level 0 to 
maturity level 3 in the BMW Maturity Process.

Abstract 
Flowshop Scheduling Problem (FSP) is a common but not trivial problem in manufacturing scheduling. 
Lower bound (LB) measures can provide a reasonable estimation considering makespan minimization. This 
paper deals with an analysis of a LB measure comparing with the CDS heuristic and the optimal solution 
of FSP. Performed simulations varying the number of jobs (N) and machines (M) with processing times 
following uniform and exponential distributions show that the discrepancies between the solutions tend to 
increase until N<M and decrease for N>M, with largest discrepancy observed for N=M. The divergences 
tend to be larger when greater variability on processing times is considered. 
Keywords 
Lower bound analysis, Flowshop scheduling; CDS heuristic. 
1. Introduction
In Flowshop Scheduling Problems (FSP), a set of N jobs has to be processed in a predefined same sequence of M 
machines. The job processing time in each machine is known, and in most cases, the main problem consists to find a 
schedule that minimizes the makespan, i.e., the time difference between the end of the last job on the last machine, 
and the start of the first job on the first machine (Taillard, 1990). According to Gupta and Stafford (2006), the 
makespan minimization is the most studied criteria since the publication of Johnson’s seminal paper in 1954. In FSP 
the sequence of machines of all jobs is known and each operation starts only after the end of the last one. Generally, 
finding the optimal solution of this problem is often difficult due its complexity regarding computation time. The 
complexity to find the best processing sequence of N jobs over the set of N! plans is considered NP-hard (Askin and 
Standridge, 1993). Scheduling is one of the most important decisions in production control systems. Hence, this paper 
aims to develop a makespan Lower Bound (LB) analysis comparing the LB measure defined by Askin and Standridge 
(1993) and the performance of a heuristic proposed by Campbell, Dudek and Smith (1970) (CDS heuristic). Further, 
optimal solutions for FSP problems with reduced number on jobs were evaluated and compared with those obtained 
with the heuristic and the LB measure. The discrepancies between these three makespan measures (LB, heuristic and 
optimal solution) for different number of jobs, number of machines and probability distribution of processing times 
may be the starting point for the gross estimation of production capacity necessary to process a set of jobs. 
2. Mathematical Models and Heuristic Methods
The FSP with makespan minimization has been a recurring subject of studies since Johnson (1954) proposed an exact

different manufacturing instances is presented. Additionally relations between these values and the makespan obtained 
from exact scheduling solutions were also included in the analysis. 
Simulation results show that with the progressive increase of the number of jobs in the shop, the relative discrepancy 
of the makespan value obtained with the CDS heuristic tends to increase to the value of the respective makespan LB 
until the number of jobs is equal to the number of machines in manufacturing (N=M). Additional increments of jobs 
from N=M lead to diminishing the relative discrepancy. On the other side, with more jobs in the shop higher makespan 
values are expected even if lower ratios between LB and CDS makespan are observed. 
Additionally, further simulations analyses with lower number of jobs and machines were performed to the aim to 
identify how close the CDS heuristic and the LB would be situated from optimal makespan solution. Instances with 
10, 20, 40 and 50 jobs and 10 machines were simulated and solved with a GAMS model. In terms of ratios, the values 
obtained for the relative makespan discrepancies were similar to those observed for the relationship between the values 
obtained with the CDS heuristic and its LB. Because the makespan value of optimal solution is always included 
between the makespan found by the heuristic and its LB, the value of the optimal solution tends to be closer the former 
with increasing number of jobs in the shop. Thus, it can be said that, in a shop with many machines and few jobs, the 
heuristic shows average results near optimal solution while for shops with many jobs and few machines, the lower 
bound seems to be a good estimate for the optimal makespan.

Abstract 
 
The research conducted in this study is aimed at enhancing warehouse performance in picking by sequence 
optimization, as the travel time covers most storage collection processes, the right order of picking lines in 
a batch is critical to attaining high productivity. For research conducted at the manufacturer in the business 
segment of electronic devices, the quantitative assessment showed an overall improvement potential of 7.4 
%, but in contrast to the systematic routing inquiry, the sequences generated by the LSO may seem illogical 
to the picker-a qualitative assessment must be considered to identify sequence patterns and discuss the 
methodology. Consequently, the measurements of warehouse performance have become a buzz word 
amongst scholars and industry practitioners. Despite the fact that the concept of warehouse performance is 
attending higher level of significance in western countries, America, Asia, due to its ability to smooth the 
business environment, in Africa, particularly in South Africa the integration and adoption of warehouse 
performance concept are facing several challenges. To date, over the past decade, a number of research 
have been done in the past decades to address these issues of warehouse performance in the manufacturing 
sector and there is still gab in the current literature review, therefore the objective of this research is to 
review and assess storage performance in the manufacturing industry. The results of the critical analysis of 
the current literature clearly show that there are flaws in the current body language related to storage 
performance. However very few studies were carried out from warehouse performance in South Africa, the 
overall of this study is to fill this gap by means of critically analyzing studies that were developed or 
conducted in the field of warehousing.

1. Introduction   
  
Today’s market environment is very competitive; the pressure is more on to organizations to find new better ways to 
add value and to deliver goods to end-user grow even stronger. The expanding demand for companies to compete with 
its products globally in terms of costing, proper quality materials and other services have had a rise to the desire to 
come up with more innovative or effective storage techniques. Storing has become the critical function with the 
increase of mass production systems, storage is where goods are stored and it is a distribution centre for raw and 
finished materials. Therefore warehousing and distributions centre have similar functions, as goods are stored (Coyle 
at el, 2003). They both perform vital functions of storage and movements of products (Langevin and Riopel Diana, 
2005). The warehouse is the critical function in any company, whereby organizations can supply customized or 
structured resources/services for their consumers in order to have an advantage over their competitors. This means

Abstract 
The manufacturing sector is the second largest sector after agriculture in Pakistan. It represents 15.3% of the total 
workforce. To strengthen the large-scale industrialization with respect to economy and employment in manufacturing, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) act as a source. Achieving sustainability for manufacturing SMEs is a great 
challenge since they do not comply with the economic, social, and environmental objectives of sustainability. Product 
remanufacturing and reuse are appropriate strategies for bringing sustainability to economically growing countries such 
as Pakistan where consumption of resources (i.e. materials, energy etc.) is of crucial consideration. Moreover, Industry 
4.0 revolution unlocked the potential of remanufacturing by giving the concept of smart factory design and smart 
services. 
It is good to note that the development of the remanufacturing industry is still undercover, neglected, and 
environmentally unfriendly, which become the main focus of this current research. This article includes a case study 
which enlightens the existing situation of auto-part remanufacturing in Pakistan. It presents a framework for sustainable 
manufacturing assessment of the existing remanufactured product to make it technically, economically, 
environmentally, and socially sustainable. The sustainable manufacturing criteria for assessment used during this 
current study are reliability, employment, life-cycle cost, and green environment. Lastly, it is also to exemplify how 
technology facilitators from Industry 4.0 can impact the automotive remanufacturing.  
This research will provide a leading-edge to the automotive SMEs through proposing a sustainable manufacturing 
assessment model and integrated improvement framework. This will address the socio-economic and the environmental 
objectives of remanufacturing in Pakistan.

Abstract 
 
Sputtering involves ejection of atoms from a surface upon impingement by energetic ions generated by a 
plasma. The plasma is created by a large potential difference (2 kV) between the cathode and anode in 
vacuum and it contains both electrons and ions. These ions get accelerated towards the target (cathode) to 
eject the adatoms of the target that deposits onto the substrate to form a thin film. The deposition rate of 
sputtering depends on the plasma density; higher plasma density increases the ions involved in 
bombardment of the target. Like any other manufacturing process, sputtering technology is associated with 
sustainability aspects such as control of the plasma density, input potential voltage and current, efficiency 
of sputtering (sputtering yield, mean free path), cooling system (input water and cooling power), 
temperature (substrate and target) and maintenance of the sputtering systems. Issues of production rates, 
automation and mass production are also very important for sustainable manufacturing process including 
sputtering technology. Optimization of the process parameters for deposition of specific films should 
consider these sustainability issues. This article highlights these sustainable issues with an effort to evaluate 
the sustainability of sputtering as a thin film deposition technology using HHV TF500 Thin Film Deposition 
System as a case study.

1. Introduction   
 
Sputtering process involves ejection of atoms from the source material (target) through ion bombardment and 
deposition of those atoms onto a substrate surface. The subsequent diffusion and condensation of the atoms onto the 
substrate surface result into formation of continuous films. Usually, the target is the cathode while the substrate is the 
anode. Sputtering is a non-thermal vaporization and non-chemical process, which means that the atoms from the 
cathode (target) are physically ejected and physically deposited onto the anode substrate. The process takes place 
inside a vacuum chamber, which is created by low pressure plasma (~ 5 mTorr) or higher plasma pressure of up to 30 
mTorr. There are various parameters which affect this process, namely target and substrate material types, bias voltage, 
sputtering power, substrate temperature, target temperature, argon gas flowrate, reactive gas flowrates and ratios, 
target-substrate separation distance, substrate holder rotational speed, base vacuum, target-substrate geometry,

This means that there is less human interruption on the actual process as from vacuuming to cooling of the deposited 
films. The automatic control and monitoring have enhanced the routine flexibility of the sputtering processes since it 
is possible to combine various process parameters to achieve specific quality of thin films. For instance, by combining 
various process parameters (optimized), it has been possible to deposit fractal or ordered films for different 
applications (Mwema et al. 2018). Additionally, as stated earlier, the capability of the sputtering process to use nearly 
all types of target materials is an aspect of routine flexibility.     
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Sustainability aspects of sputtering as a novel manufacturing process of thin and thick films have been identified and 
described. In studying sustainability of sputtering, the following topics ought to be considered: 
• 
The interplay between the processing parameters (pressures, power, temperature, cooling, flowrates, voltage, etc.) 
and the energy utilization of the facility. Optimization of the processes should also consider the energy 
consumption of the system in addition to the quality of the films.   
• 
The material and maintenance of the system in relationship to wastage, safety, environment and cost. The choice 
of the target and substrate materials should go beyond the mere application of the deposited films-should account 
for safety, reduced waste, clean environment, cost effectiveness and safety.  
• 
In line of industry 4.0, these systems are automated and exhibit routine flexibility. Machine flexibility and material 
handling processes should be enhanced.

Abstract 
In this article, a detailed image analysis on the field emission scanning electron microscopy of aluminum 
thin films sputtered on stainless steel substrates was presented. The effect of RF power on the structural 
and topography characteristics of the films was described. The physical observations of the surface 
micrographs, quantitative particle size and distribution, fractal dimensions, average surface roughness and 
widths of the multifractal spectra of all the films were related to the change in RF power. There existed a 
correlation between increasing RF power and fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum whereas there 
was no relationship established between power and height roughness of the films. Fractal and multifractal 
approaches appeared to provide better description of the effect of RF power on the sputtered Al thin films.

1. Introduction
Deposition of aluminum thin films through sputtering method has been embraced extensively due to the potential to 
obtain high quality films for various applications (Kelly and Arnell 2000). It is possible to tune the sputtering 
parameters to achieve the required properties of the Al thin films. There are various parameters of the sputtering 
process which can influence the characteristics of the Al thin films. Some of the parameters include the base pressure, 
sputtering gas pressure, argon gas flowrate, target temperature, substrate temperature, bias voltage, radiofrequency 
(RF) power, substrate type and among others (Mwema et al. 2018a). A lot of effort has been put in understanding how 
various parameters influence the formation of Al thin films during magnetron sputtering (Mwema et al. 2018a). It is 
noted that consensus does not exist in most of the published data since researchers have reported different 
combinations of parameters. As such, there is need for continued investigation and documentation of various 
parameters on sputtering of Al thin films to offer a sufficiently large resource for future academics and industry in 
thin film sputtering.

4. Conclusions 
 
Aluminum thin films were deposited on stainless steel substrates via RF magnetron sputtering (HHV TF500) facility 
at RF powers of 150, 200, 250 and 350 W for 2 hrs. The films were characterized by FESEM and optical surface 
profilometry techniques. The surface microstructure, topography and structure distribution were described. It was 
reported that RF power does not exhibit direct relationship with average roughness, particle size and circularity. 
However, RF power was shown to have a correlation with one-dimensional fractal dimension and the widths of 
multifractal spectrum.

Abstract 
This work describes a case study of a Mexican company that manufactures a numerous number of cardboard 
carton box sku´s. The firm has the strategy of producing to order 26% of its sales and the rest is fabricated 
to stock. The main problem that requires the attention of upper management corresponds to the high level 
of finished goods inventory maintained by the company. After an exhaustive stage of analysis, it was found 
that the main aspects that contribute to the huge inventory levels are; poor handling of demand forecasting; 
deficient coordination with the area of production planning and control and; customer service management. 
The paper describes in a detailed basis the initiatives designed to improve the root causes. Also, it provides 
a summary of the results obtained in pilot testing.

Abstract 
The aim of this research is the measurement of the relative efficiency in the training centers of the National Learning 
Service (SENA, in its Spanish acronym), being the most important public agency of technical and vocational education 
in Colombia. Therefore, this measurement helps for the continuous improvement of the institution and its sector. 
Execution of this research includes three main phases: firstly a characterization of the technical and technological 
education sector in Colombia and the SENA. Secondly, the measurement of relative efficiency of the training centers 
through Data Envelopment Analysis Methodology (DEA) and finally an analysis of results, which help to identify 
possible causes of inefficiency and some good practices. This research also allows demonstrating DEA applicability 
in the efficiency measurement in the technical and technological education sector, and concludes with results which 
overall represents a good mean efficiency indicator for the entity. However, some areas and work fronts need attention, 
because these have wide margins to improve in the training centers, because these have the worst efficiency scores.

Multi-Feature Usability Testing on Internet of Things-based 
Smart Gym Machine with All in One Concept Using 
Nielsen’s Heuristics

Abstract 
Usability testing is needed to know whether a product can fulfill the desires of its customers or not. A 
product that has good usability will have good prospects because technically the product is feasible to use. 
This study aims to test the usability of a new innovative product called GYM ATOM ""Gym Machine with 
Artificial Trainer and Automatic Load Modifier"". The three newest features of the gym machine are the 
gym machine is designed with the all in one concept where 1 machine can not only train 1 muscle but can 
train 7 different muscles, also having an artificial trainer that allows users to practice even though without 
a companion trainer, and automatic load modifier which is based on internet of things that use the user's 
voice input and it is converted into mechanical energy to change the load. Until now, GYM ATOM has 
been produced and has reached the alpha prototype stage. To reach the beta prototype stage until it can be 
mass produced, the product needs to be evaluated for its usability. So that the aim of this study is to test the 
usability level of GYM ATOM with multi-feature testing by using Nielsen’s Heuristics where usability 
criteria are measured based on the criteria of learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. 
Based on the results of the usability testing, it can be concluded that the total score of usability is 80.667% 
which is very good usability. But the product still has to be improved because it has a fairly high error 
percentage on the automatic load modifier feature. This is because the users must use English as their voice 
input while respondents are Indonesian who are not fluent in English so it is difficult to use if the user is 
not good at speaking English. As an evaluation, the product needs to be improved by developing its voice 
input system so that voice input can not only be used with English but also in languages that are in 
accordance with the capabilities of its users so that it has better usability.

1. Introduction
Weight training is a systematic exercise using weights as a tool to increase the strength of muscle function to improve 
physical conditions, prevent injury or for health purposes (Suharjana, 2007). Weight training is now in great demand 
by people in the world, it can be seen from the growing number of fitness centers (gym centers) where the increase in 
the number of center gyms in the world from 2004 to 2014 increased from 82,000 to 180,000 gym centers (Canamero 
et al., 2018). This is consistent with the benefits of weight training itself because weight training can increase lean 
body mass, decrease fat mass, and increase resting metabolic rate in adults (Hunter et al., 2004). 
Although the number of fitness centers is increasing, it is possible that the public's desire for weight training is not 
fulfilled. Problems arise when someone wants weight training but the location of a fitness center far from home makes 
weight training difficult to be done. For some people, sometimes expensive rental fees at the gym center make it 
unable to exercise weight regularly, while weight training must be done regularly to achieve its goals. According to

Based on the results of the usability testing, it can be concluded that the GYM ATOM has the highest very good 
performance for each criterion, which means it has a very good usability level. However, if analyzed further, the error 
rate criteria (errors) of GYM ATOM are the criteria with the lowest very good performance. It is caused by the 
automatic load modifier feature of GYM ATOM that can only be used in the English language while the respondents 
are Indonesian whose proficiency is not good in English. As an evaluation of future improvements, this feature will 
be improved so that it can be used in Bahasa Indonesia so that the usability of the GYM ATOM is going better. 
 
To calculate the GYM ATOM's overall usability score, the Actual Usability Score (AS) and the Expected Maximum 
Score (ES) are needed first. Comparison between AS and ES will get an overall usability score with the usability score 
classification in Table 5 (Kasmawi, 2013).

ES is calculated through 40 x 25 = 1000, where 40 is the number of respondents and 25 is the result of the calculation 
of the number of assessment criteria multiplied by the measurement scale range. While AS is obtained by multiplying 
the weights of each criterion (Very Bad = 1, Bad = 2, Moderate = 3, Good = 4, Very Good = 5) with the average 
frequency of all features tested as shown in Table 6.

Based on Table 7, the actual score of the GYM ATOM usability assessment is 806.667, so that the total usability score 
of GYM ATOM is (806.667/1000) x 100% = 80.667% or 0.80667. Where 0.80667 is included in the Very Good 
Usability Level. However, it does not mean there is no need for improvement because as we know that there is no the 
best system but there is always better system. The most important thing to be improved from the GYM ATOM is the 
automatic load modifier feature so that the error rate will be reduced and the usability level will be better. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Based on the discussion above, it can be concluded that the results of usability testing for GYM ATOM product using 
Nielsen's Heuristics method which is tested for 3 innovative features namely all in one concept, artificial trainer, and 
automatic load modifier has the total score of usability is 80.667% which is very good usability level. However, as an 
evaluation in the future, it needs to be improved for the automatic load modifier feature because it produces a fairly 
high error rate. This is because these features can only be used using English while the respondents are Indonesian 
who are not fluent in English. So it is necessary to repair the automatic load modifier system so that it can be used 
according to the user's language. After repairs, GYM ATOM is ready to be produced at the beta prototype stage and 
mass produced.

Abstract 
Understanding and predicting customers’ behaviors in customer-centric organizations such as banks are very critical. 
The aim of identifying customers is to recognize, make distinction, and maintain the high-value customers and to 
attract more beneficial customers. In the past, the separation of customers into different groups was based on customer 
requirements, whereas customer value has become more important as segmentation criteria in recent years. Offering 
cutting-edge banking services, banks’ competition on market share, as well as the psychological and environmental 
factors of customers’ behavior need to be analyzed over time. Transferring customers to different sectors over time 
and discovering the dominant models and their displacements between sectors are explored in this paper. We aim to 
identify the behavioral patterns and the leading characteristics of customer displacements with a focus on the 
customers of a private bank in Tehran, Iran. For this purpose, we propose a combined method based on clustering and 
association rules. Results show four dominant clusters of behaviors: ""low-value customers with sustainable model"", 
""low-value customer with unsustainable profitability model"", ""turned away customers with average profitability"", 
""loyal customers with low profitability"". We also analyze the relationships between these clusters. The outcomes of 
this study can play a remarkable role for top managers to take appropriate marketing strategies.

Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented a new hybrid K-Means and association rule method that identifies 
behavior groups of customers over time and analyzes characteristics of these group. Majority of 
previous studies applied markov chains to model customers’ movement among different sectors 
and few studies have been conducted in the context of dominant displacement patterns. In previous 
researches, the dominant patterns were extracted using the maximum number of available 
sequences and frequency without any systematic and qualitative approach. In this paper, we 
developed a new extraction and clustering sequence approach as a general way of identifying 
dominant behavioral patterns of different customer groups among sectors. Identification and 
analysis of behavioral groups can come handy in developing productive marketing strategies. In 
addition to the cases mentioned in this paper, the behavioral characteristics of different customer 
groups were evaluated in order to explore the dominant patterns pertaining to the demographic 
characteristics of customer groups.  
According to the proposed method, four groups of customer behavior were identified as; “Low-
value customers with a sustainable pattern”, “Low-value customers with stable profitability 
pattern”, “Turned away customers with average value”, and “Loyal customers with low

profitability”. Using the results of this study, we can provide a decent insight into the customer 
behavior patterns, regarding membership and transfer to different sectors over the time. These 
insights led us to propose and improve businesses and their marketing strategies. The following 
strategies can be recommended for each of the fields defined: 1.   Low-value customers with stable 
pattern: Due to their stable behavior, they can be encouraged to use the services of the bank with 
new services and promotions. 2.   Low-value customers with unstable profitability pattern: It’s 
necessary to study the reasons of their behavior instability to provide the basics to attract and retain 
them. 3. Turned away customers with average profitability: Due to the volume of their balance and 
transactions, electronic banking can be used to provide distinguished services to improve and 
return those consumers. 4. Loyal customers with low profitability: Given the level of their loyalty, 
incentive plans for special customer can intensify their loyalty, profitability, and their willingness 
to increase their deposits and transactions.

Abstract  
This work focused on the Heart Beat Monitoring Module and the concepts of IoT to implement the required system 
to measure the heartbeat of a patient remotely without the need of a staff nurse. Some elderly person live alone and 
there is a need to monitor heartbeat at every moment. In this research, we measured the pulse rate of the person at 
every minute, transmitted the data over the internet and interfaced with the user via. our Android app. This heart-beat 
sensor includes a computing circuit, timer circuit in order to measure pulse rate, heart beats and temperatures etc. The 
Internet of Things (IoT) equipped with microcontrollers and sensors can give an easy and cost-effective remote health 
monitoring. The software involved was the Android Application developed using Android Studio, which is the 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This app retrieved the data from the open IoT platform thingspeak.com. 
The software involved in this project was the Android Application developed using Android Studio, which is the IDE 
for Android Applications. This app retrieved the data from thingspeak.com. ThingSpeak is the open IoT platform with 
MATLAB analytics. The user can enter the channel number or the API key of the ThingSpeak to access the graphs 
and pulse readings via his phone application. The hardware of Arduino is an arduino uno circuit board with a software 
program. The chip of this circuit board is programmable to send programmed data first to the microcontroller and then 
to the specific required multiple circuits to execute required series of commands. A highly sensitive PulseSensor was 
used to measure the heartbeat of the patient automatically. An Arduino Uno microcontroller interfaced with a Wi-Fi 
module ESP8266 used to transmit pulse reading over the internet using Wi-Fi. The heartbeat was displayed on the 
LCD of the patient in run-time. The heartbeat in beats per minute (BPM) was plotted against time (min). A mounted 
pulse sensor to the patient had monitored the heartbeat and transmitted it in the form of voltage signal to the 
microcontroller, which converted it back into a mathematical value. The Arduino transmitted the data onto the 
thingspeak.com portal, where it was plotted on a graph and the values were stored for future assessment. The user of 
the app was given a thingspeak API and the channel number as an access code, through which physician or nurse can 
accessed the patient’s data. IoT based heartbeat module as an android application can provide a convenient, cost 
effective and continuous remote measurements for heart patients. This app can reduce the burden of hospital visits or 
admissions for elderly patients. Our IoT based handy heartbeat module as an android application will provide a 
convenient, cost effective and continuous remote measurements for heart patients. This app can reduce the burden of 
hospital visits and admissions for elderly patients. Doctors and nurses can frequently be updated through this app for 
patient care. In future, health based IoT in medicine will significantly improve patient quality of life from real-time 
measurements.

Abstract 
This paper describes an open and vital vehicle routing research opportunity.  We describe the pervasive vehicle 
routing problems (VRPs) automakers use for three different links in their supply chains.  Our research methodology 
was to analyze an automaker’s logistics problems to identify the most relevant VRP characteristics and search the 
VRP literature for contributions addressing those characteristics. Arguably the most challenging automotive VRP is 
parts collection for which we detail the key problem characteristics of capacitated trucks, periodic schedules and 
stochastic volumes.  We provide industrial data on the routes, supplier volumes and locations.  This shows the large 
scale of automotive VRPs and characterizes the randomness in the daily shipping volumes.  We observe that the 
daily volumes are stochastic with generally positively skewed distributions and positive autocorrelation.  Since the 
large-scale automotive VRPs would be computationally intractable for the existing methods on capacitated VRPs 
with stochastic volumes, research applied to the automotive industry typically assumes deterministic volumes.  
Since we observed meaningful randomness in the supplier volumes, this identifies a need for research on periodic 
capacitated VRPs that are both stochastic and large-scale.  This paper’s data will serve as a test-bed for future 
research on this important problem facing the automotive industry.

Abstract 
The objective of the paper is to motivate the readers towards finding implementable Internet of Things 
based solutions to existing well-researched engineering problems. Towards this end, this paper describes 
a portable and easy to use technology to enable consumers to shift their electricity consumption to times 
when the prices are low. This technology can be implemented on a platform that consists of a Belkin 
WeMo Smart Plug (WeMo), which can be autonomously turned on/off using an Intel Edison (Edison) 
through a WiFi connection. We use a simple Markov Model for predicting the real-time prices. Based on 
the predicted prices, a threshold-based policy is used for scheduling of devices. The choice of model and 
the scheduling algorithm is heavily influenced by the processing- and storage-capacity of this platform. 
Empirical analysis on real-data from Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), which is the largest electric utility 
in Illinois, shows that 90% of times, the customer paid no more than 1.5-1.6 times the omniscient-
minimum electricity bill for a particular device usage requirement.

1. Introduction
The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension of the concept of the internet in which a large number of 
devices, sensors and everyday objects can interact with each other and with the internet. IoT has applications in 
manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, transportation etc. The objective of this paper is to motivate the readers 
towards finding elegant IoT based solutions to already well-researched problems. In this paper, we focus on a 
particular application of IoT for smart homes to achieve this end goal. This paper describes a portable and easy to 
use technology to enable consumers to shift their electricity consumption to times when the prices are low. 
We first briefly describe the well-researched topic of electricity price prediction. Under Real-Time Pricing (RTP) 
the cost per kWh of electricity varies with time as a consequence of the changing supply and demand conditions in 
the market. Consumers can reduce their costs by shifting their electricity consumption to times when cost is low. 
This results in better utilization of generated-power, lower-costs to the consumer, and is also said to have a positive 
impact on the environment. The ability to forecast real-time prices, and a means to react to these forecasts are two 
equally important requirements for an optimal consumer-response to dynamic pricing. We take a consumer-centric 
approach for realizing the potential of RTP programs by aiming for a cheap and accessible technology.  The 
approach presented in this paper uses the pricing scheme of Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), which is the largest 
electric utility in Illinois, serving the Chicago and Northern Illinois area. 
The present work is motivated by the problem of scheduling electricity usage in a home, based on real-time prices. 
For example: Tesla's Charge-at-Home (see Tesla web-link in references) recommends an hour of charge every 29 
miles of range. It is estimated that a Tesla user would require about four hours of charge daily. The charging-times 
do not have to be contiguous. The cost to the user would be determined by the price offered by the electricity 
provider during the charging periods. Suppose we want to charge for a total of 4 hours in the next 12 hours. The 
solution would be straightforward if by some algorithm, the precise hourly prices are known beforehand. The

tuning parameters (𝑙𝐵 and 𝑢𝐵). 
 
7. Conclusion 
We worked under the teleological model that the DAHP has taken into account everything that could possibly be 
predicted before the day commences (cf. the ``slow dynamics'' discussion in Section 3). The RTHP is essentially the 
DAHP with additional ``fast dynamics'' that are explicated at the last minute. This helped us to make the prediction-
algorithm tractable on the Edison. We used a Markov Model to predict the prices. Although we convert the prices 
into a finite state-space of a reasonable size, such an action inherently introduces inaccuracies in price prediction. 
For example: assume that the price at 6:00PM is 8 cents per kWh, and that 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇= 10. The model will treat the 
two cases: 1) price at 6:05PM is 25 cents per kWh, and 2) price at 6:05PM is 10 cents per kWh, as being identical. 
Therefore, it always underestimates high prices. Similarly, it will always overestimate low prices.  
 
We assume that the effect of fast-factors lasts only for 5-minutes. Because of these assumptions we could limit the 
size of the state space to around 100, and to around 10! entries in the transition probability matrix 𝐴. For 
illustration, suppose each entry in 𝐴 is stored as type double (in C++ terminology), which has a size of 8 bytes. 
Then we need ~80kB of size to store the matrix, which is fairly small. Now, if we relax our assumption and assume 
that the effect of fast-factors lasts for 10 minutes, then for the Markovian assumption to hold we will have to raise 
the current state-space to the space where each state is a two-tuple (𝑝!
!, 𝑝!
!!!). This would result in a space of size 
approximately 10!, and 𝐴 will have 10! entries which would need around 800MB of space.  
 
We also assume that the probability distribution of prices is stationary. As discussed in Section 1, the stationarity 
assumption is not necessarily true if we have to predict the prices. We then argued in Section 3 that since we only 
have to select the cheapest hours, any model would work as long it predicts the relative ranks of the hourly prices 
accurately. This peculiarity gives us room for making the assumption. That said, we can remove this assumption in 
two ways. The first way is to estimate different transition matrices to be used during different times of the day, 
which will be a direct extension of this work. The second way is to raise the state space in a way similar to one 
discussed in the previous paragraph. We would need a 3 or 4-tuple state (the other elements of the state being past 
hourly prices) to reliably account for stationarity. We end up with a state explosion problem. 
 
As we receive more 5-minute prices for a given hour, the predicted hourly prices become more reliable. But if the 
consumer waits for a relatively reliable estimate, she loses out on the amount of time she can charge in the given 
hour. We have not encoded the risk-taking tendencies of consumers in this algorithm. 
 
Since we are looking at the solution from the perspective of the consumer, it is not clear how to pose the scheduling 
as an optimization problem for minimizing the cost due to the electricity price and hours lost. We have to consider 
798","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Toronto, Canada, October 23-25, 2019 
© IEOM Society International 
the fact that the ''value'' of electricity is different for different consumers. In fact, based on the urgency of the task, 
the ''value'' of electricity might be different at different times for the same consumer. 
 
Although we have promising empirical results for our algorithm, we do not have any theoretical bounds. Computing 
theoretical bounds on the Competitive Ratio (CR) (i.e. the ratio of the cost obtained by an Online-Algorithm with 
that of the Omniscient Optimal Algorithm) can be a tall-order even for well-formulated/straight-jacketed academic 
problems. Attempts at deriving a formal bound for the CR might require making distributional assumptions and 
other simplifications. A solution towards this end with a practical sanction is an open problem. 
 
We limited the scope of this paper in scheduling devices for which the consumption-periods need not be contiguous. 
A real-time MILP formulation such as the ones in Qayyum (2015), Antonopoulos (2012) and Sou (2011), but with 
online prediction of prices remains an open problem. It is a difficult problem considering that it might run into 
numerical issues arising from the large number of variables in the formulation.

Abstract 
The fourth (4th) industrial revolution is fast becoming part of modern operations for businesses globally. 
Technology based enterprises find themselves in a position where they have to potentially adapt to this new 
arising phenomenon. In certain instances, technology-based enterprises undergo the business incubation 
process in order to be better equipped when entering various industrial operations and markets. This paper 
seeks to reflect the services provided by business incubators in South Africa (SA) and verify their relevance 
to assist and prepare technology-based firms for the 4th industrial revolution.  The article is a conceptual 
paper, which examines existing literature on the subject matter and providing narrative on the status quo. 
The results are presented in a thematic manner and reflect gaps for the introduction of potentially new 
services that can be provided by technology business incubators in SA. These are concluded in an 
introduction of new a term, one we call incubation 4.0. This term seeks to explore the integration of 
physical, biological and digital aspects to service provision by business incubators, which are of course 
central and core to the 4th industrial revolution phenomenon at large.

Introduction
The fourth (4th) industrial revolution (industry 4.0) has been receiving a lot of attention from scholars and industry 
since its conception at the World Economic Forum (Schwab, 2017). The emergence of industry 4.0 means that 
technology-based enterprises must be able to function in this environment and be able to operate and survive. More 
especially technology-based enterprises. Many of which undergo incubation. Technology business Incubation is the 
process that entails a number of mechanisms that are aimed at assisting firms at their nascent developmental stage 
(Hackett and Dilts, 2004). The mechanisms of assistance are in the form of services, these services are but not limited 
to; business support, coaching, training, infrastructure provision and networking opportunities. Given that technology

Also important to note is that some of the technologies that will drive this relate to mention 3D. Although SA is 
regarded slow in adopting industry 4.0 some special cases are emerging such as the first ear implant was conducted 
by a University of Pretoria surgeon transplant of the 3-D printed middle ear. 
 
 
2.4. The implementation of industry 4.0 in technology incubation 
 
Given that industry 4.0 is part of industries in general to an extent that a question has now been asked in terms of how 
industry can respond to it in terms of technology (Lee et.al, 2018). They for instance cite certain aspects of which we 
reduce the list to the selected following technologies; 
 
- 
Cyber physical systems 
- 
Combinational technologies 
- 
Smart factory, autonomous machines, 3 D printing  
 
Furthermore it is worth noting that at a strategy level, considerations have to be made on how new combination 
business models can be explored, especially exploring digital and technology enabled platforms. Chio et.al, 2002 
further looked at how techno parks (TPs) can support technology-based enterprise in the fourth industrial revolution 
within Kora. This reflects a concentrated effort of connectivity from TPs which could lead to lessons learned by 
incubators. Some practical examples are emerging in South Africa.  
 
Firstly, there is an example of the Incubation Centre 4, a incubator dedicated to industry 4.0 has been established.  
 
Secondly the example of Siemens launching an incubator at the University of the Witwatersrand which is aimed at 
developing the next generation of digital mining experts.  
 
Thirdly mentions being made that Former Dimension Data CEO Brett Dawson will  be launching a new Fourth 
Industrial Revolution (4IR) startup incubator.  
 
From the three examples above, it is evident that SA business incubation industry is embracing the adoption of 
mechanisms that enable alignment to industry 4.0 to a certain extent.  
 
 
 
3. Research Method 
 
This study entailed the utilization of document analysis which is a procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents 
systematically. Requiring that data be looked and assesed in a manner that elicits meaning, gain understanding, and 
develop empirical knowledge (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Given this a number of documents which contain information 
relating to business incubation in South Africa were analysed and discussed in section 4 below. 
 
 
4. Results and discussion 
 
 
The results from the document analysis is presented below in at thematic format, one of which is an analysis that 
reduces the data into workable themes and the emerging conclusions (Castleberry and Nolen, 2018). Table 2 below 
starts off by categorising the services analysed as per selected industries.

The analysis of results from Table 2 above seems to reflect of a pattern of services which can be placed in three themes 
of services. These are similar to what was mentioned on section 2: 
 
- 
business development services  
- 
provision of physical space and resources  
- 
funding  
 
What is of particular interest is that these seem to fall within the categories of the three generations which were 
developed over the past 60 years. The future of incubation services are moving towards acceleration and potentially 
new models that consider industry 4.0 as reflected by examples on section 2.4 
 
 
5. Conclusion  
The data presents a case for consideration of new service development for business incubators in SA, with the spirit 
of new generation services. It can be concluded that incubation services have shown to evolve as seen with generation 
of services from first to third generation (Bruneel et.al, 2011), and also of late with the inclusion of acceleration. In 
conclusion we propose a term for incubating technology-based companies for the fourth industrial revolution, a term 
we call incubation 4.0. central to this term is the element of cooperation. This cooperation happens at two levels. Level 
one being cooperation within incubators amongst themselves especially ones that might possess capabilities of data 
and biological spheres, a practical case in point would be linking up Softstart Bti with Egolibio incubators. a second 
form of cooperation could be of incubators with other related institutions such as a technology station e.g. 3D printing 
with an incubator in construction creating new generation materials for building. Lastly a new incubator can be created 
by SEDA following the model of where this deals directly with the fourth industrial revolution. The ultimate incubator 
within incubation 4.0.

Abstract 
 
Hard coating ceramics are gaining prominent applications in many industries due to their astonishing and favourable 
properties. Titanium alloys are regarded as the material of the 21st century with excellent mechanical and metallurgical 
properties. Titanium and its alloys have the ability to form a protective oxide that prevents it from susceptibility to 
corrosion in the presence of oxygen but has poor wear-resistant. Coating with TiC will enhance the surface properties 
and increases its application life span and range. In this research work, TiC ceramic coating was deposited on the 
surface of commercially pure Titanium using RF magnetron sputtering. The behaviour of the evolving mechanical 
properties was characterized using different mechanical characterization techniques. Nanoindentation was used to 
determine the hardness and Young modulus. The coefficient of friction was also investigated using a tribometer. The 
hardness of the coating was improved, and the lowest coefficient of friction was found at the highest hardness value.

 1. Introduction 
 
Mechanical properties like hardness, young modulus and coefficient of friction are very crucial in making a material 
acceptable and sustainable for industrial and domestic application.  The mechanical properties can be enhanced by 
alloying with reinforcement or coating with the material of superior qualities. The challenge with the alloying process 
is the formation of the intermetallic phase during the process which can deteriorate the mechanical properties. 
Magnetron sputtering, a physical process which is a type of the coating process can be used for improving the 
mechanical properties. It has favourable advantages like low deposition temperature and easy to use.

the rubbing interaction between the steel indenter ball and the surface film coating. The size of the wear scar and 
degree of TiC coating removed reduce for sample L3 with the highest hardness when compared to the other two 
samples. This is due to highly resistant to deformation, thereby limiting the rate of TiC coating removal from the 
surface of the coating. 
Conclusion 
From the experimental observation, it can be concluded that the process parameters affect the mechanical properties 
of the TiC thin film coating. The hardness improves with increase in temperature and the same trend was noticed for 
the Young Modulus. The COF of the TiC thin film coatings reduces as the harness of the film increase and 
delamination of the films were noticed under micrographic observation.

Abstract 
The objective of this article is to review the TIG/MIG welding technology and its application in improving the 
microstructural, mechanical and metallurgical properties of engineering materials. It is shown that the TIG/MIG 
hybrid process is very effective in improving the mechanical and metallurgical properties of welded structures 
compared to independent welding processes. Combining the positive properties of individual welding process in the 
same weld pool is a novel technology. However, more studies reveal that Hybrid MIG-TIG process has not been 
extensively researched despite its promising benefits. The optimization of its process parameter is not fully 
understood. Its processes and applications are still limited. Most studies either focus on experimental investigation 
limited to the geometric properties like tensile and hardness properties. The TIG/MIG hybrid welding method has not 
been used to solve fatigue and its related problems of steel components in the structural industries. Just a few numerical 
analyses are done. Extensive work has not been done on the mechanical, metallurgical and corrosion properties of the 
hybrid. Information on the thermal behaviours and temperature distribution is also lacking. Hence, there is a need to 
research the TIG/MIG hybrid welds and perform numerical modelling to validate the results using experimental data. 
Keywords: Hybrid Welds, TIG/MIG Welding Process, Stainless Steel
1.0 Experimental method and procedure 
Welding is one of the oldest and most common joining techniques for metallic structure. It is a general term used to 
describe a wide variety of bonding techniques. The American Welding Society (AWS) defines welding as a material 
joining process used in making welds. A weld is defined as a “localized coalescence of metals or non-metals produced 
by heating the materials to their melting temperatures, with or without the application of pressure, and /or filler 
materials” (Jain 2008). Welding technology is categories into two broad types. The solid-state welding and fusion 
welding (Jain 2008). In recent times, metals have been welded by the combination of more than one welding process, 
generally referred to as a hybrid welding process. Among other hybrid processes, Tungsten Inert Gas and Metal Inert 
Gas (TIG/MIG) hybrid welding process is a novel welding technique. TIG/MIG hybrid welding is the welding of 
metals by the combination of the TIG and the MIG arc welding process in a single weld seam. This is done by setting 
a leading a TIG arc while the MIG arc is trailing (called TIG/MIG hybrid) or by a leading MIG arc while the TIG arc 
is trailing (called MIG/TIG hybrid).     
1.1 Experimental method and procedure 
Solid-state welding is the joining of materials achieved by the application of pressure or by the combined effect of 
heat and pressure. In case where heat is required in this form of welding, the heating temperature is usually set below

Abstract 
South Africa is considered as one of the ten largest coal producers and the fourth largest coal exporting 
country in the world. The above claim perfectly confirms the importance of the coal mining industry to the 
country economy. With increasing dependency of the country on coal resource for power generation, all 
indications show that coal exploration in the country will not be abated in near time. The exploration, 
however, has detrimental effects both on the flora and the fauna as well as the humans. This study, therefore, 
evaluates the impacts of coal mining in South Africa relative to achieving society 4.0 in the country. 
Mpumalanga province was used as a case study as mining activities are highly prevalent in this area. 
Impacts of the mining activities on air pollution and water pollution were reviewed in the study area. The 
study further develops a roadmap towards achieving Society 4.0 in the era of societal revolution, thus 
achieving the low carbon global paradigm shift. This study concludes on the need for cleaner substitute for 
coal in the country as a long-term recommendation and on a short-term sustainability scale, we discourage 
opencast mining and encourage underground mining of the resource.

1.0 Introduction 
The coal mining industry in South Africa generates more than 77 % of all primary energy needs of the country. It 
forms the basis of the energy sources for the electricity system of the country and so, its dependency index is higher 
than other sources of energy in the country. Eskom, the state-owned enterprise manages over 90 % of the country’s 
electricity with a projected installed capacity of 55,112 MW in 2020 when the new coal-fired power plants, Medupi 
and Kusile are completed (Bohlmann et al. 2018). Eskom reports that coal mining industry produces more than 224 
million tons of coal per year. In addition, there are an estimated 30 billion tons of coal reserves in South Africa that 
can produce more energy output for the next 200 years, as the demand for coal will also increase in the future. The 
coal mining industry is Eskom’s main source in energy generation around South Africa. However, coal exploration is 
its detrimental effects on the environment and climate of South Africa (Dunmade et al. 2019). This environmental 
contamination and pollution such as found in the soil, underground and surface water, ecosystem, landscape, 
consequently negatively affect the health of residents in surrounding areas and particularly, the coal mine workers.

other types of heavy metal equipment in contact with the acid waters and reduce the water to be used to drink or 
recreational use by any kind of human (Bell et al. 2001). 
3.0 Roadmap towards reducing the impact of coal mining 
To reduce and resolve the impacts of coal mining in South Africa, the green mining suggestion developed by Professor 
Qian, a Chinese Engineering Academician suggests solving that problem. The objective of this green mining is the 
circulation conduct of joints, bed, fractures partings and the seepage flow of the toxic substance such as methane, 
carbon dioxide and water over wrecked rock strata produced by the coal mining. The green mining methodology or 
procedure to solve the negative impacts of coal mining on the environment is still in construction. That methodology 
contains important elements to preserve water quality in the coal mining area, to conserve the coal mining under 
infrastructures, grouting in the space amongst detached rock layers to lessen surface subsidence, fractional coal 
extraction and backfill coal mining, instantaneous coal extraction and coal-bed methane, the underground 
thoroughfare support, the underground discharge of limited coal mining wastes and underground coal gasification 
(Coetzee et al. 2002; Aken et al. 2012). 
 
3.1. Conversation and Restoration of the mine water environment  
 
 The conservation of aquifers during coal mining is the most important element in coal mine water environmental 
study. That preservation of water helps the coal mining to preserve water, to manage all water use during the coal 
extraction process, and provide a solution to water pollution in the coal-mining zone. The conservation of aquifers is 
a vital element of the green mining procedure. Diverse impacts from the coal mining on aquifers and diverse 
remediation procedures for dissimilar coal mines that have diverse geological situations. The underground reservoir 
construction can be a use full technique to preserve water and avoid that water from rivers and stream can be polluted. 
This technique created an underground reservoir is mostly use to the conservation of water leaking from splintered 
aquifers that conserve the aquifer in a safe way. Concerning the coal mining around the eastern in Mpumalanga the 
key strata technique must be controlled to avoid rupture, or be reinstated by grouting after rupture, to avoid water 
eruption into the coal mine area (AGIS 2011; Blignaut 2012). 
 
3.2. Management of mining waste 
 
Massive quantities of waste are produced by coal mining; certainly, this is the major cause of solid heavy waste 
accounting for more 40 % of all solid wastes in South Africa. Heavy materials that should be always detached to have 
admission to the coal product like topsoil, waste rock and overburden the waste come from coal product preparation 
and gangue from the underground coal mining characterize this waste. Several successions of accidents in current 
months have emphasized the implication of reuse of these coal-mine wastes and showing the importance of better take 
procedures to manage all the waste from coal extraction. This management of coal mining wastes includes their 
decrease, reuse and recycle waste. The management of wastes from coal extraction involves many procedures like 
cleaner production, clean technology, pollution prevention, coal waste minimization, coal recycling, resource and 
residue utilization, the overall resource utilization and total project development. In addition, coal-mining enterprise 
should always come up with some innovative coal mining procedures to decrease the creation of coal mining wastes. 
In China, for example, the country manages most than 15% of their coal wastes by using their traditional longwall 
coal mining procedure. That method can be also used to reduce the dangers of coal mining in South Africa. The waste 
combustion residues like fly ash, bottom ash or boiler slag should be used for other concern like waste recycle (Bian 
2006; Blignaut 2012). 
 
4.0 Conclusions 
Coal product is considered as the most important source of energy around the world’s and in South Africa near 90% 
of energy come from coal product. Coal for the next 50 years will remain the most useful product to produce electricity, 
before that each country develops electricity with natural resources and new technology advanced to generate 
electricity. The natural resources to create electricity reduces the use of coal product that negatively impacts the 
environmental elements such as water pollution, soil destruction, land subsidence, air, ecosystem, animals and human 
being. Since 1993 coal mining plays an important role in the South Africa economy with R37 billion of contribution, 
816","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

and in 2013 that same industry of coal added R51 billion to the country economy. These statistics rank the country as 
the seven largest coal producer and one of the top five coal exporting in the international. This indicates that coal 
mining actions will become very exhaustive and its impacts on the environment will be also increased.  Current 
researches have demonstrated that some solution such as conservation and restoration of the mine water environment,  
 
Management of mining wastes, Treatment of land to re-use and other solution such as the use of natural sources to 
generate energy can be taken to reduce the impacts of coal mining in the environment before and after a coal mining 
is in process. This article presents the importance of coal mining industry in South Africa economy, and provide some 
environmental consequences of that industry in the zone where the coal extraction is done. In other side, the article 
outlines some procedures on how to reduce or solve the impacts of coal mining on the environment before or after 
coal extraction is made around the country. The article encourages South African Government to pursue cleaner 
substitute energy, develops green technology methodology, and clean coal mining techniques to reduce the destruction 
of the environment by the extensive coal extraction activity around the country and preserve the environment.

Abstract 
Business processes are closely associated with improvements in increased productivity and profitability. 
Keeping the “content” the same but changing the strategy has often been the approach of many service 
industries towards strategy implementation. However, non-compliance of employees to an organization’s 
business process towards implementation of a strategy has its associated risks. This study, therefore, 
investigates some of the associated risks in non-compliance to business process in a typical banking system 
in South Africa using primary and secondary data sources. This study used qualitative approach through 
the administration of questionnaires to 100 employees across all relevant segment in the selected 
commercial bank. These questionnaires were aimed at investigating alignment of business processes to the 
strategy to be implemented, staff adherence to business processes within their unit, evaluation of business 
processes in a business unit in the typical bank and evaluation of business process role on individual jobs. 
Data obtained from secondary sources like criminal investigations, financial loss data, audit data and 
process maturity dashboards were analysed. The study reveals that business processes are fundamental to 
any strategy. It is evident that not complying with the laid down business processes result in financial loss, 
which was as high as R29 million for process breaches and reputational risk for the case study used. 
Processes that are not documented make it difficult for risk managers to proactively identifying risks and 
controls. The study concludes with several recommendations on the business process towards risk 
minimization and profit maximization in an active competition between banking industries.

1.0 Introduction 
The global natural competition in manufacturing and service industries informs the business processes of these 
organizations. In the 21st century, there exists a gradual paradigm shift from the conventional business processes to a 
need-based business process which constantly requires periodic business process reengineering (Nikolaidou, 
Anagnostopoulos, and Tsalgatidou 2001). Banking industry forms one of these service industries where competition 
and need-based business processes exist (Akande, Kwenda, and Ehalaiye 2018). Thriving amidst the competitiveness 
in the banking system requires a transformational and strategic wind of change, towards profit maximization and risk 
minimization. However, each strategy, aimed towards profit maximization is associated with different business 
processes and non-compliance to these business processes by an employee during discharge of duties have a ripple

Figure 6: Investigation conducted over a six-month period 
 
Considering the high percentages of breaches, investigating the likely causes of these is essential to forestall its 
occurrence in the organization in subsequent times. These causes are but not limited to the following: 
1. Bank staff opened accounts for family members without their consent. 
2. Bank staff processing transactions on their own accounts. 
3. Cloned cheques cashed validation procedures not adhered to by supervisors. 
4. Account take over due to the customer verification process not being followed. 
5. Incorrect recording of figures due to bank staff negligence and processes not followed. 
6. Maintenance changes on own accounts and pricing reversals on own accounts. 
7. Bank staff accessing customer accounts without a valid reason. 
8. Validation processes not followed when changes are made to business accounts 
9. Personal customer information divulged to fraud syndicates, which is in both breaches of policy and process. 
 
Breach of processes and policies consequently lead to huge financial loss from an operational and capital investment 
point of view. Between the periods January 2018 to June 2018, total losses amount to R333 million, which is a12.43%, 
decrease compared to the previous financial year. This is above the expected risk appetite of R310 million. Losses 
have negative influence on the bank as it affects growth and the success of strategic operations.  
 
5.0 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
This study investigated the effect non-conformance of business processes and staffs to strategy implementation in 
service industry using a bank as a case study. The questionnaire and the investigation of reports were carried out in 
this study. Although the response was low, some good insights were gained from the employees that responded. The 
poor response can also be attributed to the fact that employees are very busy and must have blocked their emails from 
receiving surveys. A larger percentage of the processes involved in the daily operations of employees are not efficient 
and effective as they were. Thus, a process-re-engineering is highly essential if the bank will increase its profit as well 
as be able to compete with their counterparts in the banking sector. Some of the business processes do not positively 
affect business unit under which they are performed. This also requires eliminating non-value adding business 
processes in the system. The study focuses on identifying some associated risks of non-compliance of organizations 
processes on strategy implementation. Although most business enterprises such as commercial banks aim at making 
profit, this study reveals that the commercial bank investigated incurred financial losses following non-compliances 
of their processes and employees to strategy implementation. The study revealed that the bank lost a total of R333 
million in the last financial year of which R 29 million was directly linked to process breaches.

Abstract 
The construction industry is deemed to be one of the most flourishing industries in Egypt. It greatly contributes to 
the national GDP and represents one of the leading sectors in the Egyptian economy recorded at a reasonable growth 
rate recently. Throughout the history of work in mega projects, particularly in the petroleum, chemical industries and 
power plants, it has been noticed that erroneous technical, managerial and ethical behavior of personnel is dominant 
in the Egyptian work environment, which to a great extent affect passively the performance indices and success of 
the construction projects. Therefore, the aim of this research work is to introduce a model that describes the influ-
ence of ethical aspects on a number of selected performance indices used to measure the success of construction 
projects in Egypt. To this end, questionnaire surveys and interviews were used as data collection means. The 
questionnaire contained 185 questions covering 24 independent variables. The independent variables were selected 
to cover a number of critical technical, managerial and ethical issues that take place during the subsequent stages of 
large construction projects. In this research, only results concerning the influence of ethical aspects are presented. A 
number of statistical analysis tools were presented, using non-parametric analysis techniques and a number of 
regression models were developed to evaluate the project performance During both the planning and implementation 
phases. The study has detected three dependent performance indices that have been correlated with three ethical in-
dependent aspects.

Abstract 
The research covered the background and study of mechanical and rheological properties of self-compacting concrete, 
when incorporated with different chemical and mineral admixtures at micro scale. Although, with secondary raw 
materials (SRM’s) along with chemical admixtures, an improvement in rheological as well as increased mechanical 
properties in self-compacting concrete are observed, but it can alter different fresh and hardened state properties. We 
developed a methodology to understand chemistry of self-compacting concrete and its improvement as a high 
performance self-compacting concrete using SRM’s. With the addition of these SRM’s, the behavior of self-
compacting concrete was observed at fresh and hardened state with singular material addition (Binary) and then in 
combination of two materials (Tertiary). The replacing mineral admixtures were Silica fume, Fly Ash, Marble powder 
and Limestone powder. Cement was replaced initially at the ratio of 5%, 10%, and 15% by weight of cement and then 
a combination of 5%, 10 % and 15% of each SRM’s with cement. Along with mineral admixtures, chemical admixture 
was also incorporated name Gellinium 51 which is a Type F, HRWR (high range water reducer), manufactured under 
BASF Germany® tag. Throughout the experimental process, the consideration was given by the both ASTM & 
European Standard EN206-1, for self-compacting concrete which was kept under eye. Target flow for the preparation 
of high performance self-compacting concrete was kept at 750 mm for all the formulations. To prepare a high 
performance self-compacting concrete, fixed water cement ratio of 0.3 was used. To achieve target flow for self-
compacting concrete, adjustment is done in chemical admixture. We observed a good response when replaced cement 
with these materials, and the best results was observed by replacing cement with 10% Silica Fume and 10% Fly Ash 
replaced by 20% of cement. Improvement of 24% in compressive strength along with improved workability in fresh 
state was observed. European standards provided us a wide range of guidance to make concrete better and reliable in 
performance and durability. In this study, every experiment was according to the guidelines recommended by 
European as well as ASTM Standards. Tertiary formulation with Silica Fume and Fly Ash at 10 percent of replacement 
individual with cement shows higher strength among all of them. Silica Fume and Fly Ash seems to be better SRM’s 
than Marble Powder and Limestone Powder.

Abstract 
The contamination of heavy metals in water is one of the most critical problems Mexico is facing nowadays, with a 
latent risk, it is damaging the human health. Making use of technology and quality methodologies such as 
Operational Excellence (OE), we seek to find a balance to arrive at the consolidation of a scientific project 
accompanied by the OE methodology, to ensure the success of the project. In addition, it seeks to manage it with a 
wider vision, aiming at quality standards at a higher level, controlling operations to achieve a competitive advantage, 
having permanence in the market, providing a high quality and profitable product with innovative applications and 
trends. Therefore, our project provides a new method for the decontamination of water with a natural bioadsorbent 
based on grapefruit peels, and where it seeks to solve a problem without harming the environment at affordable costs 
to society.

1. Introduction
Due to the industrial expansion in Mexico, water potability goes through very critical moments, in states like Nuevo 
León, the issue of drinking water and lack of water worries society, since every time the situation becomes a more 
critical subject. The objective of this project, is to propose a new method to decontaminate heavy metals such as 
lead, mercury and cadmium from water, making use of technology and also to guarantee the viability of the project 
by applying a quality methodology such as Operational Excellence that allows us to guarantee the success of this 
project and that will lead us to stay in the market. Heavy metals are pollutants with a very high level of hazard, for 
example, mercury ranks third among the most toxic elements for humans according to the Register of Toxic 
Substances and Toxic Diseases (ATSDR) (ATSDR, 2012). In addition to this, it also affects aquatic ecosystems, and 
this is due to their persistence, low biodegradability and high toxicity at low concentrations. On the other hand, in a 
study carried out by the National Water Commission CONAGUA in 2017, there were 5028 monitoring sites 
operated by CONAGUA throughout the country, the study showed that 29.21% of the sites were cataloged with red 
color presenting non-compliance in the toxicity of water. The underground water network consisted of 1240 
monitoring sites. In this case, it was found that 33.87% of groundwater presented red color, due to non-compliance 
with the following parameters: fluorus, fecal coliforms, nitrate nitrogen, total arsenic, total cadmium, total 
chromium, total mercury and total lead. [twenty]. Currently, there is a wide range of solutions to extract or adsorb 
these metals from water, such as plant elements, phytoremediation, microorganisms, microstructures materials, 
packed biomass, but nevertheless these have a considerable disadvantage due to their high commercial value. 
Our project aims to launch to the market a filtering material made from an organic waste, which besides being 
ecological, is low cost for society. One of the most important benefits of our project, is that our main raw material is 
based on a hundred percent natural product, which in this case is the grapefruit peel. But in addition, this is a product

5. Conclusion 
The problem of contamination heavy metal in Mexican waters is an alarming problem generating alternative 
methods to treat them. It is a very important task for researchers in our country, these methods must be sustainable 
as well as profitable. The application of Operational Excellence is a key factor to achieve the success of the project, 
since the application of the principles at each stage of the project, the results were as expected, complying with 
established dates for each stage of the project and the optimal use of the available technologies. We also increase the 
competitiveness of the method; the performance of each process was improved in each department and each team 
member always had a vision of continuous improvement. 
At the end of our research project, we can conclude that the grapefruit peel contains certain specific characteristics, 
for example, pectic substances with the capacity to remove heavy toxic metals such as lead and mercury. According 
to the satisfactory results obtained, we can state that having accompanied the development of the project with the 
methodology of operational excellence provided us with tools to facilitate the success of the project, reducing costs, 
avoiding delays due to lack of effective communication or lack of planning. Also, by always having a vision beyond 
and always giving the best.

Abstract 
One of the most alarming and worrisome problems in Mexico is the contamination of water with heavy metals. 
Several studies carried out, that water pollution has been increasing in different parts around the country. Our project 
seeks to create a viable, environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to eliminate water polluting agents such 
as mercury, cadmium and lead, as well as generating an option for the use of organic waste derived from the 
growing demand for fruits that exists nowadays. Our project, also seeks to innovate a model for the decontamination 
of heavy metals from water, with the aim of providing a chance to the people most affected by this problem, which 
in this case are those with lower socioeconomic status, that do not have access to the purchase of filters or special 
equipment for the decontamination of heavy metals from water.

1. Introduction
Heavy metals cause environmental concern, because they are not degradable, they are persistent and toxic when they 
are present in nature (Gupta and Ali, 2004). Toxicity at high levels leads to adverse effects on health, generally 
associated with high concentrations of lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic. Industries such as mining, metal 
processing, electroplating and electronics release high amounts of mercury, cadmium, arsenic to the environment 
which generally pose high health risks (Liu et al, 1997). The neurological complications caused by the ingestion of 
mercury in infants is mental retardation, seizures, loss of vision and hearing, in addition to developmental delay, 
language disorders and memory loss. In adults, the neurological symptoms are: tremors, insomnia, memory loss, 
neuromuscular effects, headache and cognitive and motor dysfunction (WHO, 2017). Despite damage to human 
health, the pollution of mercury also seriously affects the environment. 
Conventional methods for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater include reduction, precipitation, ion 
exchange, filtration, electrochemical treatment, membrane technology and evaporative disposal, all of which may be 
inefficient or costly unacceptable, especially in the case of metals dissolved in large volumes of solution at relatively 
low concentrations (Ozcan et al, 2005). Adsorption is considered an effective, efficient and economical method for 
water purification (Gosset et al, 1986). Our project aims to implement a new method of filtering heavy metals in 
water with orange peel, which will be sought viable, effective, efficient and economical for the benefit of the most 
vulnerable communities to this problem. 
The orange (Citrus sinensis) cultivated in the subtropical climate, is classified in the Rutaceae family. The citrus 
flavor is one of the most popular fruit flavors for drinks. The taste of orange juice has been studied more than any 
other type of citrus fruit (Selli et al, 2004). On the other hand, the orange peel is a non-toxic low-cost bioadsorbent, 
thanks to the fact that it contains hydroxyl and carboxyl functional active groups, present in the cellulose, hemi-
cellulose and pectin components (Feng et al, 2009., Liang et al, 2009). The byproducts of citrus processing represent

The samples with contaminated water were grouped as follow: 250 ml of contaminated water separated into 20 
samples: 10 of Mercury with concentrations of 10 to 100 parts per billion and 10 of a mixture of Cadmium and Lead 
with concentrations of 10 to 100 parts per billion. 
The sample with 250 ml of contaminated water were introduced exactly with 4 grams in the final product of the 
previous process: the orange peel sieved at 150 microns. To ensure that they were 4 grams of finished product, a 
spoon was used to pour the material into the beaker. Both the beaker and the ladle were washed with distilled water 
to ensure decontamination of the material. The weight of the beaker was 50 grams, material had to be introduced 
until its weight reached 54 grams of beaker with the addition of the sieved material. 
The result can be seen in Figure 6, 20 plastic bottles, each with its respective sample of water contaminated with 
Mercury, Cadmium and Lead in addition to the respective 4 grams needed to make the filtration. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Samples 
 
The next step of experimentation involves shaking each container for 30 minutes. 
The bottles should be shaken because that guarantees that it has a great amount of contact between the contaminated 
metal water and the orange peel filter. After being stirred, they should be left to rest for a day and then stirred for 15 
minutes each to continue the contact between the filter and the water. Figure 6 shows the samples analyzed.  
 
3.1 Filtration 
The filtering process was carried out at the University of Monterrey (UDEM). This process begins with a support 
and clips to hold a funnel over a beaker that will collect the decontaminated metal solution. The funnel and the 
beaker must be previously washed with distilled water to decontaminate them. Next, a Whatman 40 filter is placed 
in the funnel to filter the water. Then, the solutions are emptied with the sieved powder and the metal solution in the 
funnel and wait until all the solution are filtered. When the solution finishes filtering, it is emptied into another vial 
already labeled. This step must be repeated for the 20 samples of contaminated water of Mercury, Cadmium and 
Lead that are then sent to be analyzed to find the remaining concentrations after filtering. 
After the filtration process, these results show a sample that satisfactorily managed to purify the contaminated water 
with 202Hg (ppb). This shows that the sample with orange 10 is the one that should be used in future projects. 
 
 
Conclusion  
During the development of the present project, multiple laboratory tests were carried out. The results obtained in the 
project were satisfactory since the orange peel gave us positive results in the decontamination of mercury, with these 
results we will have a basis for future research and creation of innovative products at low cost and with a 
considerable environmental impact, since nowadays in Mexico, pollution and lack of water is one of the most 
critical problems, especially for people with lower socioeconomic status.

Abstract 
This research reports the optimization of milling process for Al7075 aerospace alloy under dry cutting 
conditions employing Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The influence of various control parameters 
such as spindle speed (RPM), feed rate (ƒz) and axial depth of cut (ap) are examined to improve the surface 
roughness (Ra) and the material removal rate (MRR). A set of 20 test trials using a circumscribed central 
composite design (CCCD) is utilized for the design of experimentation (DOE). The second-order 
polynomial regression equations are developed to predict the response attributes. In addition, the RSM-
based parametric and variance exploration is made to quantify the effects of milling variables on the output 
characteristics. Lastly, the RSM-based Desirability Function is adopted for multi-attribute optimization. By 
applying this approach, the following have been obtained: a minimum Ra of 0.26 µm and maximum MRR 
of 2196E+04 mm3/min at the spindle speed 2577.32 rpm, the ƒz 531.650 mm/min, and the ap 4.6330 mm.

1. Introduction
Aluminum and its alloys have been the part of aerospace industry since the 19th century and their appeal has grown 
up by the time. Recently, Al7075 is becoming the mainstream material for lightweight aerospace applications due to 
its excellent strength, good corrosion resistance, better formability and low-cost characteristics (Martín et al. 2018). 
With the emerging concerns regarding the environmental health and safety and the cost associated with the cutting 
fluids (Pusavec et al. 2010); dry milling of alloys becomes the preferred choice for manufacturers. Despite the fact 
that this process encourages the environmentally friendly machining with high MRR, surface characteristics majorly 
suffer. To address this issue, the recent trend in machining practices skewed towards the development of models 
(mathematical and optimization) that can provide adequate assistance to practitioners and machinists in selecting 
appropriate process parameters for the desired responses.   
In this regard, LMalghan et al., (2018) optimized the face milling parameters for AA6061 with respect to Ra, cutting 
forces, and power consumption employing RSM-based Desirability approach and Particle Swarm Optimization. Both 
of the models reveal that 3000 rpm spindle speed, 500 mm/min feed rate, and 3 mm depth of cut are the optimal 
process variables. Likewise, Okokpujie et al. (2018) used the least square approximation method and RSM to optimize 
the end milling process for Al6061. A minimum Ra (0.5 µm) is achieved at 2034.608 rpm spindle speed, 100 mm/min 
feed rate and 20 mm axial depth of cut. In another work, Dikshit et al. (2016) modelled the cutting forces during the

4. Conclusions  
 
With the aim to improve productivity and reduce the manufacturing cost of Al7075 for aerospace applications, multi-
attribute optimization for surface roughness and material removal rate has been carried out using RSM-based 
Desirability Function. After the main effect analysis, ANOVA and discussion, the following findings are inferred: 
 
I. 
The second-ordered regression equations for surface roughness and material removal rate have demonstrated 
a good correlation between experimental values since the predicted values are within the acceptable error of 
15% and 0.89%, respectively. 
II. 
With respect to surface roughness, the spindle speed has the most pronounced effect with 90.50% 
contribution. Moreover, the main effect plots show that 4000 rpm spindle speed, 400 mm/min ƒz, and 4 mm 
ap enables the dry milling operation to produce smaller Ra under the dry machining conditions.  
III. 
For the material removal rate, the axial depth of cut is the most influential variable with 89.95% contribution 
followed by the feed rate with 9.5% contribution. However, the spindle speed was found statistically 
insignificant for MRR.  
IV. 
Multi-attribute optimization has been successfully carried out for the dry milling of Al7075 with an optimal 
desirability value 1 utilizing RSM-based Desirability Function. Minimum Ra 0.26 µm and maximum MRR 
2196E+04 mm3/min can be obtained at spindle speed 2577.32 rpm, feed rate 531.650 mm/min, and axial 
depth of cut 4.6330 mm.

Abstract  
The number of nursing home residents who need help with their functional health, i.e., ability to perform the Activities 
of Daily Living, ADLs, is constantly increasing. Clinicians, patients, and their caregivers would benefit from 
information on likely next ADL events (both progression and recovery). While much of the focus in long-term care 
and the nursing home is on preservation and restoration of these activities, very little information is available to guide 
patients, providers, families, and policymakers regarding expectations for the sequence, likelihood, and timing of 
functional loss and recovery.  
Predictive modeling, particularly Machine Learning, and availability of large data enables clinicians and patients to 
better understand what is likely to occur next. These forecasts can also set priorities for clinical interventions. 
Predictive modeling could also be used for planning purposes as it provides quantitative information on the timing 
and severity of the next disability event. Caregivers would like to know how long they need to provide care. Families 
would like to understand the likely quality of life of their loved one.  
The objective of this study is to provide a data-driven analytical model, based on Machine Learning techniques, for 
predicting functional status change for residents in long term care facilities. Particularly, we predict: 
1. the sequence in which ADLs were lost and recovered using large longitudinal data, 
2. the days between ADL loss and recovery from these losses, 
3. the likelihood of loss and improvement.  
This information can help in planning for end-of-life disabilities. It can also be used to set “pay for improvement” 
incentives for providing long term care to older adults. 
The sequence of functional loss and recovery among long term care residents is accurately predictable. This study 
provides benchmarks for the sequence, likelihood, transitions, and timing between various combinations of ADL 
deficits. While the majority of patients were able to recover from ADL deficits, the mean recovery time from a single 
ADL deficit suggests that recovery occurs over a long period and care planning needs predicting such timelines. This 
information can also be used to pay more for long term care facilities that perform better than average. In these 
payment systems, the percentage of patients that improved their condition is compared to the average percentage and 
additional payments are provided for the facilities that report better than average improvement rates.

Abstract 
Machine failures are normal and expected events of any manufacturing process. However, they may impact 
manufacturing negatively. Since these failures are a challenge to any manufacturing process; identifying and 
preventing them is an essential measure. This paper will focus on the failures of machine and their effects on 
manufacturing and production. A smart model will be presented that will enhance a fault detection process proposing 
a smart factory data analytics using cyber physical systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). This 
research will explore the statistical relationships among different types of critical failures and their factors and how 
they are caused. An actual business case for a company is presented with the suggested smart factory model that will 
monitor and predict critical failures during the production process. This predictive failure control system will create 
an intelligent machine environment for a smart manufacturing process.

between production line and the cause of failures significant interaction effect was visible, particularly for the electrical 
failure with production line 2.  
This research study concludes that manufacturing companies should give attention to preventing critical failures. This 
can be done by eliminating failure causes and by creating a predictive failure control system. The future is moving 
towards IoT and smart technology so a productive failure control system has been suggested based on a smart 
manufacturing factory module and including smart technologies such as sensors and other communication 
technologies.

Abstract 
Complex systems continue to confound the capabilities of systems engineers to deal with and navigate a new 
generation of problems. Thus, there is an emerging need to develop a cadre of effective systems engineers capable of 
efficiently addressing complex systems problems. This paper introduces a new system engineering instrument that 
assesses the performance of systems engineers. The instrument is based on the set of performance indicators examining 
six fundamental system engineering attributes. This instrument would provide a baseline to understand the current 
state of the systems engineering skills for a systems engineer and indicate developmental areas to enhance those skills. 
Following a brief introduction, this paper is structured to explore four primary areas. First, we examine why there is 
a need to develop effective systems engineers. Second, we propose a novel tool that could assess the state of systems 
engineering skill and support the purposeful development of skills. Third, we present an examination of the individual 
performance of induvial systems engineers. Fourth, a discussion is presented on the utility and implications for the 
proposed instrument.

1. Introduction
Modern systems are designed and develop to fulfill needs or provide solutions for bettering organizations and 
overcoming persistent challenges stemming from increasing complexity. However, systems and their derivative 
problems are not likely to be settled in the near future rather they are more likely to intensify in complexity. Perhaps, 
revolutions in technologies and proliferation of information are indicative of the future which must be dealt with by 
systems engineers. Thus, there is a need to employ a “systemic approach” to better manage and navigate these complex 
system problems (Alfaqiri et al., 2019; Hossain et al., 2016; Lawrence et al., 2019; Nagahi et al., 2019). In response, 
Systems Engineering (SE) has developed as a distinctive discipline to address these challenges and concerns by using 
a systemic approach to ensure that individual elements, sub-elements, and associated phenomena are functioning 
harmoniously in a given operational environment to achieve an effective performance of the overall system. From a 
fundamental perspective, systems engineering is an iterative process to ensure that the embedded elements and 
subsystems constituting the system are designed, balanced, and function in the most effective manner while integrating 
appropriate “ilities” (i.e, maintainability, sustainability, reliability, manability, supportability) and other attributes into 
the total engineering effort (Blanchard and Fabrycky, 1990; Buede, 2016; Hossain and Jaradat, 2018; Nagahi et al., 
2018; Shishko and Aster,1995). The underlying role of a systems engineer ranges from the identification of the

Abstract 
As modern supply chains continue to evolve into increasingly integrated global networks, logistics decisions that 
balance customer value with cost are becoming more complex.  Due to the dynamic nature of a supply chain system, 
the interrelationships between decision-making criteria are not always obvious to individuals who are preparing for 
careers in logistics and supply chain management, resulting in decisions being conceptualized and framed in terms of 
linear cause-and-effect paradigms. Since a logistician must be able to view the supply chain as a system to design the 
resources, flows, and solutions that support an organization’s competitive strategy, learning tools that stimulate 
holistic thinking in regard to logistics can be helpful in developing an individual’s systems thinking skills. The purpose 
of this research is to evaluate the impact of a cloud-based, applied simulation of a global supply chain on students’ 
ability to think in systemic terms.  Responses to questions examining various systems thinking competencies are 
evaluated based on a two-wave longitudinal study, before and after the simulation, to determine the impact on holistic 
thinking skills of students.  The research’s results show several significant relationships between students’ systems 
thinking skills in the pre-test and post-test.   
Keywords   
Logistics; supply chain; system thinking; simulation; undergraduate education. 
1. Introduction
This paper discusses the use of a cloud-based applied simulation tool to enhance the ability of undergraduate students 
to conceptualize the supply chain as a holistic system with a porous boundary, across and within which factors in the 
internal and external environment converge to impact performance.  The simulation is administered in a senior-level 
global logistics course after students have completed coursework in different areas of logistics and supply chain 
management, such as procurement and inventory control, warehousing, transportation, and enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) systems.  The course aims to expand students’ ability to manage logistics in the complex and uncertain 
international environment by taking a broad look at the dynamics and levers of a supply chain.  In addition to having 
an international focus, the course is also comprehensive as it integrates concepts taught in other supply chain courses. 
The goal of the simulation is to teach students how to structure and balance multiple conflicting factors, such as cost, 
speed, availability, and sustainability, to minimize supply chain failure while maximizing value to supply chain 
constituents.   
The course objective that this teaching approach aims to support is to provide students with an understanding of the 
supply chain so that they are “able to explain how effective design and management of global logistics systems can 
create a competitive advantage for an organization by reducing costs and risks and improving supply chain 
performance.”  The program-learning outcome that this objective is linked to is the development of students’ ability 
“to analyze, design, optimize, and manage global logistics systems or processes.” The goals of this study are to 
determine whether the use of a supply chain simulation in the global logistics course enhances students’ ability to (i) 
view the supply chain holistically as a single entity, (ii) recognize the behavioral patterns of inventory flows, costs, 
and carbon emissions, and (iii) adjust the system flows by impacting key leverage points to improve supply chain

5.  Concluding Remarks 
 
The current study identifies interesting results about the impact of a cloud-based, applied simulation of a global supply 
chain on students’ systems thinking skills. All the inter-relationships among students’ systems thinking skills in the 
pre-test and post-test in a simultaneous manner using two-wave longitudinal design are assessed. Several significant 
relationships among students’ systems thinking skills in the pre-test and post-test are observed. The students’ “pre-
dynamic thinking” has the highest impact on “post-dynamic thinking” of students. The students’ “pre-forest thinking” 
has the highest impact on “post-cause-effect thinking” of students. None of the six systemic skills in the pre-test 
significantly impact students’ systemic skills in the post-test. We should mention that correlational analysis is used in 
the current study. As a result, no causality should be inferred from the results of the study.  
 
This study has some limitations such as the small sample size, respondents’ drop-out rate, and lack of a control group. 
Since the current research is an initial study, the mentioned limitations will be considered in the main study. Some 
areas for improvement can be considering a larger sample of students, a carefully designed experiment, adding 
impacting control variables, and using more than one reviewers for scoring the qualitative responses.

Abstract 
Conventional machining processes such as turning, drilling, and milling are basic material removal type cutting 
techniques used commercially to produce a wide range of parts, components, and products. When it comes on their 
use for precision machining, cutting of difficult-to-machine (DTM) materials, processing of micro-components, and 
making typical shapes and intecrate features, they underperform and result in poor machinability, escalated 
machining cost, and high environmental footprints. Even under normal operating conditions, it may result in high 
consumption of energy and resources; generation of toxic fumes, particulate emissions and other wastes; risk for 
health and safety; high tool wear, and deterioration in the machined part surface quality. Innovative sustainable 
techniques such as dry and near dry (minimum quantity lubrication and cryogenic) machining, tool treatment and 
texturing, heat assisted machining etc. have been developed to overcome the machinability and sustainability 
challenges in conventional machining. This review article presents a state of the art on development of these 
sustainable techniques for economic and ecological benefits in conventional machining processes. The main 
objective of this paper is to facilitate researchers and academics by providing useful information in order to establish 
the field further.

1. Introduction
The term Sustainability is the ability of the processes, systems, products, or services to perform efficiently without 
affecting environment (Dornfeld, 2012; Gupta and Gupta, 2019). Globally, it is being implemented due to strict 
environmental regulations. Sustainability interventions incorporate various strategies and techniques to conserve 
natural resources and protect environment. In manufacturing, the term sustainable manufacturing corresponds to the 
use of green and clean processes and techniques for high productivity, low cost, and ecological benefits. Machining 
sector is an important segment of manufacturing field where various types of processes are used to cut a wide range 
of materials and machine different shape and features to produce engineered parts. Although in some instances, 
nonconventional processes possess superior features, however, the significance of conventional machining processes 
can never be underestimated. Turning, drilling, and milling are the three basic conventional machining processes 
(Grzesik, 2016). Turning is a very basic metal removal process to create cylindrical parts and components by 
removing extra material or reducing the diameter. Milling process creates variety of complex features such as 
pockets, faces, and cut edges on a flat stationary job with the help of rotating cutters. Whereas, in drilling process, a 
hole of circular cross section is cut in solid materials. Commercially, all three basic machining processes are most 
extensively utilized and identified as the most prominent processes for machining industry. But, these processes also 
affect the environment to a great extent where high consumption of energy and resources and high wastages are the 
major problems. Particularly, proper selection and application, and storage and management of metal working i.e. 
cutting fluids are major challenges (Astakhov, 2008).  
To make these processes environmentally-friendly there have been various sustainable developments in the field. It 
majorly includes dry cutting, green and solid lubricants based machining, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and 
cryogenic cooling based machining, heat assisted machining, and use of sustainable tool materials and coatings etc 
(Davim, 2017). Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned techniques to obtain sustainability in conventional 
machining.

Abstract 
Stainless steels (SS) are used in a variety of precision, scientific, and industrial applications. All demand excellent 
surface properties for better functional performance of the products made by SS. Analysis, modeling, and 
optimization of machining of SS can result in process parameter combinations which facilitate to obtain better 
surface properties while machining SS using conventional processes. This paper reports the investigation on surface 
roughness (mean roughness depth) of SS304 machined by conventional turning using TiAlN/TiN coated tools under 
the influence of green lubricant. In this work total nine experiments with two replicates each have been conducted 
by varying three important machining parameters i.e. cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed rate at three levels each. 
A detailed effect of process parameters on mean roughness depth is discussed. Analysis of variance study is also 
reported. Process parameter optimization resulted in the optimum value 4.81 µm of mean roughness depth.

1. Introduction
Stainless steel (SS) is one of the most extensively used engineering materials. It has many applications such as in 
bio-medical instruments, tanks and vessels, automobile and machine components, scientific devices etc (Davison et 
al, 1986; Prasad and Rao, 2013). But it is a difficult-to-machine (DTM) material and possesses poor machinability at 
ordinary machining conditions.  SS304 is one of the important types of stainless steel. Tool wear, work surface 
deterioration, high machining cost, and environmental footprints are some of the challenges occur while machine 
this material by conventional processes (Sharma and Gupta, 2019). Process parameter optimization, using green 
lubricants and lubrication techniques, employing assisted machining; and using treated and coated tools are some of 
the ways to overcome the machining challenges for any DTM material such as SS (Gupta and Laubscher, 2017). 
There have been some past attempts to investigate and analyze the machinability of stainless steels, which are 
discussed here as under. 
Paro et al. (2001) reported that stainless steel is always assumed as DTM material due to high degree of hardening 
and low thermal conductivity. Therefore, the selection of tool material is made considering its reliability and 
durability. A number of researchers worked on the machining of austenitic stainless steel. Abou-El-Hossein and 
Yahya (2005) machined stainless steel and investigated the different failure modes of the cutting tool. 
Ciftci (2006) studied the effect of machining variables during turning of SS by CVD coated tool without any cutting 
fluid. Dry machining was found as the sustainable alternate of wet turning. Shao et al. (2007) studied the tool wear 
mechanism in the milling process and observed that the different types of wear mechanisms namely abrasion, 
adhesion, and attrition were found at different stages. Machining of stainless steel in three different environment 
namely wet, dry and cryogenic cooling was done by Manimaran and Kumar (2013). Cryogenic cooling was 
identified a green lubrication technique that resulted in the improved machinability of SS. In a recent study, Sharma 
and Gupta (2019) machined SS304 material and investigated the influence of coated and uncoated tool on the tool 
wear. It was found that tool wear is a combination of abrasion, adhesion and cutting-edge failure at different 
combinations of process parameters. It was also recommended that the dry cutting under coated tools has potential 
and can be explored further to establish as an alternate to the conventional wet cooling based machining.

4. Conclusions 
In this paper, an investigation on analysis and optimization of surface roughness during turning of SS304 by coated 
tools and under the influence of green cutting fluid is reported. Effects of machining parameters on mean roughness 
depth, results of ANOVA study, and optimization of machining parameters for surface finish improvement are 
discussed. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work- 
 
1. Depth of cut was identified as the most significant parameter with a percentage contribution of 36.38% 
followed by fed rate- 33.21% and cutting speed- 30.26%.   
2. Analysis of the results presented that optimum parameter combination i.e. cutting speed-170m/min, feed 
rate- 0.1mm/rev and depth of cut- 0.5mm corresponds minimum Rz.  
3. Confirmation experiment conducted at optimal parameter setting resulted in optimum value of Rz- 4.81 
µm. 
In essence, it can be concluded that machinability challenges of SS304 type difficult-to-machine materials can be 
overcame by sustainable techniques where green cutting fluids possess the capability to prevent excessive tool wear 
and generate good surface quality along with keeping the environment clean and green.

Abstract 
Superalloys are high performance materials used in aerospace, chemical, scientific, and military applications. 
Machining of these alloys is challenging and to obtain better machinability, it is mandatory to follow some 
sustainable ways. This paper presents a review of work conducted on machinability of nickel-based superalloys and 
discusses the novel tool texturing for machinability enhancement of difficult-to-machine materials. It first presents 
an introduction of nickel-based superalloys, discusses some tool wear aspects, reviews some of the important 
literature which is then followed by a separate discussion on tool texture based machining. The aim of this paper is 
to facilitate researchers and scholars working in the field of advanced and sustainable machining of difficult-to-
machine materials, and to promote future research and innovations to establish the field further.

1. Introduction
Nickel based superalloys are the high-performance material used for many engineering applications. These alloys 
are preferably used for high temperature applications such as in aviation jet engines, nuclear reactors, and power 
plants etc. (Mouritz, 2012; Ezugwu et al., 1999). In the last two decades, the demand of superalloys has been 
tremendously increased. Superior mechanical properties and performance under high thermal operating conditions 
have increased its demand. Machining of superalloys is a challenge with the existing conventional machining 
processes (Pervaiz et al., 2014). Selection of appropriate machining process with optimal process parameter and 
cutting tool combination is the most important task. These alloys are highly difficult-to-machine (DTM) materials 
and result in poor machinability while machining by conventional turning, milling, and drilling processes (Guo et 
al., 2009; Thakur et al., 2009). Low thermal conductivity and high work hardening rate make its machining 
challenging and result in rapid tool wear, work surface quality deterioration, increased cutting fluid consumption, 
and overall escalated machining cost. It compels to explore new ways to machine these alloys. Several studies have 
been conducted on investigation on tool wear and other machinability indicators while machining these alloys (Guo 
et al., 2009; Thakur et al., 2009; Anthony et al., 2017). It is reported that the poor thermal conductivity and work 
hardening of the alloy induce to produce high temperature while machining superalloys which results in frequent 
tool wear under severe machining conditions and consequently escalated machining cost with high energy and 
resource consumption.  
It is important to understand the mechanism of machining involved in various materials. In order to enhance the 
machinability of engineering materials, specially, DTM materials, there are many ways such as using green 
lubricants and sustainable lubrication techniques, selection of appropriate tool materials and coatings, tool 
treatments, and optimizing machining parameters etc (Gupta and Laubscher, 2017). 
Study of work-tool interface is also important which leads to the possible interaction and machining mechanism to 
be happened and consequently the tool behavior and generation of forces etc. It is worth mentioning that based on 
the cutting tool geometry, the interaction between the cutting tool and the workpiece varies. During machining, with 
reference to the cutting tool speed and the tool geometry, the materials are induced to remove. Material removal will 
be in the direction of resultant of shear angle (Grzesik, 2017). Figure 1 illustrates the fundamental of tool velocity 
and cutting geometry of metal cutting. Where; Vc – chip velocity, Vt – tool velocity, Vs – shear velocity, α – rake 
angle and ϕ – shear angle. There are two regimes in the chip flow direction. Sliding zone and sticking zone are the 
two major regimes found influencing the tool failure (Figure 2). Sticking zone is directly induced at the shear plane

The basic dimensional requirements for tool texturing are important and mandatory to be considered. Some of the 
nomenclatures are texture external diameter (Dext), internal dimeter (Dint), horizontal pitch (PH), vertical pitch (PV) 
and tool nose clearance (Tc). Figure 6 represents the geometrical design for dimple texture. Same parameters have to 
be maintained in parallel or zig – zag texturing of cutting tool. The reason for these dimensions is to avoid thermal 
stress and surface damage due to the laser heat source used for engraving the cutting tool.  
 
 
Figure 6. Basic geometrical consideration for dimple tool texturing 
 
Other than laser texturing, researchers have also used some conventional and unconventional techniques to modify 
the cutting tool radius. To improve the efficiency of cutting tool-work interface efficiency, Jesudass et al. 2017 
applied conventional diamond tips of vickers hardness, rockwell hardness and diamond dressing tool to mark 
profile. Using these tools, dimples and scratches are produced for machining of stainless steel.  
While machining with the textured tools, powder solid particle lubricants are widely used. The solid particle 
lubricants are spreaded to be filled in the texture pattern before machining. Presence of solid lubricants during 
machining manages the amount of heat generated. In the above shown laser textures, the surface area developed is in 
line tracks. Literatures are available and discuss the combined effect of tool texture and solid lubricants. The 
maximum amount of lubricants is stored over the surface textures and supports to dissipate the heat on machining.  
From the literature, it is clear to infer that the grooves, lines and waves are more effective than the simple dimples 
textures. Deng et al. 2012, used MoS2 as a solid lubricant with surface texture cutting tools for machining studies. 
Research explored with different patterns, in which elliptical grooves filled with MoS2 solid lubricant has produced 
good results compared to the parallel or perpendicular groves. Especially, the patterns and textures designed parallel 
to the cutting edge has produced better results than the perpendicular textures (Obikawa et al., 2011; Obikawa and 
Kani, 2012). Subsequently, it has been proved that the continuous texture has high efficiency with less cutting force, 
minimum tool wear and best surface finish than the spotted texture (Koshy and Tovey, 2011). Xing et al. 2014 stated 
that the tungsten disulphide (WS2) coated ceramic cutting tools with nano textures created by laser texturing had 
considerably improved the lubricity. Reduction in cutting force, coefficient of friction, tool wear, and cutting 
temperature were reported for nano textured tools with coatings. It is also suggested that the tool texturing can be 
done on flank face rather than rake face (Anand et al., 2012).  
A detailed study has been made to discuss about the superalloys, machinability of superalloys, machining process 
and different modifications on cutting tool. Enormous work has been carried out in machining Inconel 718. There 
are many grades of nickel-based superalloys which has not been focused by many researchers in last two decades. 
On other hand, in the view of research scope, machining superalloys can be explored more with conventional 
machining process, modified cutting tool and its process conditions. Therefore, machinability studies can be 
performed on superalloys with modified cutting tools.  
 
3. Conclusions 
 
Machinability aspects of nickel-based superalloys are discussed in this paper. It presents the review of some past 
work conducted on its machinability investigation and discusses tool texturing techniques for machinability 
enhancement. The following points are drawn as a conclusion: 
  
1. Extensive research work has been conducted on investigation on machinability of nickel-based superalloys. 
Especially Inconel 718 has been investigated in detail which creates a future scope to study the 
machinability of other superalloys. 
2. Conventional cutting tools especially made of carbides are widely used in existing research. The 
modification in cutting tool can be the major topic in forth coming research.

Abstract 
In electric discharge machining (EDM), dielectric mixed with powder plays very important role and helps to attain 
superior machinability of engineering materials. In this paper, analysis and optimization of material removal rate 
(that represents process productivity) during powder-mixed dielectric based EDM of AISI 5160 steel is discussed. 
Copper electrodes (as cathode) of 26 mm diameter and conductive copper powder 44 µm particle size have been 
used during machining. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array based experimental study where voltage, peak current, and 
pulse duration have been varied at three levels each to analyze their effects on MRR. It is studied that MRR 
increased with increase in peak current and pulse duration. Optimum value of MRR (0.466 g/s) has been compared 
with the MRR obtained during normal EDM process.

1. Introduction
Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is an advanced machining process used to machine conductive materials 
irrespective of their hardness (Gupta and Jain, 2017). It works on the principle of thermos-electric erosion where 
material removal or cutting takes place by sparks occur between two electrodes i.e. tool electrode (cathode) and 
workpiece (anode) under the influence of dielectric fluid. This process has many variants and has been used to cut 
many types of difficult-to-machine materials, and to machine typical features and shapes. In recent years, EDM has 
been extensively used as an alternate to conventional machining techniques. In normal or classical EDM, to obtain 
high material removal rate is a challenge, and it is always on the cost of poor surface quality. The possible solutions 
of this problem are to machine at optimum parameters with appropriate electrode material and using powder-mixed 
dielectric. Mixing of powder increases the insulating strength of the dielectric which reduces its frequent ionization 
and helps to obtain better productivity (Marashi et al, 2016). Al, SiC, Si, Ti and W are some of powder types used 
in powder-mixed EDM. After applying voltage and generation of electric field, the gap between tool electrode and 
workpiece is filled with powder particles and they increase the gap distance. The energized charged powder particles 
act as conductors and form clusters in the spark gap. Further, they bridge the gap between the tool electrode and 
workpiece and help to initiate early explosion. It consequently leads to faster sparking and erosion of work surface 
material. Power-mixed dielectric based EDM has potential and can be explored in machining of difficult-to-machine 
materials. Some past work on this process is discussed here as under. 
Kansal et.al (2007) worked on the powder-mixed EDM and using silicon powder particle in deionized water as 
dielectric. Response surface methodology based analysis resulted in better surface finish and improved material 
removal rate. In a recent study, Singh (2018) successfully achieved over 40% improvement in MRR while 
machining D2 steel by powder-mixed EDM. Surface quality improvement in terms of reduction in crack density and 
recast layer thickness was achieved by Long et al. (2016) after fine machining of die steel by titan powder mixed 
EDM. Kolli and Kumar (2014) observed significant influence of boron carbide powder on material removal rate, 
surface roughness, and tool wear rate during powder mixed EDM of titanium alloys. An investigation on 
performance evaluation of various powders reveals the suitability and superiority of multi-walled carbon nanotube 
and Al powder to obtain higher MRR and better surface finish in EDM of EN-19 alloy steel (Mondal et al., 2018).

Larger-the-better type characteristic formula has been used in Taguchi analysis of MRR. From Fig. 2, it is observed 
that MRR first increases with increase in voltage and then decreases. Increase in peak current increases MRR. The 
reason is the increase in the spark energy between the tool electrode and work-piece. With pulse duration, MRR first 
decreases and then starts increasing rapidly. Further increase in pulse duration after 10 µs, is first used to remove the 
deposited material and then after complete removal, it removes fresh material from the worksurface (Kumar et al, 
2018).

It is evident from the analysis of the experimental results that second level of V, third level of P and PD result in 
maximum MRR (See Table 6). Therefore, mean value of MRR can be calculated using Equation 1.

µMRR = 0.71849- 2 (0.136278) 
µMRR = 0.445934 g/min 
 
The validation experiments are performed at the suggested optimal setting for MRR. Table 7 shows the optimal 
setting suggested for MRR and the values of MRR predicted at optimal setting along with its experimental value.

4. Conclusions 
The results of investigation on material removal rate while powder-mixed EDM of AISI5160 steel is reported in this 
paper. Voltage was found as the most significant parameter. Optimum process parameters i.e. 60 Volta voltage, 45 
Amp peak current, and 150 µs pulse duration produced the best value of MRR 0.466 g/s. A detailed investigation on 
analysis of all machinability indicators, comparison of powed-mixed EDM performance with classical and other 
variants of EDM, and softcomputing technique based process optimization etc. can be possible avenues for future 
research.

Abstract : 
The digital transformation of society is not a recent topic. Technology is everywhere, via connected 
watches, in our pockets with our smartphones and at home with connected objects. It connects us to a world 
that makes our lives easier and creates interconnections between people and businesses. This new world 
created by us and for us uses our data to facilitate our daily lives and deepen our links with consumption. 
The emergence of new tools based on Artificial Intelligence, and some technological transformations based 
on Big Data, as well as the development of the use of Internet of Objects, push for a profound change 
impacting all the business processes of the enterprise. A large number of studies have been conducted in 
the field have tried to give a comprehensive portrait to understand some aspects of digital transformation 
better. The purpose of this study is to form a basis for future studies which may help future studies to 
understand the digital transformation and its characteristics better and also to build a framework of digital 
transformation. The purpose of this study is to give a comprehensive state of the art of digital transformation 
through a review of 164 that can serve as a basis for a roadmap for digital transformation. 
Introduction : 
Nowadays, Companies are changing due to new information and communication technologies, but few have 
understood how to reap the benefits of this phenomenon. The digital transformation (DT) is essential for all companies, 
regardless of their size and sector of activity. Beyond the dematerialization of work processes, this approach allows 
companies to optimize their operations, and to gain in performance, efficiency, and competitiveness through the 
adoption of a new management mode, new tools, new methods of work but also new reflections and organizations.    
The DT has become a significant topic of concern and a strategic issue for all organizations. It offers new opportunities 
for companies, beyond their traditional activities, by accelerating their growth and creating sustainable competitive 
advantages and security of operations. 
The DT increases the profitability of the company by simplifying processes and interactions within the company. The 
technologies linked to the DT such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Social networks and the 
Internet of Things, offer new uses based on innovation and focused on the needs of the consumer. The use of these 
tools has become a vital issue for companies of all types of activities, sizes, and nationalities. However, the 
implementation of new technologies is not sufficient to make the digital enterprise, it is a broader phenomenon, which 
supposes not only the use of new digital tools but also the changes of the critical business elements, including strategy, 
business model, business processes, organizational structures and organizational culture (V. Arribas and J. A. Alfaro, 
2018). It is a way of culture to appropriate, not only within companies but also in everyday life. Strategy, as well as 
changes to an organization, including its structure, processes, and culture, are required to yield the capability to 
generate new paths for value creation.

Abstract 
Indonesian shipbuilding industry is a labor intensive business. There are several stages and activities in shipbuilding 
that needs process efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we implement the lean management to eliminate 
waste and create value. We start by identifying the critical wastes in the traditional shipbuilding industry. 
Subsequently, we prioritize the waste using analytical hierarchy process and investigate the source and reason by 
fishbone diagram. The result showed that the process of dropping the ship into the sea that causes the bottom of the 
ship break down is the most critical waste. Several root causes are analyzed by fishbone diagram, such as: men, 
material, method, and environment. Based on the results of the Risk Priority Number assessment, it can be inferred 
the highest priority of broken-down vessel that is the rocky environmental conditions when the ship drops to sea. 
The lowest priority is the limitation of equipment, which causes the process of dropping ships to sea not straight. 
Furthermore, all the main causes are given an improvement proposal in order to minimize the risk of the bottom of 
the ship break down during the process of dropping ship to sea.

1. Introduction
The focus of lean management is to eliminate wastes and create value. The seven wastes in lean management
concept most relevant to shipbuilding industries are: (1) transportation, (2) inventory, (3) motion, (4) waiting, (5) 
over-processing, (6) overproduction, and (7) defects. The waste of transportation refers to the movement of products 
in between processes. Processes should be as close as possible and material flow directly from process to process 
without any significant delays in between. The waste in transportation can be a very costly since transportation does 
not add any value to the product. The other waste which should be reduced as much as possible is inventory which 
increases redundant materials and add the cost without adding any value to the product. The waste of motion refers 
to the movement within a process that does not add value. The waste of waiting refers to any idle time produced 
when two interdependent processes are not completely synchronized. Waiting time is due to unsynchronized 
machines, products, people, and information that results in ineffective process. The waste of overproduction is due 
to the overproduction of a product that results in work-in-process and surplus stock. The waste of over-processing is 
caused by a lack of standard operations practice (SOP) and unclear specification/quality acceptance standards. Since 
product defects require rework or replacement, it results in a waste of resources and materials. Therefore, it is more 
effective to eliminate or reduce defective products. 
There are several studies about lean management. Cherrafi et al. (2017) studied the barriers in green lean 
implementation. They found that there were fifteen significant barriers which were classified into linkage and 
dependent ones. Villareal et al. (2016) studied lean in road transport operations. The results showed that the number 
of distribution routes and distance travelled were reduced by 27% and 32%, respectively. Garza-Reyes et al. (2018) 
investigated the impact of lean methods, such as Just In Time, autonomation, kaizen/continuous improvement, total 
productive maintenance and value stream mapping on four utilized measures for the compliance of environmental 
performance, such as material use, energy consumption, non-product output, and pollutant releases. Sharma and 
Gandhi (2017) studied and verified scope and impact of implementing lean in shipbuilding. Babur et al. (2016)

4. Conclusion and Implications 
 
We have described the waste activities in building traditional boats. All of waste activities are classified into 6 
wastes. By using AHP, we found that the process of dropping the ship into the sea that causes the bottom of the ship 
break down is the most critical waste. Several root causes are analyzed by fishbone diagram, such as: men, material, 
method, and environment. Based on the results of the RPN assessment, it can be prioritized the main cause of 
broken-down vessel that is the rocky environmental conditions when the ship drops to sea. The lowest priority is the 
limitation of equipment, which causes the process of the ships dropping into the sea to be not straight. Furthermore, 
all the main causes are given an improvement proposal in order to minimize the risk of the bottom of the ship break 
down during the process of the ships dropping into the sea. The future research can be done by implementing the 
lean-six sigma to improve the performance of building traditional ships.

Forecast Model for Return Quality in Reverse Logistics 
Networks

Abstract 
 
Giving rise to the field of reverse logistics are legislations mandating the take-back and recovery of products, 
causing high costs for manufacturers but no guaranteed profitability. One way to tackle this challenge is to demystify 
the multi-faceted uncertainties of product returns namely timing, volume and quality, that currently inhibit optimality 
of reverse logistics networks (RLN).  
One contributor to this risk is the uncertainty in the quality level of used electronics caused by variations in 
consumer usage behaviors. It would be useful if businesses could have data about the expected quality levels of future 
returns for efficient planning of RLN design and resource allocation. The objective of this thesis is to develop a 
quantitative model that can estimate the return quality of future electronics returns. The applicability of this model 
lies in enabling reprocessors to strategically design an RLN with the optimal number, capacity and location of the 
necessary facilities, with the aim of reducing the risks of costly investments, while facilitating RLNs that are both, 
environmentally and economically viable. 
While significant literature on forecast of volume and timing of returned products exists, there is scare work on 
forecasting of return quality. Additionally, significant literature explores the use of IoT, RFID and prognostic health 
monitoring (PHM) systems, characteristic of Industry 4.0, as a method of using life cycle data to predict return quality. 
However, it can be argued that these costly methods can only be justified for products with long life spans. As an 
alternative for short-lived products, this thesis develops a forecast model for return quality based on consumer behavior 
trends.  
The proposed forecast model incorporates three major factors that affect quality: usage, technological age, and 
remaining economic value of expected returns. The novelty of the model lies in deducing usage distributions through 
segmentation of the consumers by three socioeconomic factors:  age, income, and location. These usage distributions 
are used to estimate remaining life of returns, the associated recovery costs and the subsequent profitability based on 
economic market trends. 
Firstly, the methodology involves establishing a correlation between relevant socioeconomic factors and 
smartphone usage behaviors through statistical tests of association. To this end, empirical data from surveys has been 
used to derive trends between the response variables, smartphone usage and purchase behavior, and the independent 
variables, which are the socioeconomic factors.  
Secondly, a complex system of equations is developed incorporating usage level and time-based secondary market 
value trends of the product. They determine the most feasible quality level of a unit based on expected profit that can 
be derived from it through the streams of direct reuse, refurbishing, parts harvest, or materials recycling. 
For demonstration of the model, a random sample of smartphone returns based on consumers in Canada, generated 
using Monte Carlo Methods, is input into the forecast model to predict the output- which is the distribution of return 
quality from the collections in Canadian cities.    
 The results of this thesis can be used by original equipment manufacturers, government or third party reprocessors, 
to design a more efficient RLN by providing them information on what quality levels to expect from the used 
smartphones.

Abstract 
Blockchain technology is a systematic record-keeping of data, termed “ledger-keeping”, such that once a record is 
created, it is saved on multiple servers, shared with all parties on the network, and locked to disable tampering. The 
core competencies that govern blockchain are transparency, immutability (tamper-proof) and decentralization. These 
features of blockchain present a powerful solution to eliminate the transparency issues that currently plague nuclear 
supply chains and inhibit effective risk management.  
Risk management of nuclear supply chains is critical because it involves transport of fuel materials that can potentially 
be developed into nuclear weapons. The supply chain of nuclear fuel is a multi-stage process in which the raw material 
suppliers, fuel processers, and end-users (reactors) are commonly located across multiple countries. Each stage of 
transportation is prone to the risk of unauthorized removal of fuel material from the shipment. Heightening this risk 
is the lack of visibility of material during international transport. Such long transit times allow for any event of theft 
to go unnoticed until the shipment reaches the destination. For detection of theft, the IAEA calls for measurements 
and record-keeping of the gross weight of each shipment at every shipper’s and receiver’s end, at every tier of the 
supply chain, a procedure known as nuclear material accounting. A second risk is that these record entries can be 
tampered with, even by authorized workers, for concealment of theft. In order to reduce these risks, this paper proposes 
the application of blockchain in global nuclear fuel supply chains 
Integration of blockchain into nuclear supply chains can enable the mitigation of these risks by facilitating traceability 
of materials, allowing timely and precise detection of location of theft and eliminating the contingency of record- 
tampering through digitization of the nuclear material accounting registry. This paper explores the applicability of 
blockchains in the nuclear context by: (1) Mapping the nuclear fuel supply chain (2) Identifying and prioritizing 
associated risks using FMEA and (3) Proposing a framework of the blockchain infrastructure needed to reduce the 
occurrence of the identified risks.

Abstract 
Although sustainability in supply chains has been garnering increased attention, there is much room for prescriptive 
research devoted to operationalizing sustainability in apparel supply chains (ASCs). Being one of the largest polluters, 
apparel industry landfills immense amounts of garments most of which could be reconditioned, reused, or recycled 
into useful raw materials. Especially, fast fashion (low-cost clothing designs based on current, high-cost luxury fashion 
trends) necessitates fast-response supply chains, encouraging disposability, and thereby exacerbating an unsustainable 
consumption. The importance of sustainability in ASCs are emphasized via trends in 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle), 
recycling facts in North America, and apparel companies that actively engaged in sustainability initiatives. To that 
end, we study a closed-loop apparel supply chain (CLASC) model that include the process of recycling end-of-life 
garments. When the implications of fast fashion on profitability, environmental and social costs, recycling costs, and 
incentives offered to consumers are factored in, we study the optimal pricing decision for the CLASC and provide a 
closed-form solution. Model analytics, managerial insights along with numerical illustrations are offered.

Abstract 
Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery (TEOR) is a popular enhanced oil recovery process that is applied in the heavy oil 
reservoirs to reduce oil viscosity and make the oil mobile. In addition to viscosity reduction steam can evaporate the 
hydrocarbon components in the crude and carry along in the gas phase. 
Fula North Field (FNE) reservoirs are highly porous (~30%), permeable (1-2 Darcy) and unconsolidated sand in 
nature. the fluid properties include viscous crude from 15 to 17.7 API with corresponding viscosity average of 845 
cp at reservoir conditions. The reservoir pressure and temperature are given to be 527 psig and 44 °C.  
The main objective of this study was to show the good reservoir management used to improve the oil production 
from FNE Oil Field, the performance of cyclic steam stimulation and steam flood in a Sudanese oil reservoir will be 
illustrated. 
The first pilot phase 31 wells by 2010 to 2012 from 2012 to 2103 11 wells has been added and then 49 wells has 
drilled as CSS wells from 2014 to 2016, the average oil daily production for this field has been increase from 5,300 
bbl/d as of Dec. 2014 to 8,300 bbl/d as of Sep., 2016 the peak production has recorded on 2016 as 9000 bbl/d. 
After the successful implementation of CSS as full field in FNE Oil Field the plan is to go steam flooding and a pilot 
has been started since September, 2015 and still under evaluation, The result showed that the CSS is very successful 
and the average oil rate is almost 1.6 times compared to cold production, the CSS only can increase the recovery 
percent from 32.5 - 34.2% which makes it more attractive method as development scenario for FNE oil field. 
The suggested way forward for this field considering the CSS and SF scenarios has been proposed

Abstract 
One of the most pressing issues in today’s engineering education is whether we need/need-not to change from 
conventional engineering education and explore more creative and innovative ways to educate engineers to be ready 
for today’s dynamic and disruptive industry. Research indicates that employers are now seeking engineers with soft 
skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, lifelong learning, and others in addition to their technical skills. Thus, 
one needs to ask the question, do we equip and prepare our students with the right soft skills, in addition to the technical 
skills, using conventional engineering education? Are there any other educational approach that could help in 
developing the student soft skills? To address these questions, we studied the implementation of the flipped classroom 
methodology in two of the upper-division Industrial Engineering courses. We explored, via a survey, the students’ 
learning and perspective in two flipped classrooms from the lens of the reported advantages and advantages categories 
in the literature. The results of the survey indicated that the flipped classroom model improved the students’ critical 
thinking skills, promote creativity, helped them focus on problem-solving, improved their ICT skills, and improved 
their learning performance. On the other hand, the top disadvantages based on the students’ perspective included the 
not preferred method, time-consuming, unfair method, and resistance to change.

1. Introduction
Engineering education has been established for decades and still continue in the same fashion and classroom settings 
until today (Aamer et al., 2017; Mason et al., 2013). One could claim, if conventional engineering education has 
worked successfully since the past, why do we need to change the way we teach our engineering students? One of the 
most pressing issues in today’s engineering education is whether we need/need not change from conventional 
engineering education and explore more creative and innovative ways to educate engineers to be ready for today’s 
dynamic and disruptive industry. Research indicates that employers are now seeking engineers with soft skills such 
as critical thinking, problem-solving, lifelong learning, and others in addition to their technical skills,  (Gerwel Proches 
et al., 2018; Wnek and Williamson, 2010). Thus, one needs to ask the question, do we equip and prepare our students 
with the right soft skills, in addition to the technical skills, using conventional engineering education? Are there any 
other educational approach that could help in developing the student soft skills?  
One of the recent emerging and popular instructional method in engineering education is the flipped classroom 
approach (Al-Hammoud, 2017; Castedo et al., 2019). The flipped classroom model is defined as the method of 
inverting the activities outside the classroom to be conducted inside and vice versa. This means that the activities the

agreement on the advantages is 47% which is not a high percentage of positive experience of the flipped classroom. 
If we compare our findings from this research to the highest ranked advantages reported in the literature, we can see 
a match with improving learning performance, but it is not that high. However, more interaction with students was 
not among the reported advantages in our study since the engagement factor scored a low agreement percentage of 
23%. Other factors that reported in the literature such as flexible learning is evident in some of the open-ended 
questions reported by the students in terms of the convenience of watching videos at home and being able to slow 
down or speed up the videos. The positive feedback reported in the literature was not reflected in our survey results 
since the overall agreement of advantages was 47%, but some students expressed their positive feedback in the open-
ended questions. One explanation could be due to the first exposure of students to the flipped classroom model and 
could be an adoption issue.  
 
On the other hand, the top disadvantages based on the students’ perspective included the not preferred method, time-
consuming, unfair method, and resistance to change. The lowest percentage of the disadvantage is the feeling anxious 
followed by increased workload and adoption problems. The aggregate percentage of the students’ agreement on the 
disadvantages is 36%.  The parentage results matched with some of the most reported of disadvantages in the literature 
such as the limited student preparation before class, time-consuming for students, but no issues with the quality of 
recorded videos. However, some students expressed their concerns in the open-ended questions when they talked 
about the preparation time outside the classroom, but interestingly enough the students in our study did not find the 
workload time to be a major factor or a disadvantage of the flipped classroom model.   
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In response to employers’ interest in seeking engineers with soft skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, 
lifelong learning, and others in addition to their technical skills, we explored the flipped classroom model to assess if 
it is an effective active learning model to equip and prepare students with the right soft and technical skills. A survey 
composed of 18 determinants/questions (advantages and disadvantages) affecting the flipped classroom, along with 
three open-ended questions, was given to a total of 44 third year Industrial Engineering students. The results of the 
survey indicated that the flipped classroom improved the students’ critical thinking skills, promote creativity, helped 
them focus on problem-solving, improved their ICT skills, and improved their learning performance. The aggregate 
percentage of the students’ agreement on the advantages is 47% which was not a high percentage of positive 
experience of the flipped classroom. On the contrary, the top disadvantages based on the students’ perspective included 
the not preferred method, time-consuming, unfair method, and resistance to change. The aggregate percentage of the 
students’ agreement on the disadvantages is 36%.   
 
All in all, based on our survey and analysis, there was no conclusive evidence of the preference, or not, of using the 
flipped classroom model in higher level Industrial Engineering courses. The aggregate percentages of the students’ 
agreement on the flipped classroom model advantages and disadvantages do not outweigh one side over the other. 
Therefore, a follow-up study in future semesters should be conducted to verify the results and collect more data, and 
perhaps employ more in-depth statistical analysis.

Abstract 
Durability and serviceability of a highway can be ensured by use of proper quality materials and then, 
mixing them in right proportion.  The present work is a case study on proportioning of aggregate materials 
for construction of surface course of highways. Most of the times, the aggregates available for mixing have 
particle size grading that, if used, will not meet all of the specifications.  In such situations, it becomes very 
difficult to determine a right proportioning of aggregates that will have the minimum amount of deviation 
from such specifications. Existing methodologies for the proportioning do not ensure the best solution from 
this viewpoint. To overcome such difficulties, the aggregate proportioning problem has been formulated as 
a goal-programming model.  The approach described in this paper is equally applicable for proportioning 
of the aggregates for some of the other layers of a highway.

1. Introduction
Development of infrastructure, particularly surface transportation, is one of the most important steps leading to overall 
progress and growth of any nation.  Transportation contributes to economic and industrial development of any region. 
Transport facilities are required as passengers and various types of commodities need be transported from place to 
place.  The transportation is also essential for rapid strategic movement in case of emergencies caused due to external 
or internal reasons and/or for effective maintenance and enforcement of law and order within the country.  It 
contributes to national integration by restraining the narrow feelings of sectionalism and regionalism and checks the 
ugly development of slums by serving to avoid the concentration of population at low socio-economic echelon in and 
around the large urban areas.  Government of India, having realized this fact, laid much greater emphasis on the 
development of surface transportation routes of high quality.   Development of Golden Quadrilateral, and North-South 
and East-West corridors is the proof of the same. 
Therefore, transportation facilities can be seen not only to affect economic growth of the nation, but also to have 
tremendous impact on social and cultural development of any country.  India, being a vast country and very much 
underdeveloped when compared to other developed countries, has so far not been able to develop the road system 
upto the desired level. It is an established truth that greater industrial development is possible only if the road network 
is well planned, designed and developed.  With efficient road network, industries even having small capital may get 
favourable conditions for their development. At present, all the major industries are concentrated along seaports or 
railheads where transport facilities for bulk carriers are available. Such places are getting crowded with the passage 
of time, creating biospheric pollution (Papacostas 1987, Chandola 2001) and deterioration in the living standards of

5. Conclusions         
 
In a number of civil engineering applications, mixing of particles on the basis of their size gradation has been applied 
in various major areas like structural engineering for building construction, transportation engineering for making 
certain layers of flexible pavements, environmental engineering for preparing filtration systems, geotechnical 
engineering to erect embankments, and in hydraulics and water resources engineering to build earthen dams. In 
addition to the few applications mentioned above, there are many others involving the use of materials graded on the 
basis of size characteristics to achieve certain properties like surface-smoothness, durability, porosity, filterability, 
strength, compaction, drainage etc. 
 
In the present paper, a case study regarding aggregate proportioning has been discussed with reference to bituminous 
mix design problem for highway construction.  The approaches employed currently, like trial and error or graphical 
methods, consume more time and still do not necessarily yield the best solution.  Many times, the solution may not be 
even possible from the application of these conventional techniques or these may yield the results showing large 
deviations from the specifications.  Goal programming approach presented in this paper overcomes these difficulties 
and definitely ensures the best solution under the specified problem framework. 
 
Versatility of this approach can be very effectively and successfully employed for solving a large number of problems 
of the similar nature in other areas also.

Abstract 
 
This study deals with evaporation phenomenon of liquefied natural gas (LNG) during its storage in an above ground 
tank. The LNG is stored at -162°C in heavily thermally insulated tanks. Due to imperfect insulation, heat leaks from 
the surrounded environment cause substantial losses by evaporation. The rate of generated vapors (Boil-off-Gas) 
depends essentially on the storage conditions (composition of the LNG, storage pressure, materials and dimensions of 
the tank, climatic conditions of surrounded environment, etc.). The objective of the present study is the evaluation of 
the radiation heat transfer from sidewall surface to LNG liquid surface under real storage conditions relevant to the 
Skikda’s liquefaction plant during in Algeria. Three different relative positions of the liquid surface corresponding to 
three LNG filling level in the tank were considered. The results show that the radiative heat transfer mode plays an 
important role in the evaporation phenomenon (more than 50% of the total heat leakages). The results we have 
obtained tend to confirm that the thermal radiation cannot be neglected.

for reinforcement during the development and production of MMC. In recent past, industrial coal fly ash has been 
used extensively for reinforcement both in stir casting and friction stir processing and this material are basically 
found in big cities of some countries and as such not easily accessible to everyone. In this study, domestic wood fly 
ash has been developed, characterized and utilized as reinforcement during friction stir processing of aluminium 
alloy 7075-T651 due to its accessibility and availability to everyone, even people in the villages. The friction and wear 
behaviours such as wear resistance, wear rate, wear volume, and coefficient of friction of the processed samples 
were studied. Ball on flat disk tests were performed using Rtec Universal tribometer MTF 5000 with varying loads of 
20 and 50 N under influence of dry friction. It was noted that at higher load of 50 N addition of wood fly ash greatly 
reduced wear rate, volume loss and coefficient of friction and also increased wear resistance. It was also obvious that 
abrasive wear was conspicuous at lower load of 20 N than at higher load and as such more debris were noted at lower 
load.

Abstract 
Project based learning (PBL) is an educational technique where learners gain subject knowledge and learn by 
investigating and responding while busy doing a project or challenge. It implies learner’s active involvement in a 
real world problem where s/he can apply, investigate, respond, and reapply the theoretical knowledge to find 
appropriate solutions. This paper presents some significant insights about a teaching innovation project conducted 
on project based learning for better understanding the manufacturing engineering module contents. First project 
based learning (PBL) is introduced which is followed by some review of past research work conducted on PBL, then 
formulation of a project problem for the students of manufacturing engineering is discussed and it ends with the 
analysis of the students response on the effectiveness of PBL for them to understand and learn the module contents. 
A majority of the students realized the effectiveness of PBL technique, and accepted better understanding of the 
manufacturing processes and learning enhancement. It is worth mentioning that the University of Johannesburg is a 
forerunner institution globally to implement, follow and encourage the fourth industrial revolution activities in 
teaching and research. As regards to that, it is hoped that this project would contribute to develop industry 4.0 ready 
engineers to cater the local and international needs.

1. Introduction
Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogical technique that involves a dynamic classroom 
approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world 
challenges and problems (Frank et al., 2003; Rios et al, 2010). In PBL, students learn about a topic/course/subject by 
working on a project or challenge, where they busy investigating and responding. Here, an advantage of digital tools 
and technologies can be taken to accomplish project requirements and further product development. PBL can also be 
recognized as an education tool where teaching and learning is done by engaging students in investigation. The three 
set of techniques, namely, problem based learning, project based learning, and CDIO (conceive, design, implement, 
and operate) have been identified as revolutionary techniques to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills 
for learner’s success and better results in engineering education (Crawley et al., 2007; Perrenet et al., 2000; Rios et 
al., 2010). To conceive or formulate a project in project based learning is a major challenging task, as it must be 
feasible; fulfill the requirements of learning objectives; aligned to the skill development goals; along with fulfilling 
the course/subject contextual requirements. The important past attempts on PBL based education are discussed here 
as under. 
Kanigolla et al. (2014) investigated the impact of PBL on the students learning in a lean and six sigma course. A 
survey based on twenty three questions (belong to learning, critical thinking and engagement) was conducted and it 
was found that the students found project very effective to understand and learn six sigma fundamentals. Frank et al. 
(2003) also reported the effectiveness of PBL for development of engineering thinking; information retrieval, 
problem solving and laboratory skills in the students. An important work reports the improvement in student’s 
performance in the electrical control technology course after PBL interventions (Samaca and Ramirez, 2010). A 
recent study identifies PBL as an effective complimentary technique for the enhanced student learning in lean 
manufacturing module (Tortorella and Miguel, 2018). In case of many engineering subjects where laboratory work

Abstract 
The management function of any organization is to ensure that the set goals, visions and objectives of the 
organization meet customer satisfaction through the implementation of a Quality Management system 
(QMS). The aim of the study is to reduce the gap between management expectations of set standards and 
the given performance of the organization by employees, thus finding measures to reduce those gaps and 
decrease customer dissatisfaction. Primary and secondary questions are aimed to answer the following 
questions respectively: Will the implementation of QMS through an ISO13485 improve customer 
satisfaction in a medical diagnostics equipment manufacturing organization? And does staff engagement in 
the objectives set by management have a relationship to customer satisfaction? The researchers employ the 
mixed-method approach using a local diagnostics devices manufacturer as a case study. Evaluation of the 
operations system is done through data collection from employees and customers with the means of 
questionnaires. The study concluded that through statistical analysis obtained, there was unanimous support 
of the fact that implementation of a QMS has a positive effect on customer satisfaction, although the 
acceptance of the system’s implementation is not welcomed by minority of employees.

1. Introduction
Looking at a business from a comprehensive vantage point, including all the stages throughout the value chain that is 
established from the identification of needs within a market, through the conception of a product, until the satisfaction 
of those needs, it is evident that any organisation that set for itself the aim of satisfying customer needs should consider, 
in today’s complex world where those needs are ever changing, implementing a Quality Management System (QMS) 
customised to ensure that its process, service or product conforms to the objectives and the purposes for which it is to 
be used – satisfying the needs of its customers (Murmura and Bravi, 2016). By definition, a QMS incorporate the 
hierarchical structure, activities, projects and actions intended to guarantee that an item, procedure or administrations 
adjusts to the goals and the reasons for which it is to be utilized (Murmura and Bravi, 2016). Alternatively, a structured 
collection of business processes focused mainly on continuously meeting customer requirements and enhancing their 
satisfaction is known as QMS.  
The implementation of QMS has been trusted by many organizations in the past years (Pharm Out, 2016). As 
unequivocally noted by Murmura and Bravi (2016), in ongoing decades the compliance and use of institutionalized 
QMS models have been viewed as one of the most basic occasions in quality management advancement and 
globalization (Ruzevicius, Adomaitiene, and Sirvidaite, 2004; Sheehan and Presenza, 2011; Nabavi, Azizi, and

Abstract 
This study analyzed the contribution of entrepreneurship education and social networks on entrepreneurial desire 
among office technology and management students of Federal Polytechnic Kaura Namoda Zamfara State, Nigeria. 
Entrepreneurship education has modify students’ entrepreneurial intent, despite inconclusive findings among 
researchers. Theory of Planned Behaviour was adopted as the theoretical framework for study since past studies 
suggests that willingness can predict emerging issues. The survey design method using purposive sampling technique, 
where 240 students were selected from OTM department was adopted in the study. SPSS version 23 was used to 
analyze the data. Result indicated that participants with high EE showed higher level of entrepreneurial intent than 
those with low EE. Similarly, those with higher social network showed significantly high level of entrepreneurial 
intent than those with low-level social network. The researcher here agree that EE and social network play crucial 
function in students’ intent for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship courses should be included in the students 
curriculum. Findings as well shown that some of the students show willingness of becoming entrepreneurs at the end 
of their programs.

1. INTRODUCTION
The importance of entrepreneurship on the growth and development of any nation has attracted attention by 
researchers (Muhammad, 2012). Entrepreneurship is essential in boosting economic activities in any nation. To aid 
the atmosphere of entrepreneurship, Nigerian Polytechnics play important role in establishing a strong and energetic 
system of entrepreneurship being the institutions that create and spread higher knowledge. Despite this advantages 
students shows lackadaisical interest in becoming entrepreneurs. Through adopting entrepreneurship, job formation is 
possible and this bring rapid industrialization in any country (Asaju, Arome &Anyio, 2014). For many years, the rate 
of unemployment in Nigeria has been on an alarming rate despite different programs set up by the government of 
Nigeria (NBS, 2016). Students from polytechnic are expected to have practical skills that will enable them to possibly 
establish their own business and thereby employ other people, the reverse is the case as such graduates from the 
polytechnics have been known to as well look for white collar jobs that are not readily available. It thus becomes 
relevant to inculcate the advantage of optimistic entrepreneurial intention among polytechnic students in order to 
reduce the menace of unemployment and improve well being among graduates especially in a developing country like 
Nigeria.

Abstract 
Preventive maintenance aims to keep components in good operating condition and to reduce the probability of failure. 
Optimizing the frequency of preventive maintenance continues to be an important research topic because it can 
significantly impact operating costs in industrial settings. A key factor in optimizing preventive maintenance is the 
calculation of the probability of component failure. Estimates of this probability have commonly been based on 
historical data and the maintenance quality. The improvement factor (IF) was introduced in the literature as a way of 
measuring maintenance quality so managers and planners could better estimate the probability of component failure, 
post maintenance. The IF estimate can be based on either historical failure data or expert judgment. It has been 
demonstrated in previous works that relying on expert judgment is the better of the two approaches when estimating 
the IF. Such judgment is, however, inherently biased. We propose a framework for estimating the IF based on expert 
judgment that aims to circumvent such biases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we 
estimate the optimum maintenance interval of a system at a real-world offshore oil and gas installation. The results 
show our framework yielding an improved maintenance interval.

1. Introduction
In a production facility, component failures can lead to downtime which can significantly increase a company’s 
maintenance costs and negatively impact revenues. For this reason, executives and managers need to focus on evolving 
strategies for reducing component failure. One well-known strategy is based on the expected probability of component 
failure (Tezuka et al. 2015). Inadequate probability estimates can, however, lead to excessive maintenance which 
increases overall production costs in the short term (Ding & Kamaruddin 2015).  
A key aspect for calculating the probability of component failure is having a good understanding of the effectiveness 
of the maintenance being performed. Much work has been published attempted to quantify maintenance effectiveness 
by introducing a parameter referred to as the maintenance improvement factor (IF) (Pham & Wang 1996; Wang 2006; 
Letot et al. 2015; and Hosseini & Ghadimi 2016). These papers estimate the IF based on probabilistic approaches by 
using failure data. Maintenance quality is, however, directly related to the expertise of maintenance personnel (Khatab

Abstract 
Nigerian Construction industry (NCI) have significant effect on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country 
as well as on the immediate environment where its product (construction project) is to be or are currently situated, it 
also has some technical impact on the projects constructed and the environment wherewith the projects are situated, 
as well as affect the social well-being of the people within that locality. Since these are core areas of sustainability, 
then, efforts put forward to assessing sustainability of construction projects and the major setback for achieving 
same is of great importance in the Nigeria construction industry. The objective of this study is to examine the 
barriers to achieving Sustainable Construction Projects (SCP) and to identify them base on how severe each factor 
appears to be on sustainable construction. Review of related studies and summary of respondent’s opinions were 
conducted to identify possible factors causing barriers. A total of 87 questionnaire were distributed to respondents 
who are professionals in the construction industry. The study reveals that the major barriers to achieving sustainable 
construction project are Client’s Unawareness, overall management action, lack of fund and contractual procedures. 
Finally, this research recommended that there should be a platform for awareness to the public about sustainable 
construction and this should be well grounded by incorporating green building into the standard building code of 
Nigeria.

1. Introduction
The NCI has contributed immensely to the economy and social development of the nation, therefore, sustainability 
in the Nigerian Construction industry cannot be over-emphasized based on the assertion by Adetunji (2005), which 
confirms that sustainability of the industry is one major and most important challenges faced in our world nowadays 
especially in Nigeria, where less than twenty (20) construction projects are certified to be sustainable with a measure 
of universally acceptable sustainability tools like LEED, BREAM, GBCSA amongst others. This implies that there 
is need to corroborate and backup designs of more sustainable construction projects and to look into the collective 
performance of these sustainable construction projects. 
The NCI being the major consumer of non-renewable resources, poses danger of land dereliction, waste, air and 
water pollution amongst other hazards. Overseeing sustainability comprehensively so as to eradicate or limit these 
hazards requires and demands a structure that coordinates social and environmental impact with technical and 
economic impact (Brochner, 1999; Boron and Murray, 2004, 2008). Accomplishing sustainable projects has turned 
in a new course for construction industry with increment in the utilization of innovation driven strategy as opposed 
to customary or traditional procedures (Oke, Aghimien, & Olatunji, 2015). The shortcomings of procuring 
construction projects traditionally solely based on the lowest and competitive tender have led to the increasing new

from sustainable construction. It is very important for these factors to be put into serious consideration and 
appropriately mitigated so as to increase the chance of achieving more Sustainable Construction Projects in Nigeria. 
The other factor which also have high impact in achieving Sustainable Construction Project in Nigeria are 
technological constraint and construction material constraint, even though these factors have serious impact on SCP, 
they seem not to occur very frequently which makes them less threatening than the earlier mentioned factor. In term 
of occurrence as well, economic environment and contractor failure seems to be occur very frequently but as 
frequent as they seems to occur, they do not seem to have much impact as to achieving a Sustainable Construction 
Project.  
 
As for government policy and having insufficient timeframe for the completion of a construction project, they are 
seemingly negligible as they do not occur very frequently as to causing barriers for Sustainable Construction Project 
likewise as they do not have much impact in affecting successful delivery of a Sustainable Construction Project. 
Susan, John  and Eric (2013) in line with the findings in this study in their study found out that lack of demand for 
sustainable buildings, lack of public awareness, lack of government support, higher initial cost among others are the 
major barriers to sustainable construction project.. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The major barriers in achieving sustainable construction project in Nigeria are client’s unawareness, overall 
management action, lack of fund and contractual procedures. As well as it is important to enlighten clients in every 
way possible of the great advantage of sustainable construction project over the conventional or traditional 
construction project, it is also paramount to take into consideration management action and decision which also can 
greatly affect the choice of executing sustainable construction project. Lack of fund is also found to scare clients 
away from opting for sustainable construction, this is very much believed that if green building is incorporated in 
construction industry contractual procedure, there will be limited chance of professionals in the construction 
industry executing non-sustainable construction project.. 
Finally, this research recommended that there should be a platform for awareness to the public about sustainable 
construction and this should be well grounded by incorporating green building into the standard building code of 
Nigeria. Sustainability of construction project in Nigeria is a key factor to consider at the design stage of any 
construction project for both the designer and the regulatory agencies, and these factors are to be monitored 
throughout the construction process since they are vital in measuring the performance of any sustainable 
construction project to infer a more desirable and satisfactory sustainable building.

Abstract 
The Construction world is swiftly moving towards the simplification and computerization of virtually all 
construction processes. Automation and Robotics have been singled out by previous studies as a means of achieving 
this feat. A lot of countries have adopted these ideas to a large extent; however, some other regions are yet to do so. 
This study therefore seeks to identify and assess the drivers to aid the adoption of Automation and Robotics in the 
Ondo state construction industry. The review of literature was done briefly to identify some of these factors. Survey 
design was used in the Research Methodology and design; and questionnaires were administered to Built 
Environment Professionals (Architects, Civil Engineers, Quantity Surveyors) based on the number of samples drawn 
from the overall population of professionals present in Ondo State, Nigeria. Data was collected and using Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results showed that the biggest drivers to the adoption of Automation and 
Robotics were Size of firm, Performance Increment and Familiarity with the concepts of Automation and Robotics. 
It was recommended that construction firms should try embracing these concepts as the benefits are potentially 
limitless.

1. Introduction
The increasing globalization market competition and advancement in technology in the 21st century have weighed in 
on the demand for the effective organisation, efficient construction processes and lastly, innovative construction 
techniques (Hasegawa, 2006). Previous researches and studies have been handy in suggesting and proving that 
Automation and Robotics can be a dignified option in achieving these innovative techniques, in terms of 
productivity, safety and quality. The various previous researches carried out on the subject matter indicated a trend 
that majored mostly of the software development aspect as touching the early design stage of construction projects; 
some additional works have been done on steelworks, vertical transportation, concreting, finishing works etc. 
However, not much rigorous works have been seen to be directed towards the adoption and implementation of these 
technological innovations for Construction site works and processes especially in Western Africa. Computer 
hardware has seen crucial and telling improvements in recent times in areas like mapping and planning modules, 
sensory modules, vision localization, robotic control etc. due to rapid developments in Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) (Oke, Aigbavboa & Mbena, 2017) 
1011","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Toronto, Canada, October 23-25, 2019

Furthermore, the level of familiarity and prior usage of Automation and Robotics by the workforce in a construction 
firm is another very important determinant of its adoption, as corroborated by Maas and van Gassel (2005). 
Literally, when firms have little or no knowledge about a concept, there is no way they can exhibit it; the only 
plausible option in cases such as this is hiring of automation specialists. The possibility and advantages of better 
time management is another cogent driver to the adoption of Automation and Robotics in any Construction Industry; 
and this in corroboration with Kumar, Prasanthi, and Leena (2008). Other drivers such as Nature of work, Economic 
feasibility studies and Training and site Implementation of Automation are also very important ; their respectives 
Mean scores are relatively very high regardless of their actual ranking (Fell, 2001; So & Chan, 2002; Walker, 2015). 
Expansively, the type and complexity of a particular project goes a long way in attracting the usage of advanced 
technological innovations like Automation and Simulation. So, also the viability of the project; if the project 
indicates a very high profitability at the very inception due to comprehensive feasibility report; the management 
might decide to opt for Automation and Robotics out of the supposed revenue. 
Lastly, the least dominant driver is the “type of company”. This simply indicates that the usage of Automation and 
Robotics is not jus limited to a particular sector or industry; any company is open to using it as its uses and 
possibilities are limitless.  
 
4. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The future patterns and open doors for the usage of robotization and apply autonomy advances in development 
ventures can be recorded and positioned from the most least noteworthy, there will be more noteworthy familiarity 
with mechanization and mechanical technology advances inside the development business network; the quantity of 
development organizations utilizing computerization and apply autonomy will altogether expand; mechanization and 
apply autonomy advances will be less expensive to obtain and work; there will be a fundamentally bigger scope of 
robotization and apply autonomy innovations accessible for use in development; the utilization of computerization 
and apply autonomy advances will empower firms to work all the more proficiently and intensely; the advances will 
be effectively accessible everywhere throughout the world; the advances would be promptly acknowledged by the 
laborers and the business; there would be a more noteworthy joining inside the development business as far as 
control and duty regarding structure and development. 
Because of the high multifaceted nature of the development procedure and the development mechanical 
improvement robotization and apply autonomy selection is essential in other to propel development techniques. 
Draftsmen, amount surveyors, designers and every single other member of the development procedure must be 
coordinated in this adjustment procedure. The short-and long haul improvement of robotization will occur well-
ordered and will be arranged to the individual application and necessities. It is additionally suggested that enormous 
estimated organizations that appear to as of now be up to date of Apply autonomy and Computerization ought to put 
more in Innovative work (Research and development) as the potential advantages are boundless.

Abstract  
 
This paper discusses an optimal sizing strategy of wind, PV and battery-based systems for powering an islanded 
microgrid system. Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software was employed for wind speed 
and solar radiation time series forecasting in order to obtain predicted values for wind and solar power output. An 
optimization problem is developed to minimize the microgrid capital and maintenance costs. In order to achieve an 
optimal system configuration, a loss of power supply probability (LPSP) was evaluated for ensuring power system 
reliability and the optimization problem was solved using Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System 
(AIMMS). The results obtained from simulation shows the importance of optimal sizing in the investment and 
operation of microgrid systems.

1. Introduction  
The steady decrease in fossil fuel resources and uncertainties associated with its prices has compelled the search for other 
sources of energy to meet the growing energy demand in the world. Recently, renewable energy sources (RES) are considered as 
alternative source of energy generation to fossil fuel owing to its environmentally friendly nature with good power quality and 
low operation costs [1]. Microgrid system is view as interconnection of different controllable loads, distributed generators and 
energy storage system operating as a single controllable system located at the customer region [2] [3]. The operation of microgrid 
can be in isolated mode or grid connected mode. RESs are seen as a promising energy source for microgrid system with the needs 
to improve operational efficiency, reliability, sustainability and lowering costs [3]. In microgrid system, RES can either be 
employed as single or hybrid energy source. The study in [4] advised on the use of wind, PV and battery system for achieving an 
optimal design of an island microgrids in a rural area, to enhance electricity sustainability through the use of renewable energies. 
Reference [5] considered PV, wind, battery and diesel generator for supplying energy in an isolated microgrids based on economic 
and operational perspectives. On the contrary, [6] is of the opinion that PV and diesel generators are of high cost when considering 
the cost of wheeling diesel in a remote location. 
In the recent time, researchers have focused on the energy management of microgrids which entails the system operation and 
control of microgrids. Reference [3] investigates economic schedule of a grid connected microgrid system incorporatingRES and 
demand response. Reference [7] considered an optimal resource schedule for unit commitment and economic of microgrids with 
emphasis on minimizing the operation, maintenance, aging costs and network losses. In this study, we are considering an optimal 
sizing of an isolated microgrid system using wind, PV and battery as energy sources. The hourly solar radiation, temperature and 
wind speed in University of Johannesburg was captured for 24 hours. These parameters were forecasted for a year using machine 
learning software package called Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA)[8] and the predicted parameters were 
used for the computation in the optimization process. The optimization model developed seeks to minimize the capital and 
maintenance costs of wind turbine, PV and battery energy storage system whilst satisfying the demand constraints. The proposed 
model is capable of reducing the impact of RES intermittency on their respective power output whilst meeting the required hourly 
load demand.

battery storage systems are presents as follows.

In this paper, an optimal approach for sizing a microgrid for an institutional load is presented. The developed model 
focused on minimizing the capital and maintenance costs of wind turbine, PV and battery energy storage system whilst 
satisfying the demand constraints. The Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programing mathematical problem formulated was 
solved using AOA solvers embedded in AIMMS software and the results obtained show the effectiveness of the 
developed approach in achieving an optimum sizing of the microgrid.

Abstract 
One of the plants that is considered to have the potential to be developed as anti-vaporous material on 
paper is the Kirinyuh plant, because it is contain sesquiterpene. The main material used is corncob and 
cornhusks, both are mixed with a ratio of 3: 1 and cooked using a 800 ml NaOH solution of 800 ml for 60 
minutes. The results of the dishes were washed using clean running water and added Kirinyuh leaf extract 
with variations in extract concentrations of 0%, 2%, 4% and 8% respectively. Paper pulp printed in 
accordance with A4 paper size and dried under the sun. This test is carried out to determine the best 
concentration to kill termites. The number of test animals for each treatment was 5 animals. In the 
preliminary test for Kirinyuh leaf extract the concentrations were 0%, 2%, 4% and 8% (m/v). The testing 
process is carried out for 48 hours. Based on the results obtained, it was found that kirinyuh leaf extract 
had activity against termite mortality. Data shows that paper with the addition of extract with 8% 
concentration has the best activity against termite mortality with a percentage reaching 100% in two days.

1. Introduction
Until now the paper industry still has problems related to termites. Cellulose which is the main raw material 
for paper is very vulnerable to being eaten by termites. If this problem is not resolved, it will certainly cause losses 
to the paper company. One of the plants that is considered to have the potential to be developed as anti-vaporous 
material on paper is the Kirinyuh plant (Eupatorium odoratum). Plants E. Odoratum originating from South 
America in Indonesia grows well at an altitude of 200 - 1800 masl. In infertile soils it often grows very much 
(Graige, and Ahmed, 1988). This plant is a shrub that grows upright and has many branches. The height of the plant 
E. odoratum 2-6 m. The stem diameter of E. odoratum is about 2 cm (Heyne, 1987). Single leaves, face to face,
ovoid, jagged edges, pointed edges and base, smooth furry surfaces pinnate, light green with a length of 4-5 cm and
a width of 1-1.5 cm, and short stem. Compound flower, grows on the tip of the stem, bells shaped petals and needle
shaped flower crowns. Small fruits, furry blackish brown with needle-shaped seeds, small and black (Department of
Health, 2006).
In a previous study Harto (1998) stated that the content of sesquiterpenes in neem leaves was effective 
against the mortality rate of termites. The leaves of E. odoratum have a content similar to quiterpenes which are 
expected to control the mortality rate in termites. From its potential as an insecticide, it can be used as a controlling 
environment for termites (Coptotermes sp.). According to Hadi, et al (2000), that in Eupatorium odoratum leaf 
extract there were 66% monoterpene and 28% sesquiterpene compounds. In addition, it also contains 11-17% α-
pinene, 12.5-24.8% cymene, and 10.6% thymyl acetate.

Based on the results obtained, it was found that kirinyuh leaf extract had activity against termite mortality. 
Data shows that paper with the addition of extract with 8% concentration has the best activity against termite 
mortality with a percentage reaching 100%. Kirinyuh leaves have poisonous activity against termites caused by the 
content of several active compounds such as sesquiterpene. 
 
4. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
To obtain anti-wiping active ingredients, it can be obtained from the extraction of dried leaves using ethyl 
acetate solvents. Dilution of extracts with water can be done with the addition of Tween 80. Making anti-slip paper 
can be done by processing corn husks and corn cobs with a ratio (3: 1) and the addition of the active ingredient of 
leaves kirinyuh extract. Paper with the addition of extract with a concentration of 8% has the best activity against 
termite mortality with a percentage reaching 100% in 2 days.

Abstract 
Increasing greenhouse gaseous concentration in the atmosphere is perturbing the environment to cause 
grievous global warming and associated consequences. Following the rule that only measurable is 
manageable, mensuration of greenhouse gas intensiveness of different products, bodies, and processes 
is going on worldwide, expressed as their carbon footprints. The methodologies for carbon footprint 
calculations are still evolving and it is emerging as an important tool for greenhouse gas management. 
The concept of carbon foot printing has permeated and is being commercialized in all the areas of life 
and economy, but there is little coherence in definitions and calculations of carbon footprints among 
the studies. There are disagreements in the selection of gases, and the order of emissions to be covered 
in footprint calculations. Standards of greenhouse gas accounting are the common resources

1. Introduction
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fourth assessment report has strongly 
recommended to limit the increase in global temperature below 2◦C as compared to preindustrial level (i.e., 
measured from 1750) to avoid serious ecological and economic threats. Based on NOAA data, the 2017 average 
global temperature across land and ocean surface areas was 0.84°C (1.51°F) above the twentieth-century average 
of 13.9°C (57.0°F), making it the third-warmest year on record behind 2016 (warmest) and 2015 (second 
warmest)[1]. 
The imbalances caused in natural systems due to warming are already being signaled in the form of extreme 
weather events and climate change. The mountainous snow cover, permafrost, and glaciers are melting, and 
Greenland, Antarctic, and Arctic ice packs are experiencing a negative mass balance causing the sea level to rise 
at a rate of 3 mm year−1 [2-4]. Owing to such complex changes in natural phenomena, it has been projected that 
1–2 billion additional people will be under water stress, crop productivity in mid-latitudes will suffer loss, and 
wildlife and biodiversity will be threatened[2]. On social forefront, developing and poor countries are at 
immediate and disproportionately high risk of being adversely affected by global warming and thus the 
“MILLENNIUM development goal” of eradicating poverty may be compromised[5]. “The world is running short 
of time and option” at social and economic front in view of high risks related with global warming and climate 
change[6]. Strong and immediate local to international actions are thus needed to stabilize emissions in a justified

In addition to its business importance, carbon footprint has been used as an indicator of the impact of lifestyle of 
a citizen of a country on carbon emissions. The UNDP[5] and Edgar and Peters[38] published country wise per 
capita carbon footprint, a convenient way to compare contributions of countries, cities, and sectors towards global 
warming.  
 
5. Conclusion  
Carbon footprint has emerged as a strong mode of GHG expression. While earlier studies focused only on CO2 
emissions as the guidelines and suggested inclusion of all the important GHGs in calculation, carbon footprint 
started becoming synonymous to a comprehensive GHG account, over the life cycle stages of any product or 
activity. No definition, however, has yet been accepted coherently as is clear from the fact that there are different 
selection of gases and tiers among studies. However, as carbon footprint reports are increasing in response to legal 
or business requirements, most of the calculations are following the GHG protocol worldwide. Since it has been 
extended to cover natural system as well, it becomes essential to deal with the unavoidable emissions. Carbon 
footprint has been commercialized and is being utilized by organizations to count their carbon and adopt measures 
to cut down emissions. This business sense has taken carbon consciousness to the households through numerous 
online calculators and has helped in making the civil society aware of how much their activities are contributing 
to global warming. Ironically, there is no check on such carbon calculating facilities and they lack coherence and 
transparency. Since carbon footprinting is associated with money transactions and has been found to influence 
businesses, legal guidelines are necessary to monitor these calculations. Carbon footprinting must be harnessed 
as a strong tool to promote GHG emission reductions among businesses, events, and civil society and should be 
included as indicator of sustainable development.

Abstract 
Doing Risky works continuously by an operator can result in harmful effects on the health and performance 
of operator over time because of ergonomic hazards. In order to reduce these negative effects, it is necessary 
for the labors to be exposed to such dangers with the same amount. A branch of operation research that 
analyzes the allocation of staff to different tasks in order to balance the ergonomic risks and complications 
of doing continuous risky works in planning horizon in known as job rotation. In the present work, we want 
to simulate the job rotation problem of staff with different skills in cell production systems and show the 
efficiency of meta-heuristic algorithms to solve this NP_Hard model. In order to evaluate the efficiency of 
the proposed solutions, a number of sample problems have been generated randomly and they have been 
solved by meta-heuristic simulated annealing, and then its results has been compared with accurate methods 
of optimization in which the comparison of these results shows the high efficiency of proposed meta-
heuristic algorithm and the better performance in the quality of results considering time resolution. 
Keywords: job rotation, ergonomic risk, cellular manufacturing simulated annealing, staff skills. 
1. Introduction
According to the advent of mass production approach, the increase of industrial production amount and the need to 
develop large industrial units, paying attention to the new industrial technologies has become an imperative need for 
some organizations. This led to the creation of new production techniques and continuous improvement of these 
methods. Today, production systems, depending on order in the industry situation and its competitive advantages, and 
other factors affecting their performance, they use various production methods such as, workshop production, cellular 
manufacturing and other manufacturing systems. In cellular manufacturing, a family of components is processed on a 
series of machines or manufacturing processes, which are often called cells.

5 Conclusion 
In this paper, a new model to implement a job rotation scheme in cellular manufacturing systems is provided. 
The model is trying to minimize the damage caused by the staff exposure to workplace ergonomic risks, in this regard 
staff skills is in high importance and job rotation is possible in particular cell because of the difference between the 
amount of workload in different cells. 
The result in this model illustrates that for solving the problems of large size which LINGO software is not able to 
solve them, or it can solve them in a very long time, simulated annealing algorithm will gain very close results to 
optimal answers in a short time. 
It is recommended for future research to study job rotation within and between cells, and at the present time some 
research is being pursued by the authors of this article. Also, the skill level of employees is assumed to be stable, but 
for future research it is suggested that staff skills be considered dynamically. 
Another proposal is taking into account the ergonomic risks so that each employee is not only exposed to the influence 
of ergonomic risks of machines that he is working on but also the other machines which are involved in the cell.

Abstract 
Purpose of this study is to investigate organizational commitment generation X lecturers of XYZ as a private 
University. Meanwhile, to have competitive advantage, a university needs supported by lecturers as 
qualified human resources. Lecturers are expected has motivation, commitment, enthusiasm to do her/his 
job to serve students well and give lecturing. In Indonesia context, lecturers should do TRIDARMA 
(lecturing, researching, doing community service) as performance. There is not many previous study 
generation X of private universities lecturers in Indonesia. Exploratory study conducted on 100 lecturers 
who work more than five years at XYZ University. The results obtained that 70% feel satisfied by 
remuneration. But only 40% feel has strong connection with institution. Then to discuss issue in depth, 
qualitative research method was conducted in this research. Through literatures studies, in-depth interviews, 
observation, that aim to get deeper information. Key informants are four lecturers who are generation X 
and had worked more than five year and their direct supervisor. Collecting data using triangulation method. 
Results shown that leadership style, organizational support and relationship within organization has impact 
to employee satisfaction. While employee satisfaction has impact to build organizational commitment. 
Research contributions provide input to higher education managers in managing lecturers as human 
resources to build organizational commitment.

1. Introduction
Lecturers are the importance human investment of private University to enhance competitive advantages, including 
XYZ as a private University. As Siagian (2012) stated that performance quality of an organization is determined by 
quality of employees and quality of organization. Lecturers have responsibilities to do learning process for students. 
Lecturers are expected has motivation, commitment, enthusiasm to do his/her job. In Indonesia context  according 
Law No. 20/2003 at National Education System, lecturers should do TRIDARMA  obligations (lecturing, researching, 
doing community service) as performance. Then, lecturers performance will be determined by how he/she 
implementing task of professional educator by transforming, developing and disseminating science, technology and 
the arts through higher education system. Finally, lecturers needs to be committed to university his/her workplace.

Clear standards of HRM system, internal interactions will help employees understanding how to stay in ZYZ. 
Informants stated supported each other with others faculty colleagues.  Related to As'ad (2012), stated there some of 
the things that cause satisfaction, including specific organizational culture. 
 
Proposition 3: Job Satisfaction affected to Employee Engagement 
 
In this study informants feel satisfied by organizational motivation and  organizational culture of XYZ. Then as 
lecturers they feel engaged as cognitive, emotional, attitude to XYZ University. Inline with Sutrisno (2009), Sunyoto 
(2012) and Hasibuan (2017), that measuring some factors of job satisfaction can make employee feel engaged.  
Proposition 4: Employee Engagement affected to Organizational Commitment 
Informants stated they wants stay five years ahead in XYZ. Meaning as lecturers they feel conditions makes comfort 
to work. So, they are enjoy to coming work every day as affective commitment and salary or benefits still interesting 
for them to stay as continuance commitment.  
 
Model Proposed.  
 
In this section, propositions that have been formed and then assembled into a theory or model. The model was created 
by linking a proposition with other propositions. Then the models created in the study are as follows:

5. Conclusions  
 
University XYZ need to know how their lecturer needs to motivate them in the right ways. When they feel motivated 
with organization and comfort with organizational culture it will measuring generation X lecturers  job satisfaction. 
XYZ University consider are able to provide motivation in the form of organizational motivation. For making them 
feel positive about working climate, XYZ should build positive organization culture that match generation X lecturers. 
The importance with their positive feeling that impact to job satisfaction,  generation X lecturers will engaged with 
XYZ as talent management. Then it can enhance their performance to achieve organization vision as organization 
commitment. Role of direct supervisor very importance to encourage  TRIDARMA and increasing JJA. Because 
quality of lecturers also need  to developed and maintained not only in the context of performance but also job 
satisfaction and engagement.  
  
Managerial implication for XYZ  should implementation system that inherent  the needs of generation X lecturers. 
XYZ University can maintain by clear and future goal talent management. Then because lecturers generation X very 
discipline the can adaptation rules and policies system that they have taken from socialization program. As teamwork 
generation X lecturers can adopted teamwork, so direct supervisor can build teamwork for their work climate.    
 
There are limitations in this study, such as: conducted by qualitative method through interviews with limited 
informants so it should not be generalized to all generation X lecturers; Unable to perform focus group discussion 
lecturers and head of department because they do not willingness. This study only focus on generation X lecturers

Abstract 
The correct design layout of a plant is fundamental for a manufacturing company to function efficiently. 
Finding out how to arrange the equipment of a plant is essential to manufacture agriculture  and  construction 
equipment. This project aims to refer to the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) method  followed to design the 
best scenario of resources required for a plant of a leading global company. The information gathered during 
the SLP, is  used  to  generate  a  mathematical  programming  model incorporating data  analytics  tools  to 
speed  up  the  work  done  and results found with SLP. Following that, a model with a genetic algorithm is 
developed to find good results that are necessary for the decision making for a plant redesign.

1. Introduction
A leading global manufacturer  company  located  in  South  America  forecasted  an  increase  in  the  demand 
of agriculture machinery within the next five years and the actual capacity of the plant is of 94%.     In order to 
increase the efficiency of the distribution of the plant, and  increase the production capacity, in 2018 the 
company decided to implement the Systematic Layout Planning.  According  to  Maina,  Muchiri  and  Keraita 
(2018),  the  Systematic Layout  Planning (SLP), aims to systematically organize and establish  all production 
stations within a facility with the purpose of improving the production operations of a  company. This process 
took 1 full year and 25 human resources. They did calculations in an  outdated software to find the inputs for 
the SLP and worked manually to generate the different alternatives for the layout redesign. However, despite 
the effort and resources used, the results were limited by the experience  and creativity of the people involved. 
This situation led to the inaccuracy of 10,000 square meters, that was not contemplated before in the layout 
planning redesign. 
Ficko and  Palcic  (2013)  highlight  the  importance  of  using  intelligent  algorithms to optimize the design 
of the facilities. Intelligent algorithms help to find the best solution within a search space consisting of all 
possible and feasible solutions. This paper proposes  the  application  of  a  mathematical  programming model 
to determine the inputs required to develop the SLP in the agriculture machinery manufacturer located in 
South America. This model helps reduce the time and resources used to implement the SLP, determines the 
best scenario of required resources in order to meet the upcoming increasing demand and has the quality to be 
replicable in any other company of the same industrial branch.

The second model pretends to give optimal scenarios with the amount of the number of machines required, OFP 
strategy, labor requirement, and operational cost requirements; optimal inventory levels, resources to use, utilization, 
efficiency, cost required and required area (without optimization). The genetic algorithm is used to solve the model. 
The genetic algorithm designs chromosome coding, crossover, mutations and algorithm using MATLAB®. The 
company must determine which of the solutions is most feasible to implement. If the solution selected does not need 
any additional infrastructure, the process ends; if yes, then a mixed-integer linear programming (optimization in two 
dimensions) model must be done. The third model must take as input the budget, current encoded layout, material 
flow, and the government and security laws. 
 
The third model pretends to create different scenarios including processes, building expansion, cost per square 
meter, equipment area required, material flow, area required, RIP required, and quality is required in order to have 
the square meters required, total investment required, production capacity, personnel requirements, equipment 
requirements, total cost, and service level. If the optimal solution of the third model is not feasible for the company, 
then new constraints must be taken into account to improve the genetic algorithm model made. 
Figure 3. Project Flow Chart 
 
In this paper, only phase 1 of the flow chart in Figure 3 (the mathematical programming) is developed, using 
MATLAB®. The model can be run multiple times to be capable of obtaining the best solutions. 
 
The aggregated value of what is proposed is that our flow chart (Figure 3) generates better results for future 
investigations, than the SLP methodology, since every step added on it covers all the requirements of it. Nevertheless, 
the layout redesign process is now supported with algorithms and mathematical models, plus it is not manually made. 
Our model intends to leave the code in order to give the client the possibility to be programmed in any other software 
of their preference. Also, because the critical variables are defined, the model proposed can be replicable in any other 
factory. 
 
3.1 Results 
 
After running the model that was programmed in MATLAB®, it gives as outputs that for the next five years the 
annual production must be around 1,700 units and the daily demand capacity of 16 units. The model indicates that 
the current area is of 27,820 m² and it will be needed around 3,500 m² more, 550 m² for the first area, 600 m² for the 
second area, and 2,300 m² for the fourth area. The total amount of manpower needed is of 220 more, 60 for the first 
area, 60 for the second area, 30 for the third area, and 70 for the fourth area. According to MATLAB®, to complete 
what was mentioned before, an investment of approximately 13.2 millions of dollars are needed. The data obtained 
through this software is at an aggregate level. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, the authors have developed a new technique to redesign a layout in order to increase the production 
capacity of a plant. This method is based in the SLP methodology, but a genetic algorithm is introduced to explore 
all possible combinations of the critical variables related to the layout problem. The case study illustrates that our 
proposal is a viable method in solving a layout redesign and improvement problem.

Abstract 
Around 55% of businesses experience project failure at some point where the failure is usually blamed on culprits 
such as a bad idea, poor planning, overly aggressive timelines, or unforeseen changes and delays. This is mainly 
because of working in an uncertain environment, which leads to suboptimal results, where each side of a transaction 
tries to get a premium for the risk to which it is exposed. From a project management perspective, the contractor may 
exert less effort and may ask for higher reimbursement. This leads to less efficient economic performance and 
consequently less economic benefits to the project owner. In order to reduce future uncertainty, the project manager 
should offer a proper contract. For example, to reduce price uncertainty, the project manager and contractor may sign 
a fixed-price contract, whereas, when the product has to be developed, such as in R&D projects, and where there is 
uncertainty on the production side, the contractor faces additional uncertainty, hence the project manager may have to 
offer a cost plus incentive fee contract. 
This paper aims to develop an effective contractual strategy to help the project manager increase its control and 
visibility over contractor's process. Specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions: 
1.
What are the main inefficiencies that the project manager faces with a contractor whose cost and the level of
of process improvement are privately known by the contractor?
2.
What are the characteristics of an effective contractual strategy for the project manager to induce the optimal
level of process improvement on its contractors?
To address the above research questions, we develop an incentive contract for the project manager when outsourcing 
to a risky contractor whose delivery outcome is subject to quality risk. To reduce the likelihood of failure, the 
contractor can invest in a costly process improvement effort, however, the cost of such an effort is private information 
for the contractor, which results in adverse selection problem. Moreover, the contractor's decision on process 
improvement is also unobservable to the project manager, which results in moral hazard problem. We first obtain the 
first-best solution, and then solve for the second-best optimal cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) contract under full 
information asymmetry. Our comparative study between the first- and second-best contracts enables us to characterize 
the efficiency loss due to underinvestment by the high-cost contractor and information rent extracted by the low-cost 
contractor.

Abstract 
A novel cable-driven mechanism with three spatial translational motions and a central prismatic actuator to keep 
the cables under tension and increase the workplace volume is investigated. Having high accuracy in its 
workspace, the robot has potential for large-scale robotic manipulations, machining of large parts, and material 
handling. Kinematic and Jacobian analysis are performed after developing the loop chain equations. Then the 
motion is numerically analyzed to study the relations between the winches’ revolute angles and the position of the 
end-effector for a sample welding path.

Cable Robot, Parallel Platform, Singularity Analysis, Actuation Insufficiency, Jacobian Analysis 
1. Introduction
Although simple in form, cable robots are extensively exploited today for multiple purposes, including
handling. Multiple fixed- or moving-winches are also employed to move the end effector through the connection 
cables. These type of robots are usually utilized for carrying objects such as video cameras, hooks, or other types 
of grippers.  
One of the most important usages of robotic systems is in power transmission maintenance, and their 
monitoring by mobile sensing (Jiang et. al. , 2004). Sensitivity improvement and thus system reliability 
enhancement are just two of their advantages. Their applications include live maintenance of high-voltage 
transmission lines, thereby removing human workers from dangerous and highly specialized operations. They can 
also work in hazardous environments like radioactive locations in nuclear plants and access tight spaces such as 
cable viaducts and cooling pipes, and help in the precise positioning of measurement equipment. Robotics and 
information technology are implemented within electrical networks to make their power systems more efficient 
and form a small grid. (Rashid et. al. 2018). 
Robots can be widely used in energy applications. Jeon et. al. (2012) introduced a blade-cleaning robot for the 
maintenance of wind power blades. These types of maintenance devices require a continuous supply of green-
source energy, and due to the special shape of the blades, must have a mechanism that can conform to it and still 
be effiecient.

7. Conclusion 
 
This paper has presented the kinematical analysis of a 3-DOF cable robot. We also performed Jacobian 
analysis in order to find the forward and inverse kinematic Jacobian matrices. Afterwards, singularity analysis 
was done for two special cases, and singular workspaces were found. Finally, a numerical analysis was done to 
study the changes of the winches’ revolute angles with respect to time for a special given welding path.

Abstract 
Despite its vast natural resources, African is facing serious challenges in sustainable development in an energy 
sector, if addressed with dispatch could not only check its indispensable needs but also mitigate some global 
phenomenon at stake, such as desertification, environmental degradation, and greenhouse emission. This paper 
reviews the prospects of four major renewable energy sources-hydro, solar, wind and biomass- for each of the two 
leading countries in Africa namely South Africa and Nigeria. Based on a literature survey of energy efficiency, 
all two countries encourage energy efficiency in varying degrees. In the course of this review, several national 
energy policy frameworks of these countries were looked into, especially on how African countries could 
overcome the persistent energy crisis in the continent by utilizing the naturally gifted renewable energy sources. 
This could only be achieved if proper technology, awareness, and skills for harnessing the resources are provided. 
Also, lingering energy challenges such as energy efficiency measures, needs for grid extension, energy storage 
technology, and seasonal variation were carefully highlighted.

1. Introduction  
An investigation has shown that renewable energy sources such as power from the sun (photovoltaic and solar 
thermal), hydro, wind and biomass-derived fuel have contributed greatly to the sustainability of certain nations 
with several environmental and socio-economic benefits to the nations that tap them. A far bigger and wider 
benefit according to research, is the contribution of renewable energy in the reduction of pollution at both local 
and global levels, thus helping in the mitigation of climatic change which both industrialized and developing 
nations committed themselves to in the Kyoto protocol. It has been tested and proven that reliable and affordable 
power supply is an essential prerequisite for technological and economic growth. Generation of electricity from 
renewable energy resources can play a major role in electricity generation in African countries. 
This paper presents a review of renewable energy technology development in South Africa and Nigeria which 
varies due to factors that included topography, characteristics of the resource, cost of labor and policy regulation.  
In his review of renewable energy for sustainable development in Africa, I.M. Bugaje considered the extent to 
which policies on solar, wind, biomass and biogas are meeting up top challenges of sustainable development in 
four countries namely South Africa, Nigeria, Mali and Egypt [2]. In a paper titled “The economics of renewable 
energy expansion in rural sub-Saharan Africa”, Uwe Deichman chose Ethiopia, Ghana, and Kenya [3]. In his short

Abstract 
The research conducted in this study is aimed at  enhancing warehouse  performance  in picking by sequence 
optimization, as the travel time covers most part of picking processes in storages, a right order of picking lines in 
a batch is critical to attain high productivity. For a research at the manufacturer in the electronic devices business 
segment, the quantitative assessment showed an overall improvement potential of 7.4%, but in disparity to 
systematically working enquiring for routing, the sequences generated by the LSO may look illogical to the picker - 
a qualitative evaluation must be considered to identify sequence patterns and to discuss the methodology with the 
picking Personnel. Consequently, the measurements of warehouse performance have become a buzz word amongst 
scholars and industry practitioners. Despite the fact that, the concept of warehouse performance is attending higher 
level of significance in western countries, America, Asia, due to its ability of smoothing the business environment, in 
Africa, particularly in South Africa the integration and adoption of warehouse performance concept is facing 
several challenges. To date, over the past decade a number of research have been done in the past decades to 
address these issues of warehouse performance in manufacturing sector and there is still gab in the current 
literature review, therefore the objective of this research is to review and assess storage performance in 
manufacturing industry. The results of critical analysis of the current literature clearly show that there are flaws 
in the current body language related to storage performance. However very few studies have been conducted from 
warehouse performance in South Africa, the overall of this study is to fill this gab by means of critically analyzing 
studies that were developed or conducted in the field of warehousing.

1. Introduction
Today’s market environment is very competitive; the pressure is more on to organizations to find new better ways to 
add value and to deliver goods to end-user grow even stronger. The expanding demand for companies to compete with 
its products globally in terms of costing, proper quality materials and other services has had a rise to the desire to 
come up with more innovative or effective storage techniques. Storing has become the critical function with the 
increase of mass production systems, storage is where goods are stored and it is a distribution center for raw and 
finished materials. Therefore warehousing and distributions center have similar functions, as goods are stored (Coyle 
at el, 2003). They both perform vital functions of storage and movements of products (Langevin and Riopel Diana, 
2005). Warehouse is the critical function in any company, whereby organizations can supply a customized or 
structured resources/services for their consumers in order to have advantage over their competitors. This means that 
an organization that can receive, store, do cycle counts, stock takes, dispatch, rename racks correctly  at the right 
location, use scanners etc,  at a faster rate and get a working culture in order might have an advantage over their rivals. 
However, there are critical factors and should they not be addressed or managed correctly they might results in a very 
serious impact in a competitive markets. There has been a rise in delay of end-user service both internally and external. 
Goods are damaged while in storage. There is excessive movements, this also has let to poor stock take and cycle 
counts, all this is because of various factors: such as order picking, receiving, how they do cycle counts and Culture

The outcome of this article can be used as a guide to explain and orientate researchers and practitioners in the field. 
 
Vaidyanathan jayaraman (1998) – The objective of this paper is to clarify and test the distribution system design model 
and assess its performance with regards to quality of results, model validity and also algorithm performance. This 
research gives feedback on the development of multiple product storage logistics model. The model is used to forecast 
on the performance of distributions organizations that typically have to work with costs of products and distributions 
of each goods from storage to end-user outlet, the level of service given to its end-users and adaptability for each 
product group and market segment. Qualitative methods should also be considered and also try and use this research 
on food industry as there are perishable products to consider.

Abstract 
A structural equation model (SEM) method was adopted in this study to investigate the nexus between 
how government or banking sector financial support to farmers has enhance growth in Nigeria 
agricultural sector. Farmer totaling 500 were surveyed using a well-structured questionnaire in Ekiti 
State, south western part of Nigeria. Out of the 500-questionnaire distributed, about 362 feedbacks 
received was captured using a statistical tool, SPSS and evaluated by means of Analysis of Moment 
Structures. From the findings, we discovered that both short and long-time loan has a significant effect 
on farmers productivities. The short-time loan is mainly used in acquiring the basics better-quality 
seed and pesticides, while the long-time loan is used in acquiring capital equipment for farm use. The 
use of improved farm implements through the availability of long time loan has assisted farmers in 
increasing their productivity and has made farming easier for them. The study has been able to prove 
that the use of long-term loan by farmer foster and helps them maximize their productivity than the 
use of shortterm loan, hence, these study backs polices focused at increasing financial supports to 
farmers in Nigeria.

1. Introduction
The agricultural sector has been identified as an important sector which has aided the economy stability in 
Nigeria and other developing nations. South African experience a slight recession in 2018 but was able to come 
out of it due to their massive agricultural outputs sales[1]. In Nigeria, the agricultural sector interjects over 5% 
to Nigeria gross domestic product and roughly 9% percent to proper employment annually.  Following the level 
of unemployment in the country, which is hovering around 23.10% as at January 2019[2], it is highly imperative 
to recognize where investment exertions needs to be directed. This brings about the question on how government 
and financial banks aid support economic development and ensures drastic reduction in Nigeria poverty rate. 
This assessment can be tackled by recognizing that majority of the Nigerian populace are extremely poor, and 
they live in the rural regions of the country, basically engages in smallholder survival farming for their 
livelihood. These categories of this individuals are small and slow-growing agricultural insignificant producers, 
with little staple crop produces, soil nutrient diminution as well as small extent of modern implements usage[3-
7]. It is encouraging to know that there are some modern input machineries that now exist, like the use of modern 
sees which are well improved, use of fertilizer to increase the nutrients of the soil, land management and small-
scale irrigation, which are all targeted towards increasing agriculture productiveness in rural areas.

Abstract 
Supply-chain optimization is the application of processes and tools to ensure the optimal operation of a 
manufacturing organization. The SCM is the spine of E-commerce, a very critical component of E-
commerce. Supply chain efficiency means having the right product at the right place at the right time, can 
save money or reduce costs, and can enhance cash utilization. E-commerce plays a vital role on inventory 
management to keep the record electronically to avoid any information breach. In this paper, we have 
developed a database management system which would be centrally visualized by the partners of the 
apparel supply chain. Buyer can be able to place orders through this developed database system 
electronically which might save at least ordering cost, visit cost and 15 %-time savings of the total lead 
time. Furthermore, we have developed a system by which customer can buy surplus goods which remain 
after shipment has done with the cheapest cost and factory will not face any wastage of goods.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
E-commerce does not just mean trading and shopping on the Internet. It has more important meaning i.e business
efficiency at all operation levels.  The apparel manufacturing organizations are struggling to survive in the competitive 
market since labor cost is increasing day by day. Bangladesh government has been imposed a rule over the entire
garments manufacturing industry that wages must be increase every five years of recess. Government has been
declared to increase 51 % wages of the garments workers whereas the cost of manufacturing increasing due to such
kind of incremental matter. Government does not provide any special facility to the industrialist to cut their overhead
cost through there are some of options to be considered in the power supply. Apart from that movement can be
decreased the taxes which incurred on the investor. In addition, manufacturer not only getting such cost decreasing
facilities from the government but also not enjoying the proper supply of electricity and gas supply from national grid.
That is why, owners have to invest more on alternative power supply which is highly costly. As a result, garments
manufacturing industry is the question of surviving. In this situation, they are focusing on reduction of cost in different
from of view. Improving and making smooth supply chain is one of that vast area. Manufacturers have to pay more
cost for airing shipment due to poor supply chain management. The reason behind that is the lack of proper information
visibility. In order to make the visible of the information evolving e-commerce into supply chain is the important
matter.

4. Results and Discussions 
 
When a buyer goes through-commerce based website, they will click on initialization of product selection and later 
on, buyer click on the product data and he will be able to view features of the available product which depicted by the 
figure 8. Once customer make the decision that he will buy specific product and then he can view the picture with 
product price and furthermore, buyer can be able to look into the product category which showed by the figure 9 in 
details. Likewise, buyer will decide which product they want to buy from manufacturer. Finally, he will see the product 
finalization summary which described in figure 10. Once click on the purchase button and provide the delivery and 
billing address, customer will receive an invoice for his or her order confirmation that is shown by figure 10.  Figure 
11 and 12 depicted the current order placing system and proposed order placing system. The proposed system can be 
able to confirm the orders faster than the traditional method. 
 
5. Conclusions and re-commendations  
 
It has been shown from figure 2 that apparel chain member will be placing their orders through this central database 
system which would be developed through WordPress database software. Figure 3 depicted that when buyer or 
customer place an order to the manufacturer, usually places it through email confirmation. However, in this proposed 
system orders will be placed in online through using this model and details regarding all of the orders will be stored 
in the CDS database. All of the chain members will be accessible to this CDS database system. It will be linked with 
the developed database systems. Similarly, manufacturer and supplier will put any information through database this 
development system. By developing on line order placing system through developing a website will be further 
recommendation for apparel manufacturing organization and supply chain will be smoothed.

Abstract 
Wages increased drastically in apparel manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. Owner is suffering a lot to 
survive in the market though price did not increase in spite of having augment of the gross in this sector. 
Hence supply chain optimization is crucial to cut the cost from different echelon of the supply chain. In this 
research, Wages increased drastically in apparel manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. Management is 
suffering a lot to survive in the market though price did not increase in spite of having augment of the gross 
in this sector. Hence supply chain optimization is crucial to cut the cost from different echelon of the supply 
chain. In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been implemented on two of the leading 
garments manufacturing organization. It has found that error between observed versus predicted are more 
for east west fashion garments limited due to poor supply chain than energypac fashion limited. In this 
paper, we have been proposed by analyzing ANN that rate of error reduced to 10%. Consequently, both of 
the factory’s efficiency has been improved to 20% and 15 % profit got intensification focusing on supply 
chain optimization.

1. Introduction
Optimizing supply chain is very crucial for the apparel manufacturing organization since it has to pay a plenty of cost 
to make the supply chain smooth from manufacturer’s end. Company has to be involved with Outsourcing either due 
to poor supply chain performance or overbooking. It has also risk factor i.e goods quality and delivery cannot be 
achieved because of proper monitoring since key person unable to provide time into Subcontract factory and hence it 
cost more for airing or claim issues.  So in order to earn the goal of supply chain optimization, company has to improve 
productivity, quality and delivery (PQD) . To do so, factory has to make sure that there is a good team to lead the 
company forward by providing appropriate guidelines and training to the lower level management. Additionally, 
conduct continuous training to workers for their upskilling which add value to optimization for supply chain. Quality 
management system (QMS)  and Requirements for quality system (RQS) responsible are to be dedicated to facilitate 
services to the company to attain the goal of chain optimization. It can save up to 30 % of the total cost.  
2. Review on Supply chain optimization
Western countries source production to reduce costs but on the other hand they are bound to pay a high price for
ineffective logistics when transporting the goods from the local manufacturer in China. Not only is sourcing to China 
connected with relatively higher logistics costs even worsen product quality is most often linked to sourcing. Majority 
of the Bangladeshi garments manufacturing organizations source fabrics, and trims from China which is more time 
consuming as well as costly. One of the core hindrances for the smooth supply chain is due to purchase materials from 
China. Usually it takes 60 days’ time to arrive materials from this country to Bangladesh later than placing orders and

Figure 14 :  Proposed Optimized productivity of Energypac Fashion ltd 
 
Results and Discussions 
 
Figure 1 showed the supply chain network of an apparel manufacturing organizations. Figure 3 depicted that the 
supply chain performance of east west fashion garments that is not optimistic since the required outcome did not 
achieve at the right time. Consequently, product delivery was delayed and subsequently whole supply chain being 
affected.  
At the same time figure 5 portrayed the output of the manufacturing status of Elergypac fashion which was not too at 
the expected level. As a result, product went to buyer by air shipment which cost members of the supply chain and 
destroy the chain performance.  The date between observed and predicted efficiency of the east west fashion garments 
found deficient which described in the figure 7. To be acquired optimization of the supply chain, we proposed quantity 
of the creation necessary to optimize loss which described in the figure 4 and 6 for east west and Elergypac respectively 
through artificial neural network analysis. Experiment had done by the neural network via changing weight to gain 
the desired throughput and finally proposed the anticipated output in the figure 8.  The observed vs predicted 
productivity of the Energypac fashion depicted in the figure 9 . That’s figure made were very close to the wanted 
level.  The error amongst observed vs predicted of the east west fashion was severe which deviated from expectable 
level portrayed by the figure 10. A proposed optimized error figure declared for the east west fashion garments which 
showed in the figure 11.  Figure 12 described the observed error for the energypac fashion which was adjacent to the 
targeted value. The optimized error and productivity analysis figure depicted in the figure 13 and 14 respectively. 
Overall, supply chain optimization is the primary need for the apparel manufacturing industry to continue factory as 
a profitable organization's and survive in the apparel market.   
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
A comparison analysis has been done between two leading apparel suits manufacturing organizations. The experiment 
had done through ANN and consequent results depicted and analyzed. The results shown that Energypac fashion 
observation were result oriented though tiny proposal has been implemented to achieve the required output. However, 
the result of the east west fashion was far from the optimized level. More concentration needs to provide by the 
management to acquire the optimized output. Provide the training to the mid-level management and workers to achieve 
planned target and to meet the delivery date to get optimized production value. Implementing ANN and Genetic 
Algorithms to compare two or more apparel industry would be the further suggestions in order to get optimized supply 
chain.

Abstract 
The evolution of industry 4.0 in the agricultural sector is the emerging technology in vogue. Wireless Sensor Network 
(WSN) applications are technological innovations used in monitoring, sensing, reading of attached devices, in order to 
detect physical phenomena. WSN is said to be the key technology of IoT. The system developed is mainly for 
agricultural precision, which involves real-time monitoring of climatic as well as the environmental properties of 
farmland is been monitored and adequate decisions are taken in respect to the sensed variables to amend the unpalatable 
conditions on the farmland. The developed WSN system uses a mesh topology structure to achieve scalability for 
monitoring environmental variables that affect crop productivity. The system design incorporates the Global System of 
Mobile (GSM) technology into it, to give the farmer real-time information about the environmental conditions of the 
farm, thus providing real-time monitoring for better decision making. The designed system is energy efficient, reliable 
and relatively simple, the system credibility was validated by testing it in a real farm environment in Ekiti State, Nigeria. 
The gateway node used in the design successfully collects the sensed data using the environmental conditions of the 
farmland and afterward forwards the report to the farmer.

Introduction 
The quest to achieve food security has been a major agenda for developing nations of Africa over the last two decades. 
This is because Africa’s population is geometrically increasing which in turn causes a continuous demand for food. 
However, there has been a continuous decline in the levels of agricultural production over the years.   
Nigeria is a nation which is blessed with abundant land and water resources. According to statistics from the Federal 
Ministry of Trade and Investment, 40% of Nigeria’s land mass is made up of arable land. However, due to incessant 
deforestation, bush burning practices and indiscriminate application of fertilizer, a lot of the arable land, which is fragile 
has become unusable for farming (NTWG 2009). Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports 
showing that Nigeria’s arable farmland has reduced from 41.17% in 2007 to 39.53% in 2011.   
Conversely, the Nigerian agricultural sector has the tendency to increase its productivity, yet, its productivity has 
maintained an all-time low over the past five years. According to statistics from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, the 
turnout of the agricultural sector has experienced a high setback. Its growth rate was recorded to be 3.3% in the early 
1990s which later increased to 6% between 2003 to 2007. According to statistics, about 38% of Nigeria’s landmass, which 
is about 33.7 million hectares are used for farming while others are underused. 
Due to the country’s climatic situation, which is highly diverse in nature, this places the country at a high advantage to 
be able to virtually cultivate all agricultural products that can survive both in tropical and semitropical regions. The 
Nigerian government has encouraged commercial farming through the introduction of intervention funds for commercial 
farmers, farming support tools and many other farming incentives that can aid their productivity. The country is blessed 
with water and nice climatic conditions as well as large areas of arable land. However, even with all this natural 
endowment, the country still faces some setbacks in its agricultural productivity owing to low soil fertility in most of the 
areas and also the methods adopted in the cultivation of farmlands is still another issue. 
 A lot of factors have affected the level of productivity in the nation. Climate change has caused deleterious effects, 
such as disordered seasonal cycles, the desired water supply is interrupted, and this has adverse effects on the environment.

The ideal life for the sensor node using the 6000mAh battery is about 5.76 years. The estimated value does not 
include battery discharge rate and other factors that will normally affect battery life, but with all factors included 
the lifetime for the sensor node can be estimated to about 3-4 years before replacing the battery.  
 
e. 
Communication through SMS 
After the WSN was created by the gateway node. The gateway was able to collect readings from the sensor 
nodes, also it was able to send an SMS message to the farmer about the current farm development.  
5.0   Conclusion 
This paper presents a WSN system for the purpose of agricultural monitoring that is supported by the ZigBee 
network protocol technology. The designed WSN system is compatible with other sensor nodes. These sensor 
nodes are able to monitor farm environmental parameters such as soil moisture, humidity, air temperature, and 
light intensity. Its compatibility with other sensor nodes allows more sensors to be conveniently attached to it and 
to control the irrigation system through its output port. A communication link between the farmer and the farm 
system was established by employing the GSM communication technology, where the farmer can request for 
information about the farm and the farm system can notify the farmer about the farm development.  
Future research efforts will focus on reducing the size and cost of the sensor nodes. Surface mounted 
components can be used instead of the through hole components used for making the sensor node. This will 
significantly reduce the size. In addition, a low-cost wireless transceiver e.g. the CC300, nRF24L01 module, can 
be used instead of the XBee module used in this work. This will reduce the cost and size of the sensor nodes. Mass 
production of the sensor nodes will also reduce the SNs.

Abstract 
 
As an economically superior approach to uniform sampling scheme, the pioneering work of Rahim and Banerjee on 
sampling procedure with non-uniform intervals has been broadly employed in statistical process monitoring during 
the past three decades. However, since its consecutive times of inspection have to be determined through a function 
of the first sampling interval, it might make some kind of complexity in practical administration compare to uniform 
approach. In this paper, the intuitive companionship between the sampling frequencies and the failure rate of a process 
is discussed by investigating various functional constraints on choosing the length of sampling intervals and their 
effects on the optimal design of control charts, specifically for processes which deteriorate over time. Extensive 
numerical illustrations are prepared for monitoring univariate and multivariate quality characteristics in manufacturing 
and service sectors following an increasing failure rate Weibull shock model. The results obtained from proposed 
structures for sampling intervals could slightly improve the expected cost per unit time which illustrate Rahim-
Banerjee model inducing constant integrated hazard over each sampling interval is a well-established near-optimal 
non-uniform approach. However, further investigation on the mathematical problem of finding the sampling scheme 
by which the cost function is optimized would be highly fruitful.

1. Introduction 
 
As a permanent feature of the increasingly competitive international business environment, quality control of a 
production or service process would be modeled mathematically by monitoring the shift(s) in parameter(s) of the 
underlying Quality Characteristic Distribution (QCD). Control chart, the pioneering work of Shewhart (1924) in the 
economic control of variation for statistical stability and nowadays the heart of Statistical Process Control (SPC), is a 
graphical way of inspecting a process by consecutive sample points in the order in which they were obtained in time 
and signaling the occurrence of assignable cause of variation if an unusual shift in process has occurred. The detection 
and elimination of the assignable cause will bring the process back to control.  
 
To design a control chart, the quality practitioner should specify three categories of decision variables, called as design 
parameters, namely the sample size, the sampling time interval (e.g., ℎ in Uniform Sampling Scheme (USS) or ℎ𝑗 for 
𝑗= 1, 2, …, in Non-uniform Sampling Scheme (NSS)) and the control limits of the chart which would construct the 
critical region of its corresponding hypotheses testing (e.g., 𝜇∓𝐿
𝜎
√𝑛 for 𝑋̅ control chart, when the target QCD's 
parameters 𝜇 and 𝜎 assumed known or estimated). Observing sample averages 𝑋̅  outside the control limits is 
considered as a (probable) signal of the out-of-control process. 
 
There are mutual relations between the design parameters and the control chart's statistical criteria like Type-I and 
Type-II error probabilities which can be considered as performance measures, respectively for the rate of false alarms 
and for correctly identifying a shift in the process when one exists. On the other hand, different design parameters 
require diverse budgeting. A series of research studies in the literature has been devoted to control chart's Economic 
Design (ED), traced back first to Duncan (1956) and unified for any chart, control statistic, or QCD by Lorenzen and 
Vance (1986), whose optimal design parameters minimize an objective function, the Expected total Cost per unit Time

4. Conclusion 
 
As a process deteriorates over time, the reasonable approach for sampling over time is to decrease the time intervals. 
Various decreasing inspection scheme are applied in this paper for IFR processes with Wiebull distribution and the 
optimal design outputs of their corresponding economic design are compared to the non-uniform sampling scheme 
with constant integrated hazard and to the uniform sampling scheme. All the proposed procedures, like the constant 
integrated hazard, simplify the optimization problem by inducing a function in which the 𝑗th sampling interval is 
computed through a function of the first interval ℎ1 and 𝑗. In some cases, the proposed procedures are slightly better 
than the constant integrated hazard approach. Further investigation on the mathematical modelling is needed to find 
the best non-uniform sampling scheme in the space of all sampling strategies such that the cost model is minimized.

Abstract 
The time to the change point of a process, called as shock model or the process failure mechanism, may have the most 
vital role in economic and economic statistical design of control charts. A supreme tool in reliability engineering for 
the failure rate shape identification is the total time on test plot and is studied in this paper to be applied for picking 
out an appropriate failure model. For this purpose, we need the estimations of the change points of the process that 
may be considered as the most important advantage of applying control charts in the literature of statistical process 
monitoring. The unknown parameters of the fitted distribution then can be estimated by some common statistical 
methods like maximum likelihood based on the estimated change point data. The generalized cost model of Rahim 
and Banerjee (1993) which can be considered for both uniform and  non-uniform sampling schemes and adapted for 
fitted shock model will determine the design parameters of control charts in an economically optimal point of view or 
considering economic statistical model. The proposed practical approach is illustrated by a numerical study on the 
optimal design of 𝑋𝑋ത control chart for monitoring the process mean of production systems with bathtub-shaped failure 
rate.

Abstract 
The research conducted in this study aims to increase warehouse order picking performance by sequence 
optimization, as travel time covers most picking processes in storages, it is important to have a suitable order of 
picking lines in a batch to achieve high efficiency. They argued in their study that routing inquiry for line series in 
selecting order batches in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) is well investigated, recorded and 
implemented. In addition, they stated that storage areas could be an alternative in practice where routing heuristics 
could hardly be applied. The Line Sequence Optimization (LSO) calculates the line sequence with the minimum 
travel time for a given batch based on a digitized network. The quantitative evaluation showed an overall 
improvement potential of 7.4% for a case study at a distributor in the business segment of electronic devices. 
However, contrary to the systematic routing enquiry, the sequences generated by the LSO may seem illogical 
to the picker a qualitative evaluation must follow to identify sequence patterns and discuss the methodology with 
the picking staff. Although a number of studies have been conducted over the past two decades to address these 
issues in the current literature review, the purpose of this paper is therefore to evaluate warehouse performance 
in the manufacturing industry theoretically. The results of the current literature's critical analysis clearly show that 
there are warehouse performance-related flaws in the current body language.

1. Introduction
The pressure is being placed on businesses and organisation’s, in today's market competitiveness, to come up with 
fresh solutions to add value and to supply products to clients. Companies increasing demand for cost, proper quality 
material and other services to compete with their products globally has increased the desire for innovative and 
effective storage technology. With the growth of mass manufacturing systems, the warehouse has become the 
critical function of storage and is the retailing center of raw and finished products. Therefore, storage and 
distribution centers, like products are stored, have comparable tasks (Coyle at el, 2003). Both carry out 
critical storage tasks and product movements (Langevin, 2005). Warehouse is the key function within any 
organisation, in which companies can supply their customers with a personalized or organized resource / service to 
benefit their rivals. So an organisation that gets, stores, counts cycles, stocks, ships, properly renames shelves at the 
correct place, uses scanners, etc. at a quicker pace and gets an operating culture to achieve a better performance 
compared with its competitors. There are however critical variables that may have a very severe effect on 
competition markets if not properly addressed or managed.

healthcare outcomes should research be required in the future ; DM (Data Management) is one of the key points in 
the healthcare sector. This will also guarantee better quality for future purposes, information can be obtained. 
Conclusion 
The objective of this research is to improve the performance of warehouse sequence selecting by sequence 
optimisation, because travel time includes most selecting procedures in storage areas, an appropriate order of select 
lines in a batch is essential to attain high effectiveness. In their research they stated that routing investigation for line 
sequence is well studied, registered and enforced in select order batches in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). 
They also indicated that in practice storage zones could not be an option to routing heuristics. The Line Sequence 
Optimisation (LSO) calculates the line sequence on the basis of a digital network with the minimum travel time 
for a specific batch. In a case research at a retailer in the company section of electronic appliances, the 
quantitative assessment showed a general enhancement potency of 7.4%. For a case research in a retailer in the 
company sector of electrical appliances the quantitative assessment showed an general improvement potential of 
7.4%. Although a number of research were undertaken in the last two decades to deal with these problems in the 
literature review, the objective of this article is thus to evaluate warehouse efficiency in the production sector 
theoretically. The findings of critical assessment of present literature show clear that the present language of the 
body has defects in relation to the efficiency of the warehouse.

Zack Algorithm: A Heuristic Approach to Solve 
Transportation Problem

Abstract 
The problem of distribution is a classic problem in logistics. The transportation method is a method that is 
widely used in overcoming these problems. The optimization method is sometimes difficult if directly 
applied to minimize transportation costs so that the initial solution that is heuristic in nature is needed first 
even more so if there are many variables. A good initial solution is one that is easily done quickly and 
approaches the optimal solution. This research offers a new method of finding an initial solution called 
Zack Algorithm which only has 5 steps that are easy to do. Based on the case study carried out, Zack 
Algorithm produces the lowest cost which is 0.28% lower than the North West Corner method and 0.15% 
lower than the Least Cost method.

1. Introduction
The problem of distribution of goods from certain locations to the destination is a classic problem in logistics. The 
allocation of a product must be arranged in such a way as to minimize the total cost of transportation (transportation), 
with the constraints of each request being fulfilled, and the source may not send commodities greater than capacity 
(Arifin, 2010). 
The transportation model is included in the linear program problem so that it is useful to find optimal solutions where 
the numerical function consists of one or more variables that are faced with obstacles (Teguh, 2014). However, 
sometimes it is difficult to directly use the optimization method to get the optimal solution so that the initial solution 
is needed first. Even more so if there are many variables. 
There are several initial solutions to transportation problems. Some of the most famous are the North West Corner 
(NWC) and Least Cost (LC) methods. Both methods still have disadvantages. The disadvantage of the NWC method 
is that it does not allocate as many products as possible to the cell box that has the smallest transportation costs. In 
other words, each product allocation does not pay attention to the amount of the cost per unit. Because it does not pay 
attention to unit costs, the NWC method is less efficient and is the longest method in finding the optimum table 
(Yusanti et al., 2017). The disadvantage of the LC method lies in determining the allocation of products into cells or 
boxes that have the lowest costs, where the costs have more than one cell so that it confuses users because there are 
no rules in choosing. Therefore, we need a method that can accommodate the shortcomings of the initial solutions. 
The main key in finding an initial solution to the transportation problem is that it is easy to do and results are close to 
optimal. The goal is when proceeding to the optimization process is quicker to find the optimal solution. In this study, 
researchers offered an initial solution called Zack Algorithm. Zack Algorithm has an algorithm that is easy to 
understand and faster to do than other initial solutions. Zack Algorithm can also fill the shortcomings of the NWC and 
LC methods so that it is expected to be able to help especially in overcoming transportation problems.

Based on the comparison of the total cost, it can be seen that the Zack Algorithm has the lowest total cost compared 
to the NWC and LC methods. The total cost of the Zack Algorithm is 0.28% lower than the NWC method and 0.15% 
compared to the LC method. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Zack Algorithm is a new method in solving initial solutions to transportation problems. The basic principle is to fill 
in the number 0 in the cell that has the highest cost and fills the maximum amount in the cell that has the lowest cost. 
In the case study described above, it is known that the Zack Algorithm is better than the NWC and LC methods 
because it produces the lowest total cost where the total cost of the Zack Algorithm is 0.28% lower than the NWC 
method and 0.15% compared to the LC method. However, because Zack Algorithm is a heuristic method, it does not 
rule out the possibility that other problems will produce a greater total cost than other methods. At least in this research, 
a new method is found in finding initial solutions that are easily and quickly done.

Abstract 
Adequacy of electricity in one nation must be provided by the State to increase the country's national production. In 
the government policy commanded by President Joko Widodo infrastructure provision including electricity is a 
priority. Therefore this study takes a hypothesis; the availability of electricity and central government policy greatly 
affect investment in Indonesia for economic development. This study uses panel data analysis covering 34 provinces 
in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia with data for 8 years’ time series. Thus, this study chooses the best and 
most suitable econometric model that is random effects models through the stages of statistical test by using 
Hausman, prob>chi2 : 0.05>0.000. Not only the existence of electricity but also the availability of electricity 
significantly affects production activities that are generally in the service industry, manufacturing and other sectors. 
The government policy that is fast and precise on this matter will determine the acceleration of economic growth 
both directly and indirectly.

Some of the problems presented by informants related to the management of documents and manual reporting that 
while doing the accreditation of the courses have trouble when assessors who needs to access in order to synchronize 
the data manually and electronic data, the condition is very influential on the final assessment of an accreditation 
process that has an impact dominant for the sustainability of an operational program of study, in the meantime, in 2017 
the pattern of accreditation will be able to experience the changes by using the electronic system and the whole party 
BAN-PT was no longer struggling with the data manually alone, for courses this condition becomes case of its own 
to accreditation in the future. 
As for the problem of external, delays in the distribution and receipt of information from Kopertis and Higher 
Education are the university authorities often do not have space for participation for socialization, training and 
technical assistance, when such activities are needed by the university and the study program for resource development 
lecturer and students (Isaacs). As stated by the informant, that they often get a disposition that is almost expired and 
the difficulty to follow up due to constraints of time and distance faced, to expect an email, the facility was very 
limited and only use the university address for the entire circulation of the incoming information. 
Another thing that becomes important, namely, the question of the work and research that are not indexed and 
published by the institution makes its own lecturers and students working to publish the work or study they are doing. 
The issue of support for the development of student network is very limited, so the development of student creativity 
delayed when compared to other educational institutions. 
For the learning process, with limited conditions of the course will have implications on the quality of learning 
outcomes which are not update patterns of learning and the learning process. As for applications and comparison 
results of theoretical study and the application will be less to get the most as a result of students just hold on textbooks 
and textbook amount is also limited. Should be a concern that the importance of information technology in an effort 
to support the learning process and results that will affect the quality of a college graduate. 
Understanding the implications of the result of the limited use of information technology in Buru Iqra University, is a 
phenomenon that should no longer be found in the current government and private continues to spur development. 
There are several things that could be analyzed for mapping the issue of utilization of information technology at the 
University of Iqra Buru namely, the question of the availability of infrastructure, affordability, policy and support the 
manager of the university as well as the geography where Buru Iqra university is located. 
For facilities and infrastructure, associated with the location and geography of the University who are at Buru regency 
of Maluku province, the condition is of course more difficult with only the availability of telecommunication 
companies namely Telkomsel. To access the information technology course will be an expensive item which the 
benchmark price to operationalize the Internet network reached 500,000 per month with quotas and minimum speed 
to be accessed by the public. As for using the means and leasing satellite will be far more expensive a price above the 
average of 15 million per month. 
Attempts to gain access to information technology is already often done by inserting a proposal or a request to the 
private sector, but due to the condition of the facilities and infrastructure that is always experiencing barriers to 
realization (Hardstaffe et al.). One attempt rector to meet these needs by raising the cost of education, but on the last 
occasion after review rector find it difficult because of the burden that will be borne by the students will be even 
greater, in order to face these problems then sought assistance and grants from external parties (Otte et al.). 
Much study, the phenomenon of limited access to information technology, that information technology has become a 
necessity that at a certain level are crucial issues related to the development of an institution. Governments in some 
time ago, have always urged and pattern the performance on the basis of information technology and the implications 
for the quality of the service, of course, as an educational institution Buru Iqra University should also be able to adopt 
such conditions as a necessity in order to improve (Crittenden et al.). With a presence in eastern Indonesia, must be 
recognized also with various limitations owned as supporting infrastructure, 
Overall, the impact of the limitations of using information technology a crucial issue in higher education institutions 
such as Iqra University Buru so that what is desired by the government and society to improve the quality of education 
is rather difficult to realize when then problems like this cannot be handled. The great hope for the support and 
encouragement the Government in resolving these limitations must be a priority, if we is hoping the synergy between 
the processes and outputs of education in Indonesia. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The issues that arise, causing limited use of information technology in Buru Iqra University consists of several things, 
namely the availability of infrastructure, affordability, policy and support the manager of Iqra university. Such 
conditions will certainly have implications for the most important part which is limited to service and faculty and

students learning process, so it has a strong influence on the quality of higher education in this regard Buru Iqra 
University as a research object. In the sequel, the impact of the limitations, information technology will certainly affect 
the service process and learning at Iqra University of Buru like, late in the process of distribution and receipt of 
information from Kopertis and Higher Education, not indexed and research work of faculty and students and the 
limited network for the development of student activities.  
The conditions there have a domino effect on the management, development and control of an academic and 
nonacademic at the University of Iqra Buru, but so did the University of Iqra Buru, in this case the rector continues to 
strive to bring information technology at the university in order to support services and learning, which in turn have 
difficulties to financial problems which will increasingly burden the burden college students. This condition continues 
to look for a way out by making a proposal or request for assistance to external parties. Great expectations for their 
government programs in support of the use of information technology in higher education the most important thing 
that must be addressed wisely, when the whole society and the government wants to improve the quality of education, 
especially in higher education in Private Universities. 
The government, through the Ministry of Communications and Information could be the initiator of the development 
of information technology in Higher education privately confronted with the problem of funding for infrastructure, 
which is of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Research and Technology of Higher Education to work together 
to help solve the problem, because many of the problems of information technology is rooted on the issue of financing 
and facilities. 
This desire can be realized with mentoring programs and support programs in order to utilize information technology 
in private colleges, can be realized when the education has become more affordable and able to produce graduates 
who have the best quality

Abstract 
Growing numbers of people are realizing their dreams of owning and operating their own business. Entrepreneurship is 
thriving in the U.S. and throughout the world. The dramatic impact of the entrepreneurial spirit influences multiple aspects 
of business such entrepreneurs come from diverse backgrounds and strive to realize the Great American Dream of owning 
and operating their own businesses. Entrepreneurs have introduced innovative products and services, pushed back 
technological frontiers, created new jobs, and opened foreign markets and sparked the U.S. economy into regaining its 
competitive edge. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), a study of entrepreneurial activity across 
the globe, 8 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 to 64 is engaged in entrepreneurial activity. The past two decades 
have seen record numbers of entrepreneurs launch new businesses. As companies around the world have engaged in 
massive downsizing campaigns, these layoffs, have created a new wave of entrepreneurs. People who once saw launching 
a business as being too risky, now see it as the ideal way to create their own job security. 
Another significant shift in growth of small companies is due to significant shifts in our nation’s economic structure as it 
is rapidly moving away from an industrial economy to a knowledge-based one. A knowledge-based economy favors small 
businesses because the costs are very low for managing, transmitting knowledge, information, and computer- and 
information-technology are driving these costs even lower. This paper discusses the impact of entrepreneurs on the 
success of the economy and how innovative products and services introduced by small businesses are vital for creating 
jobs and enhancing the economy.

Abstract 
For many entrepreneurs, coming up with an idea for a new business concept or approach is easy. The question is if this 
idea has the potential for a successful and profitable business. A feasibility analysis is the process of determining if the 
idea is a viable foundation for creating a successful business. If the idea passes, the entrepreneur’s next step is to build a 
solid business plan for capitalizing on the idea. If the idea fails, the entrepreneur drops it and moves on to the next 
opportunity. A feasibility analysis offers efficiency and the opportunity to increase the chances for success before the 
entrepreneur invests resources. 
Conducting a feasibility study reduces the likelihood that entrepreneurs will pursue fruitless business ventures. The 
feasibility analysis asks the question: “Should we proceed with this business idea?” This paper will discuss the process 
of developing and implementing a successful business plan and how to build a solid business plan to capitalize on the 
idea. The potential value of a feasibility study and the potential “costs” of conducting a feasibility study will also be 
discusses? Challenges facing new business owners will be outlined and useful tips for avoiding pitfalls in new business 
will be outlined.

Impact of High Speed Railways in Regional Economy: 
A Regression Analysis 
Dr. Sundaravalli Narayanaswami 
Chairperson, Public Systems Group 
Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM Ahmedabad), India 
Abstract 
Transportation is an important contributor to economic growth and development of a country as it facilitates 
easy movement of goods and resources. One of the indicators of a country’s economic development is GDP. 
In this paper, we discuss the rapid penetration of high speed railways (HSR) in China within a short span 
of two decades and its impact on the local economy. For our research, we chose the Wuhan Guangzhou 
Line that began operations in 2011. We compute the theoretical regional gross development product 
(RGDP) of six cities that are along this line and three cities which are not connected by any HSR lines by 
using regression analysis.  Independent variables in our study are population, employment, capex 
investment in land assets, length of highways and higher education strength. Dependent variable is the 
RGDP and we used data from 2006 to 2019. We benchmarked the change in theoretical RGDP over the 
years with the actual RGDP. Our results indicate that cities along the HSR line have an increase in their 
RGDP, whereas cities that are not along the HSR line have a decrease in RGDP. We infer that a HSR (or a 
transport infrastructure) that facilitates ease movement of goods and services has a positive impact on the 
region’s growth; however, this could also adversely impact the neighbourhood that are not directly 
connected by the HSR. We would like to possibly extend our model to analyse the regional growth of 
European countries and the influence of HSR on it. We believe that it will be an interesting contribution, 
as our model benchmarks within-the country growth in China, whereas it would be across the countries in 
Europe.

Supply chain optimization with Genetic Algorithm focusing 
on right supplier selection at real time in apparel 
manufacturing 
Shibbir Ahmad and Md.Kamruzzaman 
Mechanical Engineering Department 
DUET,Bangladesh. 
Abstract 
Apparel manufacturing industry is facing gigantic issue to meet customer demand and make them happier 
due to improper supplier selection. Factory does not follow the scientific and analytical techniques to select 
the right supplier .In this paper, we have done the right supplier selection by implementing cross-over and 
mutation analysis of genetic algorithm. Moreover, criteria based analysis also been done to get the right 
supplier at the real time. Furthermore, supply chain optimization experiment has been done with DOE-
Taguchi method. Industry can save up to 30 % of their total cost by selecting right supplier . 
1.Introduction
The cost of component parts and raw materials initiate a key slice of the product cost in many factories.For instance, 
the cost of apparatuses and parts bought from external sources by vast automotive or textile machinery manufacturers 
may total more than 50% - 80% of the incomes. In this process of procurement, supplier selection has long been 
predictable as imperatives and has been a pivotemphasisfor the majority of the industrial marketing research over the 
past three decades (Patton,1996).  The purpose of the supplier selection is to examine how many and which suppliers 
should be designated as the sources of the supplies and how order quantities would be assignedmidst the nominated 
suppliers. Selection is said to be effectual when we attain not only a desirable solution but also an optimal solution. 
Traditional supplier selection decisions are mostlybased on procurement cost, product quality, delivery performance 
and supply capacity criteria. 
The combinedthought of the above criteria complicates the selection decision even for an experienced purchase 
manager because competing vendors have different levels of achievement under these criteria. For example, the 
wholesaler with the minimum price in a given industry may not have the best delivery performance or product quality. 
In addition to the multi-objective nature of supplier selection, appearance of a discount pricing schedule becomes a 
major hindrance for procurement managers in finding the best purchasing strategy. There is numerous discount 
strategy like discounts depending on the quantity of each product ordered from a supplier, and discounts based on the 
total worth of all products ordered from a supplier end. Quantity concession models include distinct price breaks for 
every product. 
2. Review on Supplier Selection
Advanced levels of customer satisfaction and steady performance outcome from selecting and evaluating suppliers 
based on their ability to provide quality components and subassemblies, reliable delivery, and product performance 
as per the research by Tracey and Tan (2001).The most important supplier selection criteria that would be practical

We have been implemented genetic algorithm to get optimal release of the materials which ensure production start at 
the timely manner and end with right time delivery. To do so, we have taken 7 suppliers as a testing parameter who 
supplied resourcesand experimented onto that suppliers to get the optimum outcomes. Initial population declaration, 
and cross over practice help us to take the right decision to select the right suppliers.Later on, performed mutation 
analysis to scrutinize the most optimized right supplier selection at the right time described by the figure 5.  
In the figure 6 shown the outcomes of the right supplier selection who supplied right product at the right time with 
right quality.The initial making time as well as final inspection and delivery met due to the properly materials receiving 
shown in the figure 7. Table 2 exposed accurate supplier selection criteria. Supplier 3,6 ,8 and 7 met all the criteria 
which expects by the manufacturers to flinch the production on time based on the quality,cost,ethics, and commitment 
parameters. 
Conclusion  
Modern supply chain management emphasizes close integration between suppliers andpurchasers. Organizations are 
striving to have strategic relationships with suppliers. This callsfor a reduction or a rationalization of the number of 
suppliers. It is then possible to allocate scarce resources to develop relationships with the few chosen suppliers. In the 
earlier era of transactionalrelationships, it made sense to have as many suppliers as possible in order to find the 
cheapestdeal. In these days of integrative relationships, reducing the number of suppliers has become oneof the 
objectives of supplier selection.

Adversarial Network that generates handwritten digits. Specifically, we explore the outputs of the handwritten digits 
generated by the Generative Adversarial Network via NVIDIA DIGITS, as they are perceived by humans. The analysis 
suggests that humans do perceive the handwritten digits generated by the Generative Adversarial Network to be better 
over time. Further, the study suggests that human does relate to the handwritten digits generated by a Generative 
Adversarial Network to a certain extent with around 81.25% of the study participants indicated that the handwritings 
were written by children who are 9 years and above. We present implications for future interdisciplinary research at 
the intersection of artificial and human intelligence.

1. Introduction
Generative Adversarial Network (Goodfellow 2014) has been the center of attention in the domain of artificial 
generative knowledge processes. Through the efforts of artificial intelligence researchers, neural networks like 
Generative Adversarial Network have been advancing exponentially (Eghbal-zadeh and Gerhard 2017, Gan et al. 
2017). Various technical means have been employed to determine the effectiveness of neural networks in generating 
better outputs over time (Creswell and Anil 2016, Liu and Oncel 2016, Wang 2016). However, humans’ perceptions 
on the outputs of neural networks like Generative Adversarial Network are rarely employed to judge the outputs of 
the neural networks to be better over time. Also, humans’ perceptions on the level of expertise the Generative 
Adversarial Network has reached based on the humans’ perceptions on its final generated outputs such as the perceived 
age of humans who produced the handwritten digits are rarely studied. With the prevalence of the debates in the 
domain of artificial and human intelligence (Wagman 1997, Ge et al. 2008, Servick 2018, Ulman 2019), it is critical 
to obtain humans’ perceptions in regard to the maturity of a neural network to better judge the current state of 
advancements in artificial intelligence. Questions like “Do you think this alphabet is written by a human? If so, how 
old do you think the human who wrote this alphabet?” and “Do you think this piece of art is drawn by a human? If so, 
what is the level of expertise of the human who drew this art?” need to be raised more often. To examine the outputs 
of handwriting by a Generative Adversarial Network as they are perceived by humans, we pose our research question 
as follows: What are the humans’ perceptions of handwritten digits produced by a Generative Adversarial Network?

4. Analysis 
 
From Figure. 2, we make “0” represents “Incorrect” digit whereas “1” represents “Correct” digit. We observed that 
the digits ranging from 0 to 3 has a mean value of 0, which means that the majority of the mTurkers did not recognize 
the digits generated correctly. However, the digits ranging from 4 to 9 has a mean value of 1, except for the digit 7 
that we classify as an outlier in the range, which means that the majority of the mTurkers recognized the digits in this 
range correctly. In another figure, which is Figure. 3, we see that the differences between the actual digits and the 
digits that mTurkers recognized are the largest between the digits ranging from 0 to 3 with particularly large standard 
deviations for digits ranging from 1 to 3 and particularly large mean for the digit 0. Additionally, in Figure. 4 and 
Figure. 5, we see that there are much more variability in the perceived digits before the digit 4, which means that the 
Generative Adversarial Network is still learning to generate more recognizable digits at the beginning phases, and 
thus our humans do not have a consensus on the perceived digits.  
 
The last question that we asked mTurkers was “Are the digits written by humans?”. About 81.25% of the mTurkers 
answered “yes”, which might suggest that humans do correlate to the handwritings generated by the Generative 
Adversarial Network to a certain extent. Only 3.125% of the study participants, which is 1 out of 32 participants 
indicated “No”, whereas a mere 15.625%, which is 5 out of 32 participants indicated “I don’t know”. Further, we 
provided the study participants with a few sets of age range and asked them to choose an age range that they think the 
handwriting belongs to if they think that the handwritten digits were from a human. We chose the age range based on 
the researched state of maturity of the handwritings of the general children populations at different age range (Puranik 
et. al. 2014, Puranik et. al. 2018, Ritchson 2006). 81.25% of the mTurkers indicated that the handwritten digits belong 
to children who are 9 years and above while the remaining 18.75% answered “No” or “I don’t know” to the question 
that asked whether they think those digits are written by humans, which gives a slight indication that the handwritten 
digits generated by the Generative Adversarial Network were matured enough to be indistinguishable from the 
handwritten digits of those from the 9 year old children.

In essence, our research presents an analysis of the perceived digits at each phase by the mTurkers and correlates to 
that of the actual digit generated by Generative Adversarial Network via NVIDIA DIGITS to examine the outputs of 
Generative Adversarial Network as they are perceived by humans. We then examine the perceptions and 
interpretations of humans on the sequence of handwritten digits generated by Generative Adversarial Network through 
NVIDIA DIGITS. The goal of this analysis is to spur discussions among researchers researching in the intersection of 
human intelligence and artificial intelligence to go deeper in investigating the correlation of the outputs from artificial 
intelligence and human intelligence. Our explorative analysis on leveraging humans’ intelligence to examine the 
maturity of the outputs of the Generative Adversarial Network is hoped to bring a new way of thinking to the 
community that does human-artificial intelligence research. It would be interesting to see the levels of expertise in 
humans that are needed to generate the same quality of outputs that are generated by different neural networks in the 
future.

On Minimum Cost Non-uniform Sampling Schemes for 
Optimal Design of Control Charts: Application to X-bar and 
T2 Control Charts

Abstract 
 
As an economically superior approach to uniform sampling scheme, the pioneering work of Rahim and 
Banerjee on sampling procedure with non-uniform time intervals has been broadly employed in statistical 
process monitoring during the past three decades. However, since its consecutive times of inspection have 
to be determined through a function of the first sampling interval, it might make some kind of complexity 
in practical administration compare to uniform approach. In this paper, the intuitive companionship 
between the sampling frequencies and the failure rate of a process is discussed by investigating various 
functional costraints on choosing the length of sampling intervals and their effects on the optimal design of 
control charts, especifically for non-Markovian processes which deteriorate over time. Extensive numerical 
illustrations are prepared for monitoring both univariate and multivariate quality characteristics in 
manufacturing and service sectors following an increasing failure rate Weibull shock model. Although the 
proposed structures for sampling intervals could slightly improve the expected cost per unit time, the results 
illustrated that Rahim-Banerjee model of non-uniform inspection sheme which induces constant integrated 
hazard over each sampling interval is a well-established near-optimal approach.

Water Crisis in The Southern Bangladesh: A Planning and 
Implementing GAP for Leveraging and Developing A

Abstract 
The earth is facing multidimensional problems among these global warming is taking top most problematic situation. 
While for this challenging situation first world is primary responsible but consistently suffering third world especially 
South Asian countries for instance Bangladesh, the Maldives, Sri-Lanka, India, etc. Most particularly climate impact 
turn into high salinity in water and land which causes to create scarcity of drinking and fresh water in the Southern 
Bangladesh. Author here argued that general peoples cannot eradicate this problem within short term and all those 
short-term development solution initiatives are not perfect (Khan, M. Elyas, 2013 and CTB1, 2019). In last two-three 
decades several GoB and NGOs have been implementing their water and sanitation interventions as a part of their 
project activities but mostly unsustainable because they are not considered community needs and or what is 
community really looking for? Author has been working last 5-6 years in coastal area as a development practitioner 
and he is focused on rural challenges in his research in last decade. He has identified through his field research that “a 
long-time sustainable business model may ensure sustainable water solution for coastal communities and also reduce 
their water portability/carrying problem, which is a major challenge for these communities and most particularly for 
women who are decidedly responsible for water collection and household uses”. How it could be, author described it 
in logical and rational way “if develop a business model where public-private-community partnership (PPCP model2, 
isodynamic model) is the key to success”. In this model, develop a large water purifier plant (based on context, detail 
in full paper) considering population are living a concentered zone/area and supply pure water (water without saline 
and free from harmful germs) through pipeline close to the community. The community people can collect water by 
prepaid card or monthly subscription card in the collection point. So, payment comes first than water into their 
respective collecting tool (i.e. pot/container, etc.). This model might be ensuring hassle free water supply with 
minimum spend of time and small amount of money which is smaller than they have paying cost now and then. In this 
way community can save their valuable time which is spending now for water collection, rather they could spend their 
time in productive or economic activities. On the other hand, surface water treatment plan by PPCP model could 
supply enough water for surplus agriculture production, that will ensure food and nutrition security in that area’s 
peoples who are vulnerable now.

2 Public-Private and Community Partnership (PPCP) is a very comprehensive action where win-win environment to be created among the stakeholders that is the key 
of success. In this model community contribution is less but they get benefit maximum (http://penabulufoundation.org/en/public-private-community-partnership/). It is 
known as isodynamic model of development.

Abstract 
In any industry, it is imperative to maintain a clear perspective on trends for potential purchasing demand. 
With insight into how demand will fluctuate, decisions can be made to ensure the proper supply of goods or services 
will be available to meet customers’ needs. As to the definition of forecasting, its primary function is to predict the 
future values. Forecasting provides an estimate of future demand, with the primary consistent goal being to minimize 
forecasting error. Better forecasts result in lower inventories, reduced stock-outs, smoother production plans, reduced 
costs, and improved customer service.  
There are two separate approaches to forecasting. The forecasting techniques consist of qualitative and 
quantitative forecasting. Qualitative forecasts are generally based off soft skills such as impressions or intuition. These 
factors are difficult or almost impossible to quantify. This method is used when data is limited, unavailable, or not 
currently relevant. This method may also be used when no demand history exists for a particular product or service. 
As such, the forecast’s outcome will heavily depend on the skill and experience of the forecaster and available 
impressionable information. Qualitative Forecasts use subjective inputs such as opinions for consumer surveys, 
experts, and historical impressions.  In this case, a panel of experts may assemble to collect idea then move forward 
with a forecast outline. Scenario writing may be used to develop a conceptual scenario of future trends based on a 
well-defined set of assumptions. Qualitative methods often include brainstorming sessions to assemble a baseline idea 
platform to move forward with. Quantitative Forecasting approaches on the contrary are based on analysis of historical 
data of one or more time series. Mathematical models are used to calculate potential demand fluctuation. The various 
methods of calculation are varied based on desired outcome information and available initial information available. 
Available quantitative forecasting methods consist of the following methods: Time Series Analysis, Linear 
Regression, Simple Moving Average, Weighted Moving Averages, Exponential Smoothing and Exponential 
Smoothing with Trends.  These models while all unique in their own way have their pros and cons which will explored 
extensively in the poster presentation.

Abstract 
The inadequate management of the blood platelets supply chain leads to a wastage of this valuable 
lifesaving resource. Due to the high perishability nature of the blood platelets, a sustainable supply chain is 
needed to determine an optimum transportation way that can guarantee the efficiency of the collection and 
the diffusion processes of the platelets. A multi-collection and multi-distribution problem within a multi-
echelon supply chain is presented. The objective of this research is to develop and solve a multi-objective 
optimization model with primary objective functions to minimize the total costs of the supply chain, 
minimize the carbon emitted due to the transportation activities throughout the network and minimize the 
delivery time in order to increase the shelf life of the platelets and increase the lifesaving rate as well. The 
augmented ""-constraint method is applied to solve the proposed model and numerical experiments based 
on a real case study are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model and its validity.

Abstract 
Teaching and learning in tertiary institution have experienced significant paradigm shift and new techniques are 
continually being explored for improving engineering course content delivery. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) 
is fast revolutionizing engineering course content delivery in industrial engineering with impact felt in all spheres. 
Having the right skills and strategies for online learning study assist in equipping the learners with necessary skills 
needed for the implementation of the FIR. Industrial engineering discipline deal with the design, planning, 
development, improvement, knowledge transfer, implementation, installation and evaluation of the performance of 
complex processes or integrated system of people technology and information. The objective of this paper is to discuss 
how the use of an industry 4.0 Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) feedback approach can transform industrial 
engineering course contents as applicable to industrial engineering course curriculum at the University of 
Johannesburg. The study was carried out through detailed evaluation of existing systems from which conclusions were 
drawn.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) also known as Industry 4.0, has been a major contributor to advances witnessed 
in science and technology. FIR is the fourth major industrial era since the third industrial revolution of the 18th 
Century. In this era, there have been major inventions in mobile supercomputing, ubiquitous virtual simulations, 
neuro-technological solutions, self-driving transportation systems, genetic editing to brain enhancement and many 
others. The FIR is characterized by new technological innovations that have impact on biological, digital and physical 
worlds; economies and industries, and direct impact on academic disciplines. It is a phase characterized by intense 
dependence on machines for work being done on daily bases. It is machine driven, propelled by software’s as seen in

collaborative features, quizzes, online assignments, self-evaluation and re-evaluation for continuous improvement 
amongst many other features. Adoption of similar systems will generate feedback which lecturers can analyse and 
identify areas where students are struggling. This MOOC platforms as seen is just one of the features available in 
U-link which was found to be effective in this study. 
Other findings were: 
• 
The large size of the sample and the time period (session long analysis) improved the reliability of the 
findings. As such, random data analysis was effective. 
• 
Further online studies can complement this study by utilizing more data from none students of the university 
(public participants) and addressing the limitations. 
The approach and results of this study can be a starting point for the improvement of gaps in curriculum of industrial 
Engineering programs.

Abstract 
Supplemental Restraint Systems (SRS) are safety devices built into contemporary vehicles, to reduce the 
direct impact vehicle interior parts have on drivers and passengers in the event of sudden collision. The 
need for safety features in 3-wheel vehicles is imperative due to increasing use of unconventional vehicles 
for both passenger transport and e-commerce last mile logistics. The paper reviews technological 
advancements in SRS with focus on their features in terms of innovation and applicability. This informed 
the design considerations for a suitable SRS system for unconventional vehicles. The paper shares historical 
background and significant changes that have occurred from the initial models installed in motor vehicles, 
to emerging technologies which are currently being installed in 2 and 4-wheel vehicles. It further researched 
innovative devices that complement airbags for improved vehicle safety. The study involved a logical 
review of literature to gain insight into the historical background of airbags and considerations from design 
perspective. The findings set pace to track evolution in airbags using an exploratory study approach. The 
study findings have created a benchmark for airbag installation in 3-wheeled vehicles.

In terms of operations, the impact rough and uneven roads have on shocks and springs based on the maximum 
threshold of, camber angle while turning must be considered. This is because excessive camber deflection is not large 
enough to send crash signals.   
5. Conclusion 
Significant advances in automotive SRS industry from inception to date have been explored. The findings reveal major 
changes experienced in the airbag industry, from inception till date. The automotive industry attributes most of its 
safety innovations and vehicle improvement to the invention of the airbag. As a supplemental protection device, the 
airbag has been extensively researched and ongoing studies across the globe are mainly towards improving its overall 
performance and exploring its life saving potential. From the Federal motor vehicle safety standards data in Table 1, 
the 2 473 saved from the year 2012 alone out of a total of 12 074 lives saved within the survey period amounts to 
20.5% of lives saved. Many of the improvements in airbags were witnessed after the late 90s and this partly suggest 
the reason for this achievement. Table 2 equally shows the complementary benefit, airbags contributed to the overall 
statistics of lives saved based on the fatality analysis report. The index shows that between the year 2008–2012, 11 
682 lives were saved which was achieved within a 5 year period compared to the 12 074 lives saved from 1960–2002 
(42 year period). We can deduce from the figures that airbags have progressively and consistently supplemented the 
seat belt and other vehicle safety devices. 
 
Research is ongoing on the use of external airbags as presented in Figure 7 which promises to be the next breakthrough 
in reducing impact between colliding vehicles and vehicle-pedestrian collision (VPC). The sensitivity of the SRS 
control sensors has also witnessed tremendous improvements within the last 20 years. From the research, it was 
discovered that some commercial public passenger vehicles have not been given much priority in terms of airbag 
installation. A major source of intercity transportation system within Africa, Asia and part of the middle east is the 
tricycle; indeed the safety of this daily commuting transportation system should be explored because very little 
research work has been presented in this area. Scientists in Africa need to increase their involvement in vehicle safety 
research, based on the fact that most of the commercial tricycles and commercial buses with limited safety features 
are domiciled within the continent and all the airbag patents identified thus far, originate from Europe, Asia, Australia 
and America .  
 
The fatalities and injuries experienced by poorly detonated airbags have been on the decline and this will further 
reduce as more innovations are evolving in the airbag industry. ‘In the upcoming years, innovations in smart airbag 
systems will be focused on special intelligent features, such as, automatic radioing for assistance and information 
about the location, severity and number of occupants involved in the crash, pre-tensioning the seat belts, switching off 
the fuel pump and other appropriate systems, among others. Future growth in the market will also be driven by 
continued investments in technology development and R&D as manufacturers seek newer air bag applications areas 
to offset the stabilizing opportunities in the mature front impact airbags sector’ (Global-Industry-Analysts, 2012).

Abstract  
 
This paper demonstrates the empirical application of Six Sigma to decrease the total number of delayed jobs (NODJ) 
in a service contracting company. The study is based on process information and primary data from a real project. 
DMAIC technique was used in this study to improve the service quality by investigating defects, defining the root 
causes and providing a solution to minimize the defect. The investigation shows that the mode of receiving jobs order 
and analyzing the jobs requirements influence the NODJ.

1. Introduction 
 
Nowadays, customer requirements and the demand for highly reliable products have driven many companies to 
implement Total Quality Management (TQM) principles. The need for high-quality products at a reasonable cost to 
customers has been increased due to globalization and expansion of product market. Many Companies have adopted 
different quality management standards at their facilities such as Just in Time (JIT), ISO 9000, Lean Manufacturing, 
and Kaizen to respond to these demands. Six Sigma as a quality improvement approach which controls the defect rate 
and manages the quality as overall process function has gained popularity and acceptance in many sectors all over the 
world (Nonthaleerak and Hendry 2006).  
 
In the last two decades, the service industry has played a very important role in the economies of both developed and 
developing countries which require the focus on the quality of the services. (Omar and Mustafa 2014). Therefore, the 
increase of interest in the application of six sigma not only limited to the industrial sectors but also include the service 
sectors since manufacturing organizations have seen significant results by implementing Six Sigma (Chakrabarty and 
Tan 2007). This can be seen in the successful experiences of some services companies that implemented Six Sigma 
approach like Citibank, Bank of America, American Express, Caterpillar and Baxter Healthcare in the US and Europe 
(Young 2001), (Sehwall and Yong 2003), (Schimdt and Aschkenase 2004), (Jones Jr 2004), and (Rucker, 2000). 
 
Six Sigma as a measurement standard in product variation can be traced back to Walter Shewhart who illustrated that 
three standard deviations from the process mean is the point where a process needs to be corrected. Many measurement 
standards later came on the scene but the credit for creating the expression “Six Sigma” goes to a Motorola engineer 
named Bill Smith. Motorola engineers wanted to measure the defects per million opportunities therefore, they 
developed and created these new standards instead the traditional quality levels that didn’t provide enough granularity. 
Thereafter, many manufacturing and non-manufacturing companies around the world have used Six Sigma as an 
approach to doing business (Rosing et al. 2015). 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
Most companies suppose that six-sigma can only be implemented in the manufacturing industry because they believe 
that service organizations have a huge number of human workforce and there are no measurable defects. However, 
this is not true, non-manufacturing also involve processes. Critical to Quality (CTQs) is one of the keys to the 
implementation of Six Sigma in services to identify the process parameters since it can determine what’s important to 
the quality of a process or service to ensure what’s important to the customer (Chakrabarty and Tan 2007). A recent

that the gains from the project will be institutionalized. That is, the goal is to ensure that the gains are of help in the 
process and, if possible, the improvements will be implemented in other similar processes in the business 
(Montgomery 2013). As part of the control phase, having a plan for corrective actions, sharing data related to order 
characteristics and resource availability, online upgrading, developing the inventory systems, installing a reliable GPS 
system as well as conducting training programs for its employees to keep up with new technology and encourage them 
to communicate with each other are very important to keep the job order process under stability and control. 
Documentation of the improvement actions plays a vital role in the control phase to ensure the sustainability of the 
process going forward. Table 8 summarizes the results gained from implementing the application of six sigma.

4. Conclusion  
 
In this paper, we tried to demonstrate the power of the applications of Six Sigma as an improvement tool and show 
the potential domains where it could be utilized in the non-manufacturing industry. This paper presented a successful 
case study of minimizing the number of delayed jobs which was considered as defects in a service contracting 
company by conducting a Six Sigma project and the DMAIC problem-solving methodology. After the analyses carried 
out in the project phases, it was found that the mode of receiving jobs order and analyzing the job requirements had a 
statistically significant impact on the NODJ. Taking this into consideration, an optimum combination of using an 
online approach and database system were determined to receive and analyze the jobs order and its requirements.  
 
Although the improvement has not reached to the sigma level of six, the implementation of Six Sigma methodology 
has achieved its purpose and considerable improvement has been obtained in the service quality. The percentage of 
NODJ decreases from 14.3% to 5.3% and the sigma level increased from 2.57up to 3.12. Therefore, this study can be 
considered as a pilot project that demonstrates that the applications of Six Sigma are effective approaches capable of 
improving the service quality in non-manufacturing sectors as long as the organization continues embracing Six Sigma 
within its continuous improvement culture.

Abstract 
 
We addressed the inspection process of a critical product in an industrial refrigeration company. Using DMAIC 
methodology and it’s tools, through an integral proposal that included the implementation of new documentation, 
visual aids and training courses, it was expected to achieve the standardization of the inspection process as well 
as a better quality of it. Preliminary results shown a 125% increase in the Kappa index for agreement levels of an 
attribute Gage R&R (from weak to moderate), as well as a 10% reduction in type II error (using defective product) 
and a reduction of 75% in scrap after one implementation. A control plan was left with the company to maintain 
improvements, expecting savings of approximately $52,000 USD/year from the reduction of scrap.

1. Introduction 
 
Companies are constantly developing new techniques to improve current processes and in consequence, achieve 
operational excellence, which brings notable benefits to industries, such as increased revenue and long term 
savings of resources and time. A medium size company whose area of expertise is the production of refrigeration 
units is no exception.  Even though they have been growing since they were established in 1994, becoming today's 
leader in the refrigeration market, they continue working to increase its overall efficiency and productivity. 
Therefore, a project was set in motion implementing Lean Six Sigma Methodology (L6). L6  consists of two 
different methodologies, the first one is lean manufacturing, a work philosophy whose main objectives are adding 
value to processes and eliminating waste. Secondly, six sigma whose main objective is to reduce variability and 
improve quality through statistic and strategic approaches. 
 
Six Sigma is supported by DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology, a set of cycled 
steps that allows to identify a problem in an existing process and analyze the critical reasons behind it, in order to 
implement solutions for a long term period. This methodology is supported by tools, each of them useful in each 
step of the DMAIC. For example, SIPOC diagram, VSM (Value Stream Mapping) and Project Charter in the 
Define stage; Data Collection Plan and Stakeholder Analysis in the Measure stage; Ishikawa Diagram and 5 Why's 
in Analysis; 5S, Visual Aids, FMEA (Failure Mode Effect Analysis) and SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) 
during the Improvement stage; and Control and Monitoring Plans for the Control phase. The implementation of 
some of these tools will be helpful for the development of this project. 
 
Through the implementation of the DMAIC methodology and while observing the processes inside the company, 
it became clear that there is no standardized inspection method for quality control in a key area of the company. 
In this area, hairpins are inserted into coils, and it is through these hairpins that refrigerant flows, allowing the coil 
to cool. All hairpins need to be inspected before placing them in the coil looking for critical defects that may cause 
leaks and failures of the whole system if not detected. However, it was observed that the criteria used to evaluate 
hairpins was not in an agreement between departments (engineering and quality) which leads to using defective 
pieces on their products, as well as disposing functional ones, resulting in increased costs for reprocess pieces, 
customer complaints, guarantees and scrap. Therefore, the objective of the project was to validate the 
standardization of the evaluation of defects in hairpins by increasing the Kappa levels shown in a Gage R&R to 
at least 0.60 (The Kappa Index is the ratio of times operators agree to the proportion they could/should agree). 
Nowadays, a large amount of money is spent yearly due to customer complaints and two of the biggest causes of 
these complaints are caused by defective hairpins. After analyzing customer complaints of 2018, it was found that 
$340,000 USD were lost only due to damaged hairpins, either by leaks or dents. If the agreement level is good, 
then a decrease in the amount of customer complaints will be expected.

The objective of the project was to increase the agreement level to at least 0.60, however, this can not be achieved 
in a short period of time. Since people have been doing the same evaluation for years, it will take several sessions 
to grow up this new method within each person. That is why an increase was observed, but the target was not yet 
achieved. With a continuous training and set of actions such as the ones proposed in section 2.4, it is expected that 
by the end of 2019, the objective should be achieved, and with further control, maintained or improved. In order 
to measure the impact on a population level, a second hypothesis test was made, results can be seen below:

It can be seen that for variance within themselves, our at least 0.60 desired value is within our confidence interval, 
while compared to standard, the upper limit of the confidence interval in the current situation is close to 0.60 
(0.56). This proves that in fact, a notorious improvement was seen, however, it will require continuous effort to 
achieve our goal.It was observed that 75% of the time, asimetric tails defect was hard to identify due to the 
tolerance, consequently after the design and implementation of a gage, it is expected that this percentage will be 
reduced significantly since the gages were placed in strategic points in order to not produce hairpins with asimetric 
tails or not to accept supplier batches containing this defect. 
 
Working along the manufacturing department, it was found that besides the impact made reducing customer 
complaints by not placing defective hairpins in coils, a reduction in levels of scrap would also occur. Currently, 
around $69,000.00 USD are spent on copper scrap due to hairpin manufacturing. Since hairpins will stop being 
manufactured but will be bought instead, scrap and waste will decrease . If a correct inspection is made when 
receiving hairpins with an adequate sampling plan following the Militar Standard 105E, only batches that cover 
quality requirements will be accepted, then no scrap will be absorbed by the company. This could result in savings 
of approximately $52,000.00 USD annually that come from selling 6 of the original 8 manufacturing hairpins 
machines, reducing over 75% the current levels of scrap. This data was taken and analyzed from historics of the 
first months of 2019. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Implementing Lean Six Sigma, specifically the DMAIC methodology, a project was made in a company whose 
objective was to increase the agreement level operator have when inspecting hairpins. 41% of the main objective 
was reached after the implementation of proposals, where operators were given training about all the defects they 
should take into account while inspecting, as well as providing them with visual aids (masterpiece board and 
defect catalogue), and the gage to ensure all hairpins fulfill the requirements of not having difference in tails of 
more than 0.032 in. With the kappa index increasing 125%, from 0.2 (weak level) to 0.45 (moderate level), a 
reduction of 10% of the error type II (defective pieces evaluated as functional) was observed. At the same time, 
the development of visual (list of defects) and physical aids (masterpiece board), lead us to a standardized 
inspection system of defects and the reduction of 75% of hairpins scrap. 
 
There are several actions that need to be done to ensure that the impact remains along time. Training and Gage 
R&R should be imparted to operators constantly to ensure the criteria remains according to the ones set by the 
1206","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

quality department. Audits should be done constantly to ensure that the material placed in the worksatios 
(masterpiece boards, gage and catalogues). To guarantee that this is done in a proper way, several documents and 
guidelines were left to supervisors with all the necessary instructions and material for them to execute these 
actions. 
The development of the Six Sigma project was complex due to the multiple redesign of the project. It was observed 
that the DMAIC methodology is not linear because through the application of statistical models and quality core 
tools such as Pareto, Ishikawa diagram, hypothesis test, etc. the scope, limitations and restrictions needed to be 
changed in order to solve the vital few causes. Some restrictions and limitations were from the internal and cultural 
workflow of the company due the time workers have been doing the same procedure. Also the time given to 
develop the project was short compare to the expected results, that's why as a team we learn to identify the 
strenghts of each member and then hand out responsibilities and deadlines to deliver the project promptly.

Abstract  
 
Parallel robots have many useful characteristics, compared to linear robots like their greater structural 
rigidity, among others. The process of designing parallel robots take in consideration many variables such 
the workspace, the performance and the influence of the dimensions on these features, which make it an 
iterative procedure known as optimal design. This article presents the optimal design of a five-bar 
mechanism by the utilization of genetic algorithms. For the analysis, the robot is considered entirely 
asymmetrical which generalize the results to a more significant scope. Also, the objective function of the 
algorithm was the global performance index which considered the statistical behavior of the local indexes

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Parallel robots (PRs), associated to serial robots, have presented some useful characteristics like greater structural 
rigidity (stiffness), kinematic accuracy (non-cumulative joints error), higher robot-weight-ratio, compactness, and 
modularity [1-3]. In the past two decades, all of these benefits have won PRs particular relevance for the industry in 
fields of machine tooling, quick pick and place applications, vehicle driving simulators, solar tracking mechanisms, 
among others. One of the main subjects of PRs is their optimal design, which is the selection of a robot dimensions to 
satisfy specific requirements [4]. 
 
The quantification of the behavior of the PRs is realized using performance indices. This procedure reduces the 
physical and mathematical description of a robot to a scalar value that describes a specific property. Various 
researchers have proposed performance indices to different applications, e. g.; Yang et al. proposed a stiffness 
evaluation index to obtain the suited spindle configuration for applications of machining [5]; Vulliez et al. used

6. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The propitious dimensions for the best kinematic performance were obtained with the methodology presented in the 
article. This performance guarantees an optimized design of our mechanism, which gives us the best performance for 
the application in which the robot will be used. In the analysis, we considered all the possible cases of singularity for 
our model and, according to our state of the art, few works have this analysis due to their complexity, which adds 
value to the result of our research.

Abstract 
Lean manufacturing is a systematic approach towards identifying the values in relation to the customer, exposing the 
waste with a sole aim to reduce the amount of waste and the non-value added activities. Lean manufacturing is 
indeed a very powerful approach which seeks continuous improvement in quality and reducing the waste. A process 
improvement methodology can become much better if both the approaches i.e. lean manufacturing and six sigma 
take into consideration these approaches streamline operations, increases values and reduce waste. In this paper we 
have described the case study done at Blue Sky Machining Corp. With the application of various lean tools in order 
to maximize the production, reducing the throughput loss, and realizing the potential causes that can result in the 
loss of customers. We have significantly focused on achieving the standard operation time at each level of 
production.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Introduction about company 
Blue sky machining corp. is a production machining specialist of a division of shur lok products. The company is 
capable in the efficient manufacturing of complex light weighted automotive structure and meeting its customer 
expectation. The company is focused towards the manufacturing of the light weighted aluminum structures used in 
the automotive industry. Blue sky machining Corp. is having modern technology form of MIG or resistance welding. 
Currently the company is having manual, automatic and tandem presses ranging from 80 to 1000 tons with feeder 
equipment and uncoilers. The roll forming machine is responsible for the formation of the tubular products. So, the 
there are three processes that are currently responsible for the successful manufacturing of the light weighted 
structure. 
The three major big companies are the customers of blusky including GM and Chevrolet Silverado Truck. The parts 
which the company manufactures are F4026AE, F4027AD, F4028AF, F4029AF, and F4045AG.. The manufactured 
products are dispatched to the customer for seven days in a month with a pack out quantity ranging from 216 to 250. 
 
1.2Plant Layout  
The following figure shows the plant layout of Blue-Sky industry. The plan has several workstations include two roll 
form line, three press stations, and three welding stations. Raw material in forms of long wound roll next to the 
mounting platform so that minimum travel is required while loading on it. And inventory placed between roll form 
station and press station, it is convenient to place in from the roll form and takeout for press operation as well when 
need arise. Testing and measuring instruments for the first few parts for quality and specification after changeover or 
any minor stop in production line are placed far side on right from production office. Final inspection performed 
along after welding operation and part goes to the packaging.

Overall Equipment Effectiveness= Availability * Performance * Quality

Conclusion and Result 
 
With the application of various lean tools we analyzed the whole process and steps involved in the manufacturing 
and here we are proposing the final solution to the problems: 
1. 
The inventory accumulation can be eliminated by improving the cycle time of roll form and press machine 
operation from 11sec to 9sec, 22sec to 18sec respectively. 
2. 
The ideal cycle time at roll form is achieved by introducing an Omron ZW-8000 / 7000 / 5000 Series sensors. 
[10]These sensors are high precision sensor and can easily work on a reflecting surface. And hence we can get rid of 
the variation in length of the product which would eventually save our time on rework. 
3. 
The application of MODAPTS helped us in mapping the excessive movement that was been performed by the 
operator. On restricting the motion of operator on pressing machine has helped us to achieve the ideal cycle time i.e. 
18sec. 
4. 
Finally we started a new weld cell (already present in the plant) for 3 hours in a 8 hours shift and restricting the 
roll form operation for 5 hours and enabling that one operator to work in the new weld cell for 3 hours creating a 
multi skill environment hence can increase the overall efficiency of the cycle 
5. 
The current state VSM cycle efficiency comes out to be 0.047% and the future state VSM cycle efficiency 
comes out to be 0.0509%.

Abstract 
Most metallic alloys that are not easily joined by conventional fusion welding are usually joined by friction 
stir.  on this basis, friction stir welding has seen a wide application in different industry. Friction stir welding 
is complex phenomena having connected physical phenomena. However, it is usually difficult to 
theoretically develop a system of governing equation to analyze friction stir welded joint, due to the three-
dimensional nature and complex geometry. Also, the experimental techniques are often time consuming 
and costly. Meanwhile, numerical analysis has been introduced to overcome these problems. This study 
presents a straightforward perspective to friction stir welding (FSW) of AISI 4340 steel alloy numerical 
modeling and simulation. A three-dimensional heat transfer model for FSW was presented, the coordinate 
system was considered as a moving one, while the tool axis is fixed. Stationary convection-conduction was 
adopted to solve heat transfer problem. The Heat generated between the interface between the tool pin the 
work piece was simulated using model created in COMSOL Multiphysics software V 4.0.

3.2. Discussion 
Figure 3A, shows the original model geometry drawn using the Computer aided design tools (CAD) in comsol 
Multiphysics. Figure 3B shows the mesh model discretized using free quad and free triangular operation with 
extremely fine size, to enable easy convergence. 
From Fig 4A, the temperature history of the workpiece was shown  during the pin penetration, it was noticed that the 
temperature was of the highest value where the steel is in contact with the rotating tool in agreement with the work of 
Song and Kovacevic (Song and Kovacevic 2003). The penetration speed was set to be 50mm/min at rotation speed 
600 rpm. However, directly in front of the tool new cold materials enters, while hot materials are transported away 
behind the tool.  
Assumptions  
1. Heat is generated at the interface between the work piece and tool’s shoulder. 
2. Symmetry is assumed along the boundary of the weld joint. 
3. The steel plates are assumed to be infinitely long. 
It should also be noted that the analysis did not factor in the stirring process and material flow in the steel. The material 
property of the AISI 4340 was gotten from predefined materials properties in Comsol Multiphysics software V 4.0, 
while heat transfer coefficients and other physical properties are gotten from empirical expression available in the 
literature. 
 
4. Conclusion  
A three-dimensional steel plate model surrounded by two infinite domains in the x-direction has been modeled in this 
paper. The model results show heat generated between the steel plate and the FSW tool pin.  
The following are the conclusions drawn, 
A. The model can find application in modeling combine heat transfer process for the work piece and the tool during 
FSW. 
B. Modelling of temperature distribution between the tool and the work piece has been simplified.

Abstract 
Phase field modelling, a robust computational approach for modelling, predicting microstructure 
evolution and to speculate mesoscale morphological in various materials. In this study, we have 
discretized the time variable using semi-implicit instead of explicit scheme, semi-implicit scheme is 
known to allow a larger time step sizes than explicit schemes. Meanwhile, the discretization of the space 
variable is carried out using a Fourier spectral method, having a convergence rate that is exponential 
when compared to the second order Finite-difference method. Meanwhile, a numerical implementation 
of Cahn-Hilliard equation via semi-implicit Fourier spectral algorithm for conserved quantities was also 
demonstrated for binary alloy simulation. However, Isothermal conditions are considered and Non-
dimmensionalisation is done. Lastly, we implemented a MATLAB code to solve the phase field 
equation and visualize our model.

1. Introduction
Researchers are increasingly relying on computational technologies to help in simulating and modelling properties 
of advanced materials, computational modelling has functioned as tools at the disposition of engineers and 
scientists, aiding them to a have better grasp of different process parameters influence on microstructural 
evolution, and optimizing the material in the process to obtain very specific material properties. Inexpensive 
personnel resources, lesser time to get the product to the market and aggressive margin depleting pricing has been 
the hallmark of computational material science, under which phase field modelling is categorized(Olanipekun et 
al. 2017).

Conclusion 
 
In this work we have been able to study microstructural evolution in a binary alloy using semi implicit, Fourier 
spectral algorithm phase field model developed in MATLAB.  A Phase field method was used to present the 
numerical solution, using fewer equations that are relatively lesser than the number of particles in the system.  
Therefore, themo-physical parameters like Mobility that explains or control the composition field (𝑁𝑁𝑥𝑥, 𝑁𝑁𝑦𝑦) of the 
system, anisotropy, time, internal energy coefficient, gradient energy co-efficient, has played larger part to control 
microstructural evolution, in terms of grain coarsening, morphology changes.  
The parameters used is not specific to any material. Lastly, the present studies vividly show microstructure 
evolution of binary alloy due to complex interactions of thermophysical properties and parameter. Meanwhile, we 
were able to validate the contribution of Oswald ripening process explaining the microstructural evolution.

Abstract 
In the United States, federal law requires that hospital emergency departments (EDs) are to provide care to all patients, 
regardless of patient’s ability to pay. This has caused the emergency rooms to be stretched beyond their capacity which 
adversely affects the quality of care rendered to patients. To improve the quality of health care service provided in the 
EDs, hospital management has adopted benchmarking (BM) which is a quality improvement tool for performance 
measurement and efficiency analysis of the EDs. This study utilizes a structured BM model which consists of planning, 
analysis, integration, and action phases. Data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric technique for 
estimating the efficiency of a given set of decision-making units (DMUs) and Back-propagation neural network 
(BPNN), a supervised learning algorithm for training neural networks is incorporated into the analysis phase of 
benchmarking as a performance prediction tool. Results from the BP-DEA model shows that fifty percent of the DMUs 
are efficient while the remaining fifty percent is relatively inefficient. Areas of potential improvement in the less-
efficient departments are investigated. Implementing recommendations from the analysis can lead to increased quality 
of healthcare services provided to patients and increased efficiency in hospital operations.

Abstract 
Seasonal time series depicts a variety of demand patterns due to the trend and seasonality effects. Short lifecycles 
and peak demand are the complex characteristics of most seasonal products. This study presents a multiplicative 
exponential smoothing technique and introduces an additional seasonal parameter in the quest for better peak 
season forecast. Considering an actual time series of a seasonal product, the study analyzes four possible 
combinations of additive and multiplicative forms to feature the trend and strong seasonality of the data. The 
model uses the appropriate combination of additive and multiplicative forms and introduces an additional 
smoothing parameter to represent the time series pattern. The technique is relatively easy and computationally 
stable. The test result indicates the model performance is robust and encouraging for researchers and practitioners 
to exercise customized model in predicting strong seasonal demand.

Abstract 
Domestic violence is a significant public health issue. Routine health screening is a cost-effective strategy 
to reduce the harmful physical and mental consequences after the violence occurs. However, existing 
research finds consistently low rates of violence screening offered by healthcare providers, e.g., nurses, 
nurse practitioners, physicians. There is a critical need for research that helps understand how providers’ 
screening behavior is impacted by their intentions of screening, demographics, workload, and practice 
environment of the health center which they work in. However, much of the existing research in this field 
is empirical and qualitative. Two recent studies, Health Care Providers (HCP) study and American 
Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), involved quantitative data collected to measure providers’ 
screening behavior and intention, and multi-level impacting factors including providers’ demographics and 
work experience at individual level and characteristics of practice environment at organizational level. The 
data have many challenging properties such as multi-level and multi-source, which make existing statistical 
machine learning and data analytics models inadequate. The proposed research develops a novel system-
level multi-center structural equation model (SEM) to fuse AANP and HCP data and integrated both 
datasets to examine how providers’ behavior are related to their intentions, demographics, workload, and 
practice environment. The innovative multi-center SEM enables joint estimation across multiple datasets 
and leverage information collected from multi-sources, which greatly improves power in statistical analysis. 
The knowledge and insights generated from our study could facilitate the design and optimization of health 
professional training, workload assignment, and practice environment, which leads to improved providers’ 
performance and quality of care in healthcare systems.

5. Conclusion 
 
From the results of the research and discussion in the previous chapter, the following 
conclusions can be drawn: 
 
The results of the study indicate that the level of quality of the BNI website has not met the 
expectations desired by the user. There are differences that indicate a gap (gap) between the 
two perspectives of the assessment between the level of performance (performance) and the 
level of importance (importance) or the expected ideal quality. Overall obtained from the 
study, between the indicators Usability, Information Quality, and service interaction have an 
average value difference of (-0.18), so it is stated as a negative result that proves that there are 
still many things that must be addressed by the parties BNI in order to improve the website in 
order to achieve the ideal level of user authority. As for all the indicators that have a Gap 
difference that is valued higher than the other indicators, the Usability indicator which has an 
average difference in value of the gab on that indicator of (-0.06). And what should get more 
attention because it has the lowest average gap value is the Information Quality indicator 
which has an average difference of (-0.40). 
 
Based on the analysis in the IPA quadrant which consists of 4 (four) quadrants, quality 
attributes that become the top priority in order to get a web that is in accordance with the 
wishes of the user are attractive appearance, reliable information, actual information, relevant 
information, information easily understood, information in appropriate format. Furthermore, 
what must be maintained is easy to navigate, design accordingly, have personnel space, 
accurate information, information with the right level of detail, good reputation, security in 
transactions. And there are things that according to the user do not need to but must still pay 
attention to the appropriate design, competitiveness design, positive experience, a sense of

community, ease of communication with the company. Finally, the attributes that ordinary 
users think are very well packaged on the BNI website are clear and understandable 
interactions, easy to navigate, attractive appearance, personnel room, service delivery as 
promised.

Abstract 
In today’s competitive market, companies strive to utilize opportunities to survive long-term and remain competitive. 
Lean Manufacturing is a broadly perceived tool among industries. Organizations and companies are struggling with 
the new customer driven and competitive market. In order to overcome this challenge, they have turned into Lean 
Manufacturing utilization. The focus of this study is on reducing cycle time by applying lean manufacturing tools and 
techniques at Kautex Textron Corporation. The first step of the study was process mapping to have a clear 
understanding of the whole process of plastic fuel tank production and then, other required data were gathered and 
measured for the next steps. Pareto Charts, 4W 1H, Fishbone, and 5Why were utilized to identify the problems and to 
find out where exactly the waste is occurring in the line. After a root cause analysis, MODAPTS and 5S techniques 
were applied to reduce the waste which were mainly due to the excessive operator movements in conjunction with a 
disorganized workplace. Operator movements in all stations were observed and recorded and then unnecessary 
movements were identified as waste and therefore, eliminated. Utilizing root cause analysis tools, we found out that 
the waste is occurring due to a messy environment. Needless to say that 5S is the most proper tool to increase 
productivity by providing a safe and efficient workplace. To obtain better results, some further suggestions were 
recommended such as providing user friendly containers and conveyors for components and changing the layout for 
more convenience of transportation and waste elimination.

1. Introduction
In the past, the ultimate goal of traditional business in the manufacturing industry was to produce a high volume of 
products at low costs. Nowadays, however, manufacturing organizations are focusing on quality assurance and adding 
value to the final product by eliminating seven wastes known as “Muda” which are transportation, inventory, motion, 
waiting, overproduction, over-processing, and defect. They have realized that it is applicable by applying lean to their 
processes. James P. Womack and Daniel T.Jones explain in their book that how lean thinking is a powerful antidote 
to muda. They suggest that it is lean because it creates value and get closer to what customer wants while providing a 
way to do more with less; that is less human effort, equipment, time and space. 
While customers demand in the past was a low cost product, today they are demanding services and products delivered 
on time with high quality. Many are elements that contribute to the success of manufacturing and cycle time is

4.2.2. 5S 
In the future state our group applied some 5S techniques to organize and make the assembly process more 
convenient for the operators, specially, in the pre-leak station. For improving the work space, we used three different 
colors of tape to keep, move and remove each equipment to a right place. Additionally, by using Vent hanger we 
ended up providing more organize place for components which leads to spending less time for operators to do 
assembly. 
 
Conclusion and suggestions 
The primary target of this project in Kautex Corporation was to improve the cycle time using LM tools. MODAPTS 
and 5S techniques were the main tools used to reduce the waste which were mainly the operator movements in 
conjunction with disorganized workplace. All these steps have been taken in order to meet the customer demand on 
time. Another purpose of LM tools are to identify the problems and to find out where exactly the waste is occurring. 
Pareto chart, and Kaizen, etc. were utilized with the aim of root-cause analysis. 
 
Suggestions: 
Observing the whole process of production line at Kautex, we came up with a handful of suggestions. 
• 
Implementing 5S periodically and Kaizen continually, 
• 
Using pull production system along with Kanban, 
• 
Providing user friendly containers and conveyors for components,

Towards Optimization by Matching of Response Surfaces: 
Finding Windows of Maximal Similarity

Abstract 
The ultimate goal of this work is to find a region where the response surface of a function that is not well 
characterized in terms of optimality resembles one that is well-characterized in such terms to find, at least, 
a local optimum. The region in the input space where this resemblance occurs, we call a Window of 
Maximum Similarity (WMS) and is identified by formulating and solving an optimization problem. The 
method is one of minimization of squared errors and can be used to explore experimental or simulated data. 
A series of examples are presented to show the method’s feasibility and capability for generating a two-
dimensional WMS. This method is a viable element that will serve for the future development of 
Optimization by Similarity. 
Keywords 
Optimization, Simulation, Metamodels, Response Surface Methodology  
1. Introduction
Typical approaches when using modeling require identifying an equation that can best approximate a dataset. For 
example, in linear regression, data is used to fit the line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between data points- 
the functions input space- and the fitted line- its expected response. Even so, responsible statistical practice requires 
analyzing those points, in statistics called ‘outliers’, where the model seems not to explain the independent variable 
as well. In this space, data does not behave in a desirable manner, although there will ideally exist a region in the 
dataset where it does. Our statement is that there can be regions where data, any data at hand, behaves, or “looks like” 
a function with desirable optimality conditions and that this can be used to explore the simulated data to find at least 
a local optimum. 
When a complex model, like those frequently used in simulation, is approximated by another simplified one for 
statistical testing, computational efficiency or optimization purposes, we are using a metamodel. It is common in 
metamodeling that the model’s parameters are estimated until the most competitive fit is found (typically) by 
minimization of an error function. Metamodels are often used for optimization purposes; after a model form is 
determined, it can be used to experimentally find optimality conditions of a process, as in Response Surface 
Methodology. In this work, metamodels are used in a different manner but also pointing towards optimization; after 
generating data with a model, the metamodel’s parameters will be fitted to be the one that maximizes the similarity 
between itself and the data. By superimposing both functions and finding their region of maximum resemblance, we 
are looking to identify a window the input space where this similarity occurs.

5. Conclusion and Future Work  
This work proposed the use of WMS for future optimization by similarity. The method intends to find the experimental 
region where a model with desirable characteristics is a good descriptor of the data at hand. An evaluation case using 
function AOG 1 was presented. According to these results, the method demonstrates the potential to find regions of 
similarity between two responses where optimality can be a pattern of interest.  
The evaluations of the method in seven unconstrained global optimization test functions served to show the use of 
window of maximum similarity in examples of functions with different shapes. Also, it was observed in the evaluations 
that the WMS method potentially detected zones of maximum similarity between the different test functions and a 
quadratic function.  
 
According to these results, the method demonstrates the potential to find regions of similarity between two responses 
where optimality can be a pattern of interest and can be a useful tool for exploration of simulated data to find, at least 
a local optimum.  
 
In many cases, the WMS obtained by the method were limited to take the minimum size or epsilon value assigned, 
which is why future work includes:  
1. Substitute Optimization of one composite objective function to multiple criterion optimization, as presented 
in Rodríguez-Yáñez, Méndez-Vázquez, and Cabrera-Ríos, M., 2014.  
2. Include more variables to the test functions to evaluate.  
3. Experiment using alternative metamodels.  
4. Use Design of Experiments for Experimental Region

Abstract 
Puerto Rico has not participated in the evaluation of the World Forum Competitive Index (WFCI) 
since 2015; consequently, the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association (PRMA) created an index 
to measure productivity on a project level, known as the National Operational Excellence Index 
(OEI). As part of the evaluation, three out of the twelve pillars of competitiveness were covered: 
Innovation, Technological Readiness and Labor Market Efficiency. This study measured the 
impact of the implementation of the OEI in 2017 versus the actual 2018 performance. Each 
evaluation criteria was compared to identify the project development areas that needs attendance: 
Results and Culture categories. It was found that, overall, Biomedical had the higher scores for 
2017 (but did not improve for 2018) and Pharmaceutical for 2018. It was also found that the 
variation decrease could suggest higher competitiveness over the years. This index can attract other 
industries to participate in the evaluation in order to be part of a competitive environment that 
promotes a collaborative business as part of a continuous improvement mentality, and not just an 
annual evaluation with no continuity.

Abstract 
 
Finger and joint injuries are common among children. This may come from a strain, fracture or just overuse of the 
different joints. These types of injuries may occur in the three joints of the hand: the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP), 
interphalangeal joint (PIP), or the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). However, a child with these types of injuries may 
find the normal rehabilitation methods boring and uninteresting, which may affect the speed of the rehabilitation 
process. In this project, the Unity game development engine (Unity) was used to design a game for children with these 
types of joint injuries to speed up the process of rehabilitation. Additionally, the Oculus Rift (Oculus VR) was used as 
the VR headset and the Leap Motion Controller (Leap Motion) was used to measure the hand movements and angles 
of the patient throughout the experiment. This type of game may speed up the recovery process of a child with a DIP, 
PIP, or MCP injury. The child may find the game more interesting than the normal set of exercises and therefore may 
be keener on winning the game which will speed up the rehabilitation process.

Abstract 
Functional impairments of the Upper Extremity (UE) are common not only among the elderlies, but can also result 
from cerebrovascular accident (CVA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal cord injury (SCI) in any 
individual. Citing the constant growth of UE Dysfunctions and required prolonged rehabilitation, robot-assisted 
therapy has already been contributing to restoring UE functions. Though, extensive research has been conducted on 
rehabilitation robotics, limitations still exist compared to required degrees of freedom and range of motion for effective 
UE rehabilitation. In this research, we have developed a 3-DOF robotic exoskeleton to provide rehabilitation therapy 
to the shoulder and elbow joints. The exoskeleton was designed for typical adult; provision includes for link-length 
adjustment to accommodate a wide range of users. The robot arm will be attached to the lateral side of human UE to 
provide shoulder joint vertical and horizontal flexion/extension and elbow flexion/extension motion. Modified 
Denavit-Hartenberg notions were used to develop the kinematic model and Newton-Euler formulation was used for 
the dynamic modeling of the developed robot. Control has been implemented on LABVIEW environment. 
Experimental results revealed that this robot can be effectively maneuvered to follow the desired trajectories (shoulder 
and elbow joint motion) to provide passive rehabilitation therapies.

Benchmarking Sustainability Performance of Organizations 
Using a Multicriteria Approach with Application to 
Canadian Market 
Abbas Tavassoli 
Concordia University (Montreal-Quebec) 
Canada 
Abstract 
Sustainability involves meeting the needs of present generation without compromising the requirements of 
future generations. It involves focus on three main pillars: economic, environmental and social for realizing 
overall performance. Sustainability assessment is very essential to businesses and industries to improve 
their competition capacity. Majority of the corporations are adopting sustainability practices for corporate 
progress and improving their business appearance for long term effectiveness, thereby receiving economic 
benefits as well. In this paper, the authors propose a multi-criteria framework for benchmarking 
sustainability performance of organizations. The indicators for evaluation are obtained using Sustainalytics 
database. Multicriteria decision making technique called TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by 
Similarity to Ideal) is used to generate organization rankings. The proposed technique is applied to evaluate 
performance of 24 companies in two major sectors: manufacturing and service. The selected companies 
come from the Canadian market. The results of TOPSIS study show manufacturing sector to be doing better 
than the service sector with average Relative Closeness (Ci) 0.5 and 0.36 respectively. Future work can 
involve integration of financial KPIs, cross-sector investigation and involvement of MCDM techniques 
such as AHP for weighting in the proposed study.

Recycling PET with Containment Utility Bin through 
Insertion and Tucking Operation (CUBITO) 
3D Printed Self-Assembles: 3D Shells

Applied Optimization Group 
University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez

Abstract 
Recycling entails the partial or total transformation of a product that has already served its purpose into 
another product for subsequent use. Successful recycling depends on many factors. An often-overlooked 
factor is that the post-recycling product needs to be truly useful for the consumer beyond its label of ‘made 
with recycled material.’ This work has focused on designing components that can be easily assembled 
without the need of additional fasteners onto a cube-like structure. Formally, the intention is to design a 
Containment Utility Bin Through Insertion and Tucking Operations (CUBITO). The prototype of CUBITO 
was designed using Siemens NX computer-aided design software and it was 3D printed to test its integrity 
when empty as well as with loads. The prototype is a cube with walls of approximately 75mm side 
assembled from 3 components. It has its integrity simply by the mechanical interference of its parts and it 
has been capable of containing 1.5 kilos of steel screws so far. In the future, CUBITO will be built with 
components molded from recycled PET. An initial estimation is that one PET water bottle could be melted 
and molded into CUBITO’s parts.

Abstract 
 
Sorocaba is a Brazilian city with almost seven hundred thousand people, which inhabitants are facing 
growing issues related to urban mobility. This is caused by an increasing growth of population, number of 
light vehicles, motorcycles and even buses, which have increased to attend the population’s demand of 
mobility. Combined with the lack of an urban planning, Sorocaba’s residents are facing a chaotic traffic in 
the peak hours. 
In response to a massive population growth in the north area of the city, the local government developed 
the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project, an attempt to decrease the traffic and the travel time, mainly in the 
peak hours. This project is currently in the implementation phase, with civil works scattered around the 
main avenue of the north area. The purpose of this study is to present a simulation, using the FlexSim 
software, of the BRT’s route and its integration with other buses lines, analyzing the current situation of 
public transportation and measuring the impacts of BRT construction. Due to the complex analysis, 
simulation is useful to check the improvement of the vehicles flow, regarding current traffic in the city 
and the investments projects presented by the governments.

Conclusion and suggestion 
According to the results obtained in this research, the role of determination the optimal region and 
type of industry to investment and establishing, to on time, optimum supplying of Raw material 
required for production, supply the enough energy and environmental pollution control , is very 
importance. The optimum selecting and establishing of industry in region, cause to increasing 
efficiency of supplying, handling, productivity and reduce the total expected cost and increasing the 
value- added per production unit. In this research, there are four alternative (combination the regions 
and industries) to optimal decision making by investors.  According to the results obtained in this 
research, fourth alternative (region2 and industry 2) is the best decision to investment. This results of 
research, is obtained based on opinions of industrial experts and experience investors in fields of 
industrial engineering and management and also supply main indexes (logistics, energy, human 
resource, maintenance, material and environment). Because of variety of variations, it is not possible 
to control the total variations that mean that some impressive variations on the result of research are 
out of control. So, it is suggested that the related researches in this filed should be done by all 
impressive variations. As for the optimization of value-added in industry  and how to selecting and 
establishing the industry in region, how to locating it and it's relating to the costs is a new issue in 
Iranian organizations, so in considering of its indexes and in organizations, this research has been 
faced with the previous researches limitations. Also it is suggested that research in this field should be 
done by impressive various main indexes that effective on value- added and different organizations.

Abstract 
Increasing Pedestrian Safety is currently an issue that most countries are facing as pedestrian security is of prime 
concern. This paper aims to propose a technique that utilizes the camera data collected for each street by Montreal’s 
government. The collected data is used to train a neural network using simulation and TensorFlow, which then 
identifies pedestrian patterns that are observed during each time of the day. These patterns can then aid in enhancing 
pedestrian security measures in the chosen streets. The neural network is trained to identify the number of pedestrians 
in the streets, peak hours at which pedestrian density is maximum, streets which have most pedestrian density 
throughout the day, and various other patterns described in this work. This data is then used to control the Pedestrian 
and traffic lights, issue warnings onto the pedestrians’ smartphones in the vicinity of the risk area etc. This task is 
achieved by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Services, and micro-controllers installed near street lights on 
streets. Thus, this work not only promotes pedestrian safety but also acts as an aid to developing Smart Cities. This 
work makes use of the image data freely provided by the city of Montreal. It also discusses the advantages, weaknesses, 
limitations, and future scope of the above-mentioned proposed technique.

1. Introduction
The ongoing constructions in the city of Montreal have affected the traffic control systems and made the 
pedestrians more vulnerable to accidents, and other security threats. This requires an urgent traffic management 
system which is sustainable, efficient, and multicriteria based, and can ensure pedestrian security in any 
circumstance.
This paper aims to present such a solution which incorporates technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), 
neural networks, simulation and modeling, and Cloud services. It provides a framework that allows the 
detection of pedestrian patterns during peak, as well as non-peak hours, which can in turn be incorporated 
to manage the traffic system efficiently while ensuring the security of pedestrians. The proposed technique 
involves using the data collected from monitoring cameras installed by the city government in all major streets 
of the city. The images collected by these cameras are freely available for usage. The city currently does not 
incorporate this data into any smart traffic management systems, instead this data is only analyzed during 
emergency situations.
The framework provided in this paper, aims to collect this data and use it to train the convolutional 
neural network to identify pedestrian patterns, which can in turn provide insights into enhancing 
pedestrian security.
Various implementation methodologies have been implemented in recent past and turned out to be a failure. 
Several aspects like cultural, economic and psychological affect the growth of the city on its own. These factors 
are widely influencing the production and betterment of the current situation of the city. The main issue that 
needs to be resolved when we talk about pedestrian safety is, we can save pedestrians or just reduce the risks. 
Thus, a system assuring pedestrian safety needs to be well analyzed and well versed.
The technologies that have aided in developing this framework are as follows:

beneficial to the city.  
5. Conclusion
This work presents an efficient solution that can aid in enhancing pedestrian safety in a cost effective, and 
reliable way. The issue of pedestrian safety is of utmost importance as the traditional systems for 
pedestrian safety pose many limitations and disadvantages that render them relatively ineffective. The 
technique proposed in this paper aims to eliminate those limitations and provide a reliable and extremely 
efficient system. This camera data collected for each street by Montreal’s government is used to train a neural 
network using simulation and Tensorflow, which then identifies pedestrian patterns that are observed during 
each time of the day. The neural network is trained to identify the number of pedestrians in the streets, peak 
hours at which pedestrian density is maximum, streets which have most pedestrian density throughout 
the day, and various other patterns. This data can then control the Pedestrian and traffic lights, issue 
warnings onto the pedestrians’ smartphones in the vicinity of the risk area etc. This proposed solution has 
been compared and contrasted with several other solutions that currently exist. Its efficiency, reliability, and 
cost-effectiveness make it a better alternative than most other works. Moreover, this technique can 
also provide information and alerts to emergency services and other higher authorities. This not only makes it 
ideal for pedestrian safety, but also aids in developing Smart Cities.

Utilizing the Blockchain Technology as an Effective Means 
for Supply Chain Traceability.

Abstract  
Given the broad range of activities carried out in the supply chain, product traceability stands out as the core of any 
successful supply chain management program. Traceability therefore is the planning and execution of activities which 
allow a person or an entity to monitor the pathway of a product from its origin down to the consummation of the 
product. This helps a company or an organization to be in control of all of the processes involved in a product’s 
lifecycle, it also increases transparency during the manufacturing phase of a product and thereby enhancing consumer 
trust. 
Though traceability is critical in achieving success in any supply chain transaction. However, the effectiveness of this 
effort relies on the method by which it is carried out. In the past, and even up till now, various means have been 
utilized in carrying out the traceability activities in the supply chain, such as the use of RFID in product labelling and 
identification and manual register for recording transaction levels. Nonetheless, due to the diverse nature of the supply 
chain industry which cuts across various industries, these methods have not been wholly sufficient in achieving 
product traceability, and this has led to multiple product losses and recalls. 
In this paper, we propose the use of blockchain as a means of improving the efficiency of traceability activities in the 
supply chain industry. By initiating the use of digital smart contracts in the blockchain as a technique to automate and 
track the path of a product within the supply chain, we are able to track the state of every transaction and produce an 
audit trail of the trace path of any product in a supply chain transaction. The result of this implementation is the 
elimination of certain human errors which occur during the creation of traceability logs and an optimized cost function 
of traceability in the supply chain industry. 
Furthermore, we compared the time-length of writing a traceability transaction log, in a supply chain and error rate of 
transactions between blockchain, RFID and manual register, by using a waiting line simulation technique in MS Excel 
as basis for the choice of a tech solution in any traceability effort, the result of this comparison is that the 
blockchain technology has a much lower time to complete a transaction trace log with an optimized error rate of 
0.000001% and therefore we conclude the choice of blockchain is preferred as a technology solution to supply chain 
traceability.

RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1  
 
• 
We recommend that the usage of the blockchain solution or technology in a track and trace effort should be 
concentrated only in those instances where the traceability efforts involve a cross section of stakeholders 
from various sectors.  
• 
For example, we do not advice that the blockchain solution be utilized in implementing a traceability effort 
within a small and an individual section, like in a small warehouse traceability. This is because the cost 
associated with implementing a blockchain solution will not compensate for the gains of an individual 
platform traceability.  
• 
In the overall, we recommend the implementation of a blockchain technology as a solution in traceability 
only when the traceability effort involves multiple stakeholders.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 5.1 
 
As can be seen the supply chain traceability is essential for maintaining a sustainable supply chain system. The practice 
of tracing every element used in supply chain has some challenges due to the convoluted nature of the blockchain. 
Therefore, to mitigate these challenges various solutions have been created. Presently one of the most efficient method 
of solving these challenges is the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology helps to obviate these difficulties 
because it is composed of digital execution, operates on decentralized server and scales indefinitely. By using these 
features of blockchain we can bring visibility to most aspect of the supply chain and help to make the supply chain 
system more efficient.

Abstract 
Dobot Magician-a 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) robot- is widely used nowadays in education and in research on 
industrial robotics. In this paper, we developed forward kinematics and inverse kinematics of Dobot magician robot, 
and built a non-linear approach for cartesian control of its end-effector position. Modified Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) 
convention was used to obtain forward kinematics. An Algebraic approach was used to find inverse kinematics 
solution and presented in details. An algorithm based on developed inverse kinematic was developed to conversion 
Dobot’s Cartesian variables into joint variables. This conversion facilitated to obtain Cartesian control of Dobot 
Magician robot. Lastly, simulation results show stability and efficacy of developed control approach in maneuvering 
the Dobot’s end-effector position.

1.0 Introduction: 
The use of robots has been increasing exponentially through the last couple of decades. Extensive research has been 
going on in the area of robot design and control to make such robots intelligent and to increase the performance of the 
robotic operation. The research includes the robot application in small/large industries for fine object manipulation 
(Wilson et al. 2016, Holz et al. 2015, Su et al. 2015), health care industries as an assistive device (Rabbitt et al. 2015, 
Vandemeulebroucke et al. 2018) and/or rehabilitation device (Nef  et al. 2009, Cui et al. 2017, Islam et al. 2017, 
Assad-Uz-Zaman et al. 2016, Islam et al. 2019), mining/hazardous environment for safe handling/operation (Quintana 
et al. 2018, Bai et al. 2018), precision manufacturing, and STEM education (Li et al. 2018). 
Dobot Magician (Shenzhen Co 2019a) is a commercially available lightweight, multifunctional desktop robotic arm 
that resembles a 3DOF industrial robotic manipulator is nowadays widely used for STEM education. Dobot users use 
‘Dobot Studio’ (Shenzhen Co 2019b) software to program the Dobot for object manipulation. However, Dobot studio 
does not have resources to teach robot kinematics, dynamics, and simple control techniques such as PID control. There 
is a great potential to use the Dobot in undergraduate lab and teach robotics if its kinematics, dynamics, and control 
strategies can be formulated. Therefore, in this research we have developed Dobot’s forward kinematics, inverse 
kinematics, dynamic modeling, and control technique using simple PID controller. It is anticipated that this research 
article will be a key learning resource for the undergraduate students and for researchers working on robotics especially 
with the Dobot Magician. 
To develop the forward kinematics the well known modified Denavit Hartenberg conventions (Denavit and 
Hartenberg 1955) were used, and for the inverse kinematic algebraic approach was used. Note that for the Cartesian 
control of a robot it is essential to know the inverse kinematic solution of a robot. The recursive Newon-Euler 
formulation (Craig 2017) was used to develop the dynamic model of the robot. To demonstrate the control using PID 
technique, simulation was carried out in Simulink environment where the Dynamic model of the dobot was simulated 
to follow both joint space and cartesian space trajectories.

7.0 Conclusion: 
In this paper, we have developed forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, dynamics of the Dobot Magician robot. An 
inverse kinematics algorithm was developed based on derived inverse kinematic solution. Finally, cartesian control of 
Dobot magician robot was accomplished with developed controller. The control simulation shows maximum error 
0.5°.  This controller will be further improved by adding a robust control (Sling mode control, Adaptive control etc.) 
to deal with the modeling uncertainties (future works).

Abstract  
College enrollment and academic preparation across the U.S. is still a challenge, with fewer but more diverse high 
school graduates each year which results in fewer engineering graduates. One approach to address these challenges is 
to explore trends in student enrollment and their success in engineering to identify typical student profiles. In the 
preliminary analysis, college access is explored by examining the demographics of the admitted college of engineering 
students in one year of study utilizing engineering undergraduate data and US Census databases.  Where the data were 
visualized graphically using Geographic Information System (GIS) and the preliminary findings suggest that student 
zip codes can help visualize the factors affecting college access at the institution under study. The maps indicated a 
significant difference in the student demographics as represented by zip codes and gave a clear indication of which 
factors should be investigated further.  
          The preliminary research helped us to identify the concentration of students in a particular zip code, form 
clusters, develop relationship between factors and anticipate their effect on college access. It encouraged us to further 
our investigation and analyze different factors which may affect the students’ success in colleges of engineering across 
the country.  Thus, it drove us into the design, development, training, and testing of Feed Forward Neural Network 
with backpropagation for foreseeing student’s success in terms of graduation results. Success will be defined based 
on the Final GPA of a student in Graduation. The network will be trained based on the dataset of recent graduates 
from University and will be tested to predict future outcomes. The network's structure will be optimized, and the 
predictive capability of the model will be tested. 
          This work can encourage partnerships that can drive institutional initiatives, k-12 educational policy, research 
and curricular changes that lead to greater support and success for engineering students. Now, the results from future 
work will give us an algorithm that will foresee the student’s success in graduation.

Abstract 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show a great potential for a wide range of products and applications. Oxidation of CNTs 
through plasma treatment has been shown to produce better dispersion and interfacial bonding. This report describes 
chemical and plasma functionalization of carbon nanotubes where different levels of oxidation were investigated using 
principles of experimental design. Results revealed that the samples reacted differently to the each degree of 
functionalization. In addition to, these studies provide a basis of common practices that have been experimented with 
and in some cases perfected for the treatment carbon nanotubes. The major areas addressed are the chemicals used, 
possible setups, industrial engineering tools and safety concerns all of which being critical considerations to creating 
an effective experiment. Finally, conclusions are drawn based upon the data that was gathered.

Abstract 
Currently autonomous vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors, controls and actuators, depending 
on the objectives and requirements of the vehicle. One of the biggest challenges in the development of the 
autonomous vehicle system for the assistance in the movement of people with visual disabilities is the high 
cost. Therefore, researchers with a limited budget carry out their experiments and research in simulation 
environments, while other researchers use small vehicles that in many cases do not accurately represent a 
real parametric dynamic system. This article describes the design of a low-cost prototype of an autonomous 
electric vehicle that includes its control systems, microcontrollers, encoders, motor controllers, sensors and 
cameras. Therefore, the designed vehicle has the ability to move autonomously through the use of vision 
and artificial intelligence algorithms to assist in the movement of the visually impaired person. The 
document details the first steps of the design taking into account the parameters of a real environment and 
artificial intelligence algorithms.

1. Introduction
Recently, the field of autonomous systems research has grown very fast. Most companies and organizations spend 
a great deal of time and money developing autonomous vehicles for numerous applications. This article describes
the design of a low-cost prototype of an autonomous electric vehicle for the assistance in the movement of people
with visual disabilities using vision algorithms and artificial intelligence that includes its control systems,
microcontrollers, encoders, motor controllers, sensors and cameras These vehicles generally combine a variety of
sensors to identify appropriate navigation routes to avoid obstacles efficiently.
There are five levels of autonomous driving that describe how a car is driven through tasks and responsibilities,
and how the car and driver interact. This project proposes the design of an automation car between levels three
and four. The third level is highly automated driving. It states that the driver can allow the car to be driven only
for long periods of time in certain situations. The fourth level is fully automated driving. It consists of a vehicle
that drives completely independently.
The main application is to navigate a preprogrammed route, avoiding any obstacle that the vehicle may encounter
on its way. The vehicle can complete this task using sensors to recognize its surroundings. The most common
sensors are LIDAR 3D scanning and global positioning systems. In addition, it uses a control system that
integrates all these components to apply the algorithm that processes images and classifies, and an algorithm
based on artificial intelligence.

A2) Pedestrian and Sign Recognition 
For this process, we used a model of object detection called YOLO, than it’s based on a single neural network 
which help us to predict the class of an object than the camera detect. For every class of object presente in the 
COCO (common object in context) dataset the algorithm classified by itself such cars and pedestrian. But, for 
classes than are not in this list, we have to train this neural network to learn how to recognize this new class, like 
a red traffic light, yellow traffic light and green traffic light.

Conclusion 
It is concluded that simulations can represent an almost real environment with obstacles. And also neural networks 
and computer vision can predict and solve a real road driving problem. 
It can be concluded that the mechanical and electrical design takes into account the requirements of a full-size 
vehicle, which demonstrates that using mathematical formulas and deformation simulations we can predict and 
approximate almost exact behavior in a real environment. Finally, the interaction between mechanical design and 
electrical design has allowed us to explore the capabilities acquired to find the most appropriate solution taking 
into account time, price and manufacturing.

cancer and prescribed for radiation therapy is how long they should wait for their radiation sessions to begin. This 
waiting time estimation either remains unclear or is longer than it is originally planned. One of the major attempts for 
radiotherapy cancer centers to improve their quality of services is to try to keep the patient waiting time under control 
and as low as reasonably possible. In this paper, the aim is to understand the magnitude of bottlenecking in the 
fundamental steps of the radiation therapy treatment process in order to simulate a model that can be used further on 
by cancer centers to develop their quality program. The result of this optimal simulation model would be a reduction 
of the delay between the time that the oncology recommends a patient for undergoing radiotherapy and the time that 
patients actually starts the radiation treatment sessions.

1. Introduction
Radiotherapy involves the use of radiation to treat cancer tumors while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. The 
radiation may be delivered in different methods from a source at a distance from the patient’s body in or near the 
tumor. These methods involve several steps before the actual treatment commences. 
Oncology centers aim to immediately treat patients recommended for radiotherapy. However, some patients wait for 
a long time before undergoing treatment. These prolonged waiting times has negative impacts on immediate cure or 
palliation of the disease. An estimated 120 000 people lose their lives to cancer annually in England (The NHS cancer 
plan 2000). Thus, several waiting time standards have been framed by the Joint Council for Clinical Oncology (JCCO) 
and the Department of Health (DH) to reduce further loss of life through the disease (Burke et al. 2011), (Kapamara 
et al. 2007). These standards are difficult to meet because of bottlenecks created by the interactions between the 
patients and human or machine resources in the treatment system. Oncology centers face the challenge of reducing 
these patient waiting times to improve their quality of service. Their aim is to reduce waiting times and maximize 
patient throughput while utilizing their available resources to full capacity. This could be difficult to achieve because 
of disturbances in the system like patients not attending sessions, staff shortages, unavailability of doctors, machine 
breakdowns, and or continual surge in cancer patients. Therefore, a simulation model of the treatment system would 
help to understand the magnitude of bottlenecking in the fundamental steps of the process. The simulation model is 
developed with this respect, and as a first step towards development of radiotherapy patient scheduling algorithms. 
1.1 Objective of Simulation 
Waiting times for radiation therapy (RT) are of a global concern. Emerging evidence indicates that a wait for RT may 
be a threat to patient outcomes, and that waiting times for RT should therefore be as short as reasonably achievable 
(Mackillop 2007), (Chen et al. 2008). In some cases, additional resources are required to reduce waiting times while 
in other cases, process changes or better use of existing resources will be enough. Therefore, waiting times may be

One of the suggestions of this paper is the idea of including the Palliative and Radical priority in the beginning of the 
process, which helps to start the process treatment sooner for the patients who are palliative and close to highest stages 
of cancer. The other result which helped the project in Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis is considering the different 
types of cancer based on population. This gives higher priority to the patients who have the most diagnosed rate in a 
cancer category breakdown like one illustrated by Werker et al. (2009) shown in Figure 6.  
 
As the idea of assigning priority to some patient is brought up by the authors, a big amount of time is spent on reading 
related papers and consulting with specialists to have a reasonable result, which is a positive point that the simulated 
result is close to a real true system as the average time gotten from the Arena process map to discharge a patient is 
almost 73 hours which is almost 9 days if the center works for 8 hours per day. However, by increasing the number 
of resources and availability of the machines, this even can go below one month as resulted in the sensitivity analysis. 
In patient scheduling algorithms, different factors can affect the patient waiting time to receive their radiotherapy 
treatment. The simulated model offered by this paper can be considered as an example model to find the bottlenecks 
of the treatment process in a cancer center to reduce the patient waiting time and get better service quality.

Abstract 
Carbon fiber reinforced polymer is vastly used within many industries due to its superior specific strength and 
stiffness. A material that is being developed to be used in conjunction with or as a replacement of carbon fiber is 
carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs are a multifunctional material which exhibit excellent mechanical, thermal, and 
electrical conductive properties. However, these properties are exemplified at the nanoscale level, and the properties 
begin to decrease as the CNT network increases in scale. The goal is to minimize surface cracks that may occur. 
Therefore, these two materials are tested together and separately to evaluate their performance and validate 
improvement. Functionalization techniques were employed on the CNT network as well as varying the curing 
parameters to improve the properties. Mechanical testing as well as microscopy characterization were performed on 
the resulting composite samples. Results were then analyzed by using statistical tools. After thorough research it was 
found that, by creating a hybrid composite of carbon nanotubes and carbon fiber, the mechanical properties varied 
from an improvement upon the control composite to a decrease in properties depending on the test performed. The 
goal of using this approach is to later be used in larger samples and ultimately in spacecraft and other applications.

Review of Optical Properties of Two-Dimensional Transition 
Metal Dichalcogenides

Abstract 
Two dimensional (2D) materials have become a growing subject in the last 15 years mainly due to 
the success of graphene, which created a completely different class of material based on its unique, single-
layer design. Since then, various stable materials of few atoms thick are showing promising capabilities in 
optical electronics and photonics. One group of material is monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides 
(TMDs) which are of the type MX2, where M is a transition metal (such as Mo, W, and Cr) and is 
sandwiched between two X atoms, which are chalcogen atoms (such as S, Se, or Te). TMDs can show band 
gap transformation from the reduction of bulk material to monolayers in a 2D plane. The behavior of such 
materials at the two-dimensional level has created interest in studying optical capabilities for 2D 
semiconductors. These materials are showing light interaction over a broad bandwidth from far infrared 
(FIR) to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. The materials allow for photodetection in this bandwidth without 
the need for cooling, creating new potential for optoelectronics. Here, we review these TMDs and their 
interaction with light for different applications.

Abstract 
 
When running a medical production facility, proper documentation is crucial with every process. The current system 
is so tedious and inefficient some are opting to ignore regulations completely, leaving Orchid Orthopedic Solutions 
liable in audits. As we cannot change the intricacy of the system itself, we are left to allocate a larger investment of 
resources to the system. With a greater knowledge and training on how to complete change records correctly, more 
specified employees for revising these actions, or a selected representative from each department could benefit 
everyone within the process. To both decrease the risk and increase efficiently, a change must be made.

Background 
 
Orchid Orthopedic Solutions is a global leader for medical device outsourcing services in development and design to 
the manufacturing of finished goods. Worldwide production stands at over 2 million parts a year, with a small 
percentage coming from Chelsea MI, USA. Our customer return rate is low, and the audit findings from the suppliers 
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remains low. Production depends heavily on accuracy and efficiency 
in usage of materials. Without this operation efficiency, profit margins greatly decrease and some operations may 
prove to no longer be financially viable. All optimization stands to increase productivity and profit margins. 
 
Orchid currently outputs over 100,000 parts per month. Within our Chelsea Michigan facility we produce only plastic 
products through injection molding, milling, and lathe machining. Each part is produced within the clean room 
requirements of the customer, along with the FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (FDA CFR 21) standards. 
Furthermore, parts are also inspected to a predetermined ratio dependent on batch size using statistical reasoning. The 
parts endure a cleaning and trimming process as instructed before moving to packaging. Each of these steps are 
meticulously documented for accountability and accuracy. Any lapse in this documentation could leave Orchid liable 
in the event of audits by the customer or the FDA. With that in mind, the documentation is vast, complex, but integral 
to the accurate completion of production. The last thing we would want to compromise as a medical device production 
company is quality and if we lose sight of that the entire operation could crumble from a preventable mishap. While 
striving for continuous improvements, we not only improve quality for our consumers but cost effectiveness for 
ourselves.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

their trainers. As a whole this would be an investment for further improvement within our plant’s documentation 
practices promoting efficiency and accuracy.  
 
The potential money made comes from the time saved by everyone involved in the approval process to be productive 
elsewhere. Not to mention the ease of flow of the workplace module, meaning less interpersonal conflicts. The 
potential outcome would be an increase in accuracy and education as a whole, which would further save time from 
product rework and audits. The investment proves effective in time saving and accuracy efforts. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The current process is frustrating and inhibits possible progress within other fields at Orchid Orthopedic 
Solutions. The general dreading to complete paperwork with inadequate knowledge often leads to 
inefficiency and attempted efforts to avoid it entirely, which is against production regulations. If the 
investment for the aforementioned approaches were made now, we could get in front of this issue before it 
causes a real issue with a customer or the FDA. However tedious or costly, this change would positively 
impact the work environment for the future.

Abstract 
This research study investigates access control problem in complex Internet of Things networks. The 
primary objective is to implement an efficient, flexible and scalable access control method that is suitable 
for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices from unauthorized or malicious access. The research finding 
draws conclusion based on an evaluation method that takes IoT requirements into consideration to 
recommend  the most appropriate access control method.  Access control method investigated are 
Capability-based Access Control, Role-based Access Control, Policy-based access control and Attribute-
based access control. Internet of things are characterized by power constrained devices, lightweight 
communication protocol, dynamic behavior, heterogeneity, enormous scale, intelligence and low latency 
connectivity and hence demand a different security approach than the traditional computing devices. Access 
control for the IoTs therefore requires a decentralized, secure and light-weight service and management 
architecture to solve the issue present in the client-server architecture and meet the growing scale of IoTs. 
The limitations of the client-server model are single point of failure, scalability issues, management and 
performance bottlenecks A secure service and management model based on features of and an enhanced 
blockchain technology is adopted in this research study. Each case of the access control approach is 
modeled using access control matrix. An access control matrix represents a two-dimensional matrix 
structure where subjects (users) are related to objects (resources) with their corresponding access rights. A 
prototype of each of the access control method is implemented on ethereum blockchain platform using 
devices of varying memory and computational power such as raspberry, sensors and laptops to represent 
an actual IoT scenario. The prototype uses smart contracts which is a code, token or business logic that run 
on the blockchain to automatically enforce access control when according to predefined agreements. 
Evaluation of results is based on requirements of Internet of Things such as security and privacy, 
decentralization, manageability, resource efficiency and scalability.

Abstract 
Freight transport is a recognized generator of disproportionate negative externalities: pollutant and 
greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, noise, road safety issues, and others. The massive emissions 
due to transportation are especially problematic; studies alert that continuing with the current behavior will 
increase emissions by approximately 30% compared to 1990 levels in the next thirty years, generating 
significant consequences for the climate and the lives at least in U.S. (U.S. Department of Energy & Office 
of Scientific and Technical Information, 2013). According to the world’s leading scientists, we must 
radically shift our carbon-based economy by 2030 (United Nations, 2015). The world must reduce 
emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 to stop warming at 1.5C. Otherwise, 
conditions will significantly worsen on earth for a significant part of the population. To mitigate these 
impacts, transportation and environmental agencies in the U.S. have developed several guidelines, plans, 
and regulations. These include fuel taxes to discourage combustion engine vehicles, strict fuel efficiency 
standards, financial incentives to replace old truck fleets, and others measures. More recently, states in the 
U.S. have released plans to encourage the use of zero and near-zero emission vehicles. If effective, these 
initiatives will generate much needed benefits for sustainability. However, considering the cost and 
technical features of this vehicles the immediate impacts to businesses and fleets are not necessarily 
understood. To fill this gap, this research aims to evaluate the direct economic impacts of environmental 
policies on logistics practices (i.e., inventory replenishment and fleet purchase decisions). The study 
considers two policies seeking to improve the environmental efficiency of transport operations. The first 
limits the amount of transportation operation emissions, while the second demand a fleet mix to include 
zero and near-zero emission vehicles. To analyze these policies, the researchers propose the use of an 
extension of the Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP). This extension deals with two objectives; minimizing 
cost and minimizing emissions due to transport operation when replenishing inventory, while faces a 
stochastic demand and limited capacities. To solve the mathematical problem the authors propose a multi-
step heuristic based on evolutionary and greedy search algorithms. From the companies’ perspective, this 
model is a useful tool to determine both inventory policies and fleet composition in a cost-efficient way 
when the level of emissions produced by vehicles is limited by regulatory policies. On the other hand, from 
the transportation planner’s perspective, this model allows to determinate more accurate the financial need 
of the companies when facing regulatory policies, then the planners could design more adequate programs 
to support the replacement of internal combustion vehicles. Preliminary results evidence the trade-off 
between capital investments in zero-emission vehicles and logistics costs to abide by the potential 
requirements. The output of empirical cases shows that the ratio cost/emission reduction is not linear, 
meaning that investing a large amount of money in fleet replacement does not necessarily reduce effectively

Introduction
Building construction work activities must perform efficiency in order to obtain the lowest cost. In the activities of 
building construction in Surabaya, East Java, the number of changes in the type of work due to adjustments between 
plans and reality carried out caused the cost performance to be low. Change activities must always provide economic

Literature Review
Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) 
Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) is a concept to know that if the company uses its resources, 
then the company must first understand the activities that occur within the company, the activities that consume 
resources through the identification of cost drivers or cost drivers. Activity Based Management Change Order 
(ABMCO) is an integrated and comprehensive approach that keeps the attention of management centered on the 
activities undertaken with the aim of increasing the value of the customer and the profits earned by giving that value, 
that the Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) model has two dimensions, namely the cost dimension 
and process dimension.

Conclusions And Suggestions 
4.1. Conclusion 
Relationship Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) with Efficiency 
Based on the results of the study, it is noted that Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) has a 
significant effect on efficiency. This can be seen from the t-statistic value of 2,802 which means greater than 1.96, 
which means that the more strategic use of Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) will be able to 
improve project efficiency. In other words, Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) operationally can 
improve operating efficiency and asset usage rate and lower cost. The focus is to do things right and do more activity. 
The significant effect of Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) on efficiency shows that efficiency 
improvement can be made with good Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) implementation. With 
Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO), a company can evaluate the cost and value of a processing 
activity so that there will be improved competitive position and increased process efficiency.  
Relationship Economic Value Added (EVA) with Efficiency, Based on the results of the study, it is noted that 
Economic Value Added (EVA) has a significant effect on efficiency.  The significant effect of Economic Value Added 
(EVA) on efficiency shows that efficiency improvement can be made with good EVA. The result of the analysis 
indicates that the variable of Economic Value Added (EVA) has a positive influence on project efficiency. This means 
that project efficiency can be established through good Economic Value Added (EVA). Based on the description 
above, it can be concluded that the first hypothesis reads ""Economic Value Added (EVA) effect on the efficiency of 
building construction projects"" otherwise accepted. 
Relationship Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) with Project Performance, Based on the results 
of the study, it is noted that ABMCO has no significant effect on project performance. Based on the above description, 
it can be concluded that the first hypothesis reads ""Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) affect the 
performance of building construction projects"" otherwise not accepted. 
Relationship Efficiency with Project Performance, The positive direction of efficiency to project performance 
indicates that there is a unidirectional relationship which means increasing productivity will be able to improve project 
performance.  
Relationship Economic Value Added (EVA) Relationship with Project Performance, The significant effect of 
Economic Value Added (EVA) on performance shows that performance improvement can be made with good 
Economic Value Added (EVA). The result of the analysis indicates that the variable of Economic Value Added (EVA) 
has a positive influence on project performance. This means that project performance can be established through sound

Abstract 
Subak as Bali traditional organization functions mainly in the distribution of irrigation water in paddy fields, have to 
reorganize the system of irrigation in rice fields (paddy). Distribution of irrigation water in paddy fields in Bali 
subak be reorganized back in tune with the amount of irrigation water decreased, without having implications for the 
reduction of rice production per unit area. Thus the traditional irrigation system in subak need to be reconstructed 
and adjusted for the increasingly limited availability of water, by applying a model of renewable in the irrigation 
system, but the optimum production and to avoid conflicts over water among farmers. In this context there is an 
interesting problem to be studied, as formulated in the following research questions. Reasons and motives related 
that provide the impetus for some of subak in Bali to conserve water resources. The approach used in this study is a 
qualitative research, with respect to the research, the emphasis is not on measurement but on a descriptive analysis 
of the viscous. The study was conducted in Subak Gunungsari, Jatiluwih village, and Subak Wangaya Betan, 
Mengesta village, Tabanan, Bali Province. Chosen Subak Gunungsari and Subak Wangaya Betan as a test site, not in 
spite of the uniqueness has happened to conserve water. There are several reasons why farmers of Subak Gunungsari 
and Subak Wangaya Betan, conserve water resources, among others (1) Water is an important factor in rice 
cultivation, without water it will not happen a life, no live no water so water is an essential component that must 
exist in a life. Similarly, in the agricultural sector can not be separated from the use of water to produce agricultural 
products, especially in rice cultivation. (2) Preservation of subak depends on the presence of water, because water is 
a material object that is managed by subak. Without water, the water control system does not exist, and without 
subak the system of rice fields in Bali as the rice will not be able to run optimally. (3) the longer the presence of 
water and declining water resources. (4) there is competition in water use between the domestic sector, tourism, 
animal husbandry, and agriculture it self.

Introduction 
At this time there is a tendency preservation Subak declining, this is caused by several factors, including a very low 
interest of young people to work in the agricultural sector, the narrowing of the rice acreage due to land use change, 
the modernization and technological change fairly high hit many aspects of community life, as well as decreasing 
the quantity and quality of irrigation water. If these problems are not addressed, Bali is not only a possibility to lose 
one's unique culture, but also will have a wide impact on the environment on the island of Bali (Surata, 1999; 
Lansing et al., 2001). 
The same thing also expressed by Sedana (1999) that the quantity and quality of irrigation water is currently 
decreasing. At first farmers subak members never questioned the state of irrigation water because the numbers are 
still abundant, and its use is not so complex. However, along with the development of both rural and urban areas, the 
need for water is increasing and then the water is initially almost used only for agricultural purposes, is now being 
utilized for non-agricultural purposes. These conditions resulted in farmers feel the low quality of irrigation water 
due to industrial waste disposal that could no longer be tolerated, and the amount of irrigation water they get from 
the river became less and less for farming purposes. 
In connection with this, Subak as Bali's traditional organization functions mainly in the distribution of irrigation 
water, which has long made important paddy crop cultivation in paddy fields, had to reorganize the system of

From the expression above interviewee can understand that water should not be monopolized by the agricultural 
sector. Division of water to be evenly, all must receive water distribution, water is needed by all sectors of life, 
without water, life will not be rolling. Amid the limitations of water then the only way to be taken is to implement 
efficiencies in the use of water for optimal results. 
Concerned with the problems mentioned above, the water originally conceived as something that res nullius (no one 
has), it means that if an object that has never been owned by someone (or other legal subjects), can then owned by 
people who have managed to master it so that no No more other parties who perform resistance to such 
authorization, while the right to water is a form of water that was born in relation to human rights. Explicitly indeed 
there are only two major human rights conventions which mentions the existence of the right to water as part of 
human rights. Making it clear that the right to water is an effort to determine who has and does not have water. It is 
important for investors to insure their investment. So not surprisingly, there is a presumption that the Law No. 
7/2004 on water resources is the first step of the privatization of water resources in Indonesia (Santoso, 2005). 
Law No. 7/2004 on water resources is the first step of the privatization of water in Indonesia, this is because the law 
is based on the perspective, looking at water as an economic good that is evident with the implementation of the 
right to water. Water rights are based on the concept of water right (which is very different from the concept of the 
right to water). Water rights refers to the concept of property rights (ownership) gives the freedom and authority to 
the person who has been deemed legally have water. 
When the fierce competition between the domestic sector, tourism, agriculture and animal husbandry has not 
occurred in the use of water, water control system is able to distribute irrigation water very well to all members of 
Subak in accordance with their needs and perhaps even excessive because of the availability of irrigation water in 
abundance. But it is now almost unheard of in most of Subak in Bali, as a result of intense competition between the 
various sectors as well as the presence of deforestisasi which tend to reduce water resources. If it is not managed 
properly, the wider impact threatens the sustainability of agricultural systems, especially paddy farming on 
ecosystems Subak in Bali. One of the efforts made by farmers to overcome this is to conserve the use of irrigation 
water in order to produce optimal results. As such it is one of the reasons why farmers conserve water resources. 
In addition to the efforts made by farmers in managing irrigation water in order to continue kebermanfaatannya the 
Law of water use not only refer to Law No. 7/2004, but should refer to the 1945 Constitution. Where the water is a 
human right protected by the 1945 Constitution and used to meet the lives of many people. Because it must be 
guaranteed access to water for the sake of people's welfare state is not only merchandise. 
 
Conclusions 
The conclusions of this study are as follows. There are several reasons why farmers Subak Gunungsari and Subak 
Wangaya Betan, to preserve water resources, among others, (1) water is an important factor in rice cultivation, (2) 
the preservation of water control system depends on the presence of water, because water is a material object 
managed by subak, (3) the longer the presence of water and declining water resources, (4) there is competition in the 
use of water between the domestic sector, tourism, livestock, and agriculture itself.

Abstract 
Subak constitutes a traditional irrigation system in Bali which has a nature of socio-agrarian-religious based on the 
culture and Hindu religion in Bali. Farming culture in the subak system is one of the cultures supporting the 
development of cultural tourism in Bali. Since 2012, UNESCO has recognized the existence of subak as the world 
cultural heritage. The economic growth of development often results in impacts that are less favorable for 
agricultural development, such as conversion of rice fields. The government of Denpasar city has introduced 
ecotourism within subak. The objectives of this study are to: (i) find out the problems encountered by subak related 
to ecotourism; and (ii) describe the extension techniques that are carried out for the development of ecotourism 
within Subak of Sembung. This subak was selected by purposive sampling.  is in Subak of Sembung, Peguyangan 
Village. Key respondents were selected to get data needed. Data collected by using interview, survey, observation 
and documentation. Descriptive method was employed to analyzed data. The study pointed out that there are some 
problems encountered by subak in the development of ecotourism, such as the aspects of production, tourism 
education, and business management. Therefore, it is needed the empowerment of subak to overcome the problems 
faced. The increase of crop production (corn, chili, eggplant, long beans, vegetables, cucumbers and also papaya) is 
carried out through direct extension and training activities in their rice fields. Improvement of tourism education is 
also done through the extension activities for the subak members and management board of traditional village and 
the ecotourism managers, especially those concerning sapta pesona (seven of charm). Strengthening of farmers’ 
capacity on business management is conducted through the extension training about post-harvest, such as 
processing, packaging, and marketing. It could be suggested to the subak and managers of ecotourism and 
traditional villages to have better synergy of their activities to ensure the sustainability of the development of 
ecotourism of Subak of Sembung. Government should support ecotourism activities through the promotion of the 
existence ecotourism within subak.

Introduction 
Subak is a traditional irrigation system in Bali and is often identified with water users’ organization in the fields on 
irrigation and agriculture. This has a nature of socio-agrarian-religious based on the culture and Hindu religion in 
Bali [1; 2; 3]. Farming culture in the subak system is one of the cultures supporting the development of cultural 
tourism in Bali. Since 2012, UNESCO has recognized the existence of subak as the world cultural heritage.  
The development of the agricultural sector in Denpasar City, Bali Province still has a significant role in various 
aspects, such as economy, culture and environment. This condition is in line with the role of the agricultural sector, 
especially in rice fields in developing countries [4]. Some important roles of the agricultural sector are providing 
food, providing opportunities for business opportunities, producing raw materials needed by industry, consuming 
industrial products, and contributing foreign exchange to the State. 
The fast growth of economic development in the urban areas often results in impacts that are less favorable for 
agricultural development. One of the impacts is the conversion of rice fields intended for infrastructure

Tourism Service should develop an integrated and synergized program to be able to develop ecotourism in Subak of 
Sembung. 
Individual extension, Individual extension is carried out directly to farmers to provide a more complete 
understanding of agricultural cultivation technologies, such as the benefits of seeds, seeds, fertilizers and pest and 
disease control, post-harvest and sapta pesona (seven charms). Individual extension to farmers is directly carried out 
on farmer's land in order that he could understand and employ the innovation provided. This individual extension 
was more emphasis on the purpose of adoption and implementation of innovation directly to solve the problem and 
develop the capacity of farmers. This approach is often known as learning by doing, where farmers implement 
technology while learning together with extension workers. In this study, the cultivation technique that was 
disseminated was land tillage, spacing, pest and disease control, fertilization for several types of plants, such as corn, 
cucumber, long bean, chili, eggplant, and post harvest. 
 
Conclusions  
Tourism development in Bali is very much based on agricultural culture of subak system. The agricultural sector in 
Denpasar City has a significant role in economic, cultural and environmental development. Rapid development in 
the city area led to the conversion of rice fields. One of the efforts made to control the conversion of rice fields is the 
development of ecotourism in Subak of Sembung. 
In the development of ecotourism within Subak of Sembung, there are still problems encountered by subak, such as 
the aspects of production, tourism education, and business management. Therefore, it is needed the empowerment of 
subak to overcome the problems faced. Increasing the production of non-rice crops is an important factor to be 
offered to visitors in the ecotourism area within Subak of Sembung. The kinds of crops planted by farmers are corn, 
chili, eggplant, long beans, vegetables, cucumbers and also papaya. The increase of crop production is carried out 
through direct extension and training activities for farmers in their rice fields. Tourism education is also conducted 
through the extension activities for the subak members together with the management board of traditional village 
and the ecotourism managers, especially those concerning sapta pesona (seven of charm). Capacity building of 
farmers in business management is done through the extension training about post-harvest, such as processing, 
packaging, and marketing of plant products to visitors and other communities. 
It could be suggested to the subak and managers of ecotourism and traditional villages to further enhance the 
synergy of their activities to ensure the sustainability of the development of ecotourism of Subak of Sembung. The 
role of the government as a facilitator and regulator is also needed to support ecotourism activities and at the same 
time to promote the existence ecotourism of Subak of Sembung.

Abstract 
Intermarriage as one of the realm of Civil International Law has choices of law in the settlement of disputes. As an 
example of a case in the summary this thesis, there is a dispute of inheritance in the form of a business asset placed 
on behalf of the wife (the mother of the heirs). The marriage was performed in Indonesia and Australia with Islamic 
Law and the marriage has been registered in Indonesia, this marriage also has had three sons who have different 
citizenship. There are several options to resolve the dispute legal heirs such as this, i.e. according to The Book of The 
Law of Civil Law, Australia Inheritance Law, or based on Compilation of Islamic Law. Legal issues in this study are: 
(1) How the child’s inheritance settings in a internarriage over the business assets are put under the name (the name
of) wife. (2) What is the applicable law of the resolution of disputes the fulfillment of children’s inheritance in a
intermarriage against a business asset that is placed under the name of the wife. After the qualification against the
above inheritance disputes based on legal facts which  connecting factors, then the judge could determine that the
Compilation of Islamic Law is the right law to use. Legitimate marriage done according to Islamic law, then the
Islamic law also applies to things of the legal consequences of marriage such as inheritance disputes. This research
uses the normative research methods by researching existing library materials such as legislation, books relating to
law, as well as a dictionary or encyclopedia.

Introduction
Intermarriage is a social bond which involed agents who are obedient to the divergent law. Inheritance is one of forms 
as a cosequence of marriage law, and it includes in intermarriage. To decide a lawsuit includes in Civil International 
Law or Non-Civil International Law, the judge has to do lawsuit qualification. Therefore in qualified law, someone 
divides a law issue or a law relation what the lawsuit face, according to a known category in certain law system. When 
a lawsuit has qualified as issue in Civil International Law, it is countinued to dicide which a judgement will be used 
to solve the issue. (Hardjowahono, 2013) 
As one of intermarriage example, It was conducted by Mrs. Julaikah Noor Aini namely Nur Ellis (Indonesis citizen) 
and Mr. Robbert Kevin Ellis (Foreign named Australia citizen). The first marriage was performed in Jakarta with 
Islamic Law. The similar marriage was also performed in Auustralia, when they came back to Indonesia. This marriage 
was registered in Indonesia. From this marriage, Mrs Nur and Mr. Robbert Ellis had 3 sons who had both Indonesia 
citizenship and Australia citizenship. This intermarriage was not running well, because Mrs. Nur was proved of killing 
her husband. This issue caused the other laws likes an inheritance issue because this marriage had ended, but the wife

law the sibling in this issues who are foreigners will not loss an economics right toward the property which they get 
as the inheritance wealth. 
 
 
 
4. 
Conclusion 
 
In Intermarriage, spouse and children are as the absolute heirs admitted legally both in Indonesia (Islamic Law, 
CustomaryLaw, and Civil Law of BW) and in Australia. But, the law is valid in order to distribution  the inheritance 
law which must be based on the judge decision in order to reach justice and legal security as the purpose of law. If 
there is a lawsuit about the inheritance law, the mediation can use the law where the inheritance wealth take place. 
According to the example above, related with the child’s inheritance lawsuit in intermarriage which use Islamic Law 
caused the marriage was done by Ms. Nur and spouse in Islamic law and has been written in Indonesia, and also the 
business assets being the inheritance which located in Bali, Indonesia. Ms. Nur who is the heirs’ mother has made a 
punitive measure and punishable along with getting strength of a constant law. So, Ms. Nur has lost her inheritance 
right, she has lost to be the heirs. The judge can use KHI in mediation of the inheritance, it is seen from the law facts 
which show to use National Law to solve it.

Abstract 
To improve the understanding and programming of PLC Unesa Electrical Engineering Education students, learning 
media are needed in the form of modules and trainers that discuss PLC about basic instructions, ladder diagram 
programs and DC motor control with PLC control. The use of DC motors is very common, one of the advantages of 
DC motors is that they are relatively easy to obtain and are easily regulated to rotate speed. The method used is the 
development of the four D model. The development process that is used only reaches the 3rd D stage, namely the 
development stage or develop from 4 stages namely define, design, develop, and disseminate. The subjects of this 
study were Electrical Engineering Education students at Surabaya State University who programed PLC courses. The 
modules that have been made are then validated by PLC experts, instructional media experts and linguists. Learning 
media in the form of modules and trainers are implemented to Electrical Engineering Unesa students to improve PLC 
programming skills. The module quality results obtained an average total value of 89.95% which means it can be 
categorized as very valid. For the results of student responses obtained an average total of 78.44% with a good category 
which means the learning module can be used as a reference for PLC courses.

Introduction
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is a compulsory subject for S1 Electrical Engineering Education study program 
students. One of the goals of Unesa Electrical Engineering Education is to produce competent teachers in the field of 
electrical engineering [1]. Among them as subject teachers on instrumentation expertise and process automation 
competencies. PLC learning requires the active role of students. The low ability of students' thinking is due to the fact 
that PLC learning has tended to only sharpen aspects of remembering and understanding. Then we need an alternative 
method that is able to develop programming skills in learning PLC [2]. One of them is through practicum or 
demonstration activities, because practicum or demonstration activities help students to understand an event, see an 
event in more detail than before and after that remember the event. 
In order to improve the understanding and programming of PLC Unesa Electrical Engineering Education students, it 
is necessary to have learning media in the form of modules and trainers that discuss PLC about basic instructions, 
ladder diagram programs and DC motor control with PLC control.

Abstract 
The internet is growing so rapidly and continues to innovate in creating new breakthroughs. Over time, a media is 
required to be able to display information concisely and is needed in the presentation of information that is effective 
and efficient. Information on the results of the Alphabet Incubator (AI) activity report can now be easily accessed 
using the Official Site. However, beforehand the presentation of information in the form of a conventional table, so it 
is not efficient with current technological developments. Google Spreadsheet is a sheet-making facility that can be 
used to summarize data in the form of tables and columns, provided by the Google platform that can easily be used 
for free on Google Drive. By making observations in the form of data collection, by making a direct observation of an 
existing problem, it is considered less effective and efficient in managing a report of activities carried out 
conventionally that go through several complicated processes and tend to require a long time so it is very ineffective. 
There needs to be a system renewal from conventional to online so that the presence of online tables aims to improve 
effective and efficient workers in managing data collection and activities that were previously done conventionally in 
the Alphabet Incubator (AI).

1. Introduction
Fast and precise information is needed to support life activities. The process of delivering information from time to 
time is always changing, giving a big influence to the recipients of information [1]. The system and model used will 
also determine how well and effectively the process of delivering information is running [2]. At present, information 
is no longer absorbed only by relying on conventional and old-fashioned tools, thus the role of computers is very 
crucial to provide solutions to problem solving. In addition, computers are also very reliable tools to develop a system 
that is still lagging behind the age [3]. 
Effective services will improve the process of business Incubator activities, and can improve the management system 
of activities that are being implemented [4]. At this moment, every existing Business Incubator is required to compete 
globally. One key to the success of global competition lies in how efficient and fast service can be provided by the 
Business Incubator [5]. 
Alphabet Incubator (AI) is a Research Center that acts as an enterprise that has an ecosystem to successfully create a 
corporate creativepreneur startup. Alphabet Incubator (AI) plays a role in helping the success of government programs, 
along with the development of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 contained in RIRN, and increasing campus 
competitiveness as incubators facing the challenges of the Disruption Era like Business Incubators that have flourished 
among the public [6]. 
The Alphabet Incubator (AI) website generally provides information and documentation of activities around the 
incubator business. So that the data collection process that runs on the Alphabet Incubator (AI) is currently still done 
conventionally. This conventional process is considered to be less effective and efficient because the process requires 
a lot of time [7]. According to Untung Rahardja [2014] (7) The Google platform has many free facilities that can be 
utilized. Therefore the concept was created to make the data collection system for this activity online, by using Google 
Spreadsheets so that it can be accessed and can be followed by incubator businesses located throughout Indonesia. It 
is better for us to take advantage of technological sophistication to facilitate all Indonesian incubator businesses to

Schedule and Activity Report display can provide information that is easier and more efficient to find out 
activities that often occur in the Alphabet Incubator. 
2. 
Schedule and Activity Report display can provide data online.  
3. 
With the appearance of the Schedule and Activity Report the presentation of the vacancies that occur in the 
Alphabet Incubator can be anticipated.

Accident and injury statistics at the secretary of the construction sector are the highest compared to other sectors every 
year. Accidents in the work environment are a loss for the company. In development, Indonesia is a developing country 
that has a high mortality rate according to the International Labor Organization (ILO). This is due to the large number 
of workers in the project who need good occupational safety and health (OSH) management. With a good occupational 
health and safety management system, at least it will prevent or reduce the risk of workplace accidents. Minister of 
Public Works Regulation Number: 05 / PRT / M / 2014 concerning Guidelines for Safety Management and 
Construction Systems in the Field of Public Works. Mentioning the implementation of Safety Management and 
Construction Systems work in the field of Public Works must apply in the Public Works Sector. For example, every 
implementation of field construction work. There are 2 objectives in this study. the first goal is to obtain details of 
occupational safety and health (OSH) activities  for construction projects which include roads, bridges, drainage and 
buildings. and the second objective is to compare the costs of implementing occupational safety and health (OSH) in 
construction projects (roads, bridges, and drainage). The benefits of applying occupational safety and health (OSH) 
can improve the effectiveness of safety and planned, measurable, structured and integrated health protection, can 
prevent and reduce accidents in the workplace and work-related diseases, can create a safe, comfortable and efficient 
workplace for encourage productivity. The method used in this study is: literature study, conducting research and 
analysis and discussion using descriptive analysis methods. The research subject in this study is the Cost Budget Data 
Plan for several projects, namely building, road, bridge and drainage projects. Details of the implementation of

Introduction
Construction work is a combination of various kinds of scientific disciplines, both in terms of technical construction 
and in terms of non-technical aspects and includes the element of human resources (Marleno, Surjokusumo, Oetomo, 
&Ikhsan, 2018). In construction work it always concerns the implementation of construction work and the community 
organizing the construction work itself. Where the implementation of this construction work must meet the provisions 
concerning engineering, occupational safety and health (OSH), labor protection, and local environmental management 
to ensure the realization of orderly implementation of construction work. Regarding the potential risk of workplace 
accidents in carrying out construction work, the current knowledge of occupational safety and health (OSH) on a 
construction project has become a basic requirement. The occupational safety and health (OSH) aspect will not work

In Indonesia, the number of exclusive breastfeeding to the babies under age of 6 month in year 2016 was about 54,0% 
at Lampung Province and different with the babies under the age of 5 month was only 43,1%. One of the way to 
increase the production of milk from the mother was by doing Early Breastfeeding Initiation (IMD). The result of 
monitoring nutritional status (PSG) in year 2016, at Lampung Province there were about 48,5% babies exposed with 
early breastfeeding initiation, and it was under the average of national number. The quality of early breastfeeding 
initiation in Indonesia was low because from the achieving number of 51.9%, consist of 42.7% getting early 
breastfeeding initiation after an hour from baby’s delivering, and about 9.2% in an hour or more after the birth. The 
goal of the study is to find out the relationship between the using of turtle blanket to the baby’s behaviour of early 
breastfeeding initiation. This study is an experiment with True Experiment type and Post Test Group design. The 
population come from all normal babies borned by vaginal way out with 60 sample that divided into 2 groups, they 
are intervention group and control group. Bivariate analysis is using T Test independent test,  and multi variant test 
with Cohen’s Effect Size. The result of the study shows there is significant influence by the using of turtle blanket to 
baby’s behavior in it rest stadium with p-value is about 0.003, the time spent by baby’s moving to the mother’s breast 
with p-value about 0.004 early breastfeeding initiation, spending time for baby in getting mother’s nipple with p-value 
of 0.003, the length of the first baby’s breastfeed with p-value of 0.000. Meanwhile, the un-significant behavior come 
when the baby produce saliva with p-value 0.052. Effect size test of baby’s behavior that very related is the spending 
time by doing it first breastfeed with index of effect size for about 1.18 categorized in high standard. The suggestion 
come from the result of the study is, the health provider should socialize for using turtle blanket, especially for the 
newborn baby in their IMD time.

1. Introduction
Infant mortality is one sensitive indicator to know the health status of a country even to measure the progress of a 
nation. The high mortality of infants at the age of up to one year shows the quality of the health sector in the country 
is still low. The results of the 2015 Inter census Population Survey (SUPAS) showed that the Infant Mortality Rate in 
Indonesia was 22.23 per 1,000 live births, (MOH). The number of neonatal deaths in Lampung province in 2015 was 
646 neonatal (4.14%) from 156,208 living births, and in the southern Lampung regency there were 58 neonatal deaths 
in 2015 (Din- Kes -Lampung Province).  
Infant mortality can be reduced by providing breast milk (ASI). Breast milk plays an important role in creating a 
healthy baby. One effort to increase the successful of breastfeeding is through the implementation of Early 
Breastfeeding Initiations. IMD is an opportunity given to the baby, immediately after birth by placing the baby in the 
mother's stomach, then allowing the baby to find the mother's nipple and suckle until it satisfied. This process is carried 
out at least in the first 60 minutes (1 hour) after the baby was born (MOH, 2009). The implementation of IMD can 
save about 22% of infants who die before the age of 1 month. To achieve this goal, one of the actions taken by the 
government is by promoting the IMD, this effort is carried out to support the successful of the Exclusive Breastfeeding 
program (Roesli, 2008).

The motion of a baby crawling over his mother's body is the most natural motion a baby can do after birth, this 
movement provides many benefits for the mother, which will stimulate the release of the oxytocin hormone which 
will stimulate uterine contractions that help and promote placental release and reduce uterine bleeding . (Aritonang 
and Priharsiwi, 2006). In line with the research results of Kolifah at all (2013) The Correlation between Early 
Breasfeeding Inititation and Process of Exitation Placenta. The results of the study found that most (81.8%) 
respondents experienced fluency in the removal of the placenta.  Almost all (68.2%) respondents managed to do IMD, 
the statistical test results ρ ≤ 0.05, with the results of 0.039 <0.05. The results showed that the use of turtle blanket 
caused the baby acyive to move and find out the mother's breast. The activeness of the baby's body movements also 
provides many benefits for the mother, including accelerating the stimulation to release oxytocin hormone, oxytocin 
will stimulate uterine contractions so it helps to encourage the rapid process of removing the placenta. With rapid 
placenta realease will reduce the amount of bleeding in the third period of labor. 
The effect of using turtle blanket on infant behavior when finding / sucking the mother's nipples during IMD 
implementation 
When the baby sucks ASI, it stimulate  the posterior pituitary so the oxytocin can be released, which it serves to 
increase contraction of smooth muscle around the alveoli glands so ASI can be removed directly. Oxytocin will also 
stimulate the uterine muscles to accelerate uterine involution (Manuaba, 2010). The same opinion expressed by 
Winberg (2005) which states that this skin contact, through sensory stimuli such as touch, warmth, and smell, can be 
strong vagal stimulation. This stimulation has one effect, which is the release of maternal oxytocin. The results of the 
study using turtle blanket can accelerate the process of adjusting the baby's environment outside the uterus, the more 
stable of baby's body temperature the more active the baby will move, with the baby moving actively the baby will 
find / suck the mother's breast. When the baby suck, it stimulate the posterior pituitary so that oxytocin can be released, 
octosin will stimulate the uterine muscle so as to accelerate the process of uterine involution. 
The effect of the using turtle blanket on infant behavior of their first suckling duration during the implementation of 
the IMD 
Early breastfeeding can control the condition of prolactin hormone levels do not have time to go down in the mother’s 
blood circulation, so colostrum for the first day will come out faster. The absence of stimulation in the nipple means 
allowing the levels of prolactin and oxytocin to drop slowly in the bloodstream, causing the milk come out slightly 
and stop before the baby is 6 months old. The more often the baby is breastfeeding, the more milk is removed (Sucked) 
this will make more milk in production (Purwanti 2004). The same study by Rahayu RD et al. 2012 entitled The 
Success of Early Breastfeeding Initiation (IMD) and Duration of Breastfeeding. The results of statistical tests using 
chi-square with a 2x2 contingency test obtained the value of P = 0.008 which means that the value is below 0.05 where 
it indicates that there is a significant difference between the success of Early Breastfeeding Initiation to the Length of 
Breastfeeding. The results were obtained when IMD is using baby turtle blanket. The baby felt more comfortable and 
calm in his mother's arms. the more comfortable the baby is in the arms of his mother the baby will be more active 
and the length of time for breastfeeding, with the active breastfeeding baby and when the baby sucks the nipple 
stimulation will occur to the posterior pituitary which can stimulate oxytocin releasing. Oxytocin function is to 
increase contraction of smooth muscle around the alveoli of the breast gland, so that the process of removing colostrum 
can be released more quickly. 
 
4. Conclusion 
There is a significant difference on the duration of the rest / quite alert stage between infants using turtle blankets and 
babies who only use contemporary blankets with p value 0.003 during IMD implementation. 
There is no significant when the baby is sounding its voice, between babies using turtle blankets and babies using 
contemporary blankets with p. value 0.077 at the time of the IMD implementation. 
There is no significant when the baby stars drooling, between Babies using the turtle blanket and babies using 
contemporary blankets with p-value 0.052 at the time of IMD implementation 
Here is a significant difference for the time when the baby begin to move towards the breast / areola between infants 
using turtle blankets and babies using contemporary blankets with p-value 0.004 at IMD 
There was a significant difference when the baby found / suck the mother's nipples between babies using turtle blanket 
and babies using contemporary blankets with p-value 0.003 at the time of IMD implementation. 
There is a significant difference on the baby first breastfeeding duration between infants using turtle blankets and 
babies using contemporary blankets with p-value 0,000 at the time of IMD implementation.

Abstract 
In the discipline of Systems Engineering there has been a major advancement in the industry to transition 
from the traditional systems engineering to a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). MBSE is a 
model-based approach that uses SysML to characterize and define systems in terms of models. MBSE aims 
to model: system requirements, architecture and design, ConOps diagrams, activity diagrams, different 
types of analyses, verification and validation, and other systems engineering related models. The use of 
MBSE software allow us to create these models in once central location to manage complexity and provide 
traceability across the different models. 
To better demonstrate MBSE, a MBSE software called Cameo Systems Modeler by NoMagic was utilized 
to model a weather monitoring CubeSat. Cameo Systems Modeler was used to model the CubeSat domain 
architecture, the system architecture, use case diagrams, activity diagrams, requirements verification 
matrix, and more. The cohesive model provided traceability across the different models, from the 
requirements all the way to the architecture. Overall, the use of MBSE provided an innovative and efficient 
approach to modeling all the different pieces of the CubeSat. As the need for MBSE tools increase, their 
capabilities will also increase, paving a way to manage even more complex systems.

Conclusions 
Supply chain performance measurement is vital for a company in order to survive in today’s competitive business 
environment. Supply chain performance measurement should be a business-critical process, driven by metrics and 
supported by business intelligence. With increasing competition and changing market forces, tapping into this 
critical asset is essential in sustaining competitive advantage in the global space. we can summarize the results of 
this research as follows: 
- amount of Cronbach's alpha coefficient for all variables is more than 0.7. It means that questionnaire reliability 
is confirmed. 
- The null hypothesis about normality of data distribution in statistical group was rejected. Therefore, non-
parametric statistics was used for analysis of data. 
- Based on Friedman Test, general indexes has the most effect on performance measurement in supply chain 
management (Case Study:  IKCO). 
 
- Based on Binominal Test, Result of using this test showed that all factors of research are in a suitable level.

Abstract: 
Todays, transportation and logistics engineering process are among the important issues of organizations in the 
competitive market. Considering the logistical structure of the logistics engineering and the more attention paid 
to the logistical tools and, in particular, such as the use of these tools, such as containers (pallets, containers, etc.), 
transportation equipment (trailer, forklift trucks, etc.), and The art of building the supply and distribution network 
with respect to the main warehouses, cross dock and temporary storage, is one of the most important and 
contemplative cases. The main goal of this paper is to present and develop a mathematical model of trailer 
schedule planning in possible conditions in the cross dock. In fact, the main function of this mathematical model 
is to minimize the total time of the logistics process from the stage of emptying the pallets from the  materials 
producers in the cross docks and assigning the trailer to the door and finally reloading the pallets to be distributed 
to the production sites. . To solve this model and to analyze the outputs, mixed integer programming was used by 
GAMS software.

6. CONCLUSION 
 
This paper addressed the truck scheduling problem in a crossdocking terminal whose resources including doors, forklifts, 
and workers were assumed limited and non-preemptive. 
An intelligent randomization function is then designed to choose the rules for ranking the clusters based on the status of the 
search. In other words, the selection of each ranking function is subject to a probability whose value is dynamically updated 
by the history of the search. This indicates that the choice of the initial cluster is adaptive (and not deterministic) to the input 
data. The important issue is how to define and adjust the ranking criteria of the functions such that they continually 
complement each other throughout the search. This can be extended to form a pool of good-quality feasible solutions of 
diverse attributes as the initial solutions of a neighborhood search method (such as a local search) to establish optimality.

1. Introduction
The globalization of world markets has put today’s organizations to venture into new strategic practices in order to 
sustain the level of competition in the market place. Today’s competition is on product variety, innovation, cost and 
time. Therefore, an essential requirement to face these changes is through cutting production cost and increasing 
productivity without deteriorating quality and continually maintains quality standards. As a result, several studies 
have been adopted to improve production efficiency and effectiveness through different customized tools such as 
Total Quality Management (TQM) (Camison 1996; Hongen and Xianwel 1996), Quality Control (Pandey et al. 
2011; Wang and Srinivasan 2009), Six Sigma (Cheng 2005; Habidin et al. 2015; and Mandahawi et al. 2010), lean 
(Cournoyer et al. 2010; Mandahawi et al. 2011) and Lean and Six Sigma (Adir 2019;  Lizarelli and Alliprandini 
2018). 
Furthermore, Simulation is a powerful tool available to those responsible for design and operation processes. It is 
used to describe and analyze the behavior of a system, and to aid the design of a real system (Mandahawi et al. 
2017). Discrete-event systems are dynamic systems that evolve in time by the occurrence of events at possibly 
irregular time intervals, which resembles the nature of real-world production and business system. As a result, 
simulation has been applied to a wide range of real-world applications including healthcare, manufacturing, banking, 
transportations, and distribution systems (Ahmed and Alkhamis 2009, Bond 2007, Chia, Lin 2016, El-Haik and Al-
Aomar 2006; Gunal and Pidd 2006;  Mandahawi et al. 2017; VanBerkel, and Blake 2007; Vos et al. 2007; and 
Werker et al. 2009).

A new simulation model has been developed, evaluated and validated by adopting the supermarket concept in 
addition to the new material handling system. The future simulation model has been tested with the same number of 
replications and the same replication length. The results of the future simulation model indicate that implementing 
the lean concept within the production line could have enormous effect on reducing lead time as shown in Table 3.

7. Conclusion 
 
The paper presents a simulation modeling using Arena software combined with lean manufacturing tools for the 
most two important products Top-800 and SN-800 which have the highest demand at the Emulsion department in a 
painting factory company. The current analysis shows that there is a need to improve current production line to 
increase the production capacity in order to meet customer demand. Through detailed time and motion study and 
simulation modeling analysis the team was able to identify the main non-value added activities that affect the 
production line capacity. Afterward, a set of lean manufacturing tools have been proposed to improve current 
production capacity such as improving material handling process and implementing two supermarkets to minimize 
the mixing time.  A new simulation model has been developed, the analysis show that the lead time will reduce from 
6.24 hr up to 5.34 hr, queue time from 2.5 hr to zero hour and non-value added time from 1.5 hr to 0.65 hr. All the 
proposed solutions have been approved by the company top management team and immediate actions have been 
taken to change current production process.

Abstract 
A study was performed to evaluate performance in entering English text on mobile devices by experienced users 
whose native language is not English and were experienced users of mobile devices and full keyboards. Two 
different mobile devices were used, they have virtual and physical keyboard, one of them have the full QWERTY 
keypad (single tap) and the other one have 14 keys keypad (multi-tap). Fifty subjects between the age of 19 and 44 
years voluntary participated in the study, 22 of them are females and the rest are males. Subjects gave their opinions 
concerning learnability, accuracy, and efficiency. Subjects felt that the single tap method was easier to learn, more 
accurate and more efficient, than the multi-tap method, regardless of the type of keypad used.

1. Introduction
Sending electronic text messages, via mobile phones instead of a computer, is ubiquitous in industrialized societies. 
It is also fairly widespread in underdeveloped countries. The transmission of short textual messages (SMS texting) 
between mobile phones via the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) to other systems and devices has been 
increasing exponentially, and integration with other services such as email and web services has also followed the 
same trend (Chang et al., 2017).  Emailing, online chatting, and other web services all use text inputting. SMS 
texting is done mostly on mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal organizers, and 
cellular phones (O’Riordan et al. 2005). However, as O’Riordan et al. (2005) notes, many phone manufacturers 
target fashion trends and change mobile phone designs so as be different from their competitors, usually at the 
expense of user performance and usability. These changes and the impact of using a miniaturized keypad have 
introduced many factors that affect performance, usability and user satisfaction. 
Many studies have been conducted to determine how the negative effects of these factors may be minimized or 
eliminated to gain greater user acceptance of mobile devices. The most common measures of usability of devices 
investigated are speed of text entry, accuracy of text entry, and subjective opinions of acceptability. The wide 
variety of factors that are thought to affect usability that have been studied include: (i) physical design features of 
the devices, such as type of keybpad, virtual or physical (Millet and Aydin 2010; Po-Hung Lin, 2015; Ruan et al. 
2016), layout of the keys (O’Riordan et al. 2005; Lin 2017), mapping of letters on the keys, size of keyboard/keypad 
(Karlson et al, 2006; Lin 2017), and tactile feedback (Brewster et al. 2007; Dunlop and Taylor 2009; Hoggan et al. 
2008 and Lopez et al. 2009); (ii) text input technology (Butts and Cockburn, 2002; James and Reischel, 2001; 
O’Riordan et al. 2005 and Wigdor and Balakrishnan, 2004); and (iii) user characteristics, such as age group (Millet

 6. Conclusions 
  
This study supports the generally held view that text entry speeds and error rate depends on the type of keypad used 
and the method of entering the characters.  It also shows that this view is not simplistic. In general, subjects didn’t 
feel comfortable with all the input methods, eight thought that there was a lag in time between the key press and the 
appearance of the letter on the virtual (touch) screens for the multi press input. Twenty eight subjects declared that 
their multi press performance could be enhanced with more frequent use of this method. Further research paper will 
focus on the objective analysis to study the correlation between the speed of text entry and the error rate.

Abstract 
Forecasting has proven to be a useful tool that can constitute a competitive edge in today’s competitive market. Indeed, 
forecasting deals with uncertainty by predicting the future either based on human judgement (qualitative forecasting) 
or based on historical data (quantitative forecasting). This paper explores and compares different quantitative 
forecasting methods for the sales of four sizes of a product belonging to a well-known company. These stock keeping 
units (SKUs) pertain to a carbonated beverage with high daily sales such that everyday hundreds of boxes are sold. 
To that end, this analysis focuses on one specific geographical area which is Fez, Morocco. Both the stock keeping 
units and the location were chosen with no prior motivation. In a first instance, we clean the raw data set. Then, we 
delve into exploring different classical and neural network forecasting methods, and comparing their accuracies to 
determine the most precise one, using the statistical programming language R. The results revealed that the Neural 
Network model outperforms the other methods.  
Keywords 
Predictive Forecasting, ARIMA, ETS, Neural Networks, R Programming. 
1. Introduction
In the current market, forecasting provides a competitive edge to companies that wish to reduce the costs tied to their 
inventory while making sure that they can meet the demand for their products. This optimization process is possible 
thanks to forecasting methods for the demand, which enable businesses to control their inventory levels. 
Forecasting can be defined as the scientific process through which a future parameter can be estimated using past data. 
In other words, even in a fast-changing environment, forecasts capture patterns and relationships to model the way the 
chosen subject in our environment is changing. According to Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018), the predictability 
of an event is mainly contingent upon three factors: the quantity of past data available, our understanding of the 
predictors that affect the predicted variable and the impact of the forecast on the forecasted variable, if any. 
To illustrate the third factor, we consider the example of stocks that is inspired from the currency rate exchange 
example provided in the book. If the forecasts for such variable are publicized, people will follow the trend provided 
by the forecasts. In other words, if the forecasts indicate an increase in the price of stocks for a given company, people 
will scurry to buy them, making the prices go up. The forecast is said to be self-fulfilling (Hyndman and 
Athanasopoulos 2018). 
Choosing the right forecasting method can only be achieved through understanding the type of data at hand and what 
it conveys. One classification of forecasting methods differentiates between qualitative and quantitative methods, 
which can be complementary in order to increase the accuracy of the forecast. Qualitative methods, also referred to as 
judgmental forecasts, are often the only option when no past data is available. On the other hand, quantitative or 
statistical methods rely on past data and they are more accurate when we can assume that some of the past trends will 
extend in the future (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018).

lower for this method compared to the classical methods. Thus, it is safe to say that this Neural Network 
Autoregression method is the most accurate and thus the best among the four explored.  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The aim behind this limited comparative study is purely exploratory. To that end, we performed three classical 
forecasting methods, namely ARIMA (+ Fourier Terms), TBATS and ETS (+ STL), and one Machine Learning 
method which is Neural Network Autoregression, on the sales data of the 1L SKU. After plotting and comparing the 
measures of accuracy of the four methods (using MASE as a metric), we concluded that for the weekly sales data of 
the first SKU, the Neural Network Autoregression method yields more accuracy. 
 
Future work perspectives include exploring Recurrent Neural Networks and autoregressive models in deep learning, 
which are sequence models with multiple hidden layers, capable of extracting more features, and which might be 
useful for predicting times series.

1. Introduction
I see and pay attention to the problems that occur at the SKTIP College (Kusuma Negara). It lies in the quality of the 
lecturers who teach swimming courses. and do not have the right way of teaching students aged 18 years and above 
and can be classified as the age of an adult who is clearly different in character with students at school age (age 6-17 
years) so that the teaching that occurs is not effective and efficient. Following are the swimming pool results data of 
STKIP KUSUMA NEGARA students in the Sports Education study program that students of 2018 with a total of 120 
people have received swimming courses, but not all have passed well, can be seen in the following chart:

style are: (1) There are students who feel the most right among their friends, (2) Students feel ashamed to express their 
shortcomings (3) Most students interpret that everything is done right. 
Thus, based on the results of the research and the results of the analysis above, it turns out that the value of the skills 
of students trained in training teaching styles is superior to the self-examination teaching style. therefore the researcher 
recommends that the teaching style of exercise have a higher influence than the teaching style of self-examination in 
an effort to improve learning freestyle swimming. 
 
c) The Difference Between Teaching Teaching Style and Teaching Style Self Check Against Freestyle Swimming 
Learning at Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Education Students. (A2 x A3) 
In the group of students trained in command style teaching and teaching style self-examination did not have a 
significant difference. In contrasting the values of the two treatment groups there is a p-value of 0.344. When compared 
with the significance standard of 0.05 or 5%, the p-value of 0.344> 0.05 means that H0 is accepted and H1 is rejected. 
Then it can be concluded that there is no difference in the value of learning freestyle significantly between the 
command style teaching group and the teaching style group self-check and the value of freestyle swimming learning 
outcomes of students trained in high / low command style teaching with the value of groups trained teaching style 
self-check on Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Education Education students. 
Thus, based on the results of the research and the results of the analysis above, it turns out that the value of the skills 
of students trained in command style teaching is the same as the self-examination teaching style. therefore the 
researcher recommends that the command style of teaching and teaching style self check there are no clear differences 
in results in an effort to improve learning freestyle swimming. 
 
d) Effect of Interactions Between Teaching Style and Confidence in Learning Outcomes Freestyle swimming in 
Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Education Education students 
From the results of analysis and hypothesis testing between teaching styles (A), then the researcher determines how 
much the interaction between teaching styles (A) and self-confidence (B) relates to freestyle swimming learning at 
Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. Based on the results of the analysis of research data, it was 
stated that there was an interaction between teaching styles (A) with student confidence (B). On the value of Testing 
Interaction between the two groups (AxB) there is the price of the Fo value (AB) = 58,889 with p-value = 0,000 <0,05 
or H0 rejected. This means that there is a very significant interaction effect between factors A (teaching style) and 
factor B (confidence) on freestyle swimming learning in Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
Furthermore, it can be seen from the results of the analysis that the influence of the teaching style and self-confidence 
variables on learning freestyle swimming is RSquared = 0.741 x 100 = 74.10%. 
Thus the results of the hypothesis test prove that there is an analysis of the interaction between teaching styles 
including training teaching style, command style teaching and self-examination teaching style (A) with confidence 
(B) on freestyle swimming learning outcomes in Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Education Education students. So that 
it can be concluded that there is an interaction between teaching style exercises, command teaching style and self-
examination teaching style. 
In learning swimming in addition to good motor skills, learners or students are required to have high self-esteem, 
because swimming learning is done in swimming pools, logically how can students be able to take lessons but when 
swimming in a deep place they do not have confidence thus causing unwarranted anxiety and even panic and this also 
causes accidents in the water such as sinking or cramping. In the end, students could not absorb the knowledge taught 
by lecturers when swimming courses. Furthermore, students who have good self-confidence can receive stimulation 
of movement, feel, grow and develop movement skills so that the students of STKIP Kusumanegara Jakarta Sports 
Education become skilled in following swimming courses, especially in the crawl swimming style (freestyle). 
From the description above, it can be interpreted that the occurrence of high interaction between teaching styles that 
are trained with training teaching styles, command style teaching and teaching styles check for high self-confident 
students and low self-confident students. Thus it can be concluded that there is an interaction between teaching style 
and confidence in freestyle swimming learning in Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Based on the results of the research and the results of the analysis above, it turns out that the value of the skills of 
students who are trained in low self-confidence category command style teaching is lower / lower than the teaching 
style of self-examination of low self-confidence students. Therefore the researcher recommends that the teaching style 
of self-examination in the low self confidence category be more influential than the command style teaching style of 
the low self-confidence in an effort to improve learning freestyle swimming.

Drawing conclusions is based on the findings of experimental treatment by level research, with the independent 
variables namely teaching styles including exercise teaching style, command teaching style, self-examination teaching 
style and moderator variables namely self-confidence and the dependent variable resulting from freestyle swimming 
learning. The conclusions in this study are in accordance with the submission of hypotheses, from the results of 
hypothesis testing conducted can be concluded that: 
a) There is a difference between the style of teaching practice and the command style of teaching the results of 
freestyle swimming learning in students of Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Education 
b) There is a difference between the style of teaching practice and the teaching style of self-examination of the results 
of freestyle swimming learning in students of Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Education 
c) There is no difference between the command style teaching style and the teaching style of self-examination of the 
results of freestyle swimming learning in Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
d) There is an influence of the interaction between the style of teaching and self-confidence in the results of freestyle 
swimming learning in students of the Kusumanegara STKIP Sports Education Jakarta 
e) There are differences in the results of freestyle swimming learning outcomes between the high confidence 
category teaching exercise style and the high confidence category commando teaching style in the Kusumanegara 
STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
f) 
There are differences in the results of freestyle swimming learning outcomes between the high self confidence 
category teaching practice style and teaching style self-check the category of high self-confidence in the 
Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
g) There are differences in the results of learning styles of free swimming between the command style teaching style 
of high self confidence and teaching style self-check the category of high self-confidence in Kusumanegara 
STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
h) There is no difference in the results of freestyle swimming learning outcomes between the low confidence 
category teaching exercise style and the low confidence category commando teaching style in Kusumanegara 
STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
i) 
There are differences in the results of freestyle swimming learning outcomes between the low confidence category 
exercise teaching style and the teaching style of self-checking the low self confidence category in the 
Kusumanegara STKIP Jakarta Sports Education students. 
j) 
There is a difference in the results of learning the free style swimming between the low self confidence category 
command style teaching and the teaching style self check low self confidence category in the Kusumanegara 
Jakarta Sports Education STKIP students. 
Thus to improve the learning outcomes of freestyle swimming in students of Sports Education Kusumanegara Jakarta 
College of Teacher Training and Education can be improved through teaching styles including training style teaching, 
command style teaching and self-examination teaching style by controlling self confidence first. 
The results showed that there was an influence of teaching style and confidence in the results of learning freestyle 
swimming. This research strengthens the knowledge and theory that the variable of learning outcomes in free style 
swimming is influenced by the teaching style. In this connection the research results obtained are consistent with the 
proposed theoretical model and design.

Abstract 
The quality of higher education in Indonesia has not been evenly distributed including vocational nursing schools. 
The academic quality assurance for nursing vocational schools is not at its best, which has an impact on the quality of 
nurse’s graduates who will provide the health services. The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of 
leadership on academic quality assurance. This study explores the problem of leadership based on indicators: 
supporting, inspiring, directing, facilitating. Academic quality assurance based on indicators: quality policy, quality 
design, supervision, feedback. The quantitative research uses a questionnaire on 122 permanent lecturers at 24 nursing 
vocational schools in Jakarta. The results of the analysis of the influence of leadership by influencing the academic 
quality assurance showed the distribution of estimated points formed an acceptable linear line. Thus it is proven that 
the leadership had a positive direct impact on the academic quality assurance. Furthermore the study also found indicators 
that had the most significant contribution in leadership and academic quality assurance were facilitating and academic 
quality policies. This explained that facilitative leadership had a positive direct impact on academic quality policy. In 
addition, there are some institutional practice recommendations suggested in accordance with the findings of this 
paper.

Introduction
The education system in Indonesia today cannot meet the requirements needed to face globalization and various 
demands in it. Education in the global era should now be able to prepare a system and content that adapts to the context 
of globalization. In the face of the challenges in this global era, Indonesia must build good quality higher education, 
so that graduates are eligible to compete and well received in the global world. Good quality of higher education is 
that who produces graduates who are able to actively develop their potential, assemble, and apply science and 
technology that is useful for society, nation, and the country. The growth of universities in Indonesia is quite rapid 
quantitatively.  
The number of public and private universities from all ministries, institutions, agencies in Indonesia is 4688 
institutions. The number of universities, public universities and private universities in Indonesia include academies in 
a total of 1064 institutions, polytechnics 279 institutions, college 2538 institutions. Institute 221 institutions and 
University of 586 institutions. Of the various types of public and private tertiary institutions, the highest form of 
tertiary education is then followed by academies. While the growth in the number of private universities in L2 Dikti 
region 3 Jakarta is an academy of 117 institutions, polytechnics 9 institutions, college 120 institutions, institutes of 20

policy indicators, which are 25.38%. This explains that facilitative leadership has a massive influence on the 
implementation of academic quality policy. Facilitative leadership will always encompass followers as much as 
possible in the establishment of vision and mission, and build a cohesive team with policies that are oriented towards 
improving academic quality. The ability to facilitate and collaborate is explained by Wisniewski (2004) as the ability 
of a leader to be able to share responsibility and authority with others, identify potential public interests that are 
relevant, creating opportunities for people to form partnerships through shared knowledge and to develop teams that 
understand vision and strategy. Therefore, it should be considered in the selection or appointment of leaders of 
educational institutions that have leadership because leadership is an important factor or core in quality assurance.  
Smith (2003),  facilitative leadership is a people–centered, quality and results driven process of developing and 
supporting a culture in the workplace that facilitates goal achievement through effective relational processes. 
Facilitative leadership is particularly important to effective group process, teamwork, workplace culture and change 
management in the workplace. Siebens (2011),  facilitating leader is a leader who creates the necessary condition and 
facilitates excellent group dynamic, organizational context  and processes for participative group discussion and 
decision making. Facilitating leadership is a style of leadership based on and characterized by personal modesty of 
the leader considering the answers to the main questions of the organization(such as the mission an vision) and the 
way to manage it.   Facilitating leadership must be built on intense participation with all co workers. So, the number 
of consultations and meetings on all levels of the organization is clear indicator. Facilitating leadership aims to engage 
as many people as possible with dicision making processes. So, the number of actively engaged co workers indicates 
the level of facilitation by the leader. To enable all co workers to be engaged in the decision making processes in an 
effective and efficient way, they have to be informed accurately. There fore the gathering and the internal 
dissemination of data is an indicator for Facilitating leadership. 
Osseo-Asare, Longbottom and Murphy, identify the impact of the study is that academic quality planners must pay 
attention and improve leadership tasks and activities [24]. Stephen Jacobson explains leadership and professional are 
important processes to maintain success and change in organizational governance [25]. Leadership capacity 
development needs to be done to improve the academic quality assurance. On a leadership management pilot project 
at the Australian university health faculty using the Kirkpatrick model to evaluate the results, the participants gained 
leadership capacity, changes in perceptions of leadership, and motivation to carry out leadership roles. The role of the 
mentor is very valuable for leadership development. This model has potential as a guide for succession planning [26] 
 
6. 
Conclusion 
Based on the results of the analysis of the study of the influence of leadership on academic quality assurance in the 
nursing vocational school, it can be concluded that there is a positive direct impact of Leadership on Academic Quality 
Assurance. Facilitative leadership influences the implementation of academic quality policies. 
This research will help the nursing vocational school leaders to understand leadership to strengthen academic quality 
assurance in their respective institutions. Increased quality assurance for nursing vocational schools can be built by 
increasing various factors that influence the implementation of academic quality assurance. In accordance with the 
findings of the research, improving academic quality assurance can be done by increasing leadership through 
education and training. In addition, leaders must support and facilitate the activities of lecturers in implementing the 
Three Pillars of Higher Education. 
Leadership development programs must integrate leadership theory with leadership practices; provide opportunities 
to develop and demonstrate leadership competencies with a variety of active learning experiences including small 
group discussions and presentations, interviews, simulations, role plays, exercises, and group activities.

1. Introduction
The poverty problem urges the government to immediately take concrete steps to overcome it, so that in national 
development, poverty alleviation is the highest priority. Poverty reduction is directed at helping people below the 
poverty line and preventing new poverty. 
The province of Maluku as well as an island province with great marine potential, it is also well known since long 
ago as a rich spice-producing island. Despite the abundance of natural resources, poverty in Maluku is still the 
highest in Indonesia (BPS, 2015). The depth and poverty severity index expressed by P1 and P2 shows a downward 
trend over the period 2013-2015, but in 2016, P1 slightly increased to 3.63 from 3.52 in March of 2015. This means 
there is an average increase on the gap in the standard of living of the poor compared to the poverty line. Similarly, 
P2 in 2016 increased to 0.99 from 0.92 in 2015, meaning that the poverty gap between poor people also experienced 
a slight increase (BPS, 2016). 
Increasing the P1 score indicates that the standard of living of the poor declines and if the expenditure goes further 
away from the minimum standard of living (poverty line), it will be increasingly difficult to raise the status of non-
poor, as well as the increase in the value of P2. If the inequality among the poor increases (indicated by the 
increased P2 value), the more difficult it is to suppress the poverty. The first step that needs to be done in addressing 
the problem of increasing the depth of poverty and increasing the number of poor people in Maluku Province is 
identifying factors causing the increase of the poverty. 
The government spending is one of the most effective means of government intervention on the economy. Local 
government expenditure or known as regional expenditure in the Regional Budget, is one of the factors driving 
regional economic growth. The greater the regional expenditure is expected to increase the regional economic 
activity (economic expansion).

province and across provinces. Therefore, Maluku province is very interested to attract more domestic investment 
and foreign investment. 
 
4.8 The influence of government spending and private investment on poverty through economic growth in 
Maluku Province 
The results show that the indirect effect of government spending on poverty through economic growth is positive. 
This means that increased government spending can also increase poverty through economic growth. Thus it can be 
argued that economic growth mediates the influence of government spending on poverty in Maluku Province. While 
the results of research indirect influence of private investment on poverty through economic growth is negative. This 
means an increase in private investment can reduce poverty through economic growth. Thus it can be said that 
economic growth mediates the influence of private investment on poverty reduction in Maluku Province. 
 
4.9 Dominant and Non-Dominant Variables Affect Economic Growth 
Direct private investment is very big influence (51.84%) to increase economic growth of Maluku Province 
compared with contribution of government expenditure which only equal to 13,83%. Similarly, if we can see the 
indirect effect of government expenditure on economic growth through private investment, its contribution is 62.6%. 
Thus, if the Maluku provincial government wants to increase economic growth then private investment should be 
more improved compared with government spending. 
 
4.10 Dominant and Non-Dominant Variables Affect Poverty 
Private investment variable is the most dominant direct influence on the rise and fall of poverty level in Maluku 
province. The relationship between the two variables has a coefficient value of the path of 65.28%. These results 
imply that the policy that has the greatest effect on the decline in the number of poor people is through increased 
private investment. Then, the non-dominant variable affecting poverty is the variable of economic growth, which 
contributes only 0.08% to poverty. Thus, it can be concluded that economic growth has not contributed significantly 
to the decline of poverty in Maluku province. The indirect effect of government spending on poverty is largely 
influenced by private investment compared to economic growth. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Direct government spending has a positive and significant impact on private investment in Maluku Province. This 
means that the size of government spending can increase private investment in Maluku Province. 
a) Direct government spending negatively affects economic growth in Maluku Province. The direction of a 
negative relationship indicates that the greater the government's expenditure the lower the economic growth 
rate. This means that government spending in Maluku province has not been able to contribute to economic 
growth. 
b) Private investment directly affects the economic growth in Maluku Province. This means that the high private 
investment in Maluku province, then economic growth can be directly increased. 
c) Direct government spending negatively affects poverty in Maluku Province. This shows that large government 
expenditures will be able to reduce poverty in Maluku Province. 
d) Private investment directly affects negatively and significantly to poverty in Maluku Province. This shows that 
when private investment is increased, poverty in Maluku Province will decrease. 
e) Direct economic growth negatively affects poverty in Maluku Province. This indicates that the high economic 
growth will be able to reduce poverty in Maluku Province. 
f) 
Government spending indirectly positively affects economic growth through private investment in Maluku 
Province. This means that the size of government spending in Maluku Province can increase economic growth 
through private investment. 
g) Indirect government spending negatively affects poverty through private investment in Maluku Province. This 
means that increased government spending can reduce poverty in Maluku Province through private investment. 
h) Government spending indirectly affects positively to poverty through economic growth in Maluku Province. 
This means that increased government spending can increase poverty through economic growth. 
i) 
Private investment indirectly negatively affects poverty through economic growth in Maluku Province. This 
means that large private investment will be able to reduce poverty in Maluku Province through economic 
growth. 
 
Some recommendations that can be given are: 
1410","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Toronto, Canada, October 23-25, 2019 
© IEOM Society International 
a) The impact of large private investment on economic growth and on poverty reduction in Maluku province, then 
the municipal government in Maluku province can no longer rely on economic growth on consumption. One of 
the strategic factors is how to strengthen the private sector and investment can be improved in each region. 
Therefore, in addition to stable macroeconomic conditions and security guarantees, it is necessary to improve a 
conducive investment climate that includes improving regulatory mechanisms, accelerating the establishment 
and business licenses, improving online investment information systems, and promoting investment through 
print media or electronics. If the large private sector roles and economic activity expand, then economic growth, 
job creation will increase. 
b) Government expenditures that negatively affect economic growth compel the government of Maluku Province 
to take serious and caution in determining the strategy of allocating and distributing government expenditures in 
order to have an impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. Therefore, the allocation of government 
spending should be used more for government investment in the form of infrastructure. This is done because to 
accelerate and accelerate the development and turn of the economy wheels required adequate infrastructure. By 
paying close attention to this government investment, it is expected to increase private investment and economic 
growth and poverty reduction in Maluku Province. 
c) Maluku Province does not only require high economic growth, but economic growth that can be enjoyed 
directly by many parties so that it can have a very big impact on poverty reduction. To achieve these objectives, 
the main policy that needs to be done is to advance and expand the secondary sector with the development of 
other sectors, especially the primary sector. For example, the development of industrialization based on primary 
sector. This policy is pursued in order to realize mutual support mechanisms between sectors, in order to create 
a process of transformation of a strong economic structure.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine whether there is a direct or  indirect influence between leg muscle power, tooth shape, 
achievement motivation on the ability of the long jump for university sports education students at PGRI 
Palembang,this research was conducted at the PGRI University of Palembang, sampling using random sampling, the 
test results are direct and indirect effects of the three variables on the ability of squat style long jumps, both 
individually (partially) and together to obtain the results of a good and perfect leap, thus the ability of the long jump 
can be improved through leg muscle power, the shape of the pitch, and the Achievement motivation of the

Introduction
Long jump is one branch of athletic sport, where a long jumper is required to carry out a series of moves starting 
from a run at a certain distance as a prefix, to get a horizontal speed, and when he reaches the fulcrum he has to do 
as much as possible, to get a vertical speed, then make a jumping style before landing on a sandbox The ability of 
long jump is a person's ability to perform a series of jumping movements in a simultaneous, smooth, fast and precise 
manner to produce a jumping distance. Thus to produce a squat style long jump fast and good, then there are several 
factors that need to be considered, including: attitude to stand facing the field, leg muscle power, the shape of the 
bench, facilities and infrastructure, mental, achievement motivation, Long jump is a leap motion carried out on a 
track with a sandbox used for landing in a predetermined size (Wirato 2013). 
2.
Methodology
ability of the long jump is a person's ability to carry out a series of jumping techniques simultaneously in a smooth, 
fast and precise manner to produce a jumping distance. (Widiastuti 2011) states that flexibility is the ability of the 
joint to carry out movements in a wide range of motion maximally. (Tangkudung 2012) Someone who has good 
flexibility is a person who can do a wide range of motion in his joints and which has elastic muscles. Determination 
of benchmarks in this study is, the ability of muscle groups, ligaments and joints found on the trunk of the body or 
togok (Collumna vertebralis) to carry out the movement of the body to make the jump style in lues, smooth without 
any significant obstacles to makelong jump movement 
 (Jay Dawesand Mark Roozen 2011) power is defined as the ability to do work, this is a very important aspect in the 
expression of agility. This may be the determinant of success in athletic sports. (Sukirno 2013) theability of a person 
to use the maximum power that is directed in the shortest possible time the muscles hold at high speed in one whole 
motion. Power of the leg muscles has a very important role, because the leg muscles contribute to the initial motion, 
repulsion on the pedestal board to make the leap as far as possible. So the repulsion made by the leg muscles is 
repulsion with maximum strength.  
Motivation has an important role in achieving success in activities, but not the only other factors. In sports activities 
it is suspected that the role of motivation has success in improving achievement. Because sports activities to achieve 
high achievement require a long enough time, with various problems and obstacles that must be passed without

exogenous variables and other factors. The magnitude of the contribution of kinesthetic and motor educability 
perceptions simultaneously influencing self-confidence is 1 - 0.744 = 0.256. 
This figure shows the direct effect of the long jump ability and the size of the score on self-confidence motivation of 
0.744, while the remaining 0.256 is influenced by other factors. In other words, the variability of self-confidence 
motivation that can be explained by using the kinesthetic and motor educability perception variables is 0.774, while 
the effect of 0.246 is caused by other variables outside the model.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of applying reciprocal teaching styles, teaching style practice 
in groups of students who have high motor ability and groups of students who have low motor ability on the results 
of learning the basic techniques of sepak takraw (Sepak sila, heading, Service dan  smash). The research method 
used is the experimental method with 2x2 design by level, The sample in this study amounted to 44 students 
consisting of 22 people with high motor ability and 22 people with low motor ability as a result of using the motor 
ability barrow test with a reliability of 0.93 (Standing Broad Jump, Soft Ball Throw, Zig-zag Run, Wall Pass, 
Medicine Ball Put, Sprint 50 meter). Furthermore students are grouped into four groups, each of which amounts to 
11 people who are taught by following the concepts of Mosston and Ashworth's teaching styles. Data collection on 
learning outcomes of the basic techniques of sepak takraw is done with a test instrument that has been validated by 
experts of sepak takraw. The results showed that reciprocal teaching styles were more effectively used to teach basic 
sepak takraw techniques than practice teaching styles for students who had high motor ability, for students who have 
low motor abilities, reciprocal teaching style and practice teaching style do not have  differences in the effect of 
learning the basic techniques of sepak takraw and there is an influence of the interaction between teaching styles and 
motor ability on the learning outcomes of basic techniques of sepak takraw.

Introduction
Sepak takraw is a modern traditional sport that has been modified and recognized throughout the world (Kosni et al. 
2017). The first time sepak takraw was introduced to the 10th Asian Games on Beijing in 1990 and began to develop 
in more than 20 countries (Jawis et al. 2005). Sepak takraw is now a recreational and competitive sport that is played 
throughout the world and is being promoted to be a team event at the Olympic Games (Sujae and Koh 2008). Sepak 
takraw is played in a team of three, namely tekong, feeder and spiker. Tekong is responsible for taken services, 
feeder feeds the ball to tekong while spiker is in charge of spiking the ball (Kosni et al. 2018). 
In Indonesia (Astra and Artanayasa 2017), China (Chen et al. 2018), Philippines (Chen and Xiao 2017), Malaysia 
(Hamid et al. 2015) and other countries sepak takraw become part of the learning curriculum in university. Sepak 
takraw is very suitable with physical education goals which make the players have good manipulative movement 
skills, excellent physical condition, speed of making decisions in motion, and emotional stability (Yusup 2001). As 
for the basic techniques of sepak takraw include kick techniques, heading, service receiving the first ball, smash, 
block and bait (Hakim et al. 2007). To be able to play sepak takraw you must first master the basic techniques of 
sepak takraw, because mastering basic skills before learning more complex skills is very important (Čoh et al. 
2004). 
The research that has been done in the learning process of basic techniques is carried out using the game approach 
(Yulianti 2014; Sigit 2014; Arman et al. 2013; Widodo and Sudarso 2018), with the approach to modifying sepak 
takraw balls (Saputra et al. 2017; Nizam et al. 2017; Sunarto et al. 2016). The findings of these studies state that

The results of the third hypothesis through the calculation of variance analysis indicate that there is a significant 
interaction effect between teaching styles and motor ability on the results of learning the basic techniques of sepak 
takraw. It is supported by the results of the study of (Ianovici and Weissblueth 2016). When students are given the 
right learning tools and according to their level of motor ability, they automatically improve their performance and 
motoric performance. Both interactions are seen in the differences in the effect of treatment on learning outcomes of 
basic techniques at both levels of student motor ability. Thus it can be explained that the results of learning the basic 
techniques of sepak takraw, besides being influenced by the teaching style used, it is also influenced by the 
existence of other internal factors, namely the student's motor ability factor. That means, that reciprocal teaching 
style and practice will be better implemented by considering the motor ability possessed by students for the optimal 
learning outcomes of basic sepak takraw techniques. The interaction between teaching style and motor ability was 
also found in the results of research on the results of learning other basic sports techniques, such as volleyball 
(Rohyana 2016), soccer (Doli et al. 2018), sprint skills (Sobarna 2017). 
 
5.  Conclusion 
The importance of the results of this finding is for physical education lecturers and teachers in sepak takraw 
learning, especially in choosing the teaching style that will be used to improve the learning outcomes of the basic 
techniques of sepak takraw. an instructor in physical education is important to consider teaching styles that are 
suitable and appropriate to achieve the goals of the learning to be achieved. Learning will be achieved if the teaching 
style used is in accordance with student characteristics. The results of this study state 1) For students who have high 
motor ability, reciprocal teaching style has a higher influence than teaching style practice on the results of learning 
the basic techniques of sepak takraw. 2) For students who have low motor ability, there are no different influences 
on the basic learning outcomes of sepak takraw techniques between reciprocal teaching styles and teaching practice 
styles. 3) There is an influence of the interaction between teaching style and motor ability on the results of learning 
the basic techniques of sepak takraw. The results of this study can be scientifically confirmed

Abstract 
With the increasing interfacing of healthcare and high technology, overwhelming amounts of research and 
praise have amassed in support of Simulation-Based Training. Though miles ahead of where it began, 
modern surgical simulation trainers range in fatal deficits, with the ‘most-equipped’ of them lacking 
functions as fundamental as assistive forces or even tactile sensation (haptic feedback) for training surgeons. 
The impediments that many of these modern systems possess have implications that prevent them from 
being the ultimate degree of surgical training, and prevent them from training ultimate surgeons. This poster 
is a presentation of the methods and functional advantages of the Computer-Aided Surgical Trainer (CAST) 
with an overview of the system’s evolution. Using the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) as an 
objective learning metric, the CAST system can train the highly specialized skills of laparoscopy to a 
surgeon without any of the risks or wasted resources associated with existing methods (mentor-trainee 
dynamics, cadavers, animals, etc.). By integrating sensors, image processing, machine learning, and 
augmented reality (AR) techniques, CAST is able to provide the surgeon real-time feedback and guidance 
in the development of their skills in laparoscopy.

Abstract 
In recent years, as climate change caused by CO2 emission followed by a surge in energy consumption becomes 
growing serious environmental concerns, there has been a significant effort by industrial sectors to reform existing 
systems operations to improve energy efficiency and sustainability tied to the wide-spread of demand response 
program and the high penetration of renewable generations. Followed by these efforts, many studies have been 
conducted to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in a wide range of industrial systems operations. Given 
this, the co-location of renewable generation integrated with battery energy storage has been considered as a 
promising solution that enables many industries to realize energy-efficient and sustainable operations. Considering 
co-located renewable generations, e.g., solar PV panels, integrated with battery energy storage, this study intends to 
develop a proper control policy for energy storage operations to minimize electricity cost while meeting time-
varying electricity demand load in response to intermittent renewable generation and time-of-use electricity prices. 
Specifically, this study proposes a threshold-based control policy by determining static time-varying thresholds on 
the state of charge level using two-stage stochastic programming based on historical data. The proposed threshold-
based control policy can be applied to energy storage operations by adjusting charging and discharging energy 
storage to ensure the threshold has the minimum state of charge level of energy storage.

The Implications of Uncertainty in the Results of Simulation 
Models

Abstract 
Simulation is a common engineering tool used to investigate the performance of complex systems where the input 
parameters are usually stochastic. As a consequence, simulation models contain both simulation and input uncertainty 
in their estimates. In this work, through an illustrative example, we show the implications of uncertainty in the results 
of simulation models and why it is important to acknowledge and, whenever possible, to quantify uncertainty in the 
simulation results. To investigate the implications of uncertainty in the results of simulation models a simple queue 
model was built in Simio® University Enterprise Edition v 10.165. The model consists of a single source of arrivals, 
single queue, and 𝑠𝑠 servers providing the same service. After being served, customers leave the system. Balking and 
reneging were not considered in the model. Two input parameters were considered in the model, namely the inter-
arrival time and the service time, and two output responses were considered, namely the average number of customers 
in the system and the average time spent in the system. Several scenarios were run with different number of 
replications, different traffic intensities, different number of servers, different variances, different distributions, 
different parameter values, and different seeds. The run length of each scenario was 1,825 days, which included 365 
days of warm-up. The specified warm-up period was enough for the system to reach steady state for all the 
experiments. Due to the simplicity of the system, one would expect to obtain accurate results in the simulation model. 
However, the results show that this was not always the case. As it is known, the intrinsic output-uncertainty (or 
simulation uncertainty) tends to decrease with the increase in the sample size, but interestingly in this work, for M/M/s 
systems, the highest individual absolute error was always observed for 400 replications, regardless of the 
configuration, which was not the lowest number of replications. Although the experiments of this work are simple 
queue models, the situation can be actually worse, because the uncertainty level in more complex systems may be 
much higher than the ones observed here. These results do not indicate that simulation results cannot support decision-
making or have no use. Rather, the results show that it is important to adequately inform decision-makers and 
simulation stakeholders about the uncertainties and the consequent risks involved in their decisions while using 
simulation models. As the quote says: “something is better than nothing”. A partially informed decision has higher 
chances of success than a simple blind guess.

Abstract: 
The more energy usage increases around the world the closer critical situation for supplying energy will encounter the 
nations. There will no way remain except optimal energy consumption moreover finding new energy resources. 
Renewable energies nowadays are the core concern of many researchers. Replacing fossil-based energy generation by 
other resources of renewable energies like wind and solar are started in the past decades.  
A system approach is applied in this research to present a model to analyze how building architecture and constructions 
could be improved toward green energy usage. Renewable energies will increase the incentives of the environmental 
protection, clean supply and demand in the huge energy consumers’ sectors like industries. 
It is concluded that environmental issues are a matter of concern for people, they cannot tolerate the higher expenses 
of green energy generation. They prefer to use cheap energy resources mainly non-renewables. The model confirmed 
the supporting policies both to generation and consumption will dramatically improve green energy usage. The 
governments can support both supplying and demand sides to decrease their energy expenses and give the people 
some incentive to use renewable subsidized energy and also earning by selling their extra generated power to the grid.

Available rating systems span from energy consumption evaluation systems to life cycle analysis and total 
quality assessment systems. The description of assessment results from a sample of buildings provides 
data to discuss construction characteristics that, currently, aim at being defined as sustainable. The study 
shows that building energy performance is considered the most important criterion in sustainability rating 
systems, and the least achieved one in sustainability assessments. (Cassells & Lewis, 2011). 
7. Conclusion:
This study figures out some important factors affecting energy consumption. Architectural consideration of
a building to decrease energy wastes and improve energy saving to have a sustainable energy management
are the other concern of the conceptual proposed model. The main variables are divided to Stock, Rate and
Auxiliary and the model improved step by step by increasing a variable. Causal relations are defined and 3
loops are developed. consumers positive and negative attitudes towards timber frame house and discussion
the solutions. In order to improve the acceptance degree of timber Renewable energy generated, Energy
Consumption and Long-Term Economic justification are crucial, which also need the cooperation of several
fields, such as government, investment in housing, Law and Regulations and so on. The study confirms these
attitudes of green buildings making policy and market promotion strategy by government and building
developers. There are some limitations of the study, for the architectural and demographic factors including
locations, incomes and age choice, and also for their energy consumption. It is better to figure out the criteria
for the future data collection. Future research will have focused on evaluating the factors that lead to
formation of particular attitudes and how to further enhance of green buildings. Regarding the sustainable
schemes, green building may be considered as an alternative for managing the energy use in developing
countries. Investigating green factors in the other systems, was to propose a new set of comprehensive factors
named Price of building’s materials, Suppling of housing, Demand of housing, Price of housing, investment
in housing field, Law and Regulations. Also, comparing performance sensitivity to the five representative
green building rating systems confirmed the reliability of the suggested tool based on measuring the criteria
deviations. The outcomes provide a valuable reference to the policy makers and also could be a considerable
suggestion to the future studies.

Abstract 
Thermoelectric Peltier is a solid-state module that functions based on P and N type semi conductive elements. The 
thermoelectric module can lower temperatures through the Peltier effect, wherein applied voltage and current results 
in a transfer of heat from one side of the module to the other. Optimal positioning of the Peltier module on a person’s 
neck would allow localized cooling of the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain. The maximization of the 
module’s surface area also maximizes the cooling time for a given use period. To wick away heat from the deposited 
end several methods were tested. The bare module, with a fan, aluminum plate, and a combination of both with thermal 
compound were tested. Bare Peltier temperatures reached a minimum of 61.1 °F with a maximum of 90.9 °F in a room 
that was roughly 75 °F. These data points were taken over 5-minute sessions at 5 second intervals. With the bare 
module, the lowest temperatures only lasted for 100 seconds before surpassing the starting temperature. With the 
combination cooling elements test, the minimum temperatures lasted for nearly the entire 5-minute duration. That 
resulted in 3 times longer cooling compared to the bare Peltier. The best results from testing included adding thermal 
compound with an aluminum plate and a cooling fan to the module. This resulted in a minimum temperature of 45.2 
°F and a max temperature of 74.3 °F. This had a difference of nearly 16 °F for both minimum and maximum values.

Abstract 
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves the genetic modification of patient's autologous T-cells to 
find and attack cancer cells throughout the body. Establishing critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process 
parameters (CPPs) is a crucial task for ensuring the potency, safety, and consistency of this therapy. To better 
understand these therapies, a design of experiments evaluating the expansion of T cells was carried out.  Through a 
supervised learning approach, multi-omics predictors (i.e. secretomes and NMR metabolomics features) can be used 
to understand T cell behavior based on growth and memory responses. The purpose of this work is to develop a 
computational pipeline that enables the characterization of multi-omics profiles that are predictive of quality responses 
at early stages of the manufacturing process. This includes the design of a computational tool that will measure the 
predictive power of omics variables and the sensitivity of these models to highly correlated predictors. The 
computational tool has been developed using mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques such as 
Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Symbolic Regression 
(SR). A consensus measurement between the different models was used in order to identify potential CQAs and CPPs. 
The biological meaning of these features is then assessed through discussions with the domain experts. A degree of 
consensus was achieved throughout the models in identifying important variables when modeling the percentage of T 
cells that are CCR7+CD62L+CD4+ (CD4_memory_fraction). The models presented high prediction performance 
with R2 ranging from 75% to 95% where SVM and SR provided the least and best prediction performance, 
respectively. The ranking of important features from these best-performing models can be misleading if these features 
are highly correlated. Hence, to mitigate the computational impact of highly correlated predictors, an approach 
involving the clustering of these variables is proposed before the model fitting process. Preliminary results showed 
that not only was this methodology able to rank groups of correlated predictors but was also able to improve 
performance for RF models. The findings of this work could enable the discovery of new knowledge necessary to 
achieve scalable biomanufacturing of CAR-T cell therapies in an automated manner.

Abstract 
 
 
There are thousands of short-range electric cars being purchased every month throughout North 
America. However, is the charging infrastructure for use with electric cars and plug-in hybrids keeping up 
to demand? A short-range electric car was used to determine if current charging infrastructure (available in 
June 2019) in Western New York and Western Pennsylvania could be used in a convenient and time-
efficient manner during a “typical” three-hour trip. Convenience is a key factor influencing the adoption of 
EVs. Obstacles to adopting electric vehicles (EVs) were discovered during the road trip to Erie, PA., these 
included slow chargers, no chargers, no redundancy of chargers (those currently out of service), lack of 
nearby services, varied terrain affecting kilometers (mileage), and a drivers’ need for planning. Results 
found redundancy remains a key issue for adoption with many charging stations on the route “out of 
service” with no nearby options or backups. Previous research found similar problems with few level 3 
(“fast”) chargers installed in convenient locations such as Welcome Centers. Companies involved in the 
“electrification movement” in the United States were currently installing multiple level 3 chargers in Erie, 
PA, at a central location which bodes well for future trials. More studies on short-range electric cars need 
undertaking because EV adoption is likely to be “ground up” (less expensive economy cars) instead of a 
“top-down” (more expensive luxury cars) approach.

Introduction 
 
Both long-range and short-range electric cars have been discussed in the news over the past few years as they 
slowly gain popularity. Long-range electric cars include various models from Tesla and the GM Bolt. Many types of 
short-range electric cars have been developed and are less expensive than their long-range counterparts. Examples of 
short-range cars include the Ford Focus Electric, Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Hyundai Ioniq, Nissan Leaf, Kia Soul, BMW 
i3, and Volkswagen eGolf. Short-range electric cars are defined as those from 100.8 kms (63 miles) to 182.4 kms (114 
miles) of range. The provided range is based on information gathered from the car model year 2017. 
The initial cost of short-range electric cars is becoming “more reasonable” overtime while long-range are 
still above the means of most middle-class car owners. Short-range cars could see an upswing in adoption as prices 
begin to revival gas-powered cars. The cost for a long-range Tesla in 2019 starts around $44,500 US (Model 3) and 
ends around $124,000 US (Model X). According to the Nissan USA website, a 2019 Nissan Leaf starts around $29,990 
US (without incentives applied). Similarly, a 2019 Hyundai Ioniq is advertised at $29,815 US. For most consumers, 
a 33% increase in the price of a long-range electric car versus short-range is a substantial amount of money. 
 
Short-range EV travel ranges can be examined from short, middle, and long perspectives. A short-range EV 
taking a “typical” short outing involves a single charge (usually completed from the home charger) or approximately

information about the area—all free of charge. All other areas along the trip route were not EV friendly. None of the 
wineries visited in New York or Pennsylvania had level 2 or 3 chargers available for guests. In the Niagara Region, 
Canada, approximately 20% of the wineries have level 2 chargers available. As shown in Figure 1, there was one hour 
and four minutes charging time spent in Chautauqua, NY while traveling to Erie, PA. One hour and eighteen minutes 
were spent recharging in Chautauqua, NY on the way back. The Chautauqua, NY level 2 charging station has no 
facilities such as restrooms, restaurants, or a vending machine. It is located at a store which was closed for a month. 
Both researchers had to walk approximately one kilometer (.6 miles) to visit a convenience store for a soda. Before 
heading back to Canada, the West Erie Plaza level 2 charger was used. The West Erie Plaza was 15.2 kms (9.5 miles) 
from the hotel and was the closest level 2 charger available. Driving over 15 kms to recharge is not convenient for EV 
owners, but was needed to insure enough energy to Chautauqua, NY. There were stores and restaurants in the area of 
the West Erie Plaza which helped in passing the time, but if enough charging stations were available near major motels 
only a minor inconvenience would occur. 
There were no charging stations (level 2 or 3) at either the Microtel Inn or the Solstice Inn, both located in 
Erie, PA. The Microtel Inn had no outlets on outer walls where a level 1 charger could be plugged-in. Solstice Inn had 
outside outlets and the EV was plugged-in there overnight gaining 144 km of power. Sad to say, but it not uncommon 
for hotels in the United States and Canada to provide neither an outdoor outlet or level 2 charger. Good news for EV 
owners is Sandman hotels in Canada are starting to add Level 2 chargers so patrons can plug-in at night and EVs can 
be fully charged in the morning. Hopefully, other hotels in Canada and the United States will follow suit! 
 
Range is a key factor affecting the uptake of electric cars. While the short-range electric cars in 2017 were 
advertised as providing from 100.8 kms (63 miles) to 182.4 kms (114 miles) of range, multiple factors negate those 
optimal outcomes. Those factors are often not shared and detailed with customers. One, the weather is a major factor 
in how an electric car will charge and disperse energy; especially in the winter. The weather was a minor factor in this 
study because it was conducted in spring with temperatures above 20 degrees C (68 degrees F). As noted, the terrain 
was “hilly” during most of the trip which drained energy from the car. Electric cars lose power as they climb hills or 
high bridges such as the two noted—Garden City Skyway in St. Catharines, Ontario and a high bridge in Grand Island, 
NY. Speed is another factor affecting the amount of power consumed by the EV. The return from Erie, PA to St. 
Catharines, Ontario was completed via Highway 20 throughout Western Pennsylvania and most of Western New York 
to optimize battery life. Usage of the EV on freeways while maintaining the speed limit draws more energy than shown 
available on the instrumentation.  
The available kilometers to travel shown in the car were different than those traveled in multiple 
circumstances—this is a confirmed finding in the study. As shown in the bolded Figure 1, statistics from Chautauqua, 
NY showed 120 kilometers available for travel according to the Nissan Leaf instrumentation. The distance to the 
Solstice Inn was a total of 86.8 kilometers on Highway 20 from the recharging station. There was an alteration made 
at eight kilometers from the hotel when the Leaf ran out of power. The cars’ instrumentation began to flash and there 
were no kilometers left showing. The percentage of power showing available was three dashes— zero. The researchers 
traveled another five kilometers along Highway 20 with the flashing instrumentation before stopping. The car stopped 
at a garage at the bottom of a hill in Erie, PA. We called AAA to tow us to the Microtel Inn which was eight kilometers 
(five miles) from the garage. Microtel Inn and the Solstice Inn are across the road from each other in Erie, PA. The 
Nissan Leaf was recharged at the Solstice Inn overnight. The Welcome Center in Western New York traveling to 
Merritt Winery had similar results of kilometers as shown in the car versus actual kilometers traveled. The discrepancy 
between kilometers available and traveled can be accounted for due to the terrain and speed. Other factors such as 
cold weather (less than 0 C or 32 F), air conditioning, and tire condition can be discounted as reducing the kilometers 
available for travel because they were all controlled during the experiment.  
Conclusion 
 
The charging infrastructure in Western New York and Pennsylvania is not ready to handle short-range electric 
cars on trips more than ninety minutes of continual driving. Electric car manufacturers need to test under “real world” 
scenarios to produce more accurate driving ranges for short-range EVs. Accurate kilometers available to travel will 
help with range anxiety of many consumers. Testing in a lab environment using only movement of the tires while the 
car body remains in a fixed position is not producing accurate results for use by consumers. It is a recommendation of 
this study that all hotels along the I-90 corridor provide a level 2 charger to their guests in the future to add 
convenience, promote green solutions for travel, and increase tourism. All Welcome Centers in Western Pennsylvania

need to provide a level 3 charger to encourage EV adoption and clean energy travel. Level 2 chargers are useful if 
there are services in the vicinity including malls or restaurants. If there are no service industries in the vicinity, it is 
recommended level 3 chargers are installed. There are so few fast chargers (level 3) in full operation in multiple spots 
along Interstate 90 that people driving gas-powered cars are unwilling to give up their cars due to inconvenience. 
Neaimeh et al. (2017) suggested fast chargers could be a solution to support EVs on trips—this study agrees with their 
conclusion. The study found fast chargers in multiple spots such as the Welcome Center and Chautauqua, NY would 
have helped the speed of travel and convenience. The new level 3 chargers in Erie, Pennsylvania at the Peach Street 
Walmart (available as of September 2019) will immensely help in attracting those with short-range electric vehicles. 
However, getting to Erie, Pennsylvania from Ontario, Canada will continue to be difficult without additional locations 
introducing level 2 and 3 chargers.  
Future recommendations include revisiting the same path with a 2019 or newer model Nissan Leaf or 
comparable car to see how improvements in battery range can help in a mid to long-range trip scenario. The addition 
of an automated data logger would help track information related to the trip. A repeat of the trip with a newer model 
car could see if planned improvements are operational and offer a better experience for driving time and convenience.

Abstract 
 So much interest has been drawn to producing more devices that will constitute the Internet of Things 
(IoT), however, the means to organize these devices into a network of things has remained a grey area. 
With the bulk of the emphasis channeled towards proliferating the number of embedded systems to 
compensate their growing demand, designing different IoT concepts and applications, and also 
prototyping different wireless sensor networks, a little concern has been directed to the study of quality of 
service relative to the exploding amount of data expected in the IoT network. In a typical IoT-based Smart 
Home Network, just as in our case, a ZigBee network, end devices send an enormous amount of data to 
the coordinator and other end devices through intermediary devices like routers. This, as a result, creates 
overhead application traffic in the coordinator’s queue. The built-up queue causes congestion and 
subsequent dropping of packets, increasing delay and reducing throughput. Therefore, it becomes 
imperative to develop an operative active queue model that will ensure quick and reliable data mobility 
within or by across multiple Personal Area Networks (PANs).  
This paper investigates a power-efficient ZigBee-enabled Smart Home Network that employs the Random 
Early Detection-Active Queue Management (RED-AQM) model to provide reliable data transport in the 
Smart Home context. We focus on the simulation of different network topologies for single and multiple 
PANs and identify the optimal network setup when using RED-AQM.

1. Introduction
ZigBee is a standard wireless protocol that enables the communication of smart devices in the IoT. It offers low-
cost, low-data rate, and ultimately low-power consumption is needed in a wireless sensor network and control 
networks. Its security, interoperability, reliability, ease of network deployment, and reduced power consumption, 
draws the attention of researchers to it. ZigBee can expand its network size by allowing more device connection to 
the Coordinator. This scalability feature is desired as the market for IoT and Smart Homes continue to grow. 
Within the Smart Home structure, several applications are executed concurrently in the same network or when 
interconnected to other networks through the internet. This causes new classes of problems to be encountered within 
these complex connections, especially as it relates to capacity planning and scheduling. To ensure optimal quality of 
service, it is important to examine several objectives such as minimizing collision rate, fault detection, decreasing

5. Conclusion 
This paper analyzes the RED algorithm in ZigBee network for queue management. It also reveals the effect of 
having more than PAN for a given number of nodes in a tree topology setting. The analysis shows that when RED 
active queue management is deployed in Tree Topology, there is improved throughput, less delays and data traffic 
dropped.  
Having settled that Tree topology outperformed Mesh and Star, we decided to examine the effect of having two 
ZigBee Coordinators, creating two different PANs, in the existing network. Interestingly, this did not indicate any 
enhancement for the Tree topology, although it did for Mesh by having 2ZCs.

The RED algorithm is not only an effective way for queue management, but also a handy technique for improving 
the performance of ZigBee network in this IoT era.

Abstract 
3D printing and CAD/CAM design is the technology with the biggest increase over the last six years; with 
market and patent creations increasing tenfold since 2013. Students in all fields have a need to learn these 
skills to become part of the technological world we are reaching. For the majority of that timeframe these 
technologies have also been mostly closed and used only from STEM classes, limiting the access to students 
in other fields. This paper will share the reasons behind the projects’ success, and the impact it has had on 
students from all fields including how students themselves are a key part of the program.

Abstract 
We evaluate the potential of utilizing the dynamic operations of a geographically distributed network of 
Distributed Edge Data Center units as Dispatchable Load (DL) to support the electricity grid independently 
and in coordination with traditional Distributed Energy Resource (DER) assets (e.g. Wind, Solar, and 
Energy Storage). Traditional Data Center operations represent a very stable and high-density electrical load 
on a 24/7/365 basis with little fluctuation in demand. If the electrical load of a datacenter is dispatched (i.e. 
removed/reduced from the grid), this Demand Response (DR) can provide an automated, immediate and 
flexible load balancing value to the grid.  In addition, using Modular Edge Data Center units to serve as an 
anchoring host for interconnection of traditional DER assets leverages the interconnection investment, can 
alleviate grid capacity constraints and more efficiently utilizes renewable energy generation produced on 
site.

Abstract 
Organizations follow survival in competitive business environment to be successful. Their aim is to 
offer better services to their customers. Whether service organizations or production companies are 
depended on the improvement and development of their services to increase the profitability in the 
future. To this purpose, selecting an appropriate business location is one of the most important 
systematic decision especially in the field of services and its outcomes has long-term effects. This 
research is conducted to scientifically locate Mehr Eghtesad bank branches. First the bank locating 
criteria are chosen through literature review, interviewing by experts and considering the available 
information layers in GIS environment. Best-worst method (MWM) is used to obtain the weight of 
criteria. These weights are the inputs of ArcGIS software. After entering the data into GIS, locating is 
done. Then the area which gets the highest priority is determined and its points are considered as 
candidate points in the marked areas which are the outputs of GIS. These points are considered as the 
entrance of clustering. They are clustered by Fuzzy C-Means method. Then the cluster that obtains the 
highest priority is determined by TOPSIS method. The points which are in that cluster is prioritized 
by COPRAS (COmplex PRoportional ASsessment) method. At the end, the proper places are 
determined to inaugurate the bank branches.

Vast changes in the business environment such as demographics, technology, and globalization changes lead to 
the competitive atmosphere (Oblinger & Verville, 1998). Many factors like industry, region, and time (Fritsch, 
Brixy, & Falck, 2006) and having the competitive advantages such as customer value or customer satisfaction 
(Woodruff, 1997), innovation in services (Nijssen, Hillebrand, Vermeulen, & Kemp, 2006), Information 
Technology (Powell & Dent-Micallef, 1997) and proper location (Porter, 1994) can help businesses to maintain 
the more competitive position than other competitors. Among those factors, selecting location is one of the most 
important systematic decisions (Cabello, 2017) (Turley & Fugate, 1992). Because we can't easily change the 
location of a facility, locating a company or facility have strategic importance (Cinar, 2010) (Owen & Daskin, 
1998). The importance of locating decisions is so much that 80 percent of routine decisions of public and private 
sectors are directly or indirectly to this field (Kang, Kim, & Jang, 2007). Due to the critical role of locating 
problem in commercial successes, decisions making on selecting a proper place is convert to one of the 
important problems especially in developing countries (Fung, 2001). On the other, location decisions are 
affected by many criteria (Cabello, 2017) that some of them are quantitative and some are qualitative (Chou,

Abstract 
Over the years, many issues have complicated the tasks of systems engineers. These include evolving legacy and off-
the-shelf components, contextual specificity, extensively large structures, and lack of clarity in multiple expectations 
and outcome. Thus, there is a need to develop an effective systems engineering workforce that can efficiently work in 
complex system problem domains. Two important questions that are not well defined in the existing body of literature: 
(1) What are the fundamental attributes of systems engineering that would impact the performance of individual
system engineers? (2) What are the leading indicators for appraising the performance of an individual systems
engineer? To answer the aforementioned questions, we conducted an extensive review of the literature on systems
engineering to identify the fundamental attributes of systems engineering and the corresponding performance
indicators that can measure each attribute. This review supports the development of a new systems engineering
performance measurement tool that captures and assesses the performance of individual systems engineers. This
performance is based on assessing the leading indicators of the fundamental systems engineering attributes. The
outcome of this instrument will generate a unique profile for individual systems engineers and allows engineers to
improve their systems engineering skills to better deal with the increasing intricacies of the design and operation of
complex systems.
Keywords 
Systems engineering, systems skill, effective system engineers, performance instrument, and complex system.

Abstract 
Improvements are required in any industry to increase the productivity by decreasing the defects 
in any process and also remove the overall waste produced during any production inside the manufacturing facility. 
There are many process improvements techniques available for identify the problem causing factors for defects and 
one of the most famous techniques is Six Sigma technique which is widely used to identify the real problem causing 
factors by use of different tools such as DMAIC which is nothing but Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control. 
In this particular plastic manufacturing industry, the main problem was time required for tool change over was very 
large which result in long waiting time for production as different dies and mold where required for production of fuel 
tanks. The real reason behind delay in tool or die changeover was required to be found as the overall production was 
decreasing which resulted in lot of customer unsatisfaction and also company could not reach its daily production 
targets. By use of Six Sigma tools main aim is to find factors causing time delay in tool and dies change over and to 
find factors which will solve the problem in analyze phase. It was identified that by SMED i.e. Single Minute 
Exchange of Dies technology can be used to improve total time required for tools, dies and molds changeover which 
will increase efficiency by 50%. In the process of Six Sigma tools used in define phase are project charter and SIPOC 
then cause and effect diagram, pareto chart, and brainstorming tools are used in measure phase, in analyze phase run 
chart and process capability analysis is used and in improve phase by use of run chart and process capability analysis 
it is made sure that process is really improved. 
Keywords: Process Improvement, Changeover time, Six Sigma, DMAIC process, SMED. 
1. Introduction
Six Sigma is always used by many companies and many case studies are available in the literature, e.g. Motorola, 
General Electric, Honeywell, AlliedSignal, Raytheon, and Delphi Automotive have implemented Six Sigma programs 
(Treichler, et al., 2002). Six Sigma is a tool which helps to improve the productivity by identifying the waste and 
removing them in improve phase which helps to increase the overall efficiency of the production and also customer 
satisfaction in a great way. Any industries they are more interested to remove the waste which causes more inventory 
and huge investments and also high level of customer satisfaction by use of six sigma tools the root causes are found 
and they are removed to increase the overall efficiency and customer satisfaction. Six Sigma helps to improve the 
quality of the product by identifying the defects and after that removing the defects which helps to achieve target of 
3.4 defects per million opportunities. The other main motive of using six sigma study is to decrease overall product 
cycle time and also to increase production rate of the industry. Tools, molds and dies are the most important factor in 
an any plastic manufacturing industry. In this particular industry different tools and different molds are used as per

From the figure 24 we can see that the CP value initially was less than 1 therefore it shows that system is capable 
enough to do changeover of tools, molds in less time, but in figure 25 we can see that now after implementing six 
sigma tools it is now sure that process of changeover has become robust as we can see that it is going to sigma level 
of 1.2 which is really a good notion for the improvement of the system. To check whether the data obtained has a 
confidence interval we check it in excel with 95% confidence interval and from figure 26 it is clear that the observed 
data can produce same result for maximum time in a large scale.

6. Conclusion 
 
By implementing the six sigma DMAIC tools it became very easy to identify the real problem in this plastic 
manufacturing industry which really helped to increase the overall tool, mold and die changeover efficiency than 
previous by 50%. Initially on an average all the process of changeover from tool, mold, pin, plate and final connector 
it used to take on an average 95 min but now after implementing the six sigma tools it helped to remove this time 
consuming process of changeover now new time for the changeover for head tool, mold, plate, pin and final connector 
came to on an average of 70 min which is really a good improvement. By use of six sigma tools the real problem 
causing factors where found in analyze phase which made it very clear that head tool changeover took a lot of time 
delay which may have been caused by new worker or tools are not in the required place as which resulted in the delay 
and more time for the changeover of tool. The other problem identified in analyze phase was mold changeover also 
took lot of time as the location of the mold storage area was far off from the machine which resulted in time delay in 
changeover operation of mold. In improve phase the location of mold storage was changed from the previous in which 
the new one was now very next to the machines, therefore now it became very easy for the operator to pick the required 
mold to be change in less time which helped to decrease the overall changeover time just by simply modifying the 
location of mold storage area. In this project SMED single minute exchange of die concept is used in which it is made 
sure that all the changeover of the parts takes place in just one minute or must not exceed 10 minutes.

Introduction to Improving Adaptive Snow-Sports through 
Engineering Design, 
Ergonomic Form and Function. 
Elizabeth O’Neill 
Ph.D. Candidate 
Design and approval of surveys and follow-up survey was cleared by State University of New 
York, University of Binghamton’s Institutional Review Board prior to any questionnaires or 
interviews being conducted.    
Abstract: 
Project focus is on improving adaptive ski/snowboard equipment through ergonomic design, form/function 
to increase participation in adaptive snow-sports.  By surveying users, instructors/coaches, manufacturers, 
and collected and categorize data, for both ergonomics and equipment functionality.  The areas that need 
improvement in practice and methodologies were presented and identified through two groups 
(instructors/participants).   
All areas are sighting for each problem where this sport can improve participation. Data was collected based 
on those variables and statistics were calculated.  Using that data and comparing them with both groups 
(participants/instructors) helped identify similar issues within those groups.  Ranking that data for the top 
categories gave some more predominant issues.   
Next to cost, lift and lift issues, equipment failure/comfort, communications, and not having enough 
instructors were all part of those categories.   
Following up with adaptive snow-sports instructors to confirm further information from their teaching 
perspective, was gathered to assist in updating some equipment standards and adaptive teaching practices.  
This area was another one of “top categories” identified from our original survey data. Using the identifying 
and qualitative information; I plan to work with Rehabilitation Engineering & Assistive Technology Society 
of North America, “RESNA” proposed standards committee to promote new standards for adaptive ski 
equipment to enhance the future of adaptive snow-sports.   
Investigating future teaching practices and methods will be discussed as a virtual lesson simulation for 
adaptive snow-sports.  Having a way to “try” a ski lesson and understand how your body should react in 
the situation would allow the student to comprehend skiing techniques properly and be ready to take one in 
real life. 
Using the recorded adaptive ski /snowboard practices from users and instructors in my initial survey 
collection.  Evaluating those practices and calculating the proper lifting limits for instructors, using 
established National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health “NIOSH” revised lift guidelines; 
immediately showed a need for elimination of lifting capacities presently on instructors.   
We can assist the future teaching methods to exclude any lifting by promoting self-loading sit-skis and 
establish these as the new RESNA standard.  Resulting in reduced injuries from strenuous lifting or painful 
movements by adaptive instructors.   
Meaning, we could change future manufacturing methods for the sit-ski models.  Some already follow this 
current design, so it is not an unknown design concept.

Abstract 
Humans keep using limited resources inefficiently without realizing that these resources will deplete to a small amount 
sometime in the future. With the ever-growing world, it is nearly impossible to rely solely on these resources for a 
long-term duration, the reason being why these resources should be changed for renewable ones. Another major reason 
to look for alternate resources is that non-renewable sources are environmentally unfriendly. Global warming and high 
levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have forced us to think about alternative for these resources. The renewable resources’ 
objectives dominate beneficially above from the minor contradictory ones that can be presented.

Abstract 
In this study, bio waste was vermicomposted as waste management strategy. The bio waste was 
vermicomposted over a period of 70 days with an earthworm loading of 600 earthworms/m2. Standard 
compost at the same conditions was also made and the changes in the total organic carbon (TOC), 
total nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorous (TP), total potassium (TK) and total calcium (TCa) were 
monitored using standard methods. The significance of the differences in the parameters composition 
was determined using Statistica 12.0’s box plots and t-test at 95% confidence interval. The TOC 
showed a 73% higher decrease in vermicompost in comparison to the standard compost. The TKN, 
TP, TK and TCa showed superior increases of 30%, 25%, 19% and 50% in the vermicompost in 
comparison to the standard compost. The TP and TKN showed significant variations between 
vermicompost and the standard compost at 95% confidence interval.

The box plot suggests that TCa (%) is higher in vermicompost compared to compost. Using the t-test we get 
p=0.0729. At significance level 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis. There is no sufficient evidence that 
the TCa (%) in vermicompost differs from that in compost.

Abstract 
Huge amounts of agricultural waste are being generated daily in Sub Saharan Africa and are being left to 
rot resulting in the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the environment 
and eventually climate change effects. In this study, agricultural waste was converted to bio char and its 
potential to be used as an additive in shoe wax production evaluated. Slow pyrolysis of the agricultural 
waste was done at 400 °C for 3 hours resulting in a bio char yield of 65%. This bio char was added with 
beeswax in the ratio 1:1 to result in a shoe wax. The produced shoe wax physiochemical properties 
compared very well to the standard shoe waxes available on the market. This study revealed that agro waste 
bio char can be utilized as a raw material in organic shoe wax production.

The production of bio char from agro waste can be used as a waste management strategy. Agricultural 
waste bio char poses as a raw material for natural shoe wax production. In addition to having the same 
characteristics as shoe polish already on the market, bio char shoe polish stands out as an attractive product 
due to the natural ingredients utilized.

Abstract 
This paper presents the treatment of municipality water using watermelon seeds as natural coagulants and 
bio filter in the water treatment process. A significant reduction in water physicochemical parameters was 
observed notably the BOD and COD by more than 79% to meet the WHO guidelines for drinking water. 
A process treating 25 m3/day of the water for portable uses was processed and the design of the bio filter 
presented. An economic assessment for applying this technology in water treatment showed a payback 
period of 10 months with a rate of return of 28% upon investing $295 000.00.

5","5.2 Return on Investment 
The Return on Investment (ROI) is basically a measure of the amount of capital invested in the project and is used to 
evaluate the efficiency of the investment in relation to its cost. . The ROI can be defined as the ratio of the net 
annual profit to the total investment.  
 
The ROI of 28% was very low indicating the economic potential of using water melon seeds in water treatment as a 
coagulant. 
5.3 Payback Period  
The payback period refers to the time at which the initial cash outflow of an investment is recovered from the initial 
cash investment. Payback period can be defined as the ratio between the initial investment and the cash inflow per 
‘given period.  
 
The calculated payback period for this study was 10 months indicating an economic viable process.  
NB: Since this is a process improvement on the part of the existing process, therefore less payback time is 
justifiable. 
 
 
5.4 The Net Present Value  
The Net Present Value (NPV) is an economic indicator which is defined as the difference between the present cash 
inflow values and the present cash outflow values. The NPV is a capital budgeting technique and is calculated as 
indicated below: 
 
Where Ct = net cash inflow during the period t; Co = total initial investment costs; r = discount rate, and t = number 
of time periods  
The NPV in this study was $7 438.33. A positive net present value indicates that the projected earnings generated by 
a project or investment exceed the anticipated costs (also in present dollars). This investment is profitable since it 
has a positive NPV.  
6. Conclusion  
Watermelon seeds which are abundantly available in Zimbabwe can be used to purify water for portable uses in 
Southern Africa. The watermelon seeds when employed as a coagulant which is chemical free can significantly 
decrease the COD, BOD, EC and TDS to meet acceptable limits of portable water. An economic assessment of 
applying this technology indicated a payback period of 10 months and a rate of return of 28% after investing $294 
927.00 showing the economic viability of applying this technology.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution is being fostered in many countries to make more efficient and flexible 
plants. Industry 4.0 target is to get a more competitive industry. Under this framework, improvement of 
mineral processing requires knowledge of previous methods and current technology in order to develop 
new techniques and approaches. As phosphate deposition decreases, the need for new recovery methods 
keeps growing. From this perspective, the need for control and optimization of existing processes 
becomes a necessity. It also includes the development of equipment with more advanced digitized 
components. The objective of our work is to develop a model of a process plant using SysML. In this 
paper, we adopted a system engineering-based approach, which consists on modeling and formalizing 
knowledge collected in the field. A well understanding of phosphate value chain allows both driving 
and optimizing current processes. In addition, we used this approach to model information flows in 
which we integrated a specific equipment in the overall process. This model will follow a systems 
engineering approach. In this paper we present the development of the SysML model of a process plant 
(Wash plant of phosphate). The model includes the requirements as well as the structure, behaviour and 
activity diagrams. A specific type of mining processes were studied with aim of giving feedback on the 
implementation of system modeling for mineral processing.

The preparation of the Excel material balance was made from the particle size distribution obtained at the 
laboratory scale. The results found make it possible to calculate the mass flow rate of solid (ton/h), the water flow 
(m3/h), the solid rate (%), the density (ton/m3) and the volume flow rate of the pulp (m3 / h) at the output of each 
equipment. (Figure 4) 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Model-Based Engineering is necessary for the engineering of the industry 4.0 systems. In this paper we have 
developed a SysML model of a process Wash Plant of phosphates. This model can be used for the design of the 
plant and for all the engineering activities through the plant life cycle. Our adopted approach summarizes various 
modeling tools working with a well-known industrial partner in Phosphate valorization. Using these approaches, 
we will guarantee efficient beneficiation processes by optimizing their operating parameters. Simulation through 
Excel allows the analysis of properties and performance of each equipment. 
In future works, we will investigate the possibility to generate Excel simulation from any SysML model by 
defining a map from SysML to Excel elements.

Abstract  
 
The incumbent trend in process industry is to deploy Information and communication technology 
(ICT) enabled wired process control systems. Distributed control system, Supervisory control and 
data acquisition systems with wireless open loop control systems are commonly used to facilitate the 
same. However, wireless closed loop control systems have not yet been introduced in the process 
industry. The major theme of this work is to model the enablers of implementing ICT enabled 
control system in the process industry based on their interrelationships. Interpretivestructural 
modeling (ISM) methodology is applied for the development of structural relationship among the 
enablers from a strategic perspective. Fuzzy MICMAC analysis is then carried out to categorize 
these factors based on their driving and dependence value. The paper is concluded with an action 
plan for enhancing high driving power elements and managerial implications.

1.Introduction 
Current researchers and practitioners are extremely being fascinated by the adoption of ICT as it will be highly 
beneficial [1] to all fields of business. In continuation to this, the field of education has significantly improved 
due o he adoption of ICT.  Recent trend in education is to implement different types of educational programs 
using ICT [2]. While peeping in to the world of literature, a plethora of research can be witnessed in internet 
based control systems accessing data wirelessly from a remotely located process. Monitoring and controlling of 
such systems are done by using Wireless and Internet communications technologies [3]. 
A wireless communication system has a number of advantages, not least the mobility of the devices within the 
environment. Adding in a communication device to the system or removing one from it without any disruption 
to the remainder of the system is cakewalk. Keeping apart the initial outlay on setting up the cell sites, the cost

In the selected enablers1, 8 and 10 are coming under autonomous. Autonomous elements are very weak so it can 
even be eliminated from the system. The second cluster elements are 5, 6 and 11.They are having high dependent 
power and small driving power and are coming under dependent. The elements 2 and 9are coming under 3rd cluster 
(linkage). Elements in the linkage are key enablers. They are considered as very powerful enablers who can affect 
the system and should be handled carefully. Elements 3,4 and 7 are under 4th cluster- independent group. They have 
high driving power and low dependence power. They will also affect the system. In fuzzy MICMAC analysis a 
‘transition region’ is also considered which is shown in blue color.  
3. Results and Discussions 
The proposed Fuzzy ISM model is an endeavor for identifying the key enablers that influence the implementation of 
ICT enabled wireless control system in process industries. An analysis of the driving power dependence diagram, 
ISM MICMAC and FUZZY MICMAC shows that FUZZY MICMAC is the precise method to identify the key 
enablers. After discussing with three industrial experts in the GM level and two experts from academia, an action 
plan has been formulated for enhancing the key enablers for the successive implementation of ICT enabled wireless 
control in industry. 
Based on the fuzzy MICMAC, the following findings are reported: 
1) The essential factors for the successful implementation of ICT enabled control system in process industries could 
be understood in advance. 
2) Fuzzy MICMAC helps to identify the key enablers from the eleven enablers. 
3) With the help of experts in industry and academia, by nourishing the identified enablers, ICT enabled wireless 
control system can be implemented in the industry. 
4)  Implementation of the ICT enabled wireless control system decreases the usage of several instruments in the 
process, thereby cutting down the costs and increases overall efficiency of the system. 
As a future scope the research can be further extended by incorporating more enablers. Hypothesis testing and 
management modeling further catalyzes the relationships. Similar research is possible for inhibitors of ICT enabled 
process control system, which is under progress. 
4. Conclusion 
The fields of management are swarming with innumerable models and elicitations of experts. ISM is well proven to 
utilize the experts’ knowledge and experience [14]. This research illustrates theinter - relationships between the 
enablers of ICT enabled wireless control system using ISM. Further, by the introduction of Fuzzy ISM more precise 
identification of the key enablers has been made. In this work, eleven enablers of ICT enabled wireless control 
system were identified and considered for analysis. The identification of the key enablers and awareness of their 
driving power and dependence from the Fuzzy MICMAC help the experts in industry to focus on them and prioritize 
them for successfully implementing ICT enabled wireless control systems. This study thus  helps the industrialists to 
enhance the key enablers, which will be highly beneficial  to the process industries.

Abstract
Quality management represents an increasing concern and a critical issue for project managers. Non-
conformance to quality usually result in failures and defects, which may possibly require 
reconstruction, even with minor design and operations defects. Failures or defects in constructed 
projects can result in extensive costs, increased delays, and in the worst case, fatalities, injuries and 
other safety concerns. As the most important decisions are made during design and planning phases, 
components configurations, functional performance, and material specifications must be embedded in 
quality control to ensure conformance to original design and planning decisions during the construction 
process. This article focuses on the growing debate generated by researchers and project teams 
into how quality management should respond to the challenges of defects and failures of construction 
projects. Also, the research should reflect on the concepts of quality control or quality assurance 
(QC/QA), quality management systems, quality work functions, quality control versus quality 
assurance, quality management application to projects, project quality and energy-related regulations, 
design quality issues, site inspections, conformance to quality management requirements by project 
managers, and the benefits and challenges. The key questions are “how does quality management 
addresses defects and failures in construction projects?” and “how do we meet the challenges and 
achieve the benefits of quality management?” drawing on literature, case studies, and secondary 
data. The rest of the article is keen to an explication and critical appraisal of the quality management 
standards in the construction industries in developing economies. It is a step that requires further 
analysis, and that provide project managers with a window of hope, of taking control, of defects and 
failures of construction projects.

Abstract 
 
Posture has an important role in mobility, breathing, muscle efficiency, and injury prevention for 
any human activity, including console gaming. Proper posture allows players to minimize the work 
muscles needed to exert while playing, thus allowing them to play for longer durations of time 
without much discomfort. One of the key features of proper posture is correct positioning of the 
shoulder blades, which is affected by the position of the thoracic spine. This study involves the 
construction of an ergonomic console chair dedicated to a specific demographic in order to 
improve the posture and comfort that experience while playing, with its dimensions being based 
specifically on the average Filipino male workers body measurements. One design the researchers 
proposed incorporated an underarm support system meant to guide the shoulder blades into proper 
position, thus overall improving the user’s posture. To further test the effects of using this 
ergonomic chair, it was compared to that of an ordinary non-ergonomic chair, in terms of its effects 
on the user’s comfort and performance. Prior observation in a local gaming shop was done to study 
what posture related problems players experienced while playing. In addition, both a pre-
experiment and a post-experiment survey were conducted to test the chair’s effect on the user’s 
comfort and experience. The experiment proper had participants play two gaming sessions on each 
chair, with the variable in question being the scores each player attained per session. After 
gathering all necessary data, various statistical tools were used to determine the chair’s 
effectiveness. Based on the statistics, the ergonomic console chair has proved to be effective in 
improving a user’s experience and performance.

Abstract 
 
The main aim of this research study is to place the distinct experiences of Jordan’s acquisition of energy in a broader 
empirical set of research, and to place Jordan’s energy sector in the larger context of the global economic crisis, the 
Arab Spring, and the Egyptian Revolution. The methodology that was adopted for this study described as qualitative 
by conducting several semi-structured interviews with managers in medium and top-level positions that were related 
to energy sector as targeted respondents, 32 managers were participated in this study. Further, reviewed the related 
literature in order to collect the necessary and required qualitative data from secondary sources such as statistical 
reports, previous studies, etc. As a result, to achieve effective managing of supply chain energy resources, the 
Jordanian government’s short-term solution due to the reduced natural gas supplying from Egypt was alternatively 
purchasing the necessary quantities from some Gulf countries such as Qatar and/or Saudi Arabia, which can be 
imported with two possible methods. The first method is to rent a ship equipped with a liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
terminal, which is currently operating. The second method requires equipping the Aqaba port with an LNG terminal, 
which also is currently operating. In the long-term, a viable solution to depending on importing expensive and often 
unreliable natural gas supplies from surrounding countries is to depend more heavily on renewable supply energy, 
including solar, wind, and water energy.

1. Introduction 
 
In the last eight years, it was challenging years for the Jordanian economy, which caused a variety of negative effects 
from the Arab Spring, which was taken place in neighboring countries. Since 2011, Jordan has experienced 
catastrophic shocks in the increased prices of imported goods, due to a large extent to the Arab Spring, specifically in 
Egypt. The cessation of a reliable source of gas from the Arab Gas Pipeline has heightened existing tensions within 
Jordan, including a decrease in tourism and internal as well as external political tensions. Production of natural gas 
within Jordan in 2011 was only 3% of the country’s needs, with the majority being imported from Egypt, with this 
figure being 806 million cubic in 2011 alone (IMF, 2012; MEMR, 2011; and MPIC, 2013). This is a 65% decrease 
from 2010, due to instability from the Arab Spring within Egypt, which led to 13 bombings of the Arab National Gas 
Pipeline in 2011, and a -84.2% decrease in the supply of that year. This forced Jordan to substitute natural gas with 
heavier crude oil, resulting in a 58% rate of increase in its use, as well as a rise in diesel oil consumption by 433% 
from 2010 to 2011 (IMF, 2012). These heavier fuels are much more expensive than natural gas, placing a huge stress 
on the Jordanian economy (MPIC, 2013). Since 2012, the Arab Gas Supply Pipeline, which carries natural gas from 
Egypt through the Sinai Peninsula and to Jordan and Israel, has been attacked more than forty-two times. Jordan 
imported around eighty percent of its necessity of natural gas (about 250 million cubic feet of natural gas per day) 
from Egypt to generate particularly electricity, while twenty percent being produced locally. Jordan has utilized 
multiple alternatives to address the interruption of the available natural gas supply from Egypt. The Jordanian 
distributed power plants now rely on the use of heavy fuel oil and diesel for electricity generation; in this case, costing

Another interviewee added: 
“An LNG port needs 3 years to be ready to work”. 
 
According to Jordinvest, the Kingdom planned to spend $1.4-3.8 million JD on oil shale exploration from the year 
2007-2020 (MEMR, 2011). This investment will hopefully tap into the 40 billion tons of shale in the country. Burning 
oil shale requires advanced technologies that were offered to Jordan by Estonian Shale companies, along with a fund 
from the Gulf States to build the necessary plant to extract energy. Once again, time is of the essence, and the timeline 
of construction includes a 2018 completion date. The interviewees stated that: 
“The shale oil is another alternative”. 
Another expert in the energy sector explained that: 
“Using shale oil needs at least four years, a generating station is needed”. 
 
4.3 The case of Iraq 
 
The Jordanian composition of energy consumption has been discussed in the Kingdom’s Master Energy Plan, 
including the hopes of a major increase in imports of natural gas from Iraq. This solution, which would include a 
simple pipeline from Iraq to Jordan, is the most straightforward and least costly solution. Unfortunately, like with 
Egypt, political unrest in the region has prevented this option from maturing into reality. In this context, this was 
confirmed during the research: 
“The Iraqi Gas is an option but it is not possible at the moment because of the political situation there” 
 
4.4 Towards adopting solar systems  
 
In a country, that only receives 200 mm of rain each year; solar energy seems an obvious solution. Currently, families 
throughout the country use solar energy to heat their water. However, although there is an almost unlimited amount 
of solar energy in Jordan, the lack of technology to store large amounts of this energy prohibit this option from solving 
any major source of Jordan’s energy problems in the near future. A one of the interviewee confirmed this:  
“Solar energy can help in solving only 15% of the problem”. 
4.5 The case after Egyptian revolution 
From anonymous sources in the Jordanian Energy sector, be them a specialist or prominent employee, a clear 
distinction has been drawn between the regime in power in Egypt, and the occurrence of bombings on the Egyptian 
gas pipeline. In 2012, Mohammed Morsi, chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood’s “Freedom and Justice Party”, was 
elected as the new head of state to replace Hosni Mubarak, the final Prime Minister of Egypt. During the first Egyptian 
Revolution, the Egyptian Pipeline to Jordan was attacked 13 times. Notably, after Morsi came into power, the pipeline 
ceased to be attacked. Unfortunately, since Morsi was removed in July 2013 by the military, the pipeline has been 
attacked twice more. By monitoring the pipeline attacks, one finds reasonable doubt that the attacks have been 
politically motivated. This was confirmed during the interviews: 
“The Egyptian revolution cuts the gas flow to Jordan”. 
Another energy expert also confirmed that: 
“Politics reasons are behind the cut after the revolution”. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
This research has filled an important breach in the knowledge of the Jordanian energy crisis, with a particular emphasis 
on the economic impact on the Kingdom, with the general conclusion that in order to address the difficulty, both the 
public and private energy sectors must work in conjunction in order to solve the energy crisis. Since the setbacks faced 
are all outside of the country’s borders, private profits must put aside to accelerate securing alternative sources of 
energy. 
 
The main aim of this research was to place the distinct experiences of Jordan’s acquisition of energy in a broader 
empirical set of research, coming to conclusions and recommendations based upon experience and observation rather 
than theory or logic, and to place Jordan’s energy sector in the larger context of the global economic crisis, the Arab 
Spring, and the Egyptian Revolution. The success of Jordan’s energy sector was found to be completely dependent on 
49","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Toronto, Canada, October 23-25, 2019 
© IEOM Society International 
the stability of surrounding countries, as well as the international economy. Egypt was found to be of chief importance 
to a stable import of energy, specifically with the loss of multiple billions of dollars at beginning in 2009, when the 
restrictions on imports and the bombings of the gas line in 2011 ultimately stopped most imports of natural gas, the 
source of 80% of Jordan’s electricity. This, along with the lack of any immediately available domestic or international 
sources of natural gas has led to the use of heavy oil, dramatically driving up the cost of energy and creating a 
seemingly endless cycle of loss for the Kingdom. Many studies found a relationship with the political regime in power 
in Egypt and the bombings of the Egyptian pipeline, more importantly the availability of stable and affordable energy. 
Since 2009, the cost of energy has increased the government subsidies of gas and electricity increased, and with no 
viable solution to this. Despite the options theoretically available to diversify, instability in Iraq, and the several 
yearlong process to create the necessary structures and infrastructure in short do not cut it. An expedited timeline must 
take place to end the catastrophe that has hit the country’s economic future. 
 
At this point, the private and public sectors must work together in order to create an environment in which the funding 
from Gulf States can be used most effectively. More capital must be pooled in order for these funds to be helpful to 
the Kingdom. Poor planning in the diversification of energy resources has further complicated the situation. For future 
research, there is a huge need to find where this economic capital can come from, and how the construction of an 
alternative port for liquefied natural gas can be expedited, in addition to researching how to store solar energy in the 
longer term. 
 
5.1 Research limitations and further research 
 
The analysis presented in this study suffers from some weaknesses and point it as follows:  
First, this study, due to a time limitation, relies mainly on secondary data for the data collection process (AL-Shboul, 
2016). The researcher was only able to conduct few and limited number of interviews with managers’ who are 
responsible for the energy sector in Jordan. Due to the highly demanding positions of management in the sector, they 
were either too busy and/ or did not want to cooperate with the researcher and were not able to give him an opportunity 
to meet them in interviews to collect the required data (AL-Shboul, 2016). Second, the use of a small number of 
managers rather than many in different positions is not sufficient to collect accurate data about the supply chain of 
energy resources, and may result in the inaccuracy of some measurements and/ or results (AL-Shboul, 2016). 
Therefore, the researcher suggests using many targeted mangers in leading positions, who are responsible for planning 
and organizing the supplying of energy from different resources in Jordan for data collection purpose in future research 
(AL-Shboul, 2016).

Abstract 
The purpose of the study is to investigate and uncover the impact work design and ergonomics have on employee 
productivity in an academic working environment. Human beings have been working since the beginning of time and 
work has evolved and transformed since. Now we are in the fourth industrial revolution and the employment sector is 
still in transformation. Humans are either negatively or positively impacted by the job they engage in on a daily basis 
and this research aims to unravel whether that impact negative or positive does it increase or decrease employee 
productivity in the workplace and in an environment of academia. The study also aims to suggest solutions on how to 
improve work design and ergonomics in an academic environment and to recommend possible strategies on how 
employee can perform better given the proper working conditions and work design. The Labour relations act, 
occupational health and safety act and the basic conditions of employment act provides employees and employers in 
the 21st century guidelines, rules and laws on how the employment sector should run nowadays but the research study 
aims to unravel whether these acts are being followed thoroughly or not and if employers are adhering to these laws 
which inevitably if adhered to product happier workers and healthier workers with no back pain and spine problems 
due to incorrect working conditions.

Figure 4.4 
The research study findings indicate that 42 per cent of people working in higher education institutions in Pretoria 
east are felt the chairs they sit on at work are comfortable while only 58 per cent stated that they felt their chairs were 
uncomfortable and did not give their backs full support. This means that most employees that answered the 
questionnaire for the sample study believed that the chair they used at work was not satisfactory and not useful for 
their backs and arms. 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
The research findings indicate that much more efforts are to be put in supporting employees working in the higher 
education institutions with regards to ergonomics and work design. The research also uncovered that there is indeed 
a relationship between proper work design and ergonomics and employee productivity. Proper work design and 
ergonomics help motivate employee because they are working comfortably and thus more work performance is 
achieved but if there is incorrect and improper ergonomics and work design inevitably less productivity and more 
absenteeism is the result. Recommendation is employers in higher education institutions must ensure that health and 
safety check and done and improvement of work design and ergonomics is done on a continuous and constant basis 
in order to manage the employee work demands and to support the employee.

Abstract 
 
The research seeks to uncover and investigate whether greening practices have an impact on employee morale and 
work performance that is productivity in the workplace. Human factors are defined as the study that describes 
human behavior mentally and physically when affected by particular conditions, environments, products and 
services. Wastage is an environment that affect employees negatively due to various factors namely filth, smell, dirt, 
pests etc, and this has a direct implication to their health and how they feel about coming to work. The conditions of 
working in a restaurant business are very favorable because of longs hours of standing, walking, carry plates, 
dealing with difficult customers etc and so an addition of unclean/ unhygienic surroundings is an added 
disadvantage. Greening standards comes in with added tasks but a more pleasant workplace and environment. The 
studies have proved that motivated and happy employees inevitably perform better in the workplace that is why the 
study aims at investigating how employees feel about greening practices and if the practices have a positive or 
negative impact on the employees and thus their performance on a daily basis. Restaurants contribute significant 
amounts to the GDP of all countries and so improvement of elements that impact the industry is imperative. 
Restaurants that are successfully implementing greening standards should teach and assist other restaurants to 
master what they have mastered. The research aims to unravel this concept and find possible solutions to solve the 
problems discovered in the study.

The graph above indicates the people working in the restaurant industry in Johannesburg North 58 per cent indicated 
that greening practices were helpful to them as employees and it had a positive impact to them and 42 per cent stated 
that the greening practices were not helpful and they had a negative impact to them in the work place. 
5. Conclusion
Employees have shown from this study that greening practices assist them in many ways in the workplace and the 
cleaner and hygienic the restaurant is the more they are encouraged and happy it is to be working there and thus their 
productivity increases. This research has proved that the more we train employees on greening standards the more 
they participate and are motivated to practice them on a daily basis and the more productive they become in the work 
place which means direct financial rewards for the employer. This is a clear positive impact that greening standards 
have on employee morale and work performance.

Abstract  
 
In agricultural farming, the use of conventional seeding process results in waste of time and increase in 
labor. The seed planting rate is slow and the time required for the total operation is long yet the total cost 
is high due to labor and hiring of equipment. Automatic Seed Sowing Machine can dig the ground and 
plant the seeds and cover it afterwards with soil. This undergraduate student project was inspired by 2030 
vision of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to create more sources of income and to meet local food demands. 
The development of this project will get us a step closer to the kingdom's vision by decreasing manpower 
dependency and increase in production. The project was carried out step by step from conceiving the 
main idea, sketching it on a piece of paper to discuss it within team members, designing each part with 
proper factor of safety, analyzed using 3D SolidWorks, manufactured and assembled as per design, and 
finally tested the prototype successfully. The results were encouraging yet leaving a lot of space for 
improvements such as remote control, solar power supply, and variable distance between seeding 
locations, and configuring the machine with GPS system.

Abstract 
Electricity access is closely linked to social equity and economic development of a society especially among the 
rural communities. In this study, we explore the feasibility and potential impacts of a renewable-based hybrid power 
system that provides clean and affordable electricity to a rural village in Sarawak state of Malaysia. Developed 
through a case study methodology, this work determines and analyses the potential of natural renewable resources 
for power generation purpose. According to the results from the resources estimation and surveys done, renewable-
based hybrid power system with solar, wind, biomass and hydro has been designed using a techno-economic 
optimization tool-HOMER software. The improved system also outweighs the existing diesel-fuelled system by 
saving 37.6 tonnes of greenhouse gases emission and having 52% lower in COE (cost of energy) and NPC (net 
present cost) despite there is a 6% annual capacity shortage. Based on the existing socio-economic status and the 
feedback from local community towards power generation issues, potential benefit of renewable-based hybrid power 
system on achieving sustainability and improving living standard of local community have been accomplished.

Introduction
Energy demand has been rising exponentially over the years to fulfill the energy requirements in this economically-
link and modern society. However, in Malaysia, energy poverty and lack of electricity generation in the rural area 
especially is exacerbating the poverty in this developing nation. In recent years, Malaysia has achieved 96.86% of 
24-hour electricity access and the electricity coverage in Peninsular Malaysia is the highest at 99.72% as compared
to Sarawak (88.01%) and Sabah (92.94%) (Islam et al. 2010). Recently, renewable energy sources (RES) arise to
become a potential alternative of replacing the conventional electricity generation sources (coal, natural gas, diesel
etc.) as well as reducing global warming and fuel cost to the minimum (Energy Commission 2016; Sovacool and
Drupady 2011).
Renewable energy is able to contribute significantly to meeting the power demand. It is mostly accessible in isolated 
areas; thus, it has high potential to supply electricity to such areas (Khor and Lalchand 2014; Ong et al. 2011). Many 
advanced countries willing to spend extravagantly on renewable energy and the development of its technology 
(Fadaeenejad et al. 2014). The renewable energy resources that have been established are solar photovoltaic (PV), 
wind, and hydro and biomass. 
Therefore, the main goal of this study is to analyze the economic feasibility of a designed renewable-based hybrid 
power system to meet the load demand of the selected area of study, in comparison with the existing off-grid diesel-
fueled power generation system.

Conclusions 
 
This paper presents a comparative analysis between an off-grid diesel power generation system and renewable-based 
hybrid power system in selected village of Sarawak, Malaysia. The optimization result portraits that the renewable-
based hybrid (PV-Wind-Diesel) is more economic and environmentally friendly compared to the conventional diesel

power generation system for the same load demand. From the simulation result, it is also investigated that the NPC 
of the optimized system is 50% lower than the existing system. Even though the existing system wins at electrical 
aspect with 0% capacity shortage, the optimized hybrid power system still outweighs in other aspect such as NPC, 
COE, renewability, environmental friendliness which are more important in a long term basis. Therefore, it can be 
said that the optimized renewable-based hybrid power system (PV-Diesel-Biomass) is the most suitable and cost 
effective system compared to the existing system and other optimized hybrid power system. The research objectives 
and aim for this project have been achieved.

Abstract  
 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been recognised as an important concept to concern by business 
organisations in recent years. CSR helps to ensure the organisations to mitigate the negative impacts of its operations 
on society and environment while maximizing its positive impacts. CSR has the powerful potential to make positive 
contributions to address the needs of weak communities. There are number of CSR activities that can be carried out 
by organisations. However, there are few in depth researches on CSR activities therefore, this research paper 
investigates the actual meaning of CSR and different CSR activities. Hence, a comprehensive literature survey was 
carried out to understand the concept of CSR, importance of CSR and different CSR practices of business 
organisations. A subsequent desk study identified thirty-nine (39) CSR activities which could be categorised into 
seven (07) core areas as “CSR relates to Organisational Governance”, “CSR Relates to Human Rights”, “CSR Relates 
to Labour Practices”, “CSR Relates to the Environment”, “CSR Relates to Fair Operating Practices”, “CSR Relates 
to Consumer Practices” and “CSR Relates to Community Involvement and Development”. It is essential to recognise 
the core areas relevant to social responsibility in an organisation, in order to continue the business with good reputation 
and by contributing to the country’s development.

 1. Introduction 
Over the decades, the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has continued to grow in importance and 
significance with the idea that business organisations have some responsibilities to the society beyond that of making 
profits for the shareholders (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). In addition to the production of goods and services, society 
expects that organisations will provide safety, improved lifestyle, employment, infrastructure, and environmental 
protection, without affecting cultural practices and benefits (Agarwal, 2008). As per Clyde (1999), CSR is a contract 
between society and business wherein a community grants a company a license to operate and in return the matter 
meets certain obligations and behaves in an acceptable manner. 
Clarkson (1995) stated that the fundamental idea of CSR is that business corporations have an obligation to work 
towards meeting the needs of a wider array of stakeholders. Moreover, accusations by governments and civil society 
alike, of environmental pollution, human rights abuses, and exploitation of labour in supply chains, has pressured 
companies into becoming more environmentally and socially responsible (Raynard & Forstater, 2002). However, the 
evidences available on CSR in developing countries suggests that the traditional profit-maximising view is still 
prevalent and it appears that knowledge and understanding of CSR is limited in Sri Lankan organisations (Korathotage, 
2012). Therefore, an attempt was made to study the current CSR practices of Sri Lankan business organisations. This

development programmes are the major CSR which has been highlighted more by authors which comes under “CSR 
relates to community involvement and development”.  
 
Hence, this paper encourages an agenda for future research to investigate and critically analyse the level of practice 
of each CSR activity, which could be identified through this study (Table 2). Such research will provide a clear picture 
of the current CSR practices of Sri Lankan organisations.

Abstract  
 
Today’s, especially the future’s, industrial focus is seriously being shifted towards new industrial revolutionized 
concept termed as industry 4.0. Everything associated with the industry (e.g. production machines, tools, facilities, 
systems, operations, components, services, products and environments etc.) is assumed to be digital and smart. So far, 
the industry 4.0 concept has been laid on the nine pillars or the building blocks which include; 1) the industrial internet 
of things (IIoT), 2) cloud computing (CC), 3) big data (BD), 4) simulation, 5) augmented reality (AR), 6) additive 
manufacturing (AM), 7) horizontal and vertical systems integration, 8) autonomous robots, and 9) cyber security. 
Augmented reality (AR) is considered as the important pillar which has been filtered out to comprehensively review 
in this paper. In order to capture uniform data picture, numerous search engines are used to collect the published data 
within the period of recent five years (2015-2019). The concept of AR connects the real world to the easily modifiable 
virtual world. Various sectors of AR has been found in literature which are widely scattered in various domains. It has 
been found that the use of AR is either objective-specific or area-specific. The implementation of AR based on the 
industry 4.0 concept has been practiced in industry but not on a large scale. Regarding the future work, there is a need

Abstract 
Six Sigma (6σ) is a globally established approach for the continuous improvement of production or service 
processes. Using a data- and statistic-driven approach, for example, error frequencies can be minimized and 
important performance characteristics can be improved to increase customer satisfaction. In 6σ DMAIC-, 
DMADV- and DMAEC-Projects mainly flowchart-based methods for modeling and analyzing business 
processes are used. These classical process modeling approaches are widely used in 6σ projects and are 
supported by leading 6σ process tools. However, flowcharts are less suitable for process modeling and 
analysis, e.g. for complex, semantically rich or concurrent process structures. For these cases, this article 
propagates the use of the specification language BPMN (Business Management Process Notation/ ISO/IEC 
19510:2013), which is a popular, standardized notation for business process management. It will be shown, 
which advantages the 6σ methodology can achieve by the inclusion of modern and well-established BPM 
modelling techniques. Using process examples, it is explained that BPMN has more powerful language 
functions for mapping complex process flows than flowchart based modeling. Furthermore, BPMN 
modelling tools will be demonstrated, which can support e.g. a simulation, visualization and automation of 
6σ – process workflows.

Abstract 
This study work seeks to develop a low cost design of a portable maize shelling machine for small scale farmers by 
reducing manufacturing cost and thereby making readily available on the market for the ever growing number of 
maize farmers in Zimbabwe. Three possible solutions were conceptualized, by comparing various parameters and 
use of a binary dominance matrix; a motor powered, combined de-husker and sheller was chosen for further 
development. Using locally available materials, explicit specifications of components were provided. SolidWorks 
2015 was used to generate both 2D and 3D engineering drawings of the final developed solution. Also some design 
simulations and economic analysis were done. Estimated manufacturing costs of the product amounted to USD296.  
Keywords :De-husking, sheller, maize, cost, design, farmer, sustainable. 
1. Introduction
Maize, also known as corn, is an important cereal grain widely consumed as food by man in almost all parts of the 
world. Nwakaire, et al.(2011), indicated that maize ranks third after rice and wheat in countries like India. In 
Zimbabwe, maize constitutes the staple food, with an average of 1.8 million metric tons required annually to feed 
both people and livestock.Darudkar and Handa (2015)consider maize to be also a vital raw material used in the 
production of various industrial products which include corn starch, corn oil, corn syrup and food sweetenersIn 
Zimbabwe, on average, one hectare produces about 0.8 metric tons of maize. Recent government programs such as 
the Targeted Command Agriculture have also brought about a sharp increase in the production of maize. The 
farming season of 2016/2017 had an average of 1.8 metric tons per hectare, recording a total of 2.2 million metric 
tons of maize throughout the country, Mutenga(2017).  
Maize crop goes through various stages of processing depending on the end use.Nwakaire, et al.(2011)lists 
harvesting, drying, de-husking, shelling, storing and milling as some of the most common processes 
practiced.Shelling is defined as the process of separating the seed or kernels from the cobs.It isan indispensable 
process that is aimed at maximizing storage space and lessening difficulty in handling of the grains. Adeleye, et 
al.,(2015)mentions maize shelling to beprobably the most necessary operation  in relation to the utilization  of  the 
commodity  as  it  affectsthe subsequent  processes and  storage. 
Mogaji(2016) however reports shelling to be a very tedious task, especially when done manually.Though tedious 
sometimes, Nwakaire, et al.(2011)still considered shelling as a process that improves shelf life and increases the net 
profit obtained by the farmer. Darukda & Handa (2015),also reported the average kernel price to be approximately 
twice that of the cob. Hence, decorticating the kernels and selling them by themselves will generate more income for 
the farmer.  
The difficult yet important process of shelling maize necessitates the design and production of maize shelling 
machine.Existing ones are mostly electric, hence sometimes not practically useful to the remote farmer who does not 
have access to electricity. Aremu, et al.(2015)argues that the few mechanical maize shellers are usually heavy and 
typically require more power input to operate yet they result in a low product quality considering the percentages of 
seed breakage and purity. Such arguments therefore clearly indicate thatinnovative designs of these shelling 
machines is still paramount.

Figure 12 Assembled maize sheller machine 
The economic advantages of an electro-mechanic maize sheller have well-nigh been over emphasized throughout 
the text. To the farmer, time and opportunity cannot be missed if one is to maximize in profits. On average, a farmer 
produces about 0.8 metric tonnes of maize per hectare in Zimbabwe. 
 
5. Recommendations 
The maize sheller design should also incorporate a blower or fan to enhance cleaning of shelled kernels.For 
improved safety, a guard bar or cage may be inserted over the belt and pulleys. For effective shelling, a maize 
moisture content of above 14%dry basis is recommended to improve the yield. Also addition of wheels is required 
for easy mobility within shelling area. For bigger operations an automatic packaging unit may be attached to the 
machine .The design has to be modified to incorporate other sources of power. If labor is included the cost of the 
machine (about US$450.00) may still be relatively high for farmers of little means to invest.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The need of innovative maize shellers by Zimbabwean maize producers is well defined. It was found that the 
production of this design makes economic sense and is worth it. Its production costof  USD297 is reasonably good 
compared to its potential economic benefits to anyone who would use the machine. It poses no environmental 
threats and all the required materials and skills are locally available, therefore it can be concluded that the design 
project must be implemented to save time during maize shelling by the small scale holder farmers.

Abstract 
This research study investigated tobacco curing activities in the country. Historically tobacco related activities were 
responsible for over 15% of annual deforestation in Zimbabwe, due to the energy intensive tobacco curing process 
by the majority of small scale farmers who use firewood as they find coal expensive to procure. This practice is not 
sustainable hence need to consider the feasibility of biogas as an alternative fuel for tobacco curing. The study was 
undertaken on a sample of small scale tobacco farmers, and the feed stock was mainly from dung from cattle, goats 
and chicken droppings. A technical evaluation was done for an average farmer, and came up with a 12m3 fixed 
dome biogas digester to produce 2.6 m3 of biogas on daily basis. A bulk tobacco curing barn of dimensions 3m x 4m 
x 8m was selected, and was calculated to require 1475,8 m3 of gas produced by the biomass digester which would 
generate up to 949m3 per annum. This was found to save up to 65% in energy requirements for the average farmer 
during curing. A general “feasibility calculator” for individual farmers was generated which other functions could be 
used to check individual farm biogas potential and compare it with required biogas for curing a specific amount of 
tobacco and give costing results for implementation if the farmer intended to consider biogas tobacco curing.

1. Introduction
The most popular method of producing flue cured tobacco by small scale farmers is the use of firewood, coal or 
charcoal. The tobacco industry though lucrative is not sustainable in its current state, the use of firewood leads to 
deforestation and coal is a non-renewable resource. Tobacco curing is responsible for a considerable amount of 
environmental degradation (Deangelis, 2007). In Zimbabwe the use of biogas has been popularly common in 
schools, prisons and livestock farms. Hence the prospects of using it as an alternative renewable energy source in the 
curing of tobacco. There are many factors involved in the biogas production process and also the curing process 
hence more focus is required to determine whether the current technology could enableeffective curingof tobacco 
with biogas from an economic and technical perspective; as well as coming with optimized digester and barn 
combination. 
2. Background
Tobacco is a product from curing leaves of the tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum). Its main uses are in the 
manufacture of cigarettes and also an additive in some medicine (Oppenoorth, 2014). The curing process is energy 
intensive and results in the drying, coloring and flavoring of the tobacco leaf. Tobacco farming is crucial to the 
Zimbabwean economy, as it is a major foreign currency earner.In 2016 alone total export proceeds amounted to 
$933.7 million at an average price of $5.67/kg (TIMB, 2016). However it is not without its own challenges 
according to the Forestry Commission, 15% of annual deforestation in Zimbabwe is due to tobacco related 
activities(Mwareya, 2014). To mitigate this production of biogas could be produced from anaerobic digestion of 
organic material through thebiological break down of organic matter in the absence of oxygen(Ndhlovu, 2017). 
Biogas is mainly composed of methane and carbon-dioxide. The use of biogas as an alternative energy sourcehas 
recently become popular with farmers and schools attempting the venture. Biogas is described as a low cost clean

A very clear observation is a cold spot at the bottom of the barn during all curing stages - this is due to the contact of 
water vapor from the leaves with cooler air at the exhaust.  For a perfectly cured batch of tobacco there may need to 
be some rotation of the tobacco or place the more ripe tobacco in the lower shelves as it takes less energy to cure. 
This profile is basically the same for all downdraft bulk barns and the effect on cured tobacco quality has never been 
raised meaning the effect is minimal to the end results of curing.  
 
6.4 Design summary 
Biogas digester size=12m3 
Biogas digester type=fixed dome 
Gas produced per day=2.6m3 
Total biogas per year=948.9 m3 
Biogas required to produce 2.8 tons cured tobacco =1475.8m3 
Barn type=Bulk barn  
Barn dimensions=3m x 4m x 8m 
Biogas burner type= premix (stainless steel) 
Burner flow rate of gas = 18.1 liters per minute at energy demand 
Burner dimensions:  
Gas jet diameter= 5mm 
 
 
 
Throat and primary air intake diameter=44mm 
 
 
 
Area distribution = 20x10mm diameter holes 
 
Biogas can be used to cure tobacco as it can definitely reach desired temperatures. The burner has been designed and 
it can be retrofit in an existing bulk barn as other bulk barns already use gas burners for curing tobacco curing. The 
biggest challenge to technical feasibility is that the amount of biogas required for this energy intensive process for 
the average farmer is much more than one can produce on a average farm area. 
7.Recommendations 
The need for renewable energy sources in the tobacco industry cannot be overemphasized, the industry is vital to the 
nation of Zimbabwe however it may be doing more harm than good in the long run. Beside biogas there are other 
energy options that can be used for curing tobacco in a sustainable manner and these include using solar energy and 
also firewood from sustainable sources. There have already been studies on the use of solar and efficient curing 
systems such as the rocket barn show the potential for a sustainable tobacco curing future. Combining either of these 
sustainable solutions will result in increased reliability of tobacco barns that use the technology for instance 
combining biogas and solar allows curing to occur even when there is no sun to supply solar energy as the biogas 
system can act as a backup. Such a system allows for minimal amounts biogas to be used thus ensuring that the 
supply will be able adequate in the case of the average tobacco farmer as defined by project research. 
 
In order to generate enough gas, the most ideal solution would to be to have a biogas digester that can generate 
enough gas continuously such that curing requirements are met without much need for gas storage but such a 
digester would be uneconomical to build at best not to mention the biomass required to feed the digester would be 
too much for a single farmer. Thus, the researchers suggest having a combination of biogas digesters in a 
community connected to a single gas storage point which will be connected to the retrofitted tobacco curing barn.  
The system can be made active as the curing season approaches with farmers connected to this “grid” curing their 
tobacco for free and also getting revenue from other farmers who would use this eco-friendly barn. In order to make 
biogas tobacco curing a reality the researchers suggest a model in which the farmer can use half of the produced 
biogas per day at most. What this ensures is that the farmer also benefits from the installation of the biogas digester 
on a daily basis rather than collecting biogas all year for the curing season. This model however brings in 
possibilities such as using biogas to complete part of the process rather than complete the whole process.  The 
remainder of curing can be achieved by using a hybrid system with other renewable forms of fuel such as biomass 
briquettes.  
 
8.Conclusion 
The survey study concluded the average tobacco produced by the sample of farmers to be 2.8 tons on a farm of 10 
people with 8 cattle, 7 goats and 39 chickens.The recommended digester size for the average farmer was 
116","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

12m3producing 2.6m3 of biogas per day. Suggested biogas storage option was having two 500m3 plastic bladder 
type storage units for the 949m3 of gas produced per year.The amount of gas required to cure 2.8 tonnes was 
calculated to be 1475.8m3 thus the deficit can be clearly seen therefore for the average farmer the gas produced was 
less than the gas required for curing the tobacco.The most important biomass resource was cattle as they were 
responsible for most of the gas produced per household.Cost of implementing a biogas tobacco curing system on an 
existing tobacco barn was calculated as $144.54 /m3of biogas digester designed. From the financial analysis all tests 
performed had positive results in terms of feasibility and profitability of the project.Financial benefits of curing 
tobacco using biogas included lessening the cost of buying coal and firewood for curing. It should be noted that the 
most important benefit of curing tobacco with biogas which is to save the environment does not have much direct 
financial benefit that could be calculated using the capital budgeting techniques applied in the financial analysis.

Abstract 
The research study investigated the prospects of using Autonomous Maintenance to improve maintenance 
effectiveness advantage for  the thermal power plants. Through plant audits, critical equipment was 
identified using Nowlan and Heap’s risk analysis method and confirmed using the criticality function 
(SAQM). The identified critical equipment were boilers, turbines, pumps, condensers, supeheaters, grate 
and belts. Autonomous Maintenance implementation procedures were developed for the plant and, the 
cause and effects of failure of each critical component were analysed using fishbone diagrams. 
Autonomous Maintenance checklists for each critical equipment were developed basing on the 
implementation strategy. The maintenance database  checklists, KPI data and software were used as the 
end user interface for accessing the procedures and  inputing KPI data in to the system for storage. The 
implementation were based on continous improvement as a cycle incorporating real time monitoring 
system in the plant.

1. Introduction
Over the years, manufacturing organizations have experienced an unprecedented degree of change including drastic 
change in management approaches, increasing complexities in products and process technologies, inflated market 
demands and customer expectations, and unpredictable supplier attitude(Ahuja & Khamba, 2008). In number of 
organizations, often production and manufacturing systems operate below full capacity, leading to low productivity 
and high costs of operating and maintaining machinery in factories. Local and global competition propelled by 
highly dynamic markets and rapidly changing business environment, has resulted in increased customer demands of 
high quality and affordable products and services from the manufacturing organizations (Blanchard, 2002). The 
rapidly increasing competition calls for companies to increase performance through focus on cost cutting, increasing 
productivity levels, high quality and state of the art product features for customer satisfaction, guaranteed 
profitability and survival of the organization.  
2. Background
Thermal power plant was mostly implementing ineffective maintenance strategies comprising of crisis maintenance 
and preventive maintenance resulting in high equipment breakdowns, high maintenance costs and unplanned 
equipment downtime, under-utilization and damage of equipment, thereby failing to reach company energy 
generation targets. This is due to a number of reasons which include old age of equipment, harsh economic

8. Recommendations 
The thermal plant must improve its data capturing methods and keeping of maintenance records. Equipment history 
is very important in analyzing failures and developing maintenance strategies therefore to avoid corrective 
maintenance, equipment data must be captured and recorded in and organized form. The records are also important 
when analyzing equipment for maintenance and evaluating its life cycle costs therefore it is necessary to keep the 
records.   
The organization has a number of KPI’s which it uses to monitor performance. It is necessary to increase the number 
of KPI’s and also include important ones like manpower utilization, ration of emergency work to planned works, 
schedule compliance, ratio of maintenance costs to total costs and balanced score card. These performance 
indicators give a brighter picture on the success of the maintenance programs of the organization. 
The database can be improved so that operators can compare the maintenance work they have performed to the 
programmed checklists. The Database must also be linked to SAP so as to monitor the equipment in real time and be 
able to generate notifications if AM has not been performed. The KPI monitoring software can also be advanced to 
be real time and plot graphs and chats instantaneously so as to indicate the success of AM as it is implemented. 
When linked to SAP, the software must be able to record the KPI parameters directly from equipment, post the 
information to the database for storage and retrieve it to plot real time graphs without any human intervention. 
 
9. Conclusion 
 
The research study developed the Autonomous Maintenance implementation strategy for the thermal power 
generation plant. The database and software were developed using phpmyadmin and MySQL queries so that they 
can be interfaced with SAP to eliminate the need for training operators on new software which can cause 
resistance.The study was based on an investigation of the organization’s maintenance strategies through analysis of 
previous maintenance and equipment data, discussions and interviewing management and maintenance personnel 
and observing the equipment functioning.The AM procedures were made accessible through the database and 
equipment performance monitoring was simplified through the KPI monitoring software which makes it easy to 
track the advantages brought by AM implementation.

Abstract 
Taking optimal maintenance decisions is a challenging process as different maintenance actions have different effects 
on the system. Maintenance is defined as a set of associated techniques, tools and management actions that aim to 
maintain or restore the functioning state of the system. Maintenance excellence is the balance between performance 
and risk, therefore this helps improve the sustainability of production. Traditionally, maintenance decisions are taken 
based on human experience and on the basic information known about the system. With the availability of data 
collected during the system’s life cycle; machine learning approaches can help develop optimal strategies for 
maintenance actions. This paper proposes and depicts an optimization model imported from the machine learning field 
and developed to find optimal preventive maintenance strategies. The main objective of this developed optimization 
model is to minimize the downtime and allow the system to take autonomous decisions. In this work, the maintenance 
strategy is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDP is a classical forming of sequential decision-making 
problem.  Reinforcement learning (RL) model is then developed to solve the problem interactively. RL uses the MDP 
to define the interaction between the learning agent and the environment. The final output from this method in an 
optimal policy allows providing optimal actions in different situations.

Introduction 
1.1 
Maintenance problem 
The growing competitive environment in the manufacturing field forces different organizations to reduce their costs 
(Yacout, 2010). The two main expenditure sources that can be reduced, without any loss of the quality level, are the 
energy consumption cost and the maintenance cost. Proper maintenance can also lead to optimizing energy 
consumption. The main objective of maintenance excellence is to ensure the maximum reliability and availability of 
the system with the minimum cost and without affecting the production quality. Maintenance can be classified into 
corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM). CM is the maintenance actions that take place when 
the failure of the system occurs, thus these actions are the result of failure and they aim to restore the system to specific 
conditions. PM is performed while the system is still operating; and considered as set of activities performed to retain 
the system in specific conditions. Several steps are needed to achieve PM, which are inspection, detection and 
prevention of anticipated failure (Wang, 2002).

Discussion of the Results 
Figure 2, table 1 and table 2 show a comparison between the proposed model and the model by (AbdelHaleem & 
Yacout 1998). In terms of the optimal replacement time T* the two models provide different results. For the brake T*= 
2250 hrs using the original model while by the proposed model T*= 3800 hrs. For the coupling T*= 2160 hrs by the 
original model while by the proposed model T*= 1320 hrs. It is notable that in the brake’s case T* using the proposed 
model is bigger than T* by the original model, while in the case of the coupling T* by the proposed model is smaller 
than this by the original model. To investigate which of the two models having a better solution the discrete event 
simulation was performed using each solution. The results of the simulation show that the proposed model was able 
to outperform the original model by yielding lower downtime in both of the cases. For the brake, the downtime due 
to PM actions or failures correction is reduced by 39%. For the coupling a great reduction for the downtime by 84% 
took place. The interpretations of these results can be concluded as follows:  
1. In case of the brake, the original model performed the PM actions with a high frequency which is not needed. These 
unneeded actions lead to increase the downtime. The proposed model found the value of T* that eliminated the 
unneeded PM actions. A limitation appeared in the solution by the proposed model; that it allows two failures.  
2. In the case of the coupling, the original model did not take any PM actions, it just corrected the failures. The 
proposed model obtained T* that eliminated the failures to minimize the downtime.    
From the previous interpretations, we could conclude the proposed model provides better performance than the 
original model. In addition, the proposed model is not dependent on any parameters.

Conclusions  
The objective of this work aimed to find an optimal PM strategy, using RL area imported from the machine learning. 
This maintenance strategy minimizes the downtime of the systems. The proposed solution in this work to this problem 
is to develop RL model that could be solved by SARSA (λ) algorithm. First, the challenges related to the maintenance 
problem are described with the limitations of the available models. Mainly these limitations are both the need and the 
high dependency of the available models on the input parameters and their values. The proposed model overcomes 
this limitation. In the proposed solution the problem was modeled as MDP, the developed model was based on the 
reliability of the system. The Reliability was obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Then an optimal solution to 
the problem was founded by the SARSA(λ) algorithm. The problem was solved without the need for the transition 
probabilities matrix. In addition, the proposed model is not dependent on any parameters as the failure distribution 
function, tp or tf. These capabilities of RL as a nonparametric data-driven model enable it to solve real-time problem 
of autonomous decision-making.  
To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a numerical comparison between the original model and the 
proposed model through discrete event simulation was performed. The proposed model outperformed the original 
model in two different cases, as the proposed model provides T* that yield less downtime when used to perform PM 
actions.     
Areas for further research are: i. solve the limitation related to failure allowance as in case of the brake. ii. extend the 
model for the multicomponent systems, so all the components are considered together in the same model. iii. extend 
the model to include minimizing the maintenance cost explicitly in the objective.

Abstract 
 
The increasing retail industry in Indonesia makes competitiveness among retail businesses even higher. 
Therefore, a good marketing strategy is important to do. Retail Z is a retailer that sells handphone (HP) and 
electronic accessories, which want to increase sales with limited capital. One of strategy that can be done 
is product bundling. However, a product bundling strategy that is incompatible with customer needs will 
be in vain. Therefore, a technique is needed to determine which product will be bundled. By using one of 
the data mining methods namely Association Rule-Market Basket Analysis it can be determined which 
products are often purchased simultaneously by taking into account the parameters of support and 
confidence. Results obtained with the help of RapidMiner software, department 5 and department 2 are 
departments whose products are often purchased simultaneously. This is indicated by Lift Ratio 1.029, 
Confidence 0.852 and Support 0.397. So that product bundling can be done by giving discounts to buyers 
who make product purchases in department 5 and in department 2 simultaneously.

1. Introduction 
 
Everyone wants to buy their needs in a place that is easily accessible and provides the desired product. Retail which 
is one of the links in the distribution of goods is made to simplify the purchasing process. With retail, customers do 
not have to come all the way to the production site so that the purchasing process is difficult to do. 
 
The current development of the retail world is so rapid that it has an impact on the increasing competition for market 
share among retail businesses. The Indonesian Retail Entrepreneurs Association (APRINDO) (2016) revealed that the 
growth of the retail industry in Indonesia reached 10 percent in 2016. The current retail industry is controlled by large 
organizations, including Department Stores, Chain Organizations, Warehouses, Supermarkets, Catalogs Store, Outlet 
and Online Store (Bernadetta 2012). 
 
Retail Z is handphone (HP) and electronic accessories retailer located in Yogyakarta. The increasing number of similar 
retailers creates a separate threat for Retail Z. A marketing strategy is needed that can understand consumer behavior 
so that consumers will remain loyal to buy the items they need in Retail Z. One of strategy that can be done is by 
product bundling that can attract customers to buy HP & electronic accessories in place. 
 
Product bundling that are not done properly will only be in vain, because bundled products are not in accordance with 
the customer's wishes. Therefore, the determination of bundled products will be based on the association relationship 
between items in Retail Z. By bundling the product, it is expected that customers will be interested in buying products 
in Retail Z so that they can increase their total sales. Because, the bundling strategy has a significant effect on consumer 
buying interest (Buananda & Ariyanti 2018).

Figure 3. Examples of product bundling that can be applied retail z 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Based on the research that has been done on Retail Z using the AR-MBA method, it can be concluded that by using a 
minimum value of Support which is 0.3 or 30% and the minimum value of Confidence 0.6 or 60%, there are 6 rules 
based on the output of RapidMiner. From the 6 rules obtained, only 1 rule can be said to be valid, namely the sixth 
rule that describes the associative relationship between items in Department 5 (Memory & Games) will be purchased 
simultaneously with items in Department 2 (HP Support Accessories) with a confidence level of 85 % and supported 
by 39% of all data. Therefore, the proposed solution to increase sales with product bundling based on AR-MBA 
analysis in Retail Z is that the customer gets a discount if buying items included in department 5 (Memory & Games) 
and department 2 (HP Supporting Accessories) , for example, the customer will get a discount when buying a hard 
drive with a charger simultaneously.

Abstract 
This paper examines peer rating result data for two consecutive core team-based first year engineering courses. 
Engineering students will be expected to work in teams, and the ability to effectively cooperate and communicate is 
increasingly recognized by technical corporations. Teamwork is an important outcome included in the accreditation 
criteria of ABET, and is also progressively integrated into engineering courses. However, the effect of the length of 
students’ exposure into team-based projects training is not well studied. Given the ad-hoc experience, which is the 
more students experience teamwork, the better they perform in teams, we hypothesize that peer evaluation behaviors 
for the second team-based course will be better on average comparing to the first team-based course. This study will 
further help better bridge college students with industry in terms of teamwork competency. It will also inspire 
university administrators and instructors to design curriculums that help engineering students improve teaming 
skills.

Abstract 
The MEng program at the University of Windsor is a course-based program designed for working 
professionals or recent graduates who want to increase their knowledge in multiple, advanced topics. In 
recent years, this program is getting popularity among people who graduated from foreign engineering 
schools. In an attempt to understand how majority of students in this program know about sustainable 
development, there is a survey designed using the following the questions: 
(1) How much do foreign graduate students know about sustainable development?
(2) What could be the best approach to educating foreign graduate students for sustainable development?
These questions were modified from a study done by Azapagic et.al. (2005). Answers to these questions 
will help instructors to develop courses and/ modules in courses that could help to stimulate students’ 
interest in sustainable development during their studies and to ensure their commitment to practicing 
sustainable engineering later as professionals.

Abstract 
Location and time-period can highly be correlated with traffic accidents types. In this study, 287983 traffic 
accidents that happened in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017 were collected from General Traffic Department of 
Kuwait. The collected traffic accidents occurred in four- governorates that included Kuwait-City, Hawally, 
Al Farwaniya, and Al Ahmadi as those governorates had the highest rate of traffic accidents. The types of 
traffic accidents that were included in the collected data were crashes, run-over, and rollover accidents. 
Afterward, the location and the year where and when the accident occurred were chosen to be the 
independent variable and the dependent variable was the type of accident. Then, a multinomial logit 
regression model was applied to identify the significant independent variable and the correlations between 
predictors and the dependent variable. The results showed that both location and time were significant 
variables that influence the occurring of certain types of accidents. According to the model results, rollover 
accidents had higher odds of happening in Al Ahmadi governorate. While for the time-period, 2017 was 
found to have a higher probability of run-over accidents occurring.

1. Introduction
Traffic accidents are one of the highest reason for causing death around the globe. According to World Health 
Organization data (Global Health Observatory 2017), Kuwait had the third highest death rate related to traffic 
accidents with 18.7 death rate per population compared to other Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) Countries. For 
Bahrain, the death rate per population was 8. UAE had a 10.9 death per population and Qatar had 15.2 mortality. 
While Oman and Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of deaths per population among other GCC countries with 27.4 
and 25.4 mortalities respectively. During 2017, 428 deaths and 10219 injuries occurred due to traffic accidents in 
Kuwait. This requires a study that can provide a sufficient comprehension regarding traffic accidents especially 
because of the lack of similar studies that can provide similar perception for Kuwait traffic accidents. 
Several factors can stimulate the occurrence of traffic accidents including meteorological, temporal, human factors. 
Alongside these factors, road characteristics can be considered to be another factor related to the occurrence of traffic 
accidents. A large number of researchers studied those different factors to identify the significant factors and their 
correlation with traffic accidents in different regions. In addition, road traffic accidents are classified into several types 
including rear-end collision, side-impact collision, sideswipe collision, dead on collisions, and rollover accidents. In 
this study, crashes in general including two or more vehicles involved in the accident, run-over, and rollover. First, 
drivers’ behavior and their tendency to comply with traffic regulations and traffic accidents status were reviewed for 
the GCC region. Thereafter, run-over and roll over traffic accidents and their potential risk were presented. 
In the Kingdome of Saudi Arabia, (Gharaibeh and Abu Abdo 2011) conducted a survey to understand whether youth 
had a sufficient knowledge regarding traffic safety and regulations. The area of the study was located to be at King 
Faisal University and the sample was comprised of male drivers only. The results showed that most of the participants 
were not complying with traffic laws and they were not using the seatbelt. Moreover, important traffic signs were had 
to be identified by the participants. One of the recommended solutions was aware the drivers about the traffic

set with positive coefficients and the reference level was Al Ahmadi governorate. This indicated that Al Ahmadi 
governorate had a higher probability to have rollover accidents compared to the three other governorates. 
For the time when the accident occurred, YE1 and YE3 that represented 2013 and 2016 were significant in the first 
and second set with negative coefficients compared to the reference level which was 2017. This indicated that the year 
2017 had a higher probability to have run-over compared to the two other years 2013 and 2016.

4. Conclusions  
This study was conducted to investigate the impacts of both location and time on three types of traffic accidents that 
occurred in Kuwait by utilizing official traffic accidents data that were collected from General Department of Traffic. 
Four governorates and years were included to distinguish the differences between them with respect to traffic accidents 
that resulted in 287983 crashes, rollovers, and run-over accidents.    
The statistics showed that the accidents decreased through the four years. In addition, governorate the had the higher 
rate of traffic accidents during the selected years was identified which was Hawally.  For the rollover accidents, Al 
Ahmadi was recognized as the governorate that had the highest rollovers accidents compared to other governorates. 
Run-over accidents were significantly higher in Al Farwaniya governorate. Afterward, a multinomial logit regression 
was applied to identify the significant predictors and determine the correlation between independent variables and the 
dependent variable. The results showed that both the location and time were significant variables related to traffic 
accidents types occurrence. The applied model confirmed that Al Ahmadi governorate had a higher probability of 
having rollover accidents compared to other governorates. Moreover, 2017 had higher odds of having run-over 
accidents compared to the other three selected years. 
All in all, this study can be considered as a baseline for future studies that concern with traffic accidents in Kuwait 
due to the lack of similar studies. This study can help policy-makers, related institutions, police departments and 
ministry of interior in locating the area that is correlated with the three traffic accidents types. Additionally, this study 
can help in evaluating the newly established rules regarding mitigating and lessening traffic accidents through the 
selected time-period and locations in Kuwait.

Delegation versus Control under Competition and Bargaining Power Distribution in 
Supply Chain Procurement 
Abstract 
This paper studies the optimal strategies of procuring components in a three-tier supply chain setting, including two 
competing original equipment manufacturers (OEM), a contract manufacturer (CM) and a supply market. The 
OEMs sell substitutable products in the same market. The OEMs are dependent on the CM to perform significant 
manufacturing tasks or customized processing services. The CM also needs a key component for performing its task; 
this key component should be procured from an upstream supplier. To procure the key component, each OEM has 
two options; it can either procure directly through the supply market or delegate procurement process to the CM. 
The OEMs procurement game has been analyzed under a nonstrategic supplier case where a quantity discount 
schedule is exogenously given. The optimal component procurement strategy has been characterized at different 
levels of quantity discount rates offered by the upstream supplier.

Abstract 
The recent advancement in digital technologies has encouraged manufacturers to adopt intelligent data analysis and 
decision-making support tools to leverage their competitiveness. They have become challenged by the need for more 
flexible and complex manufacturing systems. This complexity and flexibility cannot be handled efficiently with 
traditional production management paradigms, such as lean management. Semiconductor industry is an example of a 
complex production, in which high level of flexibility is required to meet a continuously changing customer demand. 
This limits the efficiency of static modeling approaches and it reflects negatively on the overall production yield. 
In this research, we propose a discrete event simulation logic for assessment of several challenging production 
management-related problems at a semiconductor manufacturer. The logic includes scheduling and processing a large 
variety of products, while respecting relative priorities and customers’ needs. It also accounts for production resources, 
equipment and operators, with variable availability. Our simulation logic is data-driven, in which data that drives the 
different actions taken within the execution of the simulation, is compiled. Consequently, the model is highly flexible 
to continuous changes in the model’s parameters. The proposed logic provides a quick and risk-free tool for capacity 
planning and reliable experimentation with different ‘What-If’ scenarios.

1. Introduction
The recent advancement in digital technologies, which is adopted by Industry 4.0 paradigm, have put a challenge for 
traditional production management-based industry, especially if the product or production is normally complex. These 
communication and information technologies, based on the Internet of Things (IoT) perception, help interconnecting 
shopfloor components for better management and control (Negri et al. 2017). Moreover, the IoT allows the exchange 
and collection of information between different system components, things, through the internet. This gives a chance

6. Conclusion and Future works        
 
The semiconductor industry is an example of a complex production due to the manufacturing technologies and the 
flexibility required to satisfy customer requirements. The manufacturers always seek for reaching production 
performance improvement in order to keep a high level of competitiveness. This implies the implementation of 
untraditional production management strategies that can handle the increased level of production complexity. Such 
problems are addressed by the applications of the Industry 4.0 concepts that adopt the IoT technologies and 
synchronized system models which copies the actual system continuously.  
 
The basis of having a good representative model is selecting proper methodology and type of modeling that is able to 
simulate the behaviors of the actual system. Nevertheless, it should be continuously monitoring the actual system to 
adapt for any modifications that may occur.  We proposed a methodology for modeling a production system for 
semiconductors using discrete-event simulation model that is both Data-driven and Agent-based. The proposed logic 
is easily applicable using Arena® simulation software. Our logic included the flexibility for accepting any updates in 
the model parameters with no need for rebuilding the model. This was realized while keeping the modeling as simple 
as possible to be easily assessed and validated.  
 
Future work for this research involves conducting design of experiments with the model results for real input data to 
understand different relationships between model outputs and different model parameters and inputs. This would help 
solving different problems and improving the general production performance of the actual system.

Abstract 
Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) is a classification algorithm known for its high accuracy and interpretable results, but 
it has relatively long computational time, which makes it unsuitable to treat big data. In this paper, we propose a 
platform for improving the computational efficiency of LAD especially in large scale and big data applications. We 
develop an approach based on a merging operation of two different LAD models. The proposed approach is ideal to 
develop incremental learning platform based on LAD. In addition, it enables LAD to be performed in parallel 
computing environments. The suggested operation determines the intersection between each pair of patterns from the 
two models. Each intersection is a new pattern in the new merged model and its characteristics are inherited from its 
parent patterns. Numerical experiments are conducted by using an industrial data set. The experiments demonstrate 
the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed approach and the classical 
implementation of LAD with a sole run on the whole data. The proposed approach resulted in a maximum accuracy 
reduction of 5% and computational time reduction of 87% from the accuracy and computational time of the classical 
implementation of LAD, respectively.

1. Introduction
Machine learning is one of the artificial intelligent (AI) applications that give the ability to learn and improve systems 
automatically. Algorithms of machine learning are categorized into supervised and unsupervised machine learning 
algorithms. Supervised machine learning is to learn and gain structural information from labeled training data.  As 
such algorithms produce models or functions which able to provide correct predictions about new unlabeled data. 
Many supervised machine learning algorithms have been developed for classification problems, such as support vector 
machines, decision trees and neural network (Safavian and Landgrebe 1991, Scholkopf and Smola 2001, Hagan et al. 
1996). Although these algorithms show high accuracy in the literature, but they don’t have powerful explanation and 
interpretability of results. Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) is developed and used as a classification method that has 
competitive accuracy and powerful abilities of interpretability by providing patterns that contain structural information 
by analyzing the training data (Boros et al. 1997, Boros et al. 2000, Hammer and Bonates 2006). LAD is used as a

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we developed an efficient merging operation for different sets of patterns which are produced 
by performing LAD on different data subsets. The motivation behind this operation is developing 
incremental learning framework using LAD and allowing LAD to process big data sets in parallel 
computing environments. We evaluated the proposed technique in terms of pattern’s quality, accuracy and 
computational time. Overall, the quality of the patterns is reduced in terms of the degrees and weights 
comparing to the patterns produced by a single run of LAD, but the accuracy and the computational time 
are promising to apply the proposed technique in an incremental learning platform and parallel computing 
environments. In the future research, we plan to modify the merging operation for the incremental learning 
platform by adding some tuning parameters to reduce the noise of new chunks of data until building a robust 
model. In addition, LAD will be implemented on different parallel computing systems using this merging 
operation and will be evaluated using various data sets.

Abstract 
This paper aims to demonstrate the impact of automation – with the use of a robot – in the welding opera-
tion in a manufacturing process of electrical and electronic components, located at the Industrial Hub of 
Manaus. The adopted procedure was the experimental research and case studying, with documentary and 
bibliographic research with exploratory bias, with variability mapping using bivariate analysis model. The 
results indicate a high degree in the effectiveness of the robotic manipulator compared to manual opera-
tion, based on the variables analyzed, such as soldering time, total amount of applied solder, and dis-
penser’s speed and temperature, as well as total adherence to quality standards.

1. Introduction
With the expansion in the use of machines in industry, especially after the industrial revolution, production capacity 
increasingcontinues to expand along,thanks to technological innovation. For Romano (2002), the machines are able 
to help automate the manufacturing process, and thus represent a large part of this ""increase"" in industry output.The 
use of robots in industrial applications have been growing positively in the recent years. They have had a populari-
zation, not only in large industries, but have spread in different branches and industrial applications. However, in 
many cases, the potential of a robot applied to a process is not fully utilized, because its programming does not al-
low its performance to be optimized (WU et al, 2000; ÇAKIR et al, 2006).

For the purposes of operational marking, the four (4) configuration variables were used as a basis for bivariate anal-
ysis, in order to infer possible restrictions, and counterpart to the seven (7) mapped defect variables. For the men-
tioned mapping the Spearman coefficient was used, which describes the correlation between the parameters and the 
resulting ones (positive or negative). Table 4 below demonstrates such relations where we have -1>ρs> 1 in which 
the resulting scalar value of 1 means perfect correlation and -1 with inverse behavior.

Spearman's correlation coefficient is the most appropriate for variables with ordinal scales (HAIR JR et al., 2005). 
The correlation coefficient does not measure the cause and effect relation between variables, although this relation 
may be present (LAPPONI, 2005). The expected result of this analysis is to verify which variables are related to 
statistical significance, and to indicate the direction (positive or negative) and the strength of the association (corre-
lation coefficient and determination coefficient). 
5. Conclusions
Among the main concluding axes are: 1) The feasibility in the implementation of automation in the welding manu-
facturing process; and 2) The adherence of bivariate analysis to the configuration matrix and defects in the optimiza-
tion. Record the limitations on detailed test surveys, particularly regarding sample size, as well as quality assessment 
criteria. 
Axis 1: Evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of the automated welding model (robotic manipulator), considering 
the technologies of sensors, HMI and automatic feeding. 
Axis 2: The use of bivariate analysis made it possible to visualize the possible correlations between the variables, 
inferring important questions about the effects of the parametric combinations of the machine.

Abstract  
The Service Mold company examined in this study is leading aerospace parts manufacturing industry located in 
Windsor, Ontario. The company demanded a new plant layout for the better material movement to improve the actual 
productivity by eradicating all the wastes in the process with the help of lean tools. In this paper, the authors analyzed 
old layout which was in random shape and identified non-value added material movements. Authors prepared a new 
layout based on the present scenario from random layout to U shape layout by utilizing cellular manufacturing to 
minimize the travel distance of both employees and material. Tools like 5W1H, Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Cause 
and Effect Diagram and 5Why are used to find the root cause of the current obstacles. And Kaizen tool was used with 
Pareto chart to identify the primary reason for the problem.  The future layout is expected to have better productivity 
in the company.

Abstract 
The context of the fourth industrial revolution brings companies numerous challenges. Agility, flexibility, 
and responsiveness are necessary characteristics in this business ecosystem, with the deep insertion of 
digital technologies in manufacturing. Therefore, this work has the objective of developing a model of 
measurement of the maturity and readiness of the industry 4.0 so that companies can visualize their 
positioning in this new reality. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used for the development of the 
model that contemplates 6 (six) dimensions. It was applied in the Industrial Pole of Manaus (PIM), in a 
multinational manufacturing company. The results obtained are adherent to the reality of the company in 
relation to the industry 4.0.

1. Introduction
Agility is a strategic feature that is becoming increasingly important to successful companies (Schuh et al. 2017). A 
large product variability, and  reduce time product-life-cycles require agile and flexible production operation, which 
can be reconfigured rapidly for new demands (Weyer et al. 2015). 
The industry is experiencing a major shift worldwide labelled as “The Fourth Industrial Revolution”. This change, 
also known as Industry 4.0, is triggered by an whopping growth in  new digital technologies (information and 
automation)  (Colli et al. 2018). According with Canetta, Barni & Montini (2018), in this new digitised ecossystem, 
companies are facing significant challenges regarding the implementation of the concept, both at organisational and 
technological level. The development process implemented by these companies includes the definition of strategic 
plans to the updating of technology and products, and the creation of new skills. 
In the context of informatization and industrialization, some developed and developing countries announced their 
national manufacturing strategies to support their economic transformation and national competitiveness, for example, 
Advanced Manufacturing in the United States and Made in China 2025 in Asia, “La Nouvelle Industrielle” iniative of 
France (Liao et al. 2017; Kagermann  2013; Li  2015). 
Industry 4.0 should impact on supply chains, business models and processes. As started in  Kagermann et al. (2013) 
these changes,  which are  likely to be enabled by the transformation to Industry 4.0,  are  as follows:  custom customer 
requests;  flexibility;  efficient decision-making;  resource  productivity and efficiency;  creation of new services; 
responding  to change in the workplace and work-life-balance.

5. Conclusions 
 
The current research was conducted assessing Industrial Pole of Manaus (manufacturing companies) , but our findings 
may apply to a wider sample. This study has important implications for both academia and firms. 
This research presents some important theoretical contributions to the state-of-the-art on assessment and readiness 
industry 4.0 maturity models. The goal of this research is to provide a maturity model for the classification of a 
company’s roadmap in the context of the Industry 4.0 requirements. As it was conducted as a pilot case study, 
including a surveyed companies, the analysis, focusing on the Industrial Pole of Manaus. 
Our approach identifies how the association of Industry 4.0 requirements according to different contextual variables 
(dimensions) may contribute to increase the assessment and readiness maturity level. 
Beyond the development of model was based on the literature review (the comparison of existing maturity models), a 
mapping of these maturity models would be important to merge their different points of assignments and dimensions 
between these models to enable companies to classify themselves in concepts of Industry 4.0 in all levels of their 
enterprise. 
The model has been developed using a qualitative and quantitative methods for empirical validation. Thus, in contrast 
to other approaches the contribution of this paper effort is the inclusion of mathematical methods to measure the 
maturity level. 
This work contains empirical evidences on assessment and readiness Industry 4.0 maturity model. Within this paper 
we present the first version of our maturity model PIM4.0. The model provides a mapping of key business dimensions 
and maturity improvement points.

Abstract 
The distribution of the merchandise for the retail companies concentrates approximately 30 percent of the 
operation costs. Costs generally increase if the company wants to have a high level of customer service, 
that is, achieve the fastest delivery. We focus on improving the distribution system of an automotive spare 
parts company to deliver its products, offering a high level of customer service. The company has a finite 
number of delivery drivers, which are assigned to specific areas of the city. Therefore, as a first step, a 
classification, grouping and assignment of the clients to the drivers is carried out using clustering 
algorithms, such that a balance of the workload is obtained. Once the coverage areas have been established, 
it is necessary to calculate departures and schedules in order to organize the visits of the delivery drivers to 
the customers. Finally, the best delivery routes are calculated through the use of metaheuristics considering 
the necessary restrictions that improve service times and reduce distribution costs. The results of the 
methodology applied in the company and a comparison of the savings generated against the current process 
are shown and cycles of continuous improvement are established.

Abstract 
In this paper, we present Industry 4.0 paradigm as a new business model that emerged from the GAFAM (Google- 
Apple- Facebook-Amazon-Microsoft) business model. As such, the main objectives of this new paradigm is internal 
and external customer empowerment and the creation of innovative collaborative applications. We discuss some 
applications that are ongoing research topics. We give two examples of industrial applications that are based on 
collaborative industrial-academic research partnership. We conclude by presenting some the opportunities, the 
challenges, recommendations and guidelines for industries and academia who are interested in implementing the 
Industry 4.0 paradigm.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 is a paradigm that aims at taking advantage of the digital transformation in the manufacturing sector. Its 
focus is on creating an intelligent network of physical assets and processes through the deployment of information 
and communication technologies, and the exploitation of these technologies to serve internal and external customers 
(Guilhem 2018a). The basic concepts and technologies of Industry 4.0 are the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud 
computing, robotics, sensors, smart products, autonomous maintenance, autonomous machines, and autonomous 
processes of a cyber-physical system (CPS), in which peripherals and assets work together through a communication 
network . A diagram of this system is presented in Figure 1.

conditions, which are used to generate patterns that describe the machining operation. The controllable machining 
conditions are used to control part accuracy and quality. We use pattern recognition technique that detects 
characteristic patterns, and use them to control the quality of a machined part by adjusting the controllable machining 
conditions in response to sensors’ readings of the uncontrollable conditions  (Shaban et al. 2017). Figure 7 shows the 
sequences of autonomous operations that are taken places.

4. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
In this paper, we introduced the Industry 4.0 paradigm as a new business model that stemmed from the GAFAM 
business model. We emphasized the idea that this new revolution should lead to customer empowerment and to 
collaborative problem solving culture, which is based on more transparency and sharing of knowledge. We presented 
areas of opportunities for collaborative industry-academia research topics, and we gave two examples of 
implementation of Industry 4.0 paradigm that are based on the existence of data and artificial intelligence techniques. 
For the manufacturers who are looking for embracing the new paradigm, the opportunities are as follows (Andrews, 
2017): 
• 
An opportunity to tackle the complex problem of rapid changes of customers’ requirements and the obligation 
to answer to these requirements in a short time interval, and with high product’s quality. The use of 
information technologies and the internet has been proven highly efficient in all aspects of our lives. It is thus 
logical to expect the same result of efficiency when large volume of heterogeneous information is rapidly 
gathered from all the processes of an industrial network, then smartly analyzed to support smart the decision 
making. 
• 
The cost and the variety of the available information technology are more affordable than ever, whether it is 
the cloud-based services, the open-source artificial intelligence tools, or the sensors that can track the tools 
and equipment states around the factory.   
• 
Many governments and coalitions are alerted to the importance of this change of paradigm, and are willing 
to invest for upgrading their industries. For example, the German government invested 500 million Euros to 
encourage research into Industry 4.0. In the USA, technology firms, manufactures, suppliers, government 
agencies and universities have formed the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition, a not-for-profit-
organization funded by 140 million $ of public and private investments. In the UK, the government had 
announced that 4.7 billion pounds would be available for research and development into areas such as 
robotics, artificial intelligence, 5G mobile and smart energy. 
However, the new paradigm of Industry 4.0 presents some challenges for the Industry (Andrews, 2017): 
• 
Since Industry 4.0 is a disruptive concept by nature, and people usually resist any changes, it is expected that 
some high and middle management officers and employees will adopt a conservative attitude, and express 
concerns about the required changes. 
• 
It is already clear that it is hard to find people having the required qualifications and digital skills to run the 
new systems, and to adapt them to the future technologies.

• 
It is not clear yet whether the manufacturers, their suppliers and theirs customers will accept to adopt smart 
communication systems and to exchange data and information openly and with little constraints. 
• 
There is an obvious need for standardization, which is not fully available yet. 
• 
It is important for historically different teams, such as the IT, the Engineering, and the Production teams to 
work closer to provide support for the new paradigm within a common IoT strategy. 
• 
Finally, the cybersecurity stems as a major challenge for Industry 4.0, since many believe that the risk of 
security breaches by the hackers, through the IoT, will increase. 
 
We conclude with the following recommendations to industries who plan to invest in building a cyber-physical 
infrastructure, which is needed to implement the Industry 4.0 paradigm:  
• 
Combining manufacturing and information technologies and take initiatives collaboratively; 
• 
Reforming the company’s data architecture; 
• 
Building the Digital Value Network  Architecture (DVNA) to create value; 
• 
Creating active knowledge and network business model to capture innovation; 
• 
Driving a culture of collaboration through digitalization and IoT; 
• 
Creating value through innovation in a collaborative industry-academia research, as well as industry-
industry mode. Some information should be ready to share to achieve mutual gain;  
• 
Interoperability means to operate correctly as a whole when connecting and using different sources. Here it 
means the state where data can be mutually used between digital platforms; 
• 
Encouraging data utilization in a customer-oriented manner; 
• 
Investing in human capital and development programs that promote new digital collaborative thinking; 
• 
Identifying opportunities to deepen collaboration and understanding of sharing-economy platforms and use 
of Cloud capabilities; 
• 
Standardization of operation means more future opportunities of collaborative problem solving. 
 
For future research, more migration toward industry 4.0 paradigm, will mean adaptation of old tools and techniques 
to exploit the new capabilities of a cyber-physical factory, and the development of new applications to satisfy and 
empower the customer.

Abstract 
Peer evaluation has been well established as an effective method to motivate team members to reflect their 
contribution and performance, to enforce sense of responsibility, to act as an incentive for demonstrating 
good interpersonal skills and to help the team achieve its goals. Behaviorally anchored rating scale is 
generally considered as an efficient and fair method to measure certain scores. However, in the application 
of peer evaluation, numerical rating could be influenced by raters’ biased understanding of the scale based 
on their cultural background. Supplementing peer-to-peer comments with numerical peer evaluation system 
could remediate rater bias effect. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing model that (1) 
processes the peer-to-peer comments about rater’s teammates’ teamwork behaviors; (2) converts comments 
into numerical space that allow for computation We evaluate our results against CATME data and validate 
our proposed system.

1. Introduction
Teamwork is rated as the most important competency by engineering graduates based on their professional
practice and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) also lists teamwork as one of required 
competency that engineering graduate should demonstrate throughout college training (Wei, 2019). To facilitate 
improving teamwork skills, the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) was developed 
to help instructors better manage teams and help students improve teamwork behaviors by its embedded peer 
evaluation system based on a behaviorally anchored rating scale (Ohland et al. 2012). CATME has currently over 
7,000 active instructor accounts for instructors across multiple disciplines in over 2,000 institutions worldwide. 
CATME evaluation tool includes five dimensions of teamwork behaviors on which team members are asked to rate 
themselves and their teammates: 
•
Contributing (C) to the Team’s Work: being able to add value to a team’s work/project. Team
members are rated on how well they meet their commitments, do their share of the work, and help
their teammates.
•
Interacting (I) with Teammates: how individuals communicate within their teams. It includes
encouraging teammates, communicating ideas clearly, and listening respectfully to others’ ideas.
•
Keeping the Team on Track (K): being aware of milestones and deadlines and ensuring that the
team is making appropriate progress.
•
Expecting Quality (E): taking steps to ensure that the team meets or exceeds all requirements for
project outcomes.

This pivot study also explores a new research method to investigate qualitative data. Hopefully, this work 
inspires lots of other novel research in this field. 
7. Conclusion 
We proposed a model capable of processing the peer-to-peer comments about rater’s teammates’ teamwork 
behaviors by converting comments into numerical space that allow for computation. The performance of the system 
is satisfying based on the dataset size that we have, which reaches 61.5% accuracy.

Abstract 
The aim of the research is to investigate factors that optimize Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of 
an underground Bord and Pillar coal mine that has limited coal reserves and unfavorable geological 
conditions. The mine consists 10 CM sections, mining both high and low seams with equipment-suits that 
comprises the Continuous Miner (CM), Shuttle Cars, Feeder Breaker, Conveyor Belts and Roof Bolter. 
Three elements making up the OEE equation (Availability, Performance Rate, Quality), are reviewed to 
establish factors that influence OEE improvement. The research paper employs deductive, quantitative 
research methods, analyzing 18 months performance data. The main source of data is the mine’s Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) system. Average OEE figures are 45%. Quality and productivity rate figures are 
85% and 103%. Availability figures average 52% and presents opportunity for OEE improvement. 
Geological conditions inherently contain mining inefficiencies leading to losses of direct operating hours 
(DOH), which affects the availability component of OEE. OEE improvement results are obtained through 
analysis of CM sections that have shown a positive shift in OEE performance. The results demonstrate that 
DOH improvement leads to optimized equipment uptime, thereby increasing availability. DOH 
improvement is achieved through effective operational downtimes management and good equipment 
maintenance management practices.

1. Introduction
The current outlook in the mining sector has been challenging with the evident drop in commodity prices leading to 
downscaling and a lack of capital investment in Greenfields and Brownfields mining projects. The situation has forced 
mining companies to review current maintenance and productivity related practices to maximize the Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) of existing assets. A review of current industry’s best practices on OEE improvements, 
underground Bord and Pillar coal mining layout and equipment-suit deployment is key in addressing productivity 
challenges and constrains on a Bord and Pillar coal mining operation. The research case is for an underground coal 
mine that consists of two shaft complexes that comprises 10 continuous mining sections which employ the 
conventional Bord and Pillar extraction method to produce thermal coal. The current mining challenge is the decline 
in CM productivity which comes as a result of reduced underground mining coal seam height and poor geological 
conditions. These constraints lead to lower productivity and higher mining cost per ton. The one method used for 
realizing productivity objectives in a Bord and Pillar coal mining operation is through measurement and optimization 
of OEE (Hedman et al. 2016) 
The mine has 10 CM sections that consist of 2 Seam and 4 Seam mining operations which has varying seam height, 
different seam thickness and parting/ Dyke intersections with inherently difficult geological conditions. The research 
paper investigates answers to the following questions: 
•
At a Bord and Pillar multi-seam operation, what is the optimal equipment-suit deployment required to ensure
maximum productivity?

Figure 8: 10 CM sections OEE – DOH analysis 
 
The DOH across all 10 CM sections is affected primarily by production stoppages, production delays and 
consequential delays. A reduction of these will increase DOH and improve both UEA and EqA, which leads in an 
increase of the overall OEE. The changing of picks and sleeves is excessive when cutting in areas of poor roof and 
floor conditions and results in excessive production downtime. Unplanned engineering stoppages have a negative 
effect of productivity. Engineering downtime analysis shows hydraulic hose leaks, mechanical component failures 
and electrical trips as major contributors. To reduce this:  
 
• 
A root cause analysis must be conducted on major and repeat component failures  
• 
A strict condition monitoring programme must be complied with 
• 
A strict backlog management programme must be put in place and adhered to. Defects from inspections must be 
prioritized, resourced and planned for execution  
• 
Equipment must be maintained as per the established onsite maintenance strategy.  
 
Cable damages are affected by non-adherence to cable processes, cable standards not being followed (routing, 
suspension), excessive water in sections, substandard cable joints and a poor testing and inspection regime. The 
excessive roof and side wall support is compounded by failure to follow correct cutting sequence, thereby introducing 
CM waiting time as cutting behind the Roof Bolter introduces health and safety risks. Section and trunk conveyor belt 
downtimes are a result of excessive number of repair joints, drive and tail end spillages and non-adherence to 
inspections and proper preventive maintenance actions. Excessive section moves are a result of unfavourable mining 
conditions where panels are abandoned due to safety concerns as a result of poor geological conditions.  
 
Conclusion 
In the present study, the equipment-suit deployment is reviewed utilizing technical specifications and name plate 
capacities of each pieces of equipment. The results demonstrate that the equipment deployment is suitable for current 
seam applications, the higher seam (2 Seam) section does consist of unsuitable equipment-suit. Redeploying these 
pieces of equipment to lower seam applications (4 Seam), leads to optimized equipment-suit use for maximum 
productivity. The three elements making up the OEE equation (Availability, Performance Rate and Quality), are all 
reviewed to establish factors that influence the OEE value in this Bord and Pillar mining operation. Availability is a 
variable that significantly affects overall improvement in OEE. The main contributors being unplanned engineering 
and operational downtimes and consequential delays such as poor geological conditions. The OEE improvement 
results demonstrate that an improvement in DOH, leads to optimized equipment uptime, thereby increasing

Availability. The current Bord and Pillar mining operation study focuses on improving performance of individual 
pieces of equipment’s that function as a single manufacturing line, thereby identifying reasons for overall poor line 
performance. There is opportunity for future bord and pillar OEE research to focus on integrating technological 
methods to provide practical solutions that address inherent mining inefficiencies such as geological challenges and 
conventional maintenance management systems. The future research work in 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) for 
manufacturing can be replicated in applications of Bord and Pillar mining operations.

Abstract 
The increasing demand for productivity, quality and availability is driving the need for the effective 
management of physical assets. The depletion of traditional cost cutting, the disadvantages associated with 
rapid growth and the management of change has caused companies to explore more effective and efficient 
options. Not only do organisations have to meet customer needs and improve the availability and 
performance of equipment, organisations also need to do so while also reducing operational costs. These 
factors have led to the increasing concentration on reliability within the business sector, specifically 
strategic maintenance management. Digital maintenance management systems are software-based systems 
used for managing and controlling plant and equipment maintenance in modern manufacturing and service 
industries. Many companies make use of such systems to ensure the effective management of physical 
assets, which plays an enormously important role in maintaining a proﬁtable business. Historically, 
selecting a digital maintenance management system was simple and required minimal research, however, 
as markets become saturated with various types of maintenance software and technologies become more 
advanced, selecting digital maintenance management systems is becoming more complex. The main 
objective of this research is to develop of a framework for evaluating and selecting digital maintenance 
management systems. The research approach for this study applies a combination of various methods. 
Results analysis focuses on the current status of the maintenance management system, business needs and 
priorities. The results indicate that the toolset developed is effective in evaluating and selecting digital 
maintenance management systems that are of best practice and cater to the specific needs of the business.

1. Background/Introduction
Maintenance is one of the most important functions of a business and forms an integral part of productivity 
improvement. Maintenance is the combination of all technical and associated administrative actions used to retain or 
restore an item to a state in which it can perform its required function (Muyengwa, 2015). Digital maintenance 
management systems are software-based systems used for managing maintenance tasks. A digital maintenance 
management system is an integral component of any efficient maintenance department (Ouellette, 2015). Digital 
maintenance management systems assist in reducing maintenance costs and minimizes emergency repairs and 
downtime. 
1.1 Strategic asset management 
In order to achieve an organisation’s objectives, structured planning and execution is required. Strategic management 
involves planning and formulating an organisations objectives, analysing internal and global environments, 
implementing the set strategy, assessing the success of the strategy and adjusting the plan if need be (Wagner, 2010). 
Maintenance accounts for a significant fraction of operational costs, the effective management of maintenance 
management therefore requires maintenance to be viewed strategically from a business point of view (Murthy et al, 
2002). Global competition has also led to maintenance being viewed in a strategic dimension (Turki, 2012). Production 
companies are now shifting focus from volume production to quick response, defect prevention and waste elimination 
associated with physical assets, such as equipment. These changes affect maintenance strategies. The advancement in 
250","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

It is apparent from Figure 4 that the business considers maintenance management (cost and budget reports and 
compliances (safety)) as the most important function. The second most important function is maintenance execution 
which consists of the asset register, lockout procedures, work order costing, work order grouping, labour scheduling 
and the use of real time data. Maintenance planning, maintenance optimisation, software quality and vendor criterion 
all have overall scores ranging from 84% to 89%. Maintenance strategy has the lowest overall score at only 5%. From 
the engagement tool, insufficient data is available on the maintenance strategy. However, literature suggests that 
maintenance strategies are of the outmost importance and form the backbone of the entire asset management plan as 
they contribute significantly to the overall efficiency of an organisation.  The low score is as a result of insufficient 
data and does not indicate low priority.   
 
From the results it is apparent that maintenance planning forms an important part of the overall maintenance 
management business process. It is also apparent that the current system does not apply multiresource scheduling and 
has a basic software system for real time data from trackers, alarms and sensors, although this is sufficient, in future, 
advances in technology will require a fully integrated system. The system also has a basic software system for 
generating KPIs for equipment. KPIs form an important part of preventative and predict maintenance, the application 
of KPIs ensures the monitoring of equipment and the reduction of downtime. The results also suggest that the demand 
for resources is not directly linked using a criterion. Having a criterion in place ensures that items are kept in stock in 
order of priority, again reduces downtime and the overall availability of equipment.  
 
For the questions relating to maintenance execution a majority of the representatives in lower management levels 
suggest that the systems put in place are not effective. The move towards the use of trackers, alarms and sensors for 
real time data analysis and trends appears to be a slow one. Best practice software solutions make use of such devices 
when monitoring equipment and for reliable electronic audit trails.  
 
Conclusion 
The outcome of this research answers the following research questions; what is the international best practice in terms 
of maintenance management systems and what methods are used to evaluate and/or select maintenance management 
systems. For this study, data is extracted by means of a literature survey. In the literature survey, various methods for 
evaluating and/or select maintenance management systems are discussed and the standardized approach, which is the 
most common and simplest approach, mixed with other methods is used. This then answers the research question, 
what methods are used to evaluate and/or select maintenance management systems. The data gathered on best practice 
maintenance management systems, which answers the research question, what is the international best practice in 
terms of maintenance management systems, is used is develop an engagement toolset. This toolset/framework is then 
tested on a set of employees to establish its effectiveness in extracting data required for optimal selection or evaluation.  
 
The results from the test indicates that a fully integrated system does exist for the majority of functionalities relative 
to best practice. There are some aspects however, that are not integrated and still function independently. This specific 
business should pay close attention to maintenance strategies, linking resource demand to criterions, effectiveness of 
the tools used for scheduling work orders, remote monitoring as well as KPI generation. From the result it is also 
apparent that the toolset developed is effective in evaluating and selecting digital maintenance management systems 
that are of best practice and cater to the specific needs of the business. This in evident in the amount relevant and 
useful data that was extracted from the test. Having such a system in place has the potential to contribute significantly 
to business proﬁtability. A toolset such as this, aids in ensuring that the maintenance management system put in place, 
meets all the unique needs of the business and ensures the efficient management of physical assets thus reducing 
operational costs and improving the availability and performance of physical assets. This enables the business to 
secure a vantage point over competitors and puts the business in a better position to manage challenges associated 
with the increasing demand on productivity, quality, availability, advances in technology and competition.

Abstract 
The success of manufacturing organizations at large is assessed through the ability to perform day to day 
business employing efficient methods and techniques of working. Lean manufacturing comprises of several 
essential principles for executing production in an organization. Several organizations have explored the 
need to implement lean principles in pursuit of improving productivity thus achieving a competitive 
advantage in the volatile global business space. This paper investigates the factors which affect the 
sustainability of lean manufacturing principles in a production system. To obtain an insight on the factors 
affecting the sustainability of lean manufacturing, a literature study on lean holistically and the principle is 
explored. The purpose of the literature is to learn proposals made in literature in relation to sustaining the 
practice of lean principles. The remediation suggested in literature is used to explore possible best practices 
that can be embedded in the daily business of an organization to promote lean principles sustainability. The 
literature in this study brings into attention significant themes essential to arrive to significant outcomes. 
The themes of study range from organizational leadership and culture followed by the organization to 
promote the best application of the principles. To gather research data, observations are used as the main 
data collection method. A checklist is used to provide a structure on the observations under the different 
themes. Without overlooking the other themes of the research, the research reports that of all the observed 
themes with different observable items the main themes which need attention are shop-floor meetings, 
training and problem solving. The analysis of the entire research reveals that if the manner with which 
training is conducted improves could alleviate many other problems as training proves to be the main 
contributor towards other factors.

1. Contextual Background
Lean is a set of tools and techniques employed and sustained by various companies with the aim of achieving increased 
production and the entire customer value chain without overlooking elimination of waste (Mwacharo, 2013). 
Organizations are often faced with the challenge of operating in a dynamic and competitive environment. It is for this 
reason why organizations have to seek improved approaches to enhance efficiency and remain relevant in the 
competitive space. Lean manufacturing is suggested to be a useful tool for improving efficiency in an organization 
(Mapfaira, et al., 2016). It aims at simplifying and organizing the workplace therefore, promoting elimination and 
reduction of waste from the processes throughout the organization (Mapfaira, et al., 2016). An efficient production 
system is usually characterised by flexible delivery times, standardised methods of carrying out duties, defect free 
processes, robust processes with less waste to mention a few aspects. What appears to be a positive approach towards 
realising this goal is through the practise of lean principles and techniques (Blažić, et al., 2017). A significant amount 
of literature mostly focuses research on the benefits of implementing lean manufacturing principles in an organisation 
however, researchers have acknowledge the amount of effort needed towards the implementation of a successful lean 
manufacturing program and reveal that limited research has been devoted towards difficulties experienced to sustain 
lean manufacturing once implemented in a production system. The sustainability of lean is a subject worth looking 
into with regards to the manner of maintaining the energy and interest of the established pilots, execution of 
improvement ideas and unleashing the ability of teams in the organisation to implement lean (Jørgensen, et al., 2007).

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to outline areas of improvement to optimize maintenance strategy of Load Haul 
Dumpers (LHD) fleet by determining factors influencing reliability and maintenance cost of LHD fleet used 
at the underground hard rock mine in South Africa. The stage of product lifetime distribution in which LHD 
fleet fall under is being analyzed. The study collects operational data comprising of maintenance and 
financial values. Pareto analysis is performed in order to determine the top twenty subsystems contributing 
eighty percent of factors affecting LHD fleet reliability. Weibull analysis is also performed to determine 
the stage of product lifetime distribution in which LHD fleet fall under. The results from the Pareto analysis 
indicates that fittings and hoses, electrical systems, air conditioning system, engine, brakes and transmission 
formed part of the top twenty percent which accounted for eighty percent of LHD fleet failures. Pareto 
analysis also outlined the top twenty percent of subsystems which accounted for eighty percent of total 
maintenance spend. Tyres also forms part of the top twenty percent which accounted for eighty percent of 
both total maintenance spend and LHD fleet failures. The LHD fleet is in the middle of the wear-out stage 
as determined using the Weibull distribution. The method of Pareto chart for determining subsystems which 
accounted for eighty percent LHD fleet failures and maintenance spend uses real case study data. The 
Weibull distribution also used real case data. The research study used a twelve month period for both 
maintenance and cost data.

1. Introduction
The underground hard rock mine is in the process of expanding its underground operation with the intension of 
increasing the life of Mine (LOM) with other 10 years of operation, thus creating jobs and sustainable income for its 
current employees and shareholders. A fully mechanized Mine aims to achieve this expansion with aid of developing 
a block cave underground section, this requires the utilization of  Drill Rigs, Load Haul Dumpers (LHD), Articulated 
Dump Trucks (ADT) and Utility Vehicles (UV)  for drilling, loading, hauling and material transportation respectively. 
After the development of a block cave underground mining section, drill rigs will not be employed or utilized as the 
block of ore caves due to gravitational force rather than by means of drill and blast techniques. The fleet of LHD 
remains the main fleet type which would be required for production purposes, hence the focus of this research study 
is on optimizing maintenance strategy for LHD which are currently in use at the said mine. LHD are utilized for 
loading of ore for intermediate mechanization in underground mining (Samanta et al. 2004). LHD are dominant 
machines in Intermediate technology and plays an important role in overall mine production. It is essential that LHD 
machines be reliable and maintained effectively (Samanta et al. 2004) and (Dindarloo, 2016). The Mine witnessed 
low LHD fleet availability in 2016, 2017 and the first two months of 2018. The trend of low machine availability 
resulted in loss of production time in the development phase. Maintenance cost for seven LHD fleet size is consistently 
high for the same period, particularly in 2017 and 2018. According to (Hussan et al. 2014) and (Vayenas and Peng, 
2014), maintenance cost for underground mobile machines accounts for 30 to 65 percent of the Mine’s total operation 
costs.

Figure 6. Weibull analysis 
 
The Weibull distribution is commonly used as a lifetime distribution in reliability engineering. Figure 4 shows two 
parameters (shape and scale). The Weibull distribution represents a decreasing, constant or increasing failure rate 
(Razali et al. 2009). Figure 6 indicates the shape (β) parameter of 6,37529, the positive correlation of time between 
failures is confirmed  statistically with a P-Value of 0,665 (https://support.minitab.com). According to (Hussan et al. 
2014), (Freeman, 1996) and (Zulkafli and Dan, 2016), the LHD fleet concerned is in the middle stage of wear out 
phase, most failures are due to subsystem reaching predicted life span. The expansion project maintenance team must 
consider a complete overhaul or refurbishment and replacement of wear out components (top twenty subsystems 
discussed subsection C and D of this section) as the ideal solution to minimize or prevent further age type of failures 
(Zulkafli and Dan, 2016), (https://www.automation.com) and (Freeman, 1996).  
 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
The research study uses a statistical approach and quantitative method for the collection of data to answer the research 
questions. Operational data comprised of maintenance and financial values for LHD fleet operating at the underground 
hard rock mine. The outcome of this study suggests that LHD fleet in question is operating with components or 
subsystems which are in the middle of the wear out stage in the bathtub curve (research question 1). It is evident that 
the expansion project maintenance team does not employ condition monitoring techniques to detect possible failures 
in order to apply preventive maintenance techniques. There is a correlation between four of the top twenty percentile 
subsystems which accounted for eighty percent of LHD fleet failures and associated cost thereof. The maintenance 
team must concentrate the effort in attempting to improve reliability and optimization of maintenance strategy as per 
the following priorities (http://www.au.af.mil/au): 
 
• Priority one – Common top twenty percent subsystems as determined in Figure 4 and 5, such subsystems comprise 
of fittings and hoses, electrical subsystem, engine and transmission. 
• Priority two – the remainder of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 4 (Pareto analysis of subsystems 
failures), but do not form part of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 5 (Pareto analysis for system 
maintenance spend), such subsystems comprise of air conditioning and brakes. 
• Priority three – the remainder of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 5, but do not form part of top 
twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 4, such subsystems comprise of OEM special maintenance cost and 
the boom.

Abstract 
Emerging research discusses the convergence of the physical worlds and digital transformations. Security 
trepidations related to the electoral system is a major challenge in developing countries. This research seeks 
to limit these security trepidations aligning with the recent digital revolutions. This research focuses on the 
implications of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) relative to the electoral process in an African context. 
The impacts of the 4IR relative to automation, data analytics, innovation, Internet of Things (IoT), security, 
connectivity, and data exchange are enormous. With security trepidations experienced in any electoral 
process specifically in the African context. Aligning with the 4IR becomes an essential and priority to be 
integrated from concept, rollout and beyond during an election phase. This aims at limiting hacks, 
cybersecurity, breaches, and stolen identities. Nigeria as a subset in the Africa context is explored to 
investigate the implications of the 4IR related to the electoral process. The biometric technology and system 
workflow are specifically investigated resulting in a document, which becomes a significant tool for 
developing countries relative to electoral assessment and implementations.

1. Introduction
The 4IR is upon us with a fundamental shift from traditional transformations, where automation, manufacturing 
technologies, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and data exchange aims at simplifying the physical worlds 
(Chen, et al., 2018). The 4IR refers to a smart technology or system describing the current trend for automation and 
data exchange (Roblek, et al., 2016 and RuBmann, 2015). The 4IR is characterised with the emergence of digital 
transformations in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), IOT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Services (IOS), 
robotics and Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) technologies (Dolgui, et al., 2018). The 
4IR has significant impacts globally inclusive of economic, academic, business and electoral sectors. This research 
seeks to explore the implications of the 4IR related to the electoral system with a specific focus on Nigeria as a subset 
African country. Electoral systems are described as a set of procedures, which regulates how referendums and 
elections are conducted and how the results are established aligning with democratic principles. Emerging literature, 
roundtables and white paper publications establish challenges in Africa democratic process relative to electoral 
trepidations faced with significant security and authentication concerns (Baguma & Eilu, 2015 and Shah, 2015). There 
is a necessity to develop a smart structure to enhance the electoral system. The government, public and private 
practitioners ought to promote for a convergence of the 4IR towards enhancing the electoral system, aiming at 
positively influencing the security authentication process. This research seeks to highlight the practical and theoretical 
implications on the adoption of the 4IR specifically biometric technology related to the electoral system. The 
influences of the 4IR to mitigate the gaps of the biometric technology authentication expertise is discussed. This 
research is initiated with a discussion on 4IR implementations specifically the biometric technology. The first section 
identifies, defines and explores the existing relationship between the biometric system workflow. Secondly, this 
research highlights literature making a comparison between the advanced and developing continents with respect to 
the electoral process currently practiced. The challenges encountered with each electoral process is reviewed based 
on 4IR implementations. This research concludes by proposing future research directions, applications and suggesting 
recommendations relative to the research objectives.

Conclusion 
There is essential for facilitating the evolution of the electoral process in developing countries towards 4IR 
implementations. An electoral structure developed on the basis of 4IR implementations enables electorate view the 
electoral process as a process and not an event. This limits manipulation, fraud, security anxieties, and violence. 
Exploring best practices relative to the measures electoral process dynamics is evaluated is critical in enhancing 
electoral reforms, democratic principles and realizing a genuine representation. This research focused on exploring 
the implications of the electoral system in Nigeria as a subset of the African context based on fourth industrial 
revolutions. 4IR implementations are the big unexploited current technological trends relative to the electoral 
structure. This research document is a significant tool for developing countries relative to electoral assessment and 
implementations. Electoral stakeholders must rethink and redevelop strategies to align the electoral process with the 
4IR implementations. This research output seeks to mitigate the skepticism and mistrust experienced by electorates 
relative to the electoral process effectively representing democratic and civic interests.

Abstract 
The present global competition is forcing companies to expand and connect their “internal improvement 
processes” with “external customers and suppliers”. Ensuring success in the face of fierce competition requires 
careful adoption of Supply Chain (SC) strategies alongside innovative capabilities such as Industry 4.0 
technologies to enable such SC strategies. To improve organization’s competitiveness and performance, modern 
day businesses are exploring the integration of SC strategies. Lean and Agile are two critical strategies because 
the former ensures efficient use of resources while the latter involves matching supply with demand in 
turbulent/unpredictable markets. Several studies have considered integration of different strategies/paradigms 
and their associated impact on SC; however, few have considered how Industry 4.0 technologies could enable 
these SC strategies for improved performance. This study presents a conceptual model that matches various 
principles/practices of Lean and Agile SC with industry 4.0 technologies (as drivers) for overall performance 
improvement. The conceptual model provides a decision supporting tool for practitioners at identifying potential 
industry 4.0 technologies in the context of lean-agile by way of motivating them on specific pillars of industry 
4.0 to adopt for specific lean-agile strategies in achieving overall organizational goals. Other managerial and 
theoretical implications of the work are highlighted.

Introduction 
The continuous competition in the global space is forcing companies to expand and connect their “internal 
improvement processes” with “external customers and suppliers”. Indeed, the competition is progressively 
tilting away from the focal company and towards the supply chain (SC) level. This is attributed to diverse and 
erratic customer behaviour among others as the world becomes a global village. In order to remain competitive, 
organizations are compelled to develop innovative ways to strengthen their image and maintain relevancy. A 
conglomerate of companies collaborating together is simply an SC. It is regarded as a system whose constituent 
parts include material suppliers, producer/manufacture, distributors and customers who are usually connected by 
2 way flow with the forward being material flow while the feedback is the information flow (Naylor et al., 1999; 
Soltan and Mostafa, 2015). The ultimate goal is to provide value in form of products or services to the 
customers. The management of such flows, i.e. material, information and even the tenable cash among the 
parties constituting the SC is referred to Supply Chain Management (SCM). A tilt from exclusive focus on the 
effectiveness and efficiency of separate business units to adopting strategic planning and designing SC as a 
whole has become a common practice among companies in the present global market. Survival of such SC will 
ultimately be hinged on careful adoption of strategies and business models in tandem with overall organizational 
goals.  
Several SC strategies have been reported in literature among which are Lean, Agile, Resilient and more recently 
added due to the need to incorporate sustainability measures into SC operations is the Green SC strategy. Lean 
and Agile are critical strategies because of their abilities to maximize the efficiency by eliminating non-value 
adding elements, stock control & centralized management as well as optimizing distribution and production 
activities (in case of lean strategy). Agile strategy on the other hand proffers advantage by its capacity of 
response and flexibility to variable market needs plus risk hedging means. They have been proven to be 
“pertinent strategies” towards achieving “efficiency and responsiveness”.  The present hostile economic

Abstract 
Manufacturing industries across the globe continuously seek for best practices and technologies in ensuring 
sustainability, competitiveness and improving business performance. Self-Monitoring Analysis and 
Reporting Technology (SMART) is a strategic best practice approach with capabilities to integrate, 
automate and operate business functions independently. A SMART manufacturing enterprise is ensued 
intended to add value in the manufacture and execution of corporate functions. The SMART context aligns 
with standards of the fourth industrial revolutions (4IR). Effective SMART implementations in 
manufacturing sectors are essential for ensuring optimal corporate inputs and outputs. This research focuses 
on SMART 4IR implementations in manufacturing industries. Manufacturing industries in Nigeria a 
western Africa country is specifically selected to investigate the influence of identified SMART 4IR 
implementations. Best practice questions relative to 4IR implementations obtainable from literature are 
defined, empirically tested, which aims at proposing solutions and recommendations relative to enhancing 
manufacturing efficiency. The document serves as a tool for manufacturing industries relative to improving 
business performance.  
Keywords 
The fourth industrial revolutions, Manufacturing industries, SMART implementations. 
1. Introduction
Manufacturing industries are continuously developing and implementing sustainable practices aimed at ensuring 
optimal productivity. The SMART context is a corporate terminology aligned with the evolving 4IR implementations 
(Chen, et al., 2018). 4IR is the current trend for data exchange and automation (Dolgui, et al., 2018). 4IR 
implementations result in a SMART manufacturing enterprise (Kang, et al., 2016). The implications of effectively 
aligning manufacturing industries with the 4IR implementations related to ensuring business sustainability cannot be 
overstated. The 4IR implementations support the full digitization and automation of manufacturing processes. The 
4IR implementations promote sustainability, competitiveness, and improvements in business performance and value. 
A search in literature details “Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)”, “SMART factory”, “Internet of Things (IoT)”, and 
“Internet of Services (IOS)” as four fundamental components of the 4IR implementations (Roblek, et al., 2016). 
Emerging literature establishes the importance of developing a SMART enterprise with significant impact on business 
productivity, effectiveness, performance and sustainability (Wang, et al., 2016). A SMART structure provides value 
added for capturing, evaluating high-value data and integrating business functions. Several SMART enablers premise 
on the 4IR implementations enhances and contribute significantly to the execution of business functions. This research 
discusses the SMART context based on 4IR implementations with significant impacts on corporate productivity, 
efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainability. Best practice questions relative to 4IR implementations obtainable 
from literature are defined and empirically tested aimed at addressing the research objectives. The empirical testing 
results in an evaluation structure for effective adoption of the 4IR implementations in manufacturing industries 
specifically Nigeria a western Africa developing country.  
This research commenced with identifying, selecting and defining important SMART 4IR enablers and strategies 
premised on literature (Chen, et al., 2018; Kang, et al., 2016; Roblek, et al., 2016; Wang, et al., 2016). This research 
assesses existing relationships obtainable between the important SMART 4IR enablers and strategies defined relative

respondents are interested in 4IR implementations despite the process not yet integrated into the manufacturing 
facilities. The survey establishes effective 4IR implementation tools such as stay-interviews, job crafting, awareness 
educations, and pulse surveys remain unclear. 
 
Conclusion 
This research evaluates the existing state of 4IR implementations in manufacturing industries related to an African 
context specific focus directed to Nigeria as a subset African country. Questionnaires and structured interview are 
employed as the principal methodology for collecting and analysing data. The data analysis is executed deploying 
SPSS tool. The results obtained validate the objectives defined in this research, which seeks to present an evaluation 
structure for effective adoption of the 4IR implementations. The outputs indicate many manufacturing sites still require 
education or training on the description, implications, and importance of 4IR implementations. The sensitizations 
include awareness of the tools to measure and drive 4IR implementations. Greater innovative and awareness drives 
related to 4IR implementations, tools combined with an effective structure facilitating business innovations and 
advancements are recommended to address gaps, priorities, and strengths essential for 4IR implementation 
improvements. Based on existing literature, this is inclusive but not limited to the effective application of 
digitalization, automation and integration strategies. This enhances sustainability, productivity, and competitiveness 
of manufacturing industries, also supporting a holistic structure for aligning business objectives with multiple 
stakeholders. 
 
Emerging literature establishes the importance of constantly enhancing business functions in manufacturing facilities 
(Fosso Wamba & Mishra, 2017 and Arsanjani, et al., 2012). This research presents an evaluation tool via decision-
support structure promoting the importance of integrating 4IR implementations with business functions in 
manufacturing facilities. The results aim at assisting manufacturing facilities to compare the existing state of its 
business relative to 4IR implementations. Conclusively, the comprehensive results establish inadequacies in 
developing and implementing 4IR strategies and the need to urgently define measures to address this limitation. Future 
studies might focus on extensively exploring the influence of 4IR implementations based on manufacturing industries 
with a fully integrated 4IR benchmarks.

Abstract 
Big data analytics plays a key role in this era of fourth industrial revolution. However, the impact of 
big data analytics capabilities on innovative product development and employee development and 
finally on innovation and learning performance have not been thoroughly examined. To address the 
gap in existing literature, here research team draws on Dynamic capability view theory to 
conceptualise a theoretical framework. The unique contribution of this study is the theoretical 
framework and seven research propositions. Future research plan is to test the theoretical framework 
and suggest insights for supply chain managers. 
Keywords  
Big data analytics, Dynamic capability view theory, Innovation, Learning 
1. Introduction
Today’s supply chains are exposed to dynamic business environments with higher level of uncertainties (Bag, 
2017; Bag et al., 2018a). Every mining company is focusing on development of dynamic capabilities to mitigate 
risks and build competitive advantage. Mining companies are developing dynamic capabilities at two levels. 
Firstly, at the business process level and secondly, are the set of organization resources (Braganza et al., 2017). 
Business processes management aims to optimize structure, functions and organizational elements 
(Samaranayake, 2009). Every mining company can potentially optimize sales order process cycle, procurement 
process cycle, manufacturing execution cycle and logistics process cycle. Business process optimization can 
save significant amount of money and reduce the lead times resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction levels. 
Business process optimization also plays an instrumental role in conserving scarce natural resources (Kelle and 
Akbulut, 2005). Big data and analytics (BDA) tools can be exploited to reap significant business benefits 
(Gunasekaran et al., 2017). Big data is characterised by 5 Vs’ (volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value). 
The unstructured data generated from social media, mobile devices, machines and sensors can provide valuable 
information for business insights (Wamba et al., 2017). BDA can be used for enabling plant automation in this 
age of fourth industrial revolution (Telukdarie et al., 2018). Existing literature shows lot of progress in the field 
of BDA. However, it fails to explain how BDA capabilities can influence the innovation and learning 
performance and finally impact sustainable supply chain performance. To extend the knowledge base, this study 
aims to answer two key research questions as follows: 
RQ1: What are the impact BDA capabilities on sustainable supply chain performance? 
RQ2: Can a model be developed for examining the moderating role of supply chain innovativeness? 
2. Conceptual framework
Dynamic capability view theory has been used as a theoretical lens to study the proposed relationships.

development improves level of knowledge and increases the incident of new green product development 
successes (Imran et al., 2018). Therefore, research team hypothesize: 
H4: Employee development is positively related to innovation and learning performance 
 
Supply chain innovativeness has the ability to strengthen/weaken the relationship between innovative green 
product development and innovation and learning performance. 
Therefore, research team hypothesize: 
H5: Firms with more (less) supply chain innovativeness have a greater (lower) level of innovative green product 
development for a given level of innovation and learning performance  
 
Supply chain innovativeness has the ability to strengthen/weaken the relationship between employee 
development and innovation and learning performance. 
Therefore, research team hypothesize: 
H6: Firms with more (less) supply chain innovativeness have a greater (lower) level of employee development 
for a given level of innovation and learning performance 
 
 
4. Findings 
 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The study conceptualises a theoretical model using DCV theory where the constructs considered are BDA 
management capability, BDA talent capability, innovative green product development, employee development, 
innovation and learning performance and sustainable supply chain performance. 
The following paths are tested using structural equation modelling tools:- 
Path 1: BDA management capability on innovative green product development: Supported 
Path 2: BDA talent capability on employee development: Supported 
Path 3: Innovative green product development on innovation and learning performance: Supported 
Path 4: Employee development on innovation and learning performance: Supported 
Path 5: Moderating role of supply chain innovativeness on the relation between innovative green product 
development and innovation and learning performance: Supported 
Path 6: Moderating role of supply chain innovativeness on the relation between employee development and 
innovation and learning performance: Supported 
 
The key take away for supply chain managers to improve supply chain sustainability in this digital age are as 
under:- 
• 
Focus on developing BDA management capabilities 
• 
Focus on developing BDA talent capabilities

Abstract 
Big data and Predictive analytics (BDPA) research in humanitarian supply chain operations has gained 
popularity for its ability to manage disaster risks. BDPA approach not only aims to predict future events, 
but also concentrates on current events and further prepare for the future events. However, review of prior 
studies shows this area is highly diverse and fragmented. Further, BDPA driven approach in HSC operations 
is complicated due to presence of multiple barriers, whose interrelationships are yet to be documented for 
purpose of enhancing existing knowledge base. The gaps in existing literature motivated to pursue the 
current study and aim to identify the leading barriers and further categorize them and finally develop the 
contextual interrelationships using popular Fuzzy Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) approach. 
Fuzzy TISM is a well expressed mental model interpreting both the nodes (indicating ‘what’) and links 
(indicating ‘how’ and ‘why’) which serves as the basis for theory building process. The TISM model shows 
that the fifteen barriers have achieved eight levels and decision makers must aim to remove the bottom level 
barriers for achieving sustainability in humanitarian supply chain operations.

1. Introduction
Disasters cause losses of human life, destruction of homes, infrastructure and disruption of normal life (O'Brien et al., 
2006). The various strategies in risk management may include reducing exposure to disasters; increase resilience to 
changing climatic risks; transformation; reducing vulnerabilities; prepare, respond and recover; and transfer and share 
risks. Interestingly, BDPA in humanitarian supply chain (HSC) operations has proven to be a useful tool for reducing 
vulnerabilities in disaster situations (Akter & Wamba, 2017). However, review of prior literature shows this area is 
diverse and fragmented and BDPA application in the field of HSC operations is under a nascent stage which requires 
more research focus from future researchers. BDPA can create visibility to actors involved in HSC operations through 
access to real time information critical for reducing disaster risks. BDPA can be useful for preventing disasters by 
detecting disasters in advance and the information can be used for shifting the people in the community to safer zones 
and plan relief aids and logistics in a better fashion (Wang et al. 2016). In a pre or post disaster situation voluminous 
data is generated from multiple sources such as from web, social networks platforms, multimedia data and GPS data 
which is difficult to be managed mainly due to lack of updated technology platform for storage, processing and lack 
of adequate skilled manpower for correct interpretation. Big data is further complicated due to diverse in nature 
involving multiple sources and multiple formats which requires integration and analysis before the decision making 
can be done. So, the decision making of disaster management officials and HSC agencies depends on the timing and 
quality of information (Bag, 2016). Therefore, success of BDPA application in sustainable HSC operations solely 
depends on the right process of data collection, storage, structuring, processing and analyzing for producing accurate 
and timely information in managing disasters effectively (Zhang et al., 2012; Hazen et al. 2014). However, multiple 
challenges involved in BDPA application basically acts as barriers in sustainable HSC operations. Such barriers have 
been mentioned in few earlier studies but there is lack of research on categorizing and prioritizing the barriers. To 
bridge gap in the existing literature the current study aims to identify the key barriers and further develop the contextual 
interrelationships using advanced multi-criteria decision making technique.

Abstract 
Reliable energy supply is a vital and crucial role of any country and affects its economic and social development. 
Energy subsidies in many countries, while enhancing welfare levels, cause over-consumption of energy, lead to 
supply insecurity and environmental effects. Energy pricing is a key factor in controlling energy demand on one 
side, and incentivizing supply, on the other side. This paper develops a mathematical model for natural gas supply 
and demand system to study how differential pricing of natural gas leads to an optimal allocation of it to various 
demand sectors. The consumer prices of natural gas in each sector affect the sectors’ demand according to its 
elasticity to the price. On the supply side, optimal pricings affects providing financial resources for natural gas 
development and supply. The optimal price path of each sector, which maximizes the net present value of net 
income, maximizes the net present value of underground resources value at the end of planning horizon, and 
minimizes CO2 emission are proposed using a system dynamics model. The model is applied to a case study. The 
optimal price paths determine a different allocation of natural gas to demand sectors compared to the Business As 
Usual case.

1. Introduction
Energy has an important and vital role in the social and economic development of countries. Ensuring a
reliable energy supply and demand system with appropriate growth is the main concern of any country to ensure 
comprehensive development. Studying the effectiveness of policies for a better performance of the national energy 
system is very crucial for every country.  
Natural gas is an important primary energy resource in different countries and among fossil fuels, has the best 
prospects of growth until 2035, especially due to its low carbon intensity (Holz et al., 2013; Exxon Mobil 2017). 
According to the positive prospects about the increase in natural gas consumption in many countries, mathematical 
models dealing with studying, forecasting and optimizing natural gas supply and demand are very useful at national 
and international levels. In this paper, a model for natural gas supply and demand system is developed to study the 
optimal allocation of natural gas resources to demand sectors through pricing policies. Energy prices, their direct 
effect on energy consumption, and their indirect effect on micro and macro-economic variables have been studied in 
several researches. These vary from studying the effects of prices on demand and consumption (Wang and Lin, 
2014; Dagher, 2012) to the indirect effects on consumer price index, GDP growth, etc. (Zhang et al. 2017, Shahbaz 
et al., 2014).  
Some researches specifically investigate the countries’ plans to reform natural gas pricing or to remove 
regulations or subsidies from their domestic natural gas prices. China, as a big energy consumer with plans to 
increase the natural gas share in its primary energy mix, has a price reform strategy to help grow natural gas supply 
(He, Lin 2017). According to this plan, Zhang et al. developed a Computable General Equilibrium model to analyze

Conclusion 
Ensuring a reliable energy supply with minimum cost is one of the main priorities of each country, and a 
prerequisite for economic and social development. Among energy resources, natural gas has the prospects to be one 
of the most growing energy resources of future and to be replaced with more polluted fuels like coal and oil products 
due to its lower pollution. In this paper, we presented a system dynamics model to study supply and demand 
reactions in response to pricing policies for each demand sector. The relationships between price and demand, price 
and supply, and supply and demand are modeled in a dynamic way. Using simulation optimization methods, the 
optimum price paths that guarantee supply security, maximize the net annual income, and minimize CO2 emissions 
are proposed in the model.  
The model is used to forecast the future natural gas supply and demand in the case study of Iran with more 
than 60% share of natural gas in the primary energy supply mix. The model forecasted a gap between supply and 
demand before 2025, if the current pricing policies for domestic sectors continued. It is concluded that the current 
pricing does not provide enough capital for future investments in natural gas development. According to this 
forecast, the optimum price paths are determined using various objective functions. These price paths indirectly 
affect how natural gas should be allocated to various demand sectors optimally. The results for the case study show 
that the highest increase should be for natural gas allocated to export and the lowest growth is related to the natural 
gas allocated to the residential sector.

Abstract 
Gas condensate recovered from the natural gas is a valuable liquid product. It must be processed or treated to a 
commercially acceptable form for its storage or export. The treatment of gas condensate generally involves the 
separation of any dissolved gases such as light hydrocarbon components (i.e., methane and ethane) along with 
decreasing the acid contents (i.e., H2S, mercaptans, etc.), water and salt contents to the desired standards in order to 
make it environmentally safe for storage and transportation purposes. The process of stripping the light end 
components from the heavier hydrocarbons is referred as condensate stabilization which is primarily performed to 
reduce the vapor pressure of condensate liquids to avoid the generation of vapor phase when transferring them to 
atmospheric tanks. Condensate stabilization can be achieved by either flash vaporization or fractionation. However, 
condensate stabilization by fractionation is a popular choice in industry as it has the capability to produce 
condensate liquids of desired vapor pressure in a single tower process. It is a complicated chemical process, thus 
requires significant efforts to develop accurate and reliable models with the objective to minimize the operational 
costs. Lately, the modeling approach that deals with input-output operating data has gained significant attention. 
Machine learning has been emerged as a proven and alternative modeling approach that based on operating data, 
which is readily available. 
This work therefore employs artificial neural network (ANN) in order to build a model that can predict the 
performance of the condensate stabilizer unit. A large dataset of an industrial condensate stabilizer, comprising of 
operating data of input-output variables, is used to evaluate the developed model. To develop the ANN model, inlet 
gas flowrate, inlet gas temperature, column temperature, column pressure, condensate flowrate, condensate 
temperature, reboiler temperature and steam flowrate are implemented as model inputs, whereas RVP, H2S contents 
and water contents are used as network outputs. The dataset is split randomly into two subsets for the purpose of 
training and testing the model. The training subset of data is employed to train the network by developing the 
network weights whereas the testing subset is used to estimate and compare the output of developed model against 
the independent operating data. The main objective of developing this ANN model is to predict the important 
parameters of the final stabilized liquid, which are RVP, H2S contents and water contents. The predictions from the 
developed model are compared with the testing subset of operating data. To evaluate the model performance, mean 
squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) are investigated. The results obtained from this case study 
show that the developed model has the potential to offer reliable and accurate predictions. As future work, an 
integrated framework will be developed where data-driven surrogate models will be integrated into optimization 
framework to find the optimal values of the variables corresponding to the minimal operational costs or energy 
demands. The integrated framework will be able to help the gas industry to simultaneously achieve the process 
efficiency, profitability and safety.

Abstract 
A Data-driven stochastic optimization framework that leverages big data in design and operation of power 
generation units is proposed. A k-means clustering algorithm is adopted to generate uncertainty scenarios for the 
stochastic optimization framework. In order to do this, the power generating design and operation problem is 
formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model. The first stage variables are associated with design 
decisions, whereas the second stage variables are associated with unit commitment operation (i.e. scheduling). The 
historical demand data was first collected and reprocessed. After that, the processed electrical demand (uncertain 
parameter) is processed and recognized using unsupervised machine learning. K-means clustering algorithm is used 
to produce electrical demand scenario profiles. These scenarios are used as inputs to the stochastic model. The 
proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and solved using GAMS. The 
stochastic data driven method enjoys the following features: it is based on information derived from real data 
without explicitly knowing the data distribution and it applies the recent advances of data analysis tools (e.g. 
machine learning) to generate a reduced size data set (i.e. clusters) integrated into mathematical model (i.e. design 
and planning model) that leads to a computationally tractable problem.  
1. Introduction
Deterministic process design and operation models can help ensure an optimal solution for certain process 
parameters (e.g. demand, fuel price) where it satisfies the constraints associated with that parameter (i.e. product 
should be greater than or equal to demand). As most real-life problems involve some sort of uncertainty, 
deterministic models are incapable of resolving them. In reality, most model parameters are uncertain, such as the 
availability of renewable energy and power demand are not known with certainty and are hard to predict. There exist 
a considerable number of studies from industry and academia on optimization under uncertainty (Sahinidis 2004, 
Grossmann et al. 2016, Ierapetritou et al. 1996). However, these approaches do not take advantage of the recent 
advances in machine learning and big data analytics to leverage uncertainty data for optimization under uncertainty. 
Hence, the goal of this paper is to propose a data- driven stochastic decision-making framework that integrates 
machine learning methods to uncertainty data with the design and operation of power generation problem. 
Traditional models of decision-making under uncertainty assume perfect information which means either accurate 
values for the system parameters or specific probability distributions for the random variables. Nevertheless, such 
exact knowledge is rarely available, prior knowledge on uncertain parameter distribution is unknown and fitting 
random variables (uncertain parameter) into a popular distribution is complicated and impractical (Bertsimas and 
Thiele 2006). Furthermore, it is mathematically intractable to deal with erroneous inputs (all sets of uncertain data) 
and this could lead to infeasible solutions or exhibit poor performance when implemented (Bertsimas and Thiele 
2006). Therefore, in this paper we propose a data-driven stochastic approach for power generation design and 
operation optimization that can efficiently utilize the available historical demand data through advances of data 
analytics tools such as k-means clustering (a machine learning tool) By doing this, data-driven power planning is 
achieved against uncertainty realization.

Abstract 
This paper discusses a 4-stage location-allocation disaster relief network. The objective of the proposed network 
design approach is to minimize the travel time from commercial storage centers to distribution centers, and from 
distribution centers to demand centers, closest to the affected area. Various scenarios of disasters occurrence, scenario-
dependency of storage and distribution centers’ capacities, transportation disturbances and lost capacities, and various 
types of transportation modes have also been considered in the form of constraints. The proposed approach has been 
applied to a real case study in northern Tehran and the results have been thoroughly analyzed and discussed.

1. Introduction
Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, tornados, etc.) are hard to predict ahead of time, and they often lead to 
serious injuries and significant property and infrastructure damages. The value of using a relief model in response 
planning to prevent and mitigate the impact of these catastrophic events is undeniable. This paper discusses such a 
model of a humanitarian supply chain based on a real-world example. The purpose of the proposed model is to 
minimize the relief delivery time while satisfying the demands of the affected area population. To reflects reality, the 
model is stochastic, with both disturbance and capacity loss of the relief storage and distribution accounted for. 
2. Literature Review
High effectiveness and timeliness of post-disaster relief is critical to maximize assistance to the victims and survivors 
and minimize mortality and financial losses. A significant body of research on various aspects of humanitarian supply 
chains has been carried out in the past decade. To find the best solution improving chances of survival, various 
approaches such as, for example, mathematical optimization, simulation, system design and decision making have 
been explored in the context for most common disasters, such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes. 
2.1. Mathematical Optimization approach 
Finding an optimal humanitarian supply chain design by using mathematical models is one of the most common 
approaches. For instance, (Das and Hanaoka, 2013) have suggested a single-objective, single-period robust location-
allocation model in which the cost of distributing relief commodities has been minimized.  (Özdamar et al., 2014) 
have proposed a multi-objective, single period deterministic location-routing model in which the cost of debris cleanup 
operations have been minimized. (Bai, 2016) has proposed a single-objective, multi-period fuzzy location model in 
which cost, travel time and unmet demand of relief commodities have been minimized. (Alem et al., 2016) have 
recommended a single-objective, multi-period stochastic location model in which the cost of distributing relief 
commodities has been minimized. (Pramanik et al., 2016) have suggested a multi-objective, multi-period fuzzy 
location model in which both cost and travel time of relief commodities have been minimized. (Rezaei-Malek et al 
2016) have offered a multi-objective, multi period robust location model in which both costs and response time for 
relief commodities and establishing storage sites have been minimized. (Haghi et al. 2017) have proposed a multi-
objective, single-period stochastic location-allocation model in which the cost has been minimized and the coverage 
of distributing relief commodities and curing injured people have been maximized. (Jha et al., 2017) have suggested 
a multi-objective, single-period stochastic location-allocation-routing model in which the cost has been minimized 
and the coverage of distributing relief commodities and transferring victims to shelters have been maximized. (Noham

desirability of the real data’s objective function value is more than the desirability of the mean of random number’s

8. Conclusions and Future Work 
8.1. Conclusion 
In this paper, the humanitarian supply chain design has been represented in the form of a stochastic optimization 
model. The proposed model has been applied to specific data and conditions in the northern regions of Tehran. 
Decision variables of this model include the location of commercial storage centers and distribution centers, and the 
amounts of allocated commodities from commercial storage centers to distribution centers, and from distribution 
centers to demand centers. The effect of various scenarios of occurring disasters, the probability of capacity loss in 
both commercial storage centers and distribution centers and different transportation modes from commercial storage 
centers to distribution centers and from distribution centers to demand centers on the travel time have been analyzed 
in this model. 
8.2. Future Recommendations 
Considering pre-disaster phase, perishability of relief commodities (such as drugs), uncertainty in the delivery time of 
commodity, shortage and the ability to add or remove transportation modes can be considered as the potential future 
research directions.
